7655,study region the study site the mount bruce flats is located in the pilbara a semiarid region of northern western australia study focus semiarid climates are characterised by an extreme water deficit with evaporation exceeding precipitation several fold groundwater recharge is episodical and occurs only after infrequent but very large volume precipitation while all other precipitation events are quickly lost to evaporation we investigated the contribution of an internally drained basin to localised groundwater recharge by combining the results of calculations from various tracer methods we developed a new mobile immobile recharge transport model coupled with a probability model based on markov chain monte carlo simulations that combines several age and hydrochemical tracers to estimate localised infiltration new hydrological insights for the region the actual recharge varied greatly across the basin being 4 5 times higher in the central part compared to the margins the highest probability for recharge was calculated for 2 5 mm y 1 and 12 6 mm y 1 with a median value of 6 8 mm y 1 while the median mobile effective porosity was low at 0 5 the flood plains overlying freshwater aquifers may contribute several times more to localised recharge than the upper parts of the catchments which are characterised by fast runoff and a lower water retention time therefore these endorheic basins could be a valuable source of water for groundwater recharge or constitute an additional hydrological challenge for mining graphical abstract ga1 keywords arid recharge groundwater terminal basin dating pilbara mobile immobile model 1 introduction groundwater recharge is a fundamental component of the water budget and understanding it is crucial for the correct management of groundwater assets healy 2010 groundwater availability is an important management concern not only to secure sufficient water quantity and quality for human consumption agriculture and industry but also for the health of the natural environment groundwater management is a high priority in semiarid and arid environments where recharge is limited and occurs infrequently and where high uncertainty in the amount of renewable water exists due to challenges in recharge estimation scanlon et al 2006 appropriate management may mitigate climate driven water quality changes barbieri et al 2023 different groundwater recharge estimation methods can be used at various temporal and spatial scales point source recharge can be quantified directly by measuring outflow from lysimeters observing water table depth and its fluctuation or using various chemical and physical tracers cook et al 2017 skrzypek et al 2019 wachniew 2015 yin et al 2023 tracers such as radiocarbon 14c tritium 3h and chlorofluorocarbons cfc 12 can be used for water age estimation calculation of proportional contribution from different sources and groundwater recharge quantification cook and dogramaci 2019 wang et al 2020 yin et al 2023 additionally chloride mass balance allison et al 1994 crosbie et al 2018 and stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions skrzypek et al 2019 xu et al 2019 can be used to estimate recharge and evaporative losses prior to recharge dogramaci et al 2012a mccallum et al 2020a mccallum et al 2014 skrzypek et al 2015 however once recharge water mixes with resident groundwater in aquifers the recharge rate calculation becomes challenging especially if the recharge is low as in semiarid climates usually the single tracer method is not able to address these complex situations but could be resolved using a multi tracer approach in combination with numerical modelling and water budget calculations cook and dogramaci 2019 or more novel probability models as proposed in this study recharge rates have been successfully estimated with the help of environmental tracers before mcmahon et al 2011 environmental tracers can be easily interpreted when samples are collected from bores with short screens and when the vertical location of the water sampling point is known and mixing between stratified water of different groundwater ages is minimized cook et al 2017 cook and solomon 1995 however in many instances mixing young shallow and old deep groundwater within aquifers can add significant uncertainty to recharge calculations eberts et al 2012 jurgens et al 2014 mccallum et al 2017 visser et al 2013 additionally in heavily pumped aquifers variations in age mixtures can be observed over short time frames constraining accuracy in recharge calculations however this may provide additional information on aquifer properties and transient mixing ratios furthermore the mixing of groundwater ages induced within aquifers may lead to the observation of both young and old water tracers showing vastly different ages cook et al 2017 jasechko et al 2017 leray et al 2014 vertical and horizontal groundwater flow established from groundwater ages can be used to constrain groundwater recharge through the improvement of water balance calculations models that reproduce multiple tracer observations are necessary to determine recharge rates accurately particularly when dating tracers show vastly different ages dunkle et al 1993 mcmahon et al 2011 pearson and white 1967 recharge rates in semiarid environments are highly variable across the landscape and largely depend on geomorphology and geology mcfarlane 2015 zarate et al 2021 at locations where bedrock is exposed to the surface direct recharge to fractured aquifers is restricted by high surface runoff beetle moorcroft et al 2021 siebers et al 2016 high surface runoff contributes to flash floods and delivers large volumes of water to flood plains rapidly these flood plains frequently overlie shallow alluvial aquifers the spatial extent of which is limited by topography creating endorheic basins skrzypek et al 2019 skrzypek et al 2016 these alluvial aquifers with relatively small storage capacity can potentially act as important interfaces for deeper fractured aquifer recharge the overarching aim of this study is to improve our understanding of the role of alluvial flood plains in groundwater recharge in a semiarid climate this aim was achieved through the conceptualization of groundwater flow the calculation of water budget and estimating recharge rates using a new mobile immobile recharge transport model in conjunction with a markov chain monte carlo approach mixing models and compared to the classical chloride mass balance calculations the study utilised water level observations hydrochemical analyses of major ion tritium radiocarbon and cfc 12 concentrations stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of water and stable carbon isotope composition of dissolved inorganic carbon 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site mt bruce flats mbf is located in the pilbara region of western australia 45 km east of tom price and it is adjacent to an open pit iron ore mine fig 1 the mbf is surrounded on all sides by ridgelines located to the east north and south to the southeast the mbf narrows out between two ridgelines to form a 2 5 km wide corridor known as rail corridor the rail corridor is cut from northeast to southwest by turee creek an ephemeral creek draining a catchment separated from the mbf by a mountain ridge fig 1 the surface outflow from the mbf is restricted by topography and the mbf acts as a small terminal basin 8 km2 for surface water periodically flooded by cyclonic rainfall events skrzypek et al 2019 these unique hydrographic conditions support coolibah woodlands an ecological community of eucalyptus victrix trees the coolibahs form two separate colonies eastern and western stands covering 1 74 km2 of the topographically lowest sections of the mbf at 703 705 m asl the coolibahs roots extend down 10 12 m below the surface not reaching the groundwater level and transpiring water from the unsaturated zone rather than directly accessing groundwater skrzypek et al 2019 2 1 1 climate the mbf has a hot semiarid climate with a high evaporation rate and a tropical rainfall pattern with wet summers and dry winters fig 2 the region experiences infrequent but heavy downpours in thunderstorms and periodic cyclonic events rouillard et al 2015 rouillard et al 2016b the most recent major cyclones cyclone lua and cyclone heidi occurred in 2012 skrzypek et al 2019 rainfall occurs mainly during the wet season between december and march with small amounts occurring during the dry season from april to november fig 2 the average annual rainfall for the period between 1998 and 2018 was 375 mm y 1 temperature data fluctuate seasonally with an average daily maximum temperature of 23 2 c in winter and 36 2 c in summer the daily minimum temperature is 9 2 c in winter and 22 8 c in summer and the average annual temperature is 23 4 c fig 2 potential evaporation rates are very high averaging 8 mm day 1 3000 mm y

hamersley group 2 ga old fig 3 table 1 the hamersley group includes banded iron formations cherts shales dolomites rhyolites and dolerites the mbf is formed on detritals dolocretes and clay tertiary sediments overlying basement lithology and it is bound by ridgelines of brockman iron formation to the north and marra mamba iron formation to the south some dolocretes are karstic and may create preferred recharge pathways the steep ridgelines comprised of the brockman iron formation and the rolling hills comprised of the marra mamba iron formation form low permeability barriers to groundwater flow these two formations are separated by the higher permeability wittenoom formation eroded to form the basinal structure in the basin tertiary sediments cover the basement units the detrital sequences are poorly sorted and formed in high energy depositional environments in some sections replaced by pedogenic dolocretes and calcretes and partially covered by lacustrine clay units fig 3 riotinto 2014 the mbf top shallow alluvial aquifer is largely unsaturated with a dynamic water table varying around 680 m asl the original groundwater table in the deep aquifer also varied around 680 m asl figs 4 and 5 the initial surveys defined two possible main recharge mechanisms for the deep aquifer 1 throughflow from the rail corridor and 2 recharge from the flanks of the mbf where clay is expected to thin out figs 3 and 4 the clay unit is a thick impermeable aquitard characterised by horizontal and vertical conductivities of 0 001 and 0 0001 m day 1 the pumping test of the deep aquifer determined a horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity of 9 m day 1 riotinto 2008 the iron ore mine operation immediately to the southwest of the mbf started above the water table in 1994 discharging initially 1 gl y 1 when below water table mining commenced in 2012 the water discharge increased to 21 26 gl y 1 riotinto 2008 riotinto 2014 2 2 analytical methods in total 36 groundwater bores were sampled during the dry season of 2018 august september including 29 from deep aquifers and 7 from shallow aquifers fig 1 supplementary materials table s1 groundwater bores at 15 locations were sampled after pumping at least three volumes of the bore five operating production bores were sampled directly from the taps and 16 bores which were not suitable for sampling with a pump were sampled using a 2 l hydrasleeve hydrasleeves are specially designed to fill only when pulled upward out of the bore and are thus capable of selectively filling up with bore water at certain depths stable carbon isotope compositions of dissolved inorganic carbon δ 13c dic radiocarbon 14c tritium 3h and cfc 12 concentrations were analysed in the rafter radiocarbon laboratory and the tritium and water dating laboratory gns science new zealand δ 13c dic samples were processed on a vacuum line with a 10 port manifold using ortho phosphoric acid digestion extracted co2 was cryogenically purified and analysed via dual inlet on isoprime 100 isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms all results are reported in permille with respect to vpdb after 17o craig correction and normalization based on internal standard insco2 with reported values of 14 0 for δ 13c insco2 was calibrated against nbs19 and lsvec with values given by coplen et al 2006 the combined analytical uncertainty for δ 13c analyses was 0 4 radiocarbon concentrations were analysed using accelerator mass spectrometry ams and reported as the percent of modern carbon pmc stuiver and polach 1977 with an analytical precision 0 3 pmc and combined analytical uncertainty of the individual measurements between 0 27 and 0 44 pmc tritium concentrations were analysed using electrolytic enrichment and liquid scintillation counting using wantalus low level counters morgenstern and taylor 2009 results are expressed in tritium units tu where one tu represents one molecule of 3h1ho in 10 18 molecules of water the method detection limit is 0 025 tu the cfcs were analysed with gas chromatography using a purge and trap system with an electron capture detector the detection limit was 5 pg kg 1 but precision was close to 50 for all concentrations measured the major source of uncertainty is the sampling technique and even though the water was collected by pumping through nylon tubing with brass fitting from fully purged bores contaminations of up to 5 pg kg 1 for cfc 12 can be expected cook et al 2017 stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of water were analysed using the isotopic liquid water analyser picarro 2130 picarro santa clara california usa in the west australian biogeochemistry centre at the university of western australia skrzypek and ford 2014 the δ 2h and δ 18o values were normalized to the vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water scale using three laboratory standards and following three point normalization skrzypek 2013 all laboratory standards were calibrated against international reference materials for vsmow2 δ 2h and δ 18o of equal 0 and slap equal δ 2h 428 0 and δ 18o 55 50 defining the vsmow2 slap2 scale coplen 1996 the long term analytical uncertainty one standard deviation was determined as 1 0 for δ 2h and 0 1 for δ 18o skrzypek and ford 2014 major ion compositions were analysed at als environmental laboratories in perth western australia ca mg na and k cations utilising inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes method ref apha 3120b br using ion chromatography method ref apha 4110b so4 and cl anions using discrete analyser in water by aquakem da method ref apha 4500 and hco3 alkalinity by acid titration method ref apha 2320 bridgewater 2012 3 theory for recharge calculation in semiarid regions where the water table is relatively deep recharge can be estimated based on either darcian velocities such as seepage from streamflow dogramaci et al 2015 or vertical seepage velocities through the unsaturated zone using groundwater dating tracers such as cfc 12 tritium and radiocarbon and hydrochemical tracers e g chloride mccallum et al 2017 however at a location with low recharge a comprehensive approach is required to minimise uncertainty in this study we applied all the listed methods using the site groundwater balance and multiple tracers to estimate the recharge and uncertainty of the analysis of the water balance components we also developed a mobile immobile recharge probability model based on the custom made python code 3 1 chloride as a recharge tracer the most straightforward method adopted in semiarid regions to estimate recharge is the chloride mass balance allison et al 1994 the chloride mass balance is a simple method of estimating the long term average recharge because it relies only on knowing the chloride deposition from rainfall and the chloride concentration in the groundwater the cl mass balance method is based on the conservative and stable state of chloride ions bromley et al 1997 the recharge is calculated from eq 1 as the product of the annual rainfall to the ratio of the chloride concentration in rainwater to that in groundwater these assumptions are related to chloride origin which is considered to originate solely from rainfall with no significant run on or run off occurring in the basin and the recharge flow process is mainly vertical rather than lateral bypass flow bromley et al 1997 the relative distribution of recharge can be estimated under certain conditions from water level data alone but velocity and darcy flow observations must be incorporated to estimate the rates of recharge recharge is often estimated more efficiently when automated inverse techniques are used eq 1 1 r p cl p cl g where r is the groundwater recharge flux mm y 1 p is the average annual precipitation mm y 1 cl p is the average precipitation weighted chloride concentration mg l 1 and cl g the mean chloride concentration in the groundwater mg l 1 to achieve estimate recharge using the chloride mass balance and extrapolate the estimated recharge from the point source cl balance monitoring bores to a larger domain a relationship was developed between the average annual rainfall and the log transformed average annual recharge dogramaci et al 2012b in this study we used cl on multiple monitoring bores across the study domain to eliminate additional uncertainty in recharge estimates 3 2 radiocarbon tritium and cfc 12 as water age tracers many tracer based recharge methods aim to relate the travel time of water to groundwater recharge rates when utilising the radiocarbon method age is determined using the 14c decay equation eq 2 this assumes that 14c enters groundwater during recharge where the most dissolved inorganic carbon is present as hco3 the method assumes that hco3 does not react with the aquifer matrix or undergo chemical changes other than the 14c radioactive decay however it is common for rock water interactions to alter the 14c activity of groundwater in this study we hypothesize that chemical reactions are similar in the unsaturated zone and aquifer across the study domain assuming that 14c modification due to hydrochemical processes does not occur in groundwater the ages can be estimated from measured 14c concentrations using 2 c c0 e tλ where t is the groundwater age c is the measured 14c activity c0 is the initial activity and λ 1 21 10 4 y 1 is the radioactive decay constant the decay constant relates to a half life of 5730 years making 14c useful for dating waters that are more than 1000 years old the initial activity is often considered to be the activity of atmospheric co2 which is often assumed to be 100 pmc the radioactive isotope of hydrogen tritium 3h behaves similarly to 14c however the half life of 12 3 years makes it more appropriate for dating water younger than 50 years tadros et al 2014 while atmospheric concentrations increased in the 1950 s due to nuclear testing decay of the bomb peak means that tritium can be assumed to reflect a constant recharge concentration taking into account tritium concentration in the current rainfall morgenstern et al 2010 tadros et al 2014 ages can therefore be calculated using eq 2 applying a radioactive decay constant λ of 0 056 and assuming an initial concentration of 1 5 tu for the study region a typical value for the southern hemisphere tadros et al 2014 similarly chlorofluorocarbon cfc s gases are dissolved and incorporated into groundwater during recharge they have relatively long residence times in the atmosphere the atmospheric concentrations of cfc 11 cfc 12 and cfc 113 increased after the 1950 s peaking between 1994 and 2002 different cfc concentrations peaked at different times since that time concentrations have decreased between 3 and 13 these man made gases dissolved in recharge water are conservative and are not influenced by water rock interactions therefore estimates of the time since recharge are obtained matching the measured concentrations to the equivalent atmospheric concentration the dates obtained from individual tracers can be utilised with a model and the position of each sample in the aquifer to determine the recharge rate vogel 1967 these methods assume that the primary mechanism for tracer transport is through groundwater advection however tracers are affected by the same processes that affect solutes in aquifers underwood et al 2018 weissmann et al 2002 this process results in the dispersion of tracers along flow paths rather than the movement of discrete parcels of uniform age ekwurzel et al 1994 underwood et al 2018 weissmann et al 2002 the tracer concentration in the aquifer may be affected by advection dispersion and exchanges between the mobile and immobile parts of an aquifer and recharge estimates should consider transport processes underwood et al 2018 3 2 1 model mathematical definition we implemented a mobile immobile model to resolve the differences between raw tracer estimates of the groundwater recharge the model implements flow in a mobile component of the aquifer and diffusive exchange with the immobile component of the aquifer the mobile component represents highly permeable parts of the aquifer i e sands or fractures and the immobile component represents the low flowing parts of the aquifer i e clay and rock matrix we assume that flow is one dimensional and that the mobile and immobile components represent averages along the flow path here we define the concentration of the tracer radiocarbon or cfc 12 in the aquifer considering mobile immobile transport eqs 3 and 4 given as by chmielarski et al 2022 3 c m t z d c m z v c m z λ c α c m c im 4 c im t α β c im c m λ c im where c m and c im are the mobile and immobile concentrations pmc for 14c and pptv for cfc 12 respectively d is the dispersion coefficient m2 y 1 v is the velocity λ is the coefficient of radioactive decay 0 000121 y 1 for 14c and 0 y 1 for cfc 12 α is the coefficient of exchange between the mobile and immobile zones y 1 and β is the ratio of immobile to mobile porosity in a one dimensional system where an unconfined aquifer is receiving recharge at the top and has an impermeable base the vertical velocity can be described as described by vogel 1967 eq 5 5 v rz θ m h where r is the recharge rate m y 1 z is the height of the measurement point above the base of the aquifer θ m is the porosity of the mobile zone and h is the thickness of the aquifer the dispersion term is described as follows eq 6 6 d v α l d eff where α l is the longitudinal dispersivity and d eff is the effective diffusion coefficient compound specific the term α can be described as sardin et al 1991 eq 7 7 α d eff l 2 c where l is the length of the diffusion and c is a shape factor this allows for compound specific differences in dispersion to be considered in the exchange term in addition to physical transport processes 14c activities need to be corrected for water rock interaction to achieve this we used a simple mass balance model with δ 13c of dissolved inorganic carbon dic and corrected each measured point for comparison to the modelled 14c concentrations eq 8 8 f δ 13 c δ 13 c s δ 13 c 0 δ 13 c s where f is the correction factor and δ 13c is for dic analysed in groundwater δ 13cs carbonates assumed 0 in aquifer and δ 13c0 dic in recharge water 12 to 17 the modelled uncorrected for geochemical processes 14c activities could be compared to each sample by dividing the concentration at the equivalent depth by the sample specific f value similar to salem et al 1980 the equations were implemented as a one dimensional finite element model in the framework described by mccallum et al 2020b the model developed for this study was implemented in python utilising the numpy and scipy libraries jones et al 2001 walt et al 2011 and is available at https github com jimmccallum ddmt recharge tracers the implemented model assumes that the properties of the aquifer are uniform and that the recharge patterns and flow fields produced are uniform within the aquifer this assumption has been investigated previously by kozuskanich et al 2014 and solomon and sudicky solomon and sudicky 1991 and the results should be considered as a mean values further we assume uniform properties of the mobile and immobile zones site wide to allow the resolution of all points simultaneously these assumptions are simplified within the context of our system but allow for recharge ranges to be estimated 3 2 2 new model calibration the model calibration and uncertainty analysis were undertaken using the dream zs algorithm laloy and vrugt 2012 the model maximises the likelihood of model fit by adjusting the parameters the parameters used for the model and the ranges over which they were varied are presented in table 2 the likelihood was maximised by comparing the modelled and predicted 14c and cfc 12 concentrations the modelled concentration was determined at the point in the model domain equivalent to the depth below the water table the likelihood was given as follows eq 9 9 ln l 1 n 14 c 1 σ 14 c 2 c 14 obs c 14 mod 2 1 ncfc 12 1 σ cfc 12 2 cfc 12 obs cfc 12 mod 2 where σ14 c and σcfc12 are the uncertainties applied to 14c and cfc 12 measurements respectively the calibration was undertaken using a burn in period of 100 samples before 1000 samples were used to create uncertainty ranges using markov chain monte carlo 4 results 4 1 hydrochemical composition of water the shallow and deep aquifers at the mbf are hydrochemically different table 3 the shallow aquifer has a higher salinity and a wider range of electrical conductivity ec from 1065 to 8358 µs cm the deep aquifer is less saline and ec is less variable ranging from 683 to 4144 µs cm carbonate species were dominated by hco3 in both aquifers except for one location with 30 mg l of co3 at a ph of 9 4 in the deep aquifer supplementary materials table s1 chloride concentrations follow similar trends as ec with the shallow aquifer having higher variability ranging from 11 to 1110 mg l and the deep aquifer ranging from 61 to 711 mg l bromide discordant with this trend was present mostly at higher concentrations in the deep aquifer 0 4 5 7 mg l than in the shallow aquifer 0 2 2 0 mg l higher concentrations of so4 hco3 ca mg and na ions generally corresponded to higher salinity fig 6 however the central lowest part of mbf is dominated by ca mg and hco3 with very low cl and na ions which are higher outside of the basin in the adjacent catchment e g in the railway corridor 4 2 stable hydrogen oxygen and carbon isotope composition and age tracers in water clear differences between shallow and deep aquifers can be observed in groundwater radiocarbon 14c concentrations but not in δ 13c dic or δ 18o h2o and δ 2h h2o table 4 groundwater in the deep aquifer is older with 14c ranging from 1 to 32 pmc with only 2 out of 27 samples above this range but still low 56 and 62 pmc groundwater in the shallow aquifer is much younger and 14c concentrations are more variable 40 98 pmc n 7 corresponding to groundwater ages between 160 and 7500 years there was no correlation between 14c concentrations and δ 13c dic values and δ 13c dic in both aquifers similarly varied around 9 7 2 1 however the two mentioned samples with the highest pmc for the deep aquifer had the highest 4 3 and the lowest 19 5 δ 13c dic values observed at the study site supplementary materials table s1 the 3h concentrations generally mirror the 14c concentration trends with higher values in the shallow aquifer 0 16 0 38 tu particularly in the central part of the mbf 0 34 0 38 tu 3h concentrations in the deep aquifer are close to zero corresponding to 5 half lives of decay 0 03 tu table 3 δ 18o h2o and δ 2h h2o in both aquifers are similar with the shallow aquifer having a more variable composition suggesting a similar composition of recharge water in both aquifers at the time of recharge shallow aquifer samples collected from the location closest to the central part of the mbf had the lowest δ 18o h2o 10 3 and δ 2h h2o 72 values reflecting the preferred recharge zone and low δ values of currently observed large cyclonic events skrzypek et al 2019 in the deep aquifer δ 18o h2o 8 4 0 6 and δ 2h h2o 60 2 8 were less variable and consistent with values reported for pilbara earlier dogramaci et al 2012a fig 7 table 3 cfc 12 results display clear differences between the two aquifers with higher concentrations present in the shallow aquifer 150 740 pptv and lower concentrations in the deep aquifer 51 374 pptv table 4 the results for the shallow aquifer more closely resemble atmospheric concentrations indicating similar trends in groundwater ages using 14c and 3h data between the aquifers cfc 12 is the most conservative of the cfcs in terms of retardation and degradation and was therefore used in this study table 4 4 3 mobile immobile recharge model the bounds of the mobile immobile recharge transport model encompass the majority of the 14c 28 of 34 and cfc 12 11 of 15 results figs 8 and 9 the exceptions are six samples including one cfc 12 result greater than atmospheric concentration and suggesting contamination mb09mn013 was excluded from the model and another point at 60 m below the water table ow3 with both elevated concentrations of 14c and cfc 12 our mobile immobile recharge transport model did not capture these points fig 9 the recharge probability distribution suggests the highest probability of recharge in the studied area to be at 2 5 and at 12 6 mm y 1 fig 10 the range covering 16th to 84th percentiles reflects recharge between 1 1 and 37 9 mm y 1 with a median value of 6 8 mm y 1 fig 10 we can further understand the recharge rate range drivers by examining the correlation of the different model parameters fig 9 table 4 recharge shows a fairly neutral relationship to most of the mobile immobile exchange model parameters α β and l also including the mobile zone porosity θ the only significant and negative correlation with recharge r was with the composition of the recharge water δ 13c0 dic end member r2 0 4 p 0 05 fig 9 the δ 13c0 dic value also correlates with horizontal diffusion l suggesting that it could be a good measure of the potential dilution of atmospheric δ 13c dic with δ 13c dic remaining in equilibrium with the rock matrix and therefore the overall recharge the range of this end member is therefore the main control of the groundwater recharge ranges we can further examine major drivers of recharge by analysing the posterior distribution of porosity fig 11 that seems to have no correlation with other parameters the porosity demonstrated a bimodal distribution with the highest probability at porosity of 0 2 representative of the fractured rock formations at the field site the second highest probability but significantly lower corresponds to a porosity value of 25 1 which represents the unconsolidated units at the site fig 11 the median value for mobile porosity is 0 5 suggesting large differences in infiltration velocity 5 discussion 5 1 catchment water budget the groundwater in the deep aquifer under the mbf is affected by the mine pit dewatering system its groundwater level dropped by 50 m from 680 to 630 m a s l riotinto 2014 based on water balance calculations area size and local precipitation and considering the dimensions of the aquifer below the mbf this reflects a mean abstraction of 22 gl y 1 over six years 2013 2018 fig 5 in contrast the decrease in the water level in the shallow aquifer was spatially variable across the catchment to a maximum of 5 m suggesting limited connectivity between the two aquifers or natural depletion due to dry weather following the last large cyclones in 2012 skrzypek et al 2019 considering a mean precipitation of 375 mm y 1 over the catchment area of 150 km2 56 gl y 1 annual mine dewatering constitutes only 40 of the total volume accumulated yearly in the mbf from annual precipitation for the period 2013 2018 while not accounting for evaporation riotinto 2008 riotinto 2014 therefore the observed 50 m water table decrease in the deep aquifer implies that only a very small fraction of the current precipitation contributes to the deep groundwater recharge and only partially compensates for groundwater abstraction this very low recharge is consistent with what is observed in other semiarid zones and can be explained by very high evaporation rates from both ponded water on the surface up to 2700 mm y 1 skrzypek et al 2015 and shallow soil 3 7 mm day 1 in the wet season tugwell wootton et al 2020 in such conditions precipitation events below 100 150 mm do not contribute to groundwater recharge at all e g harrington et al 2002 skrzypek et al 2019 vanderzalm et al 2011 dewatering created a significant hydraulic gradient but did not impact the general direction of the natural groundwater flow discharging the mbf deep aquifer and shallow aquifer to a limited extent figs 3 and 4 considering the pre mining groundwater levels aquifer properties geology major flow directions and catchment size fig 4 water budget calculations suggest that the system in natural conditions required a recharge of 1 7 mm y 1 to remain in steady state compensating natural groundwater outflow to adjunct areas this level of recharge is far below the mean recharge estimated for the central part of the mbf 6 mm y 1 skrzypek et al 2019 and at the low limit calculated for main drainage lines in the region 1 13 mm y 1 cook et al 2017 in current hydraulic conditions the pressure above and below the clay layer separating shallow and deep aquifers likely changed significantly also changing connectivity between both aquifers and potentially accelerating recharge above the natural rate despite this the deep groundwater level continues to decrease and in transient conditions a steady state numerical model is insufficient to estimate recharge rates riotinto 2014 therefore we used hydrochemical tracers to better define hydrogeological processes 5 2 hydrochemical composition the hydrochemistry of groundwater at the mbf matches the composition typical of the central pilbara region dogramaci and skrzypek 2015 concentrations of so4 hco3 versus k ca and mg ions indicate minor enrichment above the seawater dissolution line table 3 fig 6 swdl with processes other than rainfall evaporation changing the groundwater hydrochemical composition above the swdl line dogramaci et al 2012b moreover a clear linear relationship between ca mg hco3 and so4 ions fig 6 suggests that the system could be dominated by dolomite calcite gypsum dissolution and precipitation dogramaci et al 2012a the wittenoom formation acts as a source of ca mg hco3 ions and pyrites in shales supplying sulphates table 1 dogramaci et al 2017 as salinity increases due to evaporation the ratio of so4 to ca increases fig 6 indicating that groundwater evolves over time with dolomite gypsum dissolution or calcite precipitation dogramaci et al 2012a mather et al 2018 however on a millennial scale following evaporation and precipitation the concentration of br relative to cl increases because halite does not incorporate br into its crystal structure easily br can be removed from groundwater with organic matter incorporated into volatile compounds or carried out in hydrological systems by water flow br cl ratios in systems with restricted groundwater flows and repetitive wetting and drying cycles remain high skrzypek et al 2013 bores at the mbf display br cl ratios greater than the rainfall ratio of 500 with the lowest ratios along the rail corridor in the most saline parts of the deep and shallow aquifers outside of the mbf internally drained basin catchment e g turee creek catchment groundwater in deep aquifers generally has higher br and lower cl concentrations compared with shallow aquifers 5 3 radiogenic and chemical age tracers hydrogeological systems that are displaying a clear relationship between 14c and δ 13c dic usually indicate mixing between two inorganic carbon end members typically representing deep old waters low pmc and δ 13c dic close to 0 isolated from direct interaction with the atmosphere and shallow young waters pmc near 100 and negative δ 13c dic 8 remaining close to equilibrium with atmospheric co2 cook et al 2017 at the mbf two end member mixing is not that obvious because the ranges observed in δ 13c dic values largely overlap for shallow and deep groundwaters in the pilbara region the surface freshwater δ 13c dic typically varies between 10 and 13 remaining in equilibrium with the atmospheric co2 8 and reflecting primarily temperature driven diel cycles with very minor inputs from organic carbon siebers et al 2020 on the regional scale organic carbon input to groundwater is rather low due to extremely low organic matter content in soil usually 1 rouillard et al 2016a therefore δ 13c dic values in groundwater are usually similar to those of surface water and rarely below 15 which may indicate some organic carbon input the local marine carbonate formations which can contribute to dic concentrations have higher δ 13c values than groundwater δ 13c dic the δ 13c value of the wittenoom formation representing 3 ga old marine carbonates varies in a narrow range around 0 mather et al 2018 and more recent 100 ka calcrete and dolocretes precipitated in terrestrial conditions around 5 4 mather et al 2019 mather et al 2018 both due to their age have 14c pmc values near zero the δ 13c dic values of groundwater at the study site varied in the range between 7 3 and 13 5 except three samples below 15 0 and two above 5 0 potentially reflecting mixing between modern atmospheric co2 and dic originating from marine carbonate dissolution e g the wittenoom formation however δ 13c dic does not show a clear linear relationship with 14c pmc with many samples outside of the potential mixing lines but these ages should be considered as maximal if marine carbonate addition cannot be excluded several old water samples characterized by very low 14c pmc 0 20 have at the same time quite negative δ 13c dic 7 3 to 11 1 close to values observed for surface waters remaining in equilibrium with the co2 atmospheric at the time of recharge and not significantly modified by post infiltration processes despite the lack of obvious correlation with δ 13c dic 14c pmc progressively decreased with depth but it is variable a large range of variation in pmc e g 1 28 pmc for intervals 90 110 m bgs suggests different recharge rates at different parts of the mbf depending on lithology and position in the landscape the potential for high rates of recharge to the aquifer underlying the coolibah woodlands is confirmed by very negative δ 18o h2o values suggesting fast infiltration from large cyclonic events characterised by very low δ 18o h2o fig 7 skrzypek et al 2019 chloride concentration varies in a wide range suggesting a groundwater recharge from 0 5 mm y 1 at the basin margin to 8 mm y 1 at the central part with the deep aquifers showing a more consistent range of recharge fig 12 simulations of the solute transport using the mobile immobile recharge transport model using cfc 12 and 14c tracers estimated the highest probability for recharge of 2 5 and 12 6 mm y 1 at relativly low median effective mobile porosity of 0 5 figs 8 and 9 table 2 3h results confirm old ages of water in the deep aquifer near zero for tu and recent recharge to the shallow aquifer 2 3 half lives with mean ages between 25 and 37 years the δ 13c dic values do not correlate directly with 14c pmc concentrations but with horizontal diffusion l and recharge r suggesting that δ 13c dic remining with atmospheric co2 at the surface is diluted with dic originating from marine carbonate dissolution figs 8 and 9 the model we developed for estimating recharge is one dimensional and at the start assumes a homogeneous environment but the flow varies significantly spatially we demonstrated a bimodal distribution of porosity and therefore recharge rates that could reflect lithology and potential two modes of infiltration more typical for most sedimentary units 2 5 mm y 1 and preferred recharge 12 6 mm y 1 fig 11 this may vary with depth and heterogeneous parameters within the profiles may be appropriate furthermore we utilised all depth measurements from across the site rather than treating measurement locations individually the latter approach may have helped to identify the spatial variability in recharge however the number of parameters needed for the model 7 in this case may be difficult to resolve with only 1 3 tracer measurements at each location hence the approach we have taken reports the range of plausible recharge rates given the site wide data set rather than the spatial variability of recharge 5 4 significance of internally drained basin conceptual model internally drained basins may significantly contribute to groundwater recharge of the underlying aquifers on both catchment and regional scales this recharge is particularly important in arid and semiarid climates where evaporative losses from the surface and shallow soils are very high and significantly reduce infiltration through surfaces characterised by low water retention times lee 2018 yapiyev et al 2020 the mbf acts as an internally drained small basin accumulating water in the centre of the flood plain causing higher soil moisture and creating favourable ecological conditions for the coolibah woodland fig 1 surface water flows from the surrounding slopes are directed to the mbf centre infiltration is limited during relatively fast runoff however it may occur at the bottom of the ridges where the clay horizon is discontinued extended retention time during prolonged flooding in the central part of the mbf contributes to higher vertical infiltration through preferred recharge zones and then groundwater infiltrates laterally in directions opposite to surface flows groundwater in the shallow aquifer moves horizontally outward but also infiltrates through clays and partially karstic calcrete and dolocrete layers to the deep aquifer in natural conditions shallow aquifer recharge was relatively fast with infrequent larger than average recharge during cyclonic events skrzypek et al 2019 the median recharge is relatively high 6 8 mm y 1 respectively to overall low effective mobile porosity 0 5 recharge through the clay layers might be an important recharge pathway accelerated by dewatering and lowering the head in the deep aquifer below the water table in the shallow aquifer this is particularly important when considering that the clay layer was fully saturated when the head was at 680 m a s l the current deep aquifer head is below the base of the clay layer some indication of enhanced recharge through the creek bed is evident from the results of environmental tracer modelling particularly one bore ow3 in the railway corridor this suggests that some locations along the creek bed may act as preferential recharge locations the head difference between the shallow and the deep aquifer in the centre of the mbf pre mining created a preferred infiltration pathway to the deep aquifer the dropping groundwater levels due to dewatering reduced pressure in the deep aquifer and therefore accelerated seepage from the clay unit slow seepage resulted in older ages of infiltrated water recharge along the flanks of the clay layer would supply much younger water to the deep aquifer as it would flow faster through more permeable units parts of the deep aquifer now act as unconfined aquifers due to dewatering the general water budget calculation averaged across the entire catchment suggests that the current mine drawdown corresponds to a recharge rate of 31 mm y 1 which is the maximum predicted recharge rate at certain locations not mean value across the mbf excluding ow3 endorheic basins such as the mbf are important groundwater resources in locations of sparse surface water but at the same time they may constitute a challenge for mining in adjunct areas understanding recharge processes and mechanisms is important because the terminal nature of catchment areas may lead to the salinisation of groundwater due to evaporation tweed et al 2011 the importance of ephemeral recharge identified in the present study is consistent with global observations of arid and semiarid environments shanafield and cook 2014 sorman et al 1997 our work has highlighted that tracer type recharge estimators are effective tools for determining recharge in arid and semi arid environments when advance probability modelling is used these tools may be used more widely to understand groundwater recharge rates and sources 6 conclusion the proposed new probability mobile immobile model combining age tracers and stable isotope compositions allowed successful calculations of recharge rates in mount bruce flats mbf a small scale endorheic basin in the semiarid climate of western australia the observed differences in infiltration rates are primarily driven not by lithology but topography creating a radial gradient across the basin with recharge progressively decreasing further from the central part of the mbf the median recharge is relatively high 6 8 mm y 1 with the highest probability for recharge of 2 5 and 12 6 mm y 1 this relatively high recharge is accompanied by overall low effective mobile porosity for deeper aquifers 0 5 groundwater dating in transient systems is complex hence developing models that are capable of combining several tracer methods produces more robust outcomes than a single tracer model or direct application of age tracers a multi tracer approach is essential for cross verification of results but applying tracers directly without a mobile immobile model may lead to discrepancies in the obtained results the major limitation for comprehensive assessment as presented in this study is access to a high number of bores and observations which are usually limited outside of mining sites the model is available as open access software but further testing at different sites with various recharge rates is recommended credit authorship contribution statement grzegorz skrzypek formal analysis investigation methodology writing original draft adrian siller formal

7655,study region the study site the mount bruce flats is located in the pilbara a semiarid region of northern western australia study focus semiarid climates are characterised by an extreme water deficit with evaporation exceeding precipitation several fold groundwater recharge is episodical and occurs only after infrequent but very large volume precipitation while all other precipitation events are quickly lost to evaporation we investigated the contribution of an internally drained basin to localised groundwater recharge by combining the results of calculations from various tracer methods we developed a new mobile immobile recharge transport model coupled with a probability model based on markov chain monte carlo simulations that combines several age and hydrochemical tracers to estimate localised infiltration new hydrological insights for the region the actual recharge varied greatly across the basin being 4 5 times higher in the central part compared to the margins the highest probability for recharge was calculated for 2 5 mm y 1 and 12 6 mm y 1 with a median value of 6 8 mm y 1 while the median mobile effective porosity was low at 0 5 the flood plains overlying freshwater aquifers may contribute several times more to localised recharge than the upper parts of the catchments which are characterised by fast runoff and a lower water retention time therefore these endorheic basins could be a valuable source of water for groundwater recharge or constitute an additional hydrological challenge for mining graphical abstract ga1 keywords arid recharge groundwater terminal basin dating pilbara mobile immobile model 1 introduction groundwater recharge is a fundamental component of the water budget and understanding it is crucial for the correct management of groundwater assets healy 2010 groundwater availability is an important management concern not only to secure sufficient water quantity and quality for human consumption agriculture and industry but also for the health of the natural environment groundwater management is a high priority in semiarid and arid environments where recharge is limited and occurs infrequently and where high uncertainty in the amount of renewable water exists due to challenges in recharge estimation scanlon et al 2006 appropriate management may mitigate climate driven water quality changes barbieri et al 2023 different groundwater recharge estimation methods can be used at various temporal and spatial scales point source recharge can be quantified directly by measuring outflow from lysimeters observing water table depth and its fluctuation or using various chemical and physical tracers cook et al 2017 skrzypek et al 2019 wachniew 2015 yin et al 2023 tracers such as radiocarbon 14c tritium 3h and chlorofluorocarbons cfc 12 can be used for water age estimation calculation of proportional contribution from different sources and groundwater recharge quantification cook and dogramaci 2019 wang et al 2020 yin et al 2023 additionally chloride mass balance allison et al 1994 crosbie et al 2018 and stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions skrzypek et al 2019 xu et al 2019 can be used to estimate recharge and evaporative losses prior to recharge dogramaci et al 2012a mccallum et al 2020a mccallum et al 2014 skrzypek et al 2015 however once recharge water mixes with resident groundwater in aquifers the recharge rate calculation becomes challenging especially if the recharge is low as in semiarid climates usually the single tracer method is not able to address these complex situations but could be resolved using a multi tracer approach in combination with numerical modelling and water budget calculations cook and dogramaci 2019 or more novel probability models as proposed in this study recharge rates have been successfully estimated with the help of environmental tracers before mcmahon et al 2011 environmental tracers can be easily interpreted when samples are collected from bores with short screens and when the vertical location of the water sampling point is known and mixing between stratified water of different groundwater ages is minimized cook et al 2017 cook and solomon 1995 however in many instances mixing young shallow and old deep groundwater within aquifers can add significant uncertainty to recharge calculations eberts et al 2012 jurgens et al 2014 mccallum et al 2017 visser et al 2013 additionally in heavily pumped aquifers variations in age mixtures can be observed over short time frames constraining accuracy in recharge calculations however this may provide additional information on aquifer properties and transient mixing ratios furthermore the mixing of groundwater ages induced within aquifers may lead to the observation of both young and old water tracers showing vastly different ages cook et al 2017 jasechko et al 2017 leray et al 2014 vertical and horizontal groundwater flow established from groundwater ages can be used to constrain groundwater recharge through the improvement of water balance calculations models that reproduce multiple tracer observations are necessary to determine recharge rates accurately particularly when dating tracers show vastly different ages dunkle et al 1993 mcmahon et al 2011 pearson and white 1967 recharge rates in semiarid environments are highly variable across the landscape and largely depend on geomorphology and geology mcfarlane 2015 zarate et al 2021 at locations where bedrock is exposed to the surface direct recharge to fractured aquifers is restricted by high surface runoff beetle moorcroft et al 2021 siebers et al 2016 high surface runoff contributes to flash floods and delivers large volumes of water to flood plains rapidly these flood plains frequently overlie shallow alluvial aquifers the spatial extent of which is limited by topography creating endorheic basins skrzypek et al 2019 skrzypek et al 2016 these alluvial aquifers with relatively small storage capacity can potentially act as important interfaces for deeper fractured aquifer recharge the overarching aim of this study is to improve our understanding of the role of alluvial flood plains in groundwater recharge in a semiarid climate this aim was achieved through the conceptualization of groundwater flow the calculation of water budget and estimating recharge rates using a new mobile immobile recharge transport model in conjunction with a markov chain monte carlo approach mixing models and compared to the classical chloride mass balance calculations the study utilised water

dissolved inorganic carbon 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site mt bruce flats mbf is located in the pilbara region of western australia 45 km east of tom price and it is adjacent to an open pit iron ore mine fig 1 the mbf is surrounded on all sides by ridgelines located to the east north and south to the southeast the mbf narrows out between two ridgelines to form a 2 5 km wide corridor known as rail corridor the rail corridor is cut from northeast to southwest by turee creek an ephemeral creek draining a catchment separated from the mbf by a mountain ridge fig 1 the surface outflow from the mbf is restricted by topography and the mbf acts as a small terminal basin 8 km2 for surface water periodically flooded by cyclonic rainfall events skrzypek et al 2019 these unique hydrographic conditions support coolibah woodlands an ecological community of eucalyptus victrix trees the coolibahs form two separate colonies eastern and western stands covering 1 74 km2 of the topographically lowest sections of the mbf at 703 705 m asl the coolibahs roots extend down 10 12 m below the surface not reaching the groundwater level and transpiring water from the unsaturated zone rather than directly accessing groundwater skrzypek et al 2019 2 1 1 climate the mbf has a hot semiarid climate with a high evaporation rate and a tropical rainfall pattern with wet summers and dry winters fig 2 the region experiences infrequent but heavy downpours in thunderstorms and periodic cyclonic events rouillard et al 2015 rouillard et al 2016b the most recent major cyclones cyclone lua and cyclone heidi occurred in 2012 skrzypek et al 2019 rainfall occurs mainly during the wet season between december and march with small amounts occurring during the dry season from april to november fig 2 the average annual rainfall for the period between 1998 and 2018 was 375 mm y 1 temperature data fluctuate seasonally with an average daily maximum temperature of 23 2 c in winter and 36 2 c in summer the daily minimum temperature is 9 2 c in winter and 22 8 c in summer and the average annual temperature is 23 4 c fig 2 potential evaporation rates are very high averaging 8 mm day 1 3000 mm y

hamersley group 2 ga old fig 3 table 1 the hamersley group includes banded iron formations cherts shales dolomites rhyolites and dolerites the mbf is formed on detritals dolocretes and clay tertiary sediments overlying basement lithology and it is bound by ridgelines of brockman iron formation to the north and marra mamba iron formation to the south some dolocretes are karstic and may create preferred recharge pathways the steep ridgelines comprised of the brockman iron formation and the rolling hills comprised of the marra mamba iron formation form low permeability barriers to groundwater flow these two formations are separated by the higher permeability wittenoom formation eroded to form the basinal structure in the basin tertiary sediments cover the basement units the detrital sequences are poorly sorted and formed in high energy depositional environments in some sections replaced by pedogenic dolocretes and calcretes and partially covered by lacustrine clay units fig 3 riotinto 2014 the mbf top shallow alluvial aquifer is largely unsaturated with a dynamic water table varying around 680 m asl the original groundwater table in the deep aquifer also varied around 680 m asl figs 4 and 5 the initial surveys defined two possible main recharge mechanisms for the deep aquifer 1 throughflow from the rail corridor and 2 recharge from the flanks of the mbf where clay is expected to thin out figs 3 and 4 the clay unit is a thick impermeable aquitard characterised by horizontal and vertical conductivities of 0 001 and 0 0001 m day 1 the pumping test of the deep aquifer determined a horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity of 9 m day 1 riotinto 2008 the iron ore mine operation immediately to the southwest of the mbf started above the water table in 1994 discharging initially 1 gl y 1 when below water table mining commenced in 2012 the water discharge increased to 21 26 gl y 1 riotinto 2008 riotinto 2014 2 2 analytical methods in total 36 groundwater bores were sampled during the dry season of 2018 august september including 29 from deep aquifers and 7 from shallow aquifers fig 1 supplementary materials table s1 groundwater bores at 15 locations were sampled after pumping at least three volumes of the bore five operating production bores were sampled directly from the taps and 16 bores which were not suitable for sampling with a pump were sampled using a 2 l hydrasleeve hydrasleeves are specially designed to fill only when pulled upward out of the bore and are thus capable of selectively filling up with bore water at certain depths stable carbon isotope compositions of dissolved inorganic carbon δ 13c dic radiocarbon 14c tritium 3h and cfc 12 concentrations were analysed in the rafter radiocarbon laboratory and the tritium and water dating laboratory gns science new zealand δ 13c dic samples were processed on a vacuum line with a 10 port manifold using ortho phosphoric acid digestion extracted co2 was cryogenically purified and analysed via dual inlet on isoprime 100 isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms all results are reported in permille with respect to vpdb after 17o craig correction and normalization based on internal standard insco2 with reported values of 14 0 for δ 13c insco2 was calibrated against nbs19 and lsvec with values given by coplen et al 2006 the combined analytical uncertainty for δ 13c analyses was 0 4 radiocarbon concentrations were analysed using accelerator mass spectrometry ams and reported as the percent of modern carbon pmc stuiver and polach 1977 with an analytical precision 0 3 pmc and combined analytical uncertainty of the individual measurements between 0 27 and 0 44 pmc tritium concentrations were analysed using electrolytic enrichment and liquid scintillation counting using wantalus low level counters morgenstern and taylor 2009 results are expressed in tritium units tu where one tu represents one molecule of 3h1ho in 10 18 molecules of water the method detection limit is 0 025 tu the cfcs were analysed with gas chromatography using a purge and trap system with an electron capture detector the detection limit was 5 pg kg 1 but precision was close to 50 for all concentrations measured the major source of uncertainty is the sampling technique and even though the water was collected by pumping through nylon tubing with brass fitting from fully purged bores contaminations of up to 5 pg kg 1 for cfc 12 can be expected cook et al 2017 stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of water were analysed using the isotopic liquid water analyser picarro 2130 picarro santa clara california usa in the west australian biogeochemistry centre at the university of western australia skrzypek and ford 2014 the δ 2h and δ 18o values

where the water table is relatively deep recharge can be estimated based on either darcian velocities such as seepage from streamflow dogramaci et al 2015 or vertical seepage velocities through the unsaturated zone using groundwater dating tracers such as cfc 12 tritium and radiocarbon and hydrochemical tracers e g chloride mccallum et al 2017 however at a location with low recharge a comprehensive approach is required to minimise uncertainty in this study we applied all the listed methods using the site groundwater balance and multiple tracers to estimate the recharge and uncertainty of the analysis of the water balance components we also developed a mobile immobile recharge probability model based on the custom made python code 3 1 chloride as a recharge tracer the most straightforward method adopted in semiarid regions to estimate recharge is the chloride mass balance allison et al 1994 the chloride mass balance is a simple method of estimating the long term average recharge because it relies only on knowing the chloride deposition from rainfall and the chloride concentration in the groundwater the cl mass balance method is based on the conservative and stable state of chloride ions bromley et al 1997 the recharge is calculated from eq 1 as the product of the annual rainfall to the ratio of the chloride concentration in rainwater to that in groundwater these assumptions are related to chloride origin which is considered to originate solely from rainfall with no significant run on or run off occurring in the basin and the recharge flow process is mainly vertical rather than lateral bypass flow bromley et al 1997 the relative distribution of recharge can be estimated under certain conditions from water level data alone but velocity and darcy flow observations must be incorporated to estimate the rates of recharge recharge is often estimated more efficiently when automated inverse techniques are used eq 1 1 r p cl p cl g where r is the groundwater recharge flux mm y 1 p is the average annual precipitation mm y 1 cl p is the average precipitation weighted chloride concentration mg l 1 and cl g the mean chloride concentration in the groundwater mg l 1 to achieve estimate recharge using the chloride mass balance and extrapolate the estimated recharge from the point source cl balance monitoring bores to a larger domain a relationship was developed between the average annual rainfall and the log transformed average annual recharge dogramaci et al 2012b in this study we used cl on multiple monitoring bores across the study domain to eliminate additional uncertainty in recharge estimates 3 2 radiocarbon tritium and cfc 12 as water age tracers many tracer based recharge methods aim to relate the travel time of water to groundwater recharge rates when utilising the radiocarbon method age is determined using the 14c decay equation eq 2 this assumes that 14c enters groundwater during recharge where the most dissolved inorganic carbon is present as hco3 the method assumes that hco3 does not react with the aquifer matrix or undergo chemical changes other than the 14c radioactive decay however it is common for rock water interactions to alter the 14c activity of groundwater in this study we hypothesize that chemical reactions are similar in the unsaturated zone and aquifer across the study domain assuming that 14c modification due to hydrochemical processes does not occur in groundwater the ages can be estimated from measured 14c concentrations using 2 c c0 e tλ where t is the groundwater age c is the measured 14c activity c0 is the initial activity and λ 1 21 10 4 y 1 is the radioactive decay constant the decay constant relates to a half life of 5730 years making 14c useful for dating waters that are more than 1000 years old the initial activity is often considered to be the activity of atmospheric co2 which is often assumed to be 100 pmc the radioactive isotope of hydrogen tritium 3h behaves similarly to 14c however the half life of 12 3 years makes it more appropriate for dating water younger than 50 years tadros et al 2014 while atmospheric concentrations increased in the 1950 s due to nuclear testing decay of the bomb peak means that tritium can be assumed to reflect a constant recharge concentration taking into account tritium concentration in the current rainfall morgenstern et al 2010 tadros et al 2014 ages can therefore be calculated using eq 2 applying a radioactive decay constant λ of 0 056 and assuming an initial concentration of 1 5 tu for the study region a typical value for the southern hemisphere tadros et al 2014 similarly chlorofluorocarbon cfc s gases are dissolved and incorporated into groundwater during recharge they have relatively long residence times in the atmosphere the atmospheric concentrations of cfc 11 cfc 12 and cfc 113 increased after the 1950 s peaking between 1994 and 2002 different cfc concentrations peaked at different times since that time concentrations have decreased between 3 and 13 these man made gases dissolved in recharge water are conservative and are not influenced by water rock interactions therefore estimates of the time since recharge are obtained matching the measured concentrations to the equivalent atmospheric concentration the dates obtained from individual tracers can be utilised with a model and the position of each sample in the aquifer to determine the recharge rate vogel 1967 these methods assume that the primary mechanism for tracer transport is through groundwater advection however tracers are affected by the same processes that affect solutes in aquifers underwood et al 2018 weissmann et al 2002 this process results in the dispersion of tracers along flow paths rather than the movement of discrete parcels of uniform age ekwurzel et al 1994 underwood et al 2018 weissmann et al 2002 the tracer concentration in the aquifer may be affected by advection dispersion and exchanges between the mobile and immobile parts of an aquifer and recharge estimates should consider transport processes underwood et al 2018 3 2 1 model mathematical definition we implemented a mobile immobile model to resolve the differences between raw tracer estimates of the groundwater recharge the model implements flow in a mobile component of the aquifer and diffusive exchange with the immobile component of the aquifer the mobile component represents highly permeable parts of the aquifer i e sands or fractures and the immobile component represents the low flowing parts of the aquifer i e clay and rock matrix we assume that flow is one dimensional and that the mobile and immobile components represent averages along the flow path here we define the concentration of the tracer radiocarbon or cfc 12 in the aquifer considering mobile immobile transport eqs 3 and 4 given as by chmielarski et al 2022 3 c m t z d c m z v c m z λ c α c m c im 4 c im t α β c im c m λ c im where c m and c im are the mobile and immobile concentrations pmc for 14c and pptv for cfc 12 respectively d is the dispersion coefficient m2 y 1 v is the velocity λ is the coefficient of radioactive decay 0 000121 y 1 for 14c and 0 y 1 for cfc 12 α is the coefficient of exchange between the mobile and immobile zones y 1 and β is the ratio of immobile to mobile porosity in a one dimensional system where an unconfined aquifer is receiving recharge at the top and has an impermeable base the vertical velocity can be described as described by vogel 1967 eq 5 5 v rz θ m h where r is the recharge rate m y 1 z is the height of the measurement point above the base of the aquifer θ m is the porosity of the mobile zone and h is the thickness of the aquifer the dispersion term is described as follows eq 6 6 d v α l d eff where α l is the longitudinal dispersivity and d eff is the effective diffusion coefficient compound specific the term α can be described as sardin et al 1991 eq 7 7 α d eff l 2 c where l is the length of the diffusion and c is a shape factor this allows for compound specific differences in dispersion to be considered in the exchange term in addition to physical transport processes 14c activities need to be corrected for water rock interaction to achieve this we used a simple mass balance model with δ 13c of dissolved inorganic carbon dic and corrected each measured point for comparison to the modelled 14c concentrations eq 8 8 f δ 13 c δ 13 c s δ 13 c 0 δ 13 c s where f is the correction factor and δ 13c is for dic analysed in groundwater δ 13cs carbonates assumed 0 in aquifer and δ 13c0 dic in recharge water 12 to 17 the modelled uncorrected for geochemical processes 14c activities could be compared to each sample by dividing the concentration at the equivalent depth by the sample specific f value similar to salem et al 1980 the equations were implemented as a one dimensional finite element model in the framework described by mccallum et al 2020b the model developed for this study was implemented in python utilising the numpy and scipy libraries jones et al 2001 walt et al 2011 and is available at https github com jimmccallum ddmt recharge tracers the implemented model assumes that the properties of the aquifer are uniform and that the recharge patterns and flow fields produced are uniform within the aquifer this assumption has been investigated previously by kozuskanich et al 2014 and solomon and sudicky solomon and sudicky 1991 and the results should be considered as a mean values further we assume uniform properties of the mobile and immobile zones site wide to allow the resolution of all points simultaneously these assumptions are simplified within the context of our system but allow for recharge ranges to be estimated 3 2 2 new model calibration the model calibration and uncertainty analysis were undertaken using the dream zs algorithm laloy and vrugt 2012 the model maximises the likelihood of model fit by adjusting the parameters the parameters used for the model and the ranges over which they were varied are presented in table 2 the likelihood was maximised by comparing the modelled and predicted 14c and cfc 12 concentrations the modelled concentration was determined at the point in the model domain equivalent to the depth below the water table the likelihood was given as follows eq 9 9 ln l 1 n 14 c 1 σ 14 c 2 c 14 obs c 14 mod 2 1 ncfc 12 1 σ cfc 12 2 cfc 12 obs cfc 12 mod 2 where σ14 c and σcfc12 are the uncertainties applied to 14c and cfc 12 measurements respectively the calibration was undertaken using a burn in period of 100 samples before 1000 samples were used to create uncertainty ranges using markov chain monte carlo 4 results 4 1 hydrochemical composition of water the shallow and deep aquifers at the mbf are hydrochemically different table 3 the shallow aquifer has a higher salinity and a wider range of electrical conductivity ec from 1065 to 8358 µs cm the deep aquifer is less saline and ec is less variable ranging from 683 to 4144 µs cm carbonate species were dominated by hco3 in both aquifers except for one location with 30 mg l of co3 at a ph of 9 4 in the deep aquifer supplementary materials table s1 chloride concentrations follow similar trends as ec with the shallow aquifer having higher variability ranging from 11 to 1110 mg l and the deep aquifer ranging from 61 to 711 mg l bromide discordant with this trend was present mostly at higher concentrations in the deep aquifer 0 4 5 7 mg l than in the shallow aquifer 0 2 2 0 mg l higher concentrations of so4 hco3 ca mg and na ions generally corresponded to higher salinity fig 6 however the central lowest part of mbf is dominated by ca mg and hco3 with very low cl and na ions which are higher outside of the basin in the adjacent catchment e g in the railway corridor 4 2 stable hydrogen oxygen and carbon isotope composition and age tracers in water clear differences between shallow and deep aquifers can be observed in groundwater radiocarbon 14c concentrations but not in δ 13c dic or δ 18o h2o and δ 2h h2o table 4 groundwater in the deep aquifer is older with 14c ranging from 1 to 32 pmc with only 2 out of 27 samples above this range but still low 56 and 62 pmc groundwater in the shallow aquifer is much younger and 14c concentrations are more variable 40 98 pmc n 7 corresponding to groundwater ages between 160 and 7500 years there was no correlation between 14c concentrations and δ 13c dic values and δ 13c dic in both aquifers similarly varied around 9 7 2 1 however the two mentioned samples with the highest pmc for the deep aquifer had the highest 4 3 and the lowest 19 5 δ 13c dic values observed at the study site supplementary materials table s1 the 3h concentrations generally mirror the 14c concentration trends with higher values in the shallow aquifer 0 16 0 38 tu particularly in the central part of the mbf 0 34 0 38 tu 3h concentrations in the deep aquifer are close to zero corresponding to 5 half lives of decay 0 03 tu table 3 δ 18o h2o and δ 2h h2o in both aquifers are similar with the shallow aquifer having a more variable composition suggesting a similar composition of recharge water in both aquifers at the time of recharge shallow aquifer samples collected from the location closest to the central part of the mbf had the lowest δ 18o h2o 10 3 and δ 2h h2o 72 values reflecting the preferred recharge zone and low δ values of currently observed large cyclonic events skrzypek et al 2019 in the deep aquifer δ 18o h2o 8 4 0 6 and δ 2h h2o 60 2 8 were less variable and consistent with values reported for pilbara earlier dogramaci et al 2012a fig 7 table 3 cfc 12 results display clear differences between the two aquifers with higher concentrations present in the shallow aquifer 150 740 pptv and lower concentrations in the deep aquifer 51 374 pptv table 4 the results for the shallow aquifer more closely resemble atmospheric concentrations indicating similar trends in groundwater ages using 14c and 3h data between the aquifers cfc 12 is the most conservative of the cfcs in terms of retardation and degradation and was therefore used in this study table 4 4 3 mobile immobile recharge model the bounds of the mobile immobile recharge transport model encompass the majority of the 14c 28 of 34 and cfc 12 11 of 15 results figs 8 and 9 the exceptions are six samples including one cfc 12 result greater than atmospheric concentration and suggesting contamination mb09mn013 was excluded from the model and another point at 60 m below the water table ow3 with both elevated concentrations of 14c and cfc 12 our mobile immobile recharge transport model did not capture these points fig 9 the recharge probability distribution suggests the highest probability of recharge in the studied area to be at 2 5 and at 12 6 mm y 1 fig 10 the range covering 16th to 84th percentiles reflects recharge between 1 1 and 37 9 mm y 1 with a median value of 6 8 mm y 1 fig 10 we can further understand the recharge rate range drivers by examining the correlation of the different model parameters fig 9 table 4 recharge shows a fairly neutral relationship to most of the mobile immobile exchange model parameters α β and l also including the mobile zone porosity θ the only significant and negative correlation with recharge r was with the composition of the recharge water δ 13c0 dic end member r2 0 4 p 0 05 fig 9 the δ 13c0 dic value also correlates with horizontal diffusion l suggesting that it could be a good measure of the potential dilution of atmospheric δ 13c dic with δ 13c dic remaining in equilibrium with the rock matrix and therefore the overall recharge the range of this end member is therefore the main control of the groundwater recharge ranges we can further examine major drivers of recharge by analysing the posterior distribution of porosity fig 11 that seems to have no correlation with other parameters the porosity demonstrated a bimodal distribution with the highest probability at porosity of 0 2 representative of the fractured rock formations at the field site the second highest probability but significantly lower corresponds to a porosity value of 25 1 which represents the unconsolidated units at the site fig 11 the median value for mobile porosity is 0 5 suggesting large differences in infiltration velocity 5 discussion 5 1 catchment water budget the groundwater in the deep aquifer under the mbf is affected by the mine pit dewatering system its groundwater level dropped by 50 m from 680 to 630 m a s l riotinto 2014 based on water balance calculations area size and local precipitation and considering the dimensions of the aquifer below the mbf this reflects a mean abstraction of 22 gl y 1 over six years 2013 2018 fig 5 in contrast the decrease in the water level in the shallow aquifer was spatially variable across the catchment to a maximum of 5 m suggesting limited connectivity between the two aquifers or natural depletion due to dry weather following the last large cyclones in 2012 skrzypek et al 2019 considering a mean precipitation of 375 mm y 1 over the catchment area of 150 km2 56 gl y 1 annual mine dewatering constitutes only 40 of the total volume accumulated yearly in the mbf from annual precipitation for the period 2013 2018 while not accounting for evaporation riotinto 2008 riotinto 2014 therefore the observed 50 m water table decrease in the deep aquifer implies that only a very small fraction of the current precipitation contributes to the deep groundwater recharge and only partially compensates for groundwater abstraction this very low recharge is consistent with what is observed in other semiarid zones and can be explained by very high evaporation rates from both ponded water on the surface up to 2700 mm y 1 skrzypek et al 2015 and shallow soil 3 7 mm day 1 in the wet season tugwell wootton et al 2020 in such conditions precipitation events below 100 150 mm do not contribute to groundwater recharge at all e g harrington et al 2002 skrzypek et al 2019 vanderzalm et al 2011 dewatering created a significant hydraulic gradient but did not impact the general direction of the natural groundwater flow discharging the mbf deep aquifer and shallow aquifer to a limited extent figs 3 and 4 considering the pre mining groundwater levels aquifer properties geology major flow directions and catchment size fig 4 water budget calculations suggest that the system in natural conditions required a recharge of 1 7 mm y 1 to remain in steady state compensating natural groundwater outflow to adjunct areas this level of recharge is far below the mean recharge estimated for the central part of the mbf 6 mm y 1 skrzypek et al 2019 and at the low limit calculated for main drainage lines in the region 1 13 mm y 1 cook et al 2017 in current hydraulic conditions the pressure above and below the clay layer separating shallow and deep aquifers likely changed significantly also changing connectivity between both aquifers and potentially accelerating recharge above the natural rate despite this the deep groundwater level continues to decrease and in transient conditions a steady state numerical model is insufficient to estimate recharge rates riotinto 2014 therefore we used hydrochemical tracers to better define hydrogeological processes 5 2 hydrochemical composition the hydrochemistry of groundwater at the mbf matches the composition typical of the central pilbara region dogramaci and skrzypek 2015 concentrations of so4 hco3 versus k ca and mg ions indicate minor enrichment above the seawater dissolution line table 3 fig 6 swdl with processes other than rainfall evaporation changing the groundwater hydrochemical composition above the swdl line dogramaci et al 2012b moreover a clear linear relationship between ca mg hco3 and so4 ions fig 6 suggests that the system could be dominated by dolomite calcite gypsum dissolution and precipitation dogramaci et al 2012a the wittenoom formation acts as a source of ca mg hco3 ions and pyrites in shales supplying sulphates table 1 dogramaci et al 2017 as salinity increases due to evaporation the ratio of so4 to ca increases fig 6 indicating that groundwater evolves over time with dolomite gypsum dissolution or calcite precipitation dogramaci et al 2012a mather et al 2018 however on a millennial scale following evaporation and precipitation the concentration of br relative to cl increases because halite does not incorporate br into its crystal structure easily br can be removed from groundwater with organic matter incorporated into volatile compounds or carried out in hydrological systems by water flow br cl ratios in systems with restricted groundwater flows and repetitive wetting and drying cycles remain high skrzypek et al 2013 bores at the mbf display br cl ratios greater than the rainfall ratio of 500 with the lowest ratios along the rail corridor in the most saline parts of the deep and shallow aquifers outside of the mbf internally drained basin catchment e g turee creek catchment groundwater in deep aquifers generally has higher br and lower cl concentrations compared with shallow aquifers 5 3 radiogenic and chemical age tracers hydrogeological systems that are displaying a clear relationship between 14c and δ 13c dic usually indicate mixing between two inorganic carbon end members typically representing deep old waters low pmc and δ 13c dic close to 0 isolated from direct interaction with the atmosphere and shallow young waters pmc near 100 and negative δ 13c dic 8 remaining close to equilibrium with atmospheric co2 cook et al 2017 at the mbf two end member mixing is not that obvious because the ranges observed in δ 13c dic values largely overlap for shallow and deep groundwaters in the pilbara region the surface freshwater δ 13c dic typically varies between 10 and 13 remaining in equilibrium with the atmospheric co2 8 and reflecting primarily temperature driven diel cycles with very minor inputs from organic carbon siebers et al 2020 on the regional scale organic carbon input to groundwater is rather low due to extremely low organic matter content in soil usually 1 rouillard et al 2016a therefore δ 13c dic values in groundwater are usually similar to those of surface water and rarely below 15 which may indicate some organic carbon input the local marine carbonate formations which can contribute to dic concentrations have higher δ 13c values than groundwater δ 13c dic the δ 13c value of the wittenoom formation representing 3 ga old marine carbonates varies in a narrow range around 0 mather et al 2018 and more recent 100 ka calcrete and dolocretes precipitated in terrestrial conditions around 5 4 mather et al 2019 mather et al 2018 both due to their age have 14c pmc values near zero the δ 13c dic values of groundwater at the study site varied in the range between 7 3 and 13 5 except three samples below 15 0 and two above 5 0 potentially reflecting mixing between modern atmospheric co2 and dic originating from marine carbonate dissolution e g the wittenoom formation however δ 13c dic does not show a clear linear relationship with 14c pmc with many samples outside of the potential mixing lines but these ages should be considered as maximal if marine carbonate addition cannot be excluded several old water samples characterized by very low 14c pmc 0 20 have at the same time quite negative δ 13c dic 7 3 to 11 1 close to values observed for surface waters remaining in equilibrium with the co2 atmospheric at the time of recharge and not significantly modified by post infiltration processes despite the lack of obvious correlation with δ 13c dic 14c pmc progressively decreased with depth but it is variable a large range of variation in pmc e g 1 28 pmc for intervals 90 110 m bgs suggests different recharge rates at different parts of the mbf depending on lithology and position in the landscape the potential for high rates of recharge to the aquifer underlying the coolibah woodlands is confirmed by very negative δ 18o h2o values suggesting fast infiltration from large cyclonic events characterised by very low δ 18o h2o fig 7 skrzypek et al 2019 chloride concentration varies in a wide range suggesting a groundwater recharge from 0 5 mm y 1 at the basin margin to 8 mm y 1 at the central part with the deep aquifers showing a more consistent range of recharge fig 12 simulations of the solute transport using the mobile immobile recharge transport model using cfc 12 and 14c tracers estimated the highest probability for recharge of 2 5 and 12 6 mm y 1 at relativly low median effective mobile porosity of 0 5 figs 8 and 9 table 2 3h results confirm old ages of water in the deep aquifer near zero for tu and recent recharge to the shallow aquifer 2 3 half lives with mean ages between 25 and 37 years the δ 13c dic values do not correlate directly with 14c pmc concentrations but with horizontal diffusion l and recharge r suggesting that δ 13c dic remining with atmospheric co2 at the surface is diluted with dic originating from marine carbonate dissolution figs 8 and 9 the model we developed for estimating recharge is one dimensional and at the start assumes a homogeneous environment but the flow varies significantly spatially we demonstrated a bimodal distribution of porosity and therefore recharge rates that could reflect lithology and potential two modes of infiltration more typical for most sedimentary units 2 5 mm y 1 and preferred recharge 12 6 mm y 1 fig 11 this may vary with depth and heterogeneous parameters within the profiles may be appropriate furthermore we utilised all depth measurements from across the site rather than treating measurement locations individually the latter approach may have helped to identify the spatial variability in recharge however the number of parameters needed for the model 7 in this case may be difficult to resolve with only 1 3 tracer measurements at each location hence the approach we have taken reports the range of plausible recharge rates given the site wide data set rather than the spatial variability of recharge 5 4 significance of internally drained basin conceptual model internally drained basins may significantly contribute to groundwater recharge of the underlying aquifers on both catchment and regional scales this recharge is particularly important in arid and semiarid climates where evaporative losses from the surface and shallow soils are very high and significantly reduce infiltration through surfaces characterised by low water retention times lee 2018 yapiyev et al 2020 the mbf acts as an internally drained small basin accumulating water in the centre of the flood plain causing higher soil moisture and creating favourable ecological conditions for the coolibah woodland fig 1 surface water flows from the surrounding slopes are directed to the mbf centre infiltration is limited during relatively fast runoff however it may occur at the bottom of the ridges where the clay horizon is discontinued extended retention time during prolonged flooding in the central part of the mbf contributes to higher vertical infiltration through preferred recharge zones and then groundwater infiltrates laterally in directions opposite to surface flows groundwater in the shallow aquifer moves horizontally outward but also infiltrates through clays and partially karstic calcrete and dolocrete layers to the deep aquifer in natural conditions shallow aquifer recharge was relatively fast with infrequent larger than average recharge during cyclonic events skrzypek et al 2019 the median recharge is relatively high 6 8 mm y 1 respectively to overall low effective mobile porosity 0 5 recharge through the clay layers might be an important recharge pathway accelerated by dewatering and lowering the head in the deep aquifer below the water table in the shallow aquifer this is particularly important when considering that the clay layer was fully saturated when the head was at 680 m a s l the current deep aquifer head is below the base of the clay layer some indication of enhanced recharge through the creek bed is evident from the results of environmental tracer modelling particularly one bore ow3 in the railway corridor this suggests that some locations along the creek bed may act as preferential recharge locations the head difference between the shallow and the deep aquifer in the centre of the mbf pre mining created a preferred infiltration pathway to the deep aquifer the dropping groundwater levels due to dewatering reduced pressure in the deep aquifer and therefore accelerated seepage from the clay unit slow seepage resulted in older ages of infiltrated water recharge along the flanks of the clay layer would supply much younger water to the deep aquifer as it would flow faster through more permeable units parts of the deep aquifer now act as unconfined aquifers due to dewatering the general water budget calculation averaged across the entire catchment suggests that the current mine drawdown corresponds to a recharge rate of 31 mm y 1 which is the maximum predicted recharge rate at certain locations not mean value across the mbf excluding ow3 endorheic basins such as the mbf are important groundwater resources in locations of sparse surface water but at the same time they may constitute a challenge for mining in adjunct areas understanding recharge processes and mechanisms is important because the terminal nature of catchment areas may lead to the salinisation of groundwater due to evaporation tweed et al 2011 the importance of ephemeral recharge identified in the present study is consistent with global observations of arid and semiarid environments shanafield and cook 2014 sorman et al 1997 our work has highlighted that tracer type recharge estimators are effective tools for determining recharge in arid and semi arid environments when advance probability modelling is used these tools may be used more widely to understand groundwater recharge rates and sources 6 conclusion the proposed new probability mobile immobile model combining age tracers and stable isotope compositions allowed successful calculations of recharge rates in mount bruce flats mbf a small scale endorheic basin in the semiarid climate of western australia the observed differences in infiltration rates are primarily driven not by lithology but topography creating a radial gradient across the basin with recharge progressively decreasing further from the central part of the mbf the median recharge is relatively high 6 8 mm y 1 with the highest probability for recharge of 2 5 and 12 6 mm y 1 this relatively high recharge is accompanied by overall low effective mobile porosity for deeper aquifers 0 5 groundwater dating in transient systems is complex hence developing models that are capable of combining several tracer methods produces more robust outcomes than a single tracer model or direct application of age tracers a multi tracer approach is essential for cross verification of results but applying tracers directly without a mobile immobile model may lead to discrepancies in the obtained results the major limitation for comprehensive assessment as presented in this study is access to a high number of bores and observations which are usually limited outside of mining sites the model is available as open access software but further testing at different sites with various recharge rates is recommended credit authorship contribution statement grzegorz skrzypek formal analysis investigation methodology writing original draft adrian siller formal

hydrologic processes the hydrological predictions for the environment hype model s soil profile depth can vary up to four meters discretized into three soil layers here we further discretized the hype subsurface domain to accommodate up to seven soil layers to improve the representation of subsurface thermodynamics and water transfer more accurately soil moisture data from different locations across ncrb are collected from 2013 to 2017 for model calibration we use multi objective optimization moo to account for streamflow and soil moisture variability and improve the model fidelity at a

deteriorating the streamflow performance streamflow and soil moisture simulation performance improvements are statistically insignificant between the original three layer and seven layer

discretization permafrost climate change data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil moisture is an essential component of the water cycle with soil properties governing the partitioning of precipitation into infiltration surface runoff and soil storage therefore having a strong influence over the hydrologic behavior of any catchment brocca et al 2012 meng and quiring 2008 the surface runoff is governed by the wetness condition of the soil where soil moisture thresholds determine the runoff coefficient latron and gallart 2008 western and grayson 1998 particularly across the canadian prairies and pothole region with its dynamic contributing areas messing et al 2011 applications of hydrological models have been around for many decades by scientists and policymakers to understand the complex hydrological cycle including soil moisture and surface runoff leading to flooding or drought leavesley 1994 mostafaie et al 2018 singh 2018 hydrological models vary from simple conceptual lumped models to complex physically based fully distributed models kumar singh marcy 2017 in a conceptual hydrological model the partition of the incident rainfall between infiltration and surface runoff is controlled by conceptual storage which governs the soil moisture shahrban et al 2018 the hydrological predictions for the environment hype model used in this study is also a conceptual hydrological model applied widely for continental scale hydrological and water quality modeling worldwide andersson et al 2015 arheimer et al 2011 donnelly et al 2009 pechlivanidis and arheimer 2015 strömqvist et al 2012 the complexity of a model usually depends upon the data requirement the number of parameters and model assumptions michaud and sorooshian 1994 estimating parameters is often required for a reliable simulation of the water budget within the model automatic calibration is frequently executed using single objective optimization to minimize the residuals between the measured and simulated output of a specific water balance component which is streamflow most of the time although single objective calibration of model parameters can be efficient in simulating a particular aspect to which the model is being calibrated duan 2011 gan and biftu 1996 it commonly leads to misrepresentation of other water balance components of the model gudmundsson et al 2012 vrugt et al 2003 for example hydrological model parameters calibrated with streamflow observations often yield better model output for runoff but it does not necessarily improve other soil state variables such as evapotranspiration soil moisture or groundwater flow holmes et al 2020 li et al 2017 rajib et al 2016 in addition single objective automatic calibration identifies multiple parameter sets that yield similar model performance this phenomenon is termed non uniqueness or non identifiability of model parameters which are most common in complex models compared to the observation data beven 2006 beven 2009 unlike single objective optimization which gives only one optimal solution multi objective optimization moo offers multiple solutions based on the trade off between various objectives in recent studies there has been a growing trend toward moo to incorporate multiple model states or fluxes in the water cycle budhathoki et al 2020a efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 madsen 2000 yapo et al 1998 moo can be performed using two techniques the first technique assigns weightage to the individual objective function to create a composite objective function deb 2011 the second approach is based on pareto optimal solutions jung et al 2017 kamali et al 2013 moussa and chahinian 2009 for which there is no unique solution to optimize all the objectives simultaneously therefore multiple sets of parameters in the moo can lead to the model s similar acceptable performance also there are trade offs amongst the objectives which means improving one objective s performance may degrade the performance of the other objectives and vice versa madsen 2000 accurate calibration of model processes and fluxes however necessitates accurate physical representation of system dynamics in terms of water and heat transfer in the case of frozen soils for simplicity many hydrological models are set up to accommodate up to three soil layers hydrological models such as hype and variable infiltration capacity vic liang 1994 are limited to only up to two or three soil layers on the other hand models such as land dynamics model lad milly and shmakin 2002 or the modélisation environnementale communautaire surface hydrology mesh pietroniro et al 2007 use five soil layers or more likewise in seasonal and cold regions soil thermodynamics such as the freezing and thawing phenomena and subsequent infiltration occur based on the overall thickness of each soil layer and requires accurate transfer of both water and heat across a gradient therefore the discretization of the soil layer can be an essential step toward capturing the gradual process of freezing and thawing and other internal soil water dynamics such as evapotranspiration percolation and runoff from the soil layers in cold regions infiltration through frozen soil plays an essential role in influencing the soil moisture and overall soil water balance zhang et al 2010 during winter when the soil temperature drops below zero degrees celsius freezing of water in the soil pores occurs the frozen state causes the soil to become relatively impermeable limiting or restricting the infiltration and eventually leading to excess runoff flerchinger et al 2013 gray et al 2001 the infiltration capacity of soil varies depending upon the freezing and thawing conditions of the soil during the frozen state the infiltration rate can be minimal or in some cases there is no infiltration due to the formation of the ice lenses an increase or decrease in the infiltration rate can occur during the thawing period depending on the transfer of heat and moisture levels at freezing murray and gillies 1971 the primary goal of this study is to develop a well calibrated continental scale hydrological model representative of the cold region hydrology in the nelson churchill river basin with a reliable simulation of streamflow and soil moisture this is particularly important in long term future climate simulations flood and drought predictions water allocation and permafrost analysis therefore this study specifically addresses the following research questions 1 how does the moo of model parameters affect the model simulation compared to single objective optimization at a continental scale 2 what added information does the discretized hype model provide regarding process representation and model fidelity and 3 how does the discretized hype model affects the runoff generation 2 study area and data 2 1 nelson churchill river basin the study area of interest is the nelson churchill river basin ncrb with approximately 1 4 million square kilometers of coverage fig 1 the annual average precipitation of the catchment fluctuates from 315 mm in the southern region especially in the prairies to more than 850 mm in the rockies alberta and the great lakes ontario fig 2 a fig s1 shows the major rivers that flows across the catchment the ncrb catchment is characterized by freezing temperatures during winter with the average temperature ranging from 4 in the southern region to 22 in the northern part of the catchment the majority of the land cover of the northern ncrb is dominated by forest and wetlands accounting for more than 38 of the total catchment area zubrycki et al 2016 most of the settlements are in the southern region of the catchment and hence is mainly dominated by croplands with approximately 35 of the area the water bodies cover about 11 of the land use the rest of the land cover is comprised of grassland shrubland cropland barren land and urban areas in addition the landscape of ncrb is also characterized by prairie pothole regions extending from southern alberta saskatchewan and manitoba in canada to the northern states of the united states us such as north dakota south dakota minnesota and montana prairie farm rehabilitation administration pfra 1983 fig 2 b the prairie potholes are isolated in nature forming numerous internally closed basins therefore the potholes do not contribute directly to the runoff for a low return period however the potholes can expand during wet conditions connecting with adjacent potholes resulting in larger potholes mekonnen et al 2014 shook and pomeroy 2011 the potholes are connected by surface and subsurface runoff by fill and spill mechanism contributing to the downstream streamflow shaw et al 2012 therefore the catchments with prairie potholes provide a substantial challenge for hydrological modeling due to their dynamic nature ahmed et al 2020 2021 in terms of the frozen soil permafrost layers are predominant in the northern region of the catchment where the soil remains frozen throughout the year for at least two consecutive years the frozen state of the soil causes retention of surface runoff resulting in the development of numerous wetlands kurz et al 2017 smith and riseborough 2002 zhang et al 1999 the line of continuous permafrost is found near the outlets of ncrb draining to hudson bay where 90 100 landmass is under its influence the line of discontinuous permafrost 50 90 then extends to the south as far as thompson manitoba fig 2 b zubrycki et al 2016 isolated patches of permafrost 0 50 can be observed in the middle section of saskatchewan manitoba and the rockies of alberta the rest of the landmass is free of permafrost but seasonally frozen grounds can be commonly observed ncrb is highly regulated the global reservoir and dam database grand shows that the catchment has 96 reservoirs with catchment areas ranging from 6 sq km to 100 000 sq km approximately lehner et al 2011 the reservoirs are regulated for various purposes such as hydroelectricity irrigation water supply flood control and recreational facilities however only a few of these structures possess significant alternation in the streamflow downstream over longer terms some notable reservoirs of the catchment are reindeer lake lake diefenbaker lake of the woods cedar lake lake winnipeg and southern indian lake fig 1 tefs et al 2021 since a portion of the ncrb originates in the united states of america usa this is a transboundary basin subject to the boundary waters treaty between canada and the usa and therefore of international significance environment and climate change canada 2022 2 2 meteorological data hype requires precipitation and temperature input for model setup and simulation in this research the hype model has been setup for ncrb with a regional deterministic reforecast system rdrs 10 dataset of 10 km horizontal resolution gasset et al 2021 the higher resolution of rdrs is a downscaled product obtained from the global deterministic reforecast system gdrs which utilizes era interim dee et al 2011 reanalysis dataset as the initial condition the rdrs 10 dataset is chosen over its previous version rdrs 15 as the latter is available for only five years 2010 2014 at a 15 km resolution in contrast the rdrs 10 is comparatively a higher resolution dataset available for a more extended period from 2000 to 2017 across the entire north american continent making it a suitable meteorological input for transboundary and continental scale catchment studies 2 3 streamflow and soil moisture data observed time series streamflow and soil moisture data at several locations within ncrb fig 1 were available for model calibration verification soil moisture and validation streamflow daily streamflow data are obtained from the water survey of canada hydat database the gauging stations are chosen considering the spatial distribution drainage area and data availability gauging stations with drainage areas less than 3000 sq km and stations with more than 10 missing data from the time period of analysis are excluded from the study this results in the selection of 58 gauging stations across ncrb in this study we used soil moisture and temperature data from 22 soil moisture stations across ncrb primarily in the prairie regions the soil moisture data of the stations located in alberta are provided by alberta agriculture and forestry alberta environment and parks aep and environment and climate change canada eccc the soil moisture and temperature data at these locations are available daily for 20 cm and 50 cm depth the soil moisture data for carman manitoba are retrieved from risma real time in situ soil monitoring for agriculture network installed by agriculture and agri food canada the soil moisture data for brightwater creek in central saskatchewan are obtained from the kenaston network the data are available from 2007 to 2017 for the summer months may to september at 20 cm and 50 cm depth tetlock et al 2019 the soil moisture data are excluded for the winter period due to the inaccurate readings from the instruments when the soil is frozen budhathoki et al 2020a tetlock et al 2019 2 4 gleam verification data the evapotranspiration and soil moisture products from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam v3 6b satellite data are used to verify process simulation output from the original and discretized hype models at the sub basin scale the original 0 25⁰ 0 25⁰ grid data of gleam is interpolated to the sub basin scale of hype with distance weighted average remapping for the period of 2003 2017 the soil moisture from the two models is compared with the surface soil moisture from the gleam dataset and evaluated in terms of kge metrics the systematic biases between the modeled and satellite soil moisture data can exist due to the difference in the soil layer depth and characteristics reichle and koster 2004 the systematic bias can be reduced by matching the gleam data and model simulation statistics therefore to match the mean and variance of the two datasets the simulated soil moisture at 20 cm depth is re scaled against gleam soil moisture at 10 cm depth using mean standard deviation µ σ matching lópez et al 2017 also adopted this approach to evaluate the satellite based soil moisture product at different depths however the et data do not require re scaling and can be compared directly after interpolation the re scaled model surface soil moisture is then calculated as shown in eq 1 1 θ rescaled σ θ obs σ θ sim x θ sim θ sim θ obs where θ sim is the model simulated soil moisture θ obs is the gleam soil moisture observations σ θ obs and σ θ sim are the standard deviations of the gleam and model simulated soil moisture θ obs and θ sim are the means of the gleam and model simulated soil moisture the equation suggests that the satellite data are more reliable than the model produced data 3 model configuration 3 1 the hype model the hype model is chosen for this study as the model is flexible for continental scale simulation such as ncrb and provides efficient run time at continental scale since ncrb is a northern latitude catchment cold regions process such as snowmelt glacier ablation and melt lake and river ice and flow regulations are important for a process based simulation and are well integrated into the hype model lindström et al 2010 further hype model is more computationally efficient to the previously mentioned models which makes it more suitable to simulate large scale domains in a timely manner although the existing formulation of the non contributing area calculation in hype does not provide good simulation across the prairies stadnyk et al 2020 efforts are now being made to improve such phenomenon in the hype modeling framework ahmed et al 2022 moreover the integration of major reservoir regulation into the model for this region shows statistical improvement of the long term seasonal regulated outflows tefs et al 2021 rainfall and temperature inputs are distributed in hype through several storage compartments used to simulate water movement the model simulates and outputs several hydrologic process fluxes such as evapotranspiration macropore flow infiltration snow water equivalent groundwater flow soil moisture and routing in lakes and rivers in hype the watershed is divided into multiple sub models or subbasins and the output is aggregated to the sub model scale a sub basin in hype can be further divided into slcs soil type land use combination a unique combination of soil type land use type and vegetation for example the ncrb hype model has eight land use and seven soil types generating 30 unique slcs since hype model is not purely based on physical laws but of more conceptual nature most of the surface and sub surface processes requires estimation of parameters through calibration the snow accumulation and snow melt are estimated through the degree day method the potential evaporation in hype is calculated using the priestly taylor method the priestly taylor method calculates evaporation based on net downward radiation netrad the slope of the saturated vapor pressure dsatvap latent heat of vaporization and a psychrometric constant vertical infiltration of water into the soil layer in hype is controlled by rainfall and snowmelt the properties of the soil and infiltration capacity determine the amount of water entering the soil layer the actual infiltration determines the surface runoff and macropore flow in the default hype model infiltration is calculated first based on rainfall and snowmelt on the land surface and then soil water is removed in the form of runoff evaporation and macropore flow runoff from the soil zone is calculated when soil moisture exceeds the field capacity which is dependent on soil parameters in this study the current configuration of the hype model for ncrb is adopted as a sub model from the h hype hudson bay drainage basin model setup using hydro1k dem land cover data from european space agency esa climate change initiative and a soil map from harmonized world soil database tefs et al 2021 the h hype parent model has been tailored for the river systems draining into the hudson bay significantly improving the model performance by incorporating lake specific parameterizations and basin regulation stadnyk et al 2020 tefs et al 2021 the model used in this study builds upon the h hype model advances for this study region by expanding the three soil layer scheme to accommodate seven soil layers the ncrb hype model consists of 2693 subbasins with a median area of 330 km2 3 2 soil layer discretization the original hype model accommodated three soil layers fig 3 the thickness of the first soil layer being 0 2 m the second from 0 25 m to 1 5 m and the third from 0 5 m to 2 25 m depending on the soil type fig 3 a as it is assumed that a soil layer can be as thick as 1 5 m in the upper two layers constant soil properties are assumed throughout that thickness of the soil since hydrologic properties can fluctuate significantly throughout the vertical soil profile particularly at rooting depths specifying a large number of soil layers should generally yield an improved representation of the soil moisture profile and thus the vertical water flux compared to a few soil layers martinez et al 2001 the structural modification to the hype soil model includes further discretization of the upper two soil layers with the third soil layer kept constant the upper two soil layers are discretized into three sub soil layers each fig 3 b the third soil layer is not further discretized owing to a lack of observational data for ground truthing soil moisture only available up to 3 m and because the upper two layers will be more dominant controls over the thermodynamic fluxes and vertical hydrologic discretization the first soil layer up to 20 cm is divided into three sub layers of 5 cm 10 cm and 20 cm depths the upper layer should be chosen as thin as possible to evaluate soil temperature near the surface for permafrost investigations however selecting the layer too thin can lead to a large gap between the upper two layers causing an asymmetric approximation of vertical gradients between the two layers mahrt and pan 1984 the second layer is also divided into three equal layers depending upon the thickness which varies based on the soil type the derivation of each water balance component from the original hype model is modified based on the discretized soil layers in the discretized hype model to accommodate equations for extra soil layers this requires the addition of extra columns for additional soil layers in the geoclass txt input file of the hype model the modification also allows the discretized hype model to output water balance fluxes from each discretized soil layer the discretization process resulted in up to 95 additional parameters to uniquely control the fluxes to and from each soil layer compared to the original hype model in which 155 parameters are used for calibration therefore the discretized hype model is subjected to additional calibration trials 85 000 runs over the original hype model 50 000 runs the soil layer discretization can be crucial particularly in a case such as infiltration runoff where the amount of water percolation depends on the soil temperature fig 4 that said deviations of the discretized layer soil parameters from the original soil layer parameters should be small and represent small perturbations within the overall parameter space 4 calibration techniques 4 1 calibration setup calibration using streamflow and soil moisture requires multi objective optimization moo with the selection of the calibration and validation periods depending on an overlapping period of the data record for both these variables although long term data are available for streamflow the limited availability of soil moisture data restricted our calibration and validation period from 2013 to 2017 therefore three years of data 2013 2015 are used for the calibration period and two years of data 2016 2017 are used for model validation the spin up period of 2 years 2011 2012 is used to develop an initial condition as suggested by swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi developers parameters for calibration are selected based on sensitivity analyses performed by bajracharya et al 2020 and as listed in table 1 in addition to some of the soil parameters there are seven parameters dependent upon the land use type and six parameters associated with the soil type table 1 identifies three parameters multiplied by the number of ilake clusters and two parameters multiplied by the number of olake clusters that are used in the model setup and calibration lakes in hype can be categorized as either outlet lakes olakes located at the outlet of the subbasins or internal lakes ilakes located conceptually within a subbasin stadnyk et al 2020 grouped the ilakes into three regions and olakes into four regions using k means cluster analysis based on similar physiographic characteristics in the context of soil temperature the preliminary analysis shows good model simulation compared to the measured data therefore calibration of soil temperature is not required for this study 4 2 optimization algorithm in this study we implemented optimization software toolkit for research involving computational heuristics ostrich software to calibrate the model as it is flexible with different optimization algorithms with the added advantage of parallel processing matott 2017 ostrich is a model independent optimization toolkit which can be linked with any model based on the input and output text files from that model the single objective calibration was performed using dynamically dimensioned search dds tolson and shoemaker 2007 in contrast the moo was executed using pareto archived dynamically dimensioned search padds asadzadeh and tolson 2013 in a parallel processing environment parallel computation can significantly reduce the runtime and is essential for a large number of simulations for a continental scale model such as ncrb the parallel processing version of dds and padds is referred to here as pdds and para padds respectively fig 5 pdds optimization is an efficient technique to optimize a given objective function for automatically calibrating hydrological model parameters in each iteration pdds searches in the neighborhood of the current best solution for the next best possible solution and terminates the search when it reaches the user specified maximum number of simulations besides the maximum number of simulations users have the flexibility to input a perturbation value required for the pdds algorithm in ostrich the perturbation value can range from 0 to 1 with the recommended value of 0 2 used for this calibration tolson and shoemaker 2007 the perturbation value is the ratio of standard deviation to the deviation range the higher perturbation value spreads out the sample from the current best solution matott 2017 parapadds is the multi objective optimization moo technique of dds with the addition of archiving of the solutions by identifying multiple non dominated solutions the selection of a non dominated solution to be perturbed using the parapadds algorithm from the pool of non dominated solutions is based on the selection metric there are currently four selection metrics supported by parapadds 1 uniform random selection 2 crowding distance 3 estimated hyper volume contribution hvc1 and 4 exact hyper volume contribution hvc2 in this study hvc1 has been used as the selection metric for parapadds as it is more efficient than other selection metrics asadzadeh and tolson 2013 4 3 model performance evaluation the median kling gupta efficiency kge between the measured and computed streamflow across all hydrometric stations is used as an objective function for single objective optimization and moo the median is often the preferred measure of central tendency because the median is more resistant to outliers than the mean for the distributions that have outliers or are skewed additionally in the case of multi objective optimization the median kge between the measured soil moisture and computed soil moisture at 20 cm depth across all soil moisture stations is used as the second objective function although we have soil moisture data at 50 cm depth we only used soil moisture data at 20 cm depth during calibration to afford direct comparison to the original hype model in addition not all the stations have soil moisture data at 50 cm depth kge is a preferred metric compared to nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as nse tends to underestimate the variability in the simulations in contrast kge offers balanced optimization of the model bias variability and temporal fit gupta et al 2009 eq 2 for the calculation of kge is applicable for both streamflow and soil moisture there are three major components involved in the computation of the kge metric 1 correlation 2 bias and 3 variability the equation between the measured and the simulated dataset can be formulated as below to obtain kge 2 kge 1 r 1 2 σ sim σ obs 1 2 µ sim µ obs 1 2 where r is the pearson correlation coefficient between observations and simulations σ obs is the standard deviation of measured data σ sim is the standard deviation of the simulations µ obs is the measured mean and µ sim is the simulated mean the theoretical value of kge ranges from the worst to the best simulation 1 however acceptable kge values in modeling studies range from 0 41 1 the value of kge less than 0 41 is deemed unsuitable as it indicates that the mean measured value is a better indicator than the computed value knoben et al 2019 the measured value can be either streamflow or soil moisture to calculate two different objective functions ie kge streamflow and kge soil moisture 4 4 selection of solution from pareto front single objective calibration does not require the selection of a parameter solution as the optimization converges to a single solution in the case of moo multiple non dominated solutions are available depending upon the output of each objective function a non dominated solution is achieved when none of the objective functions can be improved without affecting the other one dumedah et al 2010 huang 2014 the desired solution is then selected from the pareto front such that the distance d between the chosen solution and the reference solution is minimum the minimum distance can be calculated from eq 3 below as suggested by mostafaie et al 2018 3 d f n i 1 j f i x n j 1 p where fi is the objective function and p is the euclidean distance to estimate the distances to the reference solution since we have two objective functions a median kge between the measured and simulated streamflow i e f1 kgestreamflow and b median kge between the measured soil moisture and simulated soil moisture i e f2 kgesoil moisture nj is the reference solution of the optimization problem which is 1 for the best possible achievable kge solution and p is 2 which is used to estimate the euclidean distance to the reference solution 5 results 5 1 analysis of soil layer discretization before model calibration we compare the soil moisture simulations from the two models three and seven layer discretization at various soil moisture stations before calibration to assess the impact of discretization without the influence of calibration methodology fig 6 fig 7 fig s2 the default parameters of hype at 20 cm depth are used across additional layers of the model soil moisture simulated by both models using default hype parameters indicates an overestimation of soil moisture at all sites compared to the observed dataset the overestimation of soil moisture volume is more significant in the discretized hype model than in the original hype simulation which is expected given the parameters were selected from and previously optimized for the original hype model measured soil moisture volume across all stations varies from 18 mm to 85 mm depending upon the location with simulated soil moisture volume ranging from 37 mm to 116 mm for the original hype model and 42 124 mm for the discretized model although the discretized model overestimates soil moisture by 22 on average compared to the original model both models replicate similar patterning and timing of seasonal soil moisture content overestimation by the discretized seven layer model indicates that the increased discretization increases the retention of water within the upper soil structure relative to the original model which is caused by the same default percolation parameters being used in both models for example as the model is discretized into finer depths using the same percolation parameter for smaller soil depths allows the model to percolate more water into the soil layer below 5 2 analysis of soil layer discretization after model calibration the seven layer discretized hype model is compared to the original three layer hype model following calibration across the ncrb domain which is essential to justify the importance of soil layer discretization spatial analysis of the kge streamflow discharge between the original model and the discretized model indicates similar performance between single objective optimization fig 8 a fig 8 b and multi objective optimization moo methodologies fig 8 c fig 8 d most stations perform poorly in the non contributing areas nca region of the prairies also commonly referred to as the prairie pothole region with low or even negative kge scores the representation of the spill and runoff process from the prairie potholes can be challenging in a conceptual model like hype leading to a generally poor simulation of runoff generation and hence streamflow this issue has been the focus of several studies where models struggle to mimic the actual representation of the prairies fill and spill dynamics ahmed et al 2020 granger et al 1984 muhammad et al 2018 unduche et al 2018 ncas are incorporated into hype using the parameterization technique a volume based correction using a runoff threshold stadnyk et al 2020 although this approach reasonably improved runoff simulation across this region stadnyk et al 2020 recommend applying improved algorithms based on the dynamic fill and spill runoff generation process to have better streamflow simulation at a larger scale however the discretized hype model performs satisfactorily near the basin outlet compared to the original hype model especially at the churchill river outlet where there are few upstream nca regions the moo of the discretized model demonstrates improvement at the churchill river above red head rapids wsc id 06fd001 with a kge score of 0 80 compared to the original model simulation 0 71 fig 9 a evaluation of the time series simulation at this station indicates the discretized model is better able to capture peak flow events especially during the 2014 and 2017 floods in the context of nelson river at long spruce generation station the measured streamflow fluctuates due to the heavily fragmented and regulated lower nelson river fig 9 b the discretized hype model also performs better here with a kge score of 0 68 relative to the original model 0 65 statistically insignificant under single objective calibration the discretized model does not indicate any improvement over the original model with both models resulting in median kge scores of approximately 0 66 during the calibration period fig 10 a and 0 45 during validation fig 10 b when moo is used the discretized model shows slight but insignificant improvement for both streamflow and soil moisture relative to the original model although the improvements remain statistically insignificant the discretized hype model shows improvement of kge score by 0 02 and 0 023 calibration for streamflow and soil moisture evaluation respectively the improvements in model performance can be found to be statistically insignificant as the paired t test shows p values of 0 98 0 05 and 0 26 0 05 for streamflow and soil moisture respectively however the interquartile range iqr for discretized hype model is reduced from 0 35 to 0 29 fig 10 c also when comparing the single objective soil moisture calibration and validation results to those obtained using moo improvements are statistically significant with noticeable reductions in the iqr for both the three layer and seven layer models 5 3 impact of process based multi objective optimization both versions of hype three and seven soil layer discretization are subjected to moo measuring model performance against both observed streamflow and soil moisture data fig 11 demonstrates the trade off between maximizing kge for streamflow and soil moisture 20 cm performance that occurs the selected optimal solution red dot on fig 11 from the non dominated solutions is the nearest solution to the reference point in the objective space i e kgestreamflow 1 kgesoil moisture 1 with other non dominated solutions varying from kge of 0 5 0 65 for soil moisture and between 0 61 and 0 66 for streamflow the resulting pareto front from the two models is very similar in terms of range for the original three layer hype model the single objective calibration results in more optimal streamflow performance median kge of 0 66 relative to the median moo kge of 0 63 though the difference is statistically insignificant this is not however the case for the discretized seven layer model which results in a median kge just below 0 66 which appears to maintain better streamflow performance despite optimizing an additional objective previous studies indicate that moo may be either beneficial or detrimental to streamflow gauge performance compared to single objective calibration depending on the parameterization and model setup studies conducted by chen et al 2017 and werth et al 2009 report improvement in streamflow simulation due to moo while the studies from budhathoki et al 2020a and yang et al 2019 indicate no improvement in streamflow simulation this can be expected for a multi objective optimization when the precipitation is properly partitioned among different state variables and fluxes budhathoki et al 2020a b and would largely depend on the model structure s ability to accurately represent this partitioning all studies however agree that using moo significantly improves the simulation of the secondary objective which in this study is the soil moisture most of the simulated soil moisture profiles mimic the observed dataset during the unfrozen state after moo generally from may to october fig 12 fig 13 fig s3 with half the soil moisture stations having a kge of 0 64 and up to 0 79 soil moisture at some of the stations such as stettler fig 13 f and st albert fig 13 d in alberta are poorly simulated with the volumetric water content vwc being significantly underestimated compared to the observed dataset with pbias of approximately 40 during the calibration period table 2 conversely the soil moisture at carman fig 13 h in manitoba is generally overestimated soil types and characteristics can be very localized and heterogeneous and due to the resolution of the land use and soil maps used to construct the model i e the hype slcs the model is likely misrepresenting the soil texture in locales surrounding these particular gauges although the soil data is 300 m resolution fine resolution the site specific soil observation can be different at few locations also this fine resolution will not be able to capture the actual soil texture heterogeneity overall the calibrated models using moo effectively captures soil moisture observed profiles the original hype model increases the median kge of soil moisture from 0 22 to 0 64 and the discretized hype model median kge for soil moisture increases from 0 20 to 0 65 these results demonstrate that although the single objective optimization achieves adequate streamflow performance the soil moisture component is in fact poorly simulated in the context of the soil temperature both models perform equally well across ncrb at 20 cm depth fig s4 regardless of the season soil temperature at the soil moisture observation stations varies from 15 ⁰c during the winter season to 25 ⁰c during the summer season at the 20 cm depth it should be noted that the soil moisture stations are located in the southern region of the catchment where the air temperature is relatively warmer compared to the northern extent of the basin however unlike soil moisture which is challenging to verify in the model during the winter season due to the presence of both liquid and solid water content the hype model can accurately simulate soil temperature throughout the frozen soil state this is an important finding for future permafrost studies in response to climate change for which soil temperature simulation and feedback will be necessary 5 4 impact on runoff generation the seven layer discretized hype model shows only minor simulation performance improvement over the original hype model however the moo results offer insight into potential model fidelity improvements at a hydrologic process level the water balance components simulated by the two models reveal significant differences in runoff generation component contributions the logarithmic radar diagram suggests changes in the infiltration and evapotranspiration components which are both slightly higher fractions of the water budget in the case of the seven layer discretization of hype fig s5 evapotranspiration et is the most significant contributor to the prairie regional water balance accounting for more than 70 of total precipitation several studies have reported the annual et to be around 360 400 mm under non drought conditions in this region armstrong et al 2015 martel et al 2018 wang et al 2013 based on the optimal moo solution the original hype model estimates the average et loss to be about 340 mm across the entire domain whereas the discretized hype model results in approximately 380 mm et or 12 greater water loss this is consistent with the enhanced capacity of the discretized model to allow more water to infiltrate into the soil layers contributing to higher evapotranspiration potential from water stored in the soils we further evaluate the spatial performance of the two models for et simulation using the gleam reanalysis dataset over the entire ncrb results show that the kge values from the seven layer discretized hype model are notably improved relative to gleam across most sub basins within the prairie region fig 14 however differences in other water balance components such as the snow water equivalent and soil storage deficit results not shown are relatively small among the two model discretization schemes therefore although there is no significant difference in streamflow and soil moisture performance characteristics between the two discretized models the internal response to soil moisture i e et loss does demonstrate substantial improvement it should be noted that since the rescaled soil moisture at 20 cm depth is obtained by matching the mean and median from the gleam observations the kge values shown in fig 14 reflects on the correlation between the two datasets we similarly compare the spatial performance of both model discretization schemes in terms of their surface soil moisture representation relative to gleam data across the ncrb using the kge metric although both models show similar performance when evaluated at point ground surface observation stations the seven layer discretized hype model demonstrates improved spatial performance relative to the original hype model fig 14 d improvements are particularly notable in the prairie pothole region and across the northern permafrost impacted portion of the basin 6 discussion results indicate that moo effectively addresses the issue of poor model fidelity resulting from single objective optimization which deteriorates the simulation quality of soil moisture in the process of achieving adequate streamflow performance moo significantly improves the soil moisture simulation with negligible impact on the calibration of the streamflow soil moisture at the 20 cm depth in particular shows significant improvement in both timing and magnitude following multi objective optimization fig 12 fig 13 fig s3 at most soil moisture stations errors tend to be more significant either at the beginning of the spring season when the snow and frozen soil begin to melt or during the fall season the spring and fall seasons are thermodynamically more complex owing to soil and surface water phase change specifically the freeze thaw cycle for the ncrb since hype is a semi conceptual model with temperature index methods it lacks the specificity of thermodynamic principles to reliably mimic the real world energy exchange occurring within these processes as phase change occurs from one state to another there may also be some observational error inherent in the measured data at these times of the year when soil moisture probes capture only the liquid not solid water content residing within the soils budhathoki et al 2020a b in addition some soil moisture stations are still poorly represented after moo with poor performance correlated with the discrepancy between the soil type classification in the hype model based on the soil use map and localized soil type at those stations the soil type at any location can also vary both horizontally and vertically at the st albert location soils are described as medium to moderately fine texture soil ranging from fine to fine textured at a depth of 0 6 1 5 m below the surface and medium texture below 1 5 m depth knapik and veauvy 1975 fine texture soils typically have a high proportion of silt and clay and therefore a higher water holding capacity than medium and coarse textured soils campos et al 2011 in hype the soil classification impacting the st albert gauge i e the subbasin the gauge resides in is classified as medium soil texture resulting in faster drainage of soils within the subbasin than would be observed at the gauge the soils underlying the carman station are predominately loamy sand a fine textured soil with low water holding capacity and fast drainage rates mills and haluschak 1993 however the soil classification in hype characterizes the sub basin soil type under medium soil texture which can range from sandy loam to silty loam table 2 the medium textured soil tends to drain the soils comparatively at slower rate compared to the fine textured soil therefore the simulated soil moisture at carman station is higher compared to the measured dataset although the cci land cover soil classification used in this study is of 300 m resolution the land cover map is not an accurate representation of the ground observations for some of the soil moisture stations therefore it is suggested to update the soil classification based on the ground observations which could be beneficial for the improvement of the model calibration the benefit of moo is likely most apparent across the prairie region where complex runoff generation processes exist and hydrologic models often struggle to simulate streamflow adequately runoff generation from the prairies is one of the complex features of ncrb as these basins are highly dynamic and their contributing areas change depending on the antecedent moisture conditions of the basin shook et al 2021 runoff generation from the prairies and the amount of water infiltrating into the soil layers are governed by the connectivity of the small depressions through the fill and spill process mechanism accurately simulating channel dis connectivity and streamflow in this region is essential for flood and drought monitoring whereas accurate soil moisture estimation is crucial in regional crop forecasts and crop rotation akinremi et al 1996 mcginn and shepherd 2003 as well as long term estimation of total water loss for example when soils across the canadian prairies are under severe water stress due to low precipitation and higher evaporation demand farmers may choose to have a two year fixed rotation of fallow and spring wheat campbell et al 1987 in recent decades however fallow land across the prairies has been rapidly converting into continuous annual cropping increasing the evapotranspiration from the croplands and resulting in increased water loss and severity of drought in these regions akther and azam 2019 soil moisture estimation in this region is an essential tool to address such long term drought mitigation and management issues including sustainable land practices based on continental scale modeling under future climates several studies and climate models project an increase in precipitation and temperature for the northern hemisphere guo et al 2019 koenigk et al 2020 in our study we evaluated the two discretization schemes for the hype model only for a shorter duration due to limitations of overlapping observation availability for streamflow and soil moisture data verification against gleam reanalyses for evapotranspiration and soil moisture suggests more significant shifts in internal water balance result from the enhanced discretization scheme particularly for evaporative water loss in the context of climate change small increases in prairie precipitation relative to larger increases in air temperature are projected to enhance water loss across the prairies macdonald et al 2018 this suggests that over the longer term differences between the two models are likely to become more pronounced due to shifting inflow to water loss partitioning in subbasins particularly in the prairie region gleam data also offer insight that meaningful differences in soil moisture may be occurring in permafrost regions northern ncrb where simulation of soil temperature and moisture components will be more critical for climate change assessment of permafrost thaw our results suggest the seven layer discretized model does not degrade streamflow simulation quality despite the added parameter complexity of the enhanced discretization scheme moreover calibration using multiple objectives incorporating soil moisture requires the model calibration to meet additional criteria but does not adversely impact the streamflow performance in addition there is not much difference in computation time required between single objective and multi objective optimization these are important considerations since the primary function of the model is the prediction of streamflow though streamflow performance alone cannot justify the added model complexity we argue the seven layer model can be beneficial in three ways 1 since soil moisture simulation performance shows meaningful improvement the reliability of the discretized model is greater for long term simulation in analysing the relationship among changing water balance components e g climate change studies 2 the seven layer discretized model better captures simulated peak flows making it a better choice for flood simulation and flood frequency analysis and 3 since the discretized model operates at finer vertical discretization the model is of benefit to analyse the impact of changing climate on soil temperature and permafrost process based calibration plays an important role in improving model fidelity which is likely to be even more significant over long term large scale simulations and ungauged catchments here we have improved model fidelity by implementing process based calibration using additional observation data and improving model structure by discretizing three soil layers into seven soil layers to improve structural representation of the model in previous studies process based calibration has been limited to smaller scale catchments in the prairies budhathoki et al 2020a b due to which the application of such models has been confined to small physiographical and topographical regions to facilitate computational efficiency this study particularly emphasizes process based calibration at the continent scale nelson churchill river basin expanding across different hydroclimatic ecozones and land features such a model can be resourceful in developing an overview of the actual water resources status and assist in identifying regions where an in depth assessment may be required process based continental hydrological model is not only important in estimating the quantity of freshwater supply across the study domain stadnyk and déry 2021 but it is also vital in estimating several other components such as snow water equivalent swe soil moisture and evapotranspiration et 7 summary and conclusions calibration of hydrological model parameters is crucial to ensure that the model captures real world hydrological processes well producing reliable estimates of the system fluxes furthermore observation data play a pivotal role in tuning the model parameters as model simulations are compared to these datasets in performance evaluation this study implemented a process based calibration for hydrological simulation in two phases in the first phase the upper two soil layers of the model are discretized into finer depth increments such that the model simulates sub surface soil water balance components within each of the finer discretized soil layers in the second phase multi objective optimization moo of both the coarser and finer discretized versions of the hype model is implemented for streamflow and soil moisture datasets across the hydrologically complex ncrb domain although single objective optimization effectively simulates streamflow the sub surface soil moisture component is poorly represented in the model when single objective calibration to streamflow is used soil moisture is overestimated by up to 30 compared to the observed point data fig 6 fig 7 moo can offer improvements to simulating the soil moisture component at most stations improving the median kge from 0 21 to 0 60 with little trade off in streamflow performance however some soil moisture stations still remain poorly simulated within both model discretization schemes poor performance in these cases is linked directly with differences in the soil classification in the model hype and observational evidence of soil textures at the gauge site local scale heterogeneity the discretized hype model provides minimal improvement over the original hype model however the seven layer discretization improves the simulation of sub surface water balance partitioning specifically the evapotranspiration losses relative to gleam reanalysis data the discretization of soil layers into finer depths allows the model to infiltrate more water into subsurface soil layers which increases the amount of water available for evapotranspiration from the upper layers spatial evaluation of soil moisture against gleam data suggests the seven layer discretization better represents surface soil moisture which is essential for long term water balance and agricultural water management studies despite promising results and future opportunities with the calibrated model this study has some limitations the first limitation remains the lack of soil moisture data available in the northern portion of the catchment as most of the soil moisture stations are in the southern region the calibration of model soil moisture parameters is biased towards the physiographic characteristics of the southern portion of the basin the second limitation of this study is the inability to validate frozen soil moisture simulations against observed data this is due to hype s inability to separate the liquid and solid water content in the soil to directly compare with measurements of liquid water content only taken by the soil probes regardless of the above limitations the calibrated seven layer discretized hype model can be useful for several future applications i understanding the relationship between surface and subsurface components and the implications of climate change on their relative partitioning ii projection of permafrost degradation based on discretized soil temperature and iii agriculture water use and management studies across the prairie region particularly in water loss quantification the discretized hype model generates output at each soil layer allowing the model user flexibility in analyzing sub surface component contributions and their relationship to changing soil temperature and moisture owing to the model s continental scale domain this offers the opportunity to examine process level changes on a regional

7656,study region nelson churchill river basin ncrb canada and usa study focus soil temperature and moisture are essential variables that fluctuate based on soil depth controlling several sub surface hydrologic processes the hydrological predictions for the environment hype model s soil profile depth can vary up to four meters discretized into three soil layers here we further discretized the hype subsurface domain to accommodate up to seven soil layers to improve the representation of subsurface thermodynamics and water transfer more accurately soil moisture data from different locations across ncrb are collected from 2013 to 2017 for model calibration we use multi objective optimization moo to account for streamflow and soil moisture variability and improve the model fidelity at a continental scale new hydrological insights our study demonstrates that moo significantly improves soil moisture simulation from the median kling gupta efficiency kge of 0 21 0 66 without deteriorating the streamflow performance streamflow and soil moisture simulation performance improvements are statistically insignificant between the original three layer and seven layer discretization of hype however the finer discretization model shows improved simulation in sub surface components such as the evapotranspiration when verified against reanalysis products indicating a 12 underestimation of evapotranspiration from the three layer hype model the improvement of the discretized hype model and simulating the soil temperature at finer vertical resolution makes it a prospective model for permafrost identification and climate change analysis graphical abstract ga1 keywords hydrological model nelson churchill river basin multi objective optimization soil layer discretization permafrost climate change data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil moisture is an essential component of the water cycle with soil properties governing the partitioning of precipitation into infiltration surface runoff and soil storage therefore having a strong influence over the hydrologic behavior of any catchment brocca et al 2012 meng and quiring 2008 the surface runoff is governed by the wetness condition of the soil where soil moisture thresholds determine the runoff coefficient latron and gallart 2008 western and grayson 1998 particularly across the canadian prairies and pothole region with its dynamic contributing areas messing et al 2011 applications of hydrological models have been around for many decades by scientists and policymakers to understand the complex hydrological cycle including soil moisture and surface runoff leading to flooding or drought leavesley 1994 mostafaie et al 2018 singh 2018 hydrological models vary from simple conceptual lumped models to complex physically based fully distributed models kumar singh marcy 2017 in a conceptual hydrological model the partition of the incident rainfall between infiltration and surface runoff is controlled by conceptual storage which governs the soil moisture shahrban et al 2018 the hydrological predictions for the environment hype model used in this study is also a conceptual hydrological model applied widely for continental scale hydrological and water quality modeling worldwide andersson et al 2015 arheimer et al 2011 donnelly et al 2009 pechlivanidis and arheimer 2015 strömqvist et al 2012 the complexity of a model usually depends upon the data requirement the number of parameters and model assumptions michaud and sorooshian 1994 estimating parameters is often required for a reliable simulation of the water budget within the model automatic calibration is frequently executed using single objective optimization to minimize the residuals between the measured and simulated output of a specific water balance component which is streamflow most of the time although single objective calibration of model parameters can be efficient in simulating a particular aspect to which the model is being calibrated duan 2011 gan and biftu 1996 it commonly leads to misrepresentation of other water balance components of the model gudmundsson et al 2012 vrugt et al 2003 for example hydrological model parameters calibrated with streamflow observations often yield better model output for runoff but it does not necessarily improve other soil state variables such as evapotranspiration soil moisture or groundwater flow holmes et al 2020 li et al 2017 rajib et al 2016 in addition single objective automatic calibration identifies multiple parameter sets that yield similar model performance this phenomenon is termed non uniqueness or non identifiability of model parameters which are most common in complex models compared to the observation data beven 2006 beven 2009 unlike single objective optimization which gives only one optimal solution multi objective optimization moo offers multiple solutions based on the trade off between various objectives in recent studies there has been a growing trend toward moo to incorporate multiple model states or fluxes in the water cycle budhathoki et al 2020a efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 madsen 2000 yapo et al 1998 moo can be performed using two techniques the first technique assigns weightage to the individual objective function to create a composite objective function deb 2011 the second approach is based on pareto optimal solutions jung et al 2017 kamali et al 2013 moussa and chahinian 2009 for which there is no unique solution to optimize all the objectives simultaneously therefore multiple sets of parameters in the moo can lead to the model s similar acceptable performance also there are trade offs amongst the objectives which means improving one objective s performance may degrade the performance of the other objectives and vice versa madsen 2000 accurate calibration of model processes and fluxes however necessitates accurate physical representation of system dynamics in terms of water and heat transfer in the case of frozen soils for simplicity many hydrological models are set up to accommodate up to three soil layers hydrological models such as hype and variable infiltration capacity vic liang 1994 are limited to only up to two or three soil layers on the other hand models such as land dynamics model lad milly and shmakin 2002 or the modélisation environnementale communautaire surface hydrology mesh pietroniro et al 2007 use five soil layers or more likewise in seasonal and cold regions soil thermodynamics such as the freezing and thawing phenomena and subsequent infiltration occur based on the overall thickness of each soil layer and requires accurate transfer of both water and heat across a gradient therefore the discretization of the soil layer can be an essential step toward capturing the gradual process of freezing and thawing and other internal soil water dynamics such as evapotranspiration percolation and runoff from the soil layers in cold regions infiltration through frozen soil plays an essential role in influencing the soil moisture and overall soil water balance zhang et al 2010 during winter when the soil temperature drops below zero degrees celsius freezing of water in the soil pores occurs the frozen state causes the soil to become relatively impermeable limiting or restricting the infiltration and eventually leading to excess runoff flerchinger et al 2013 gray et al 2001 the infiltration capacity of soil varies depending upon the freezing and thawing conditions of the soil during the frozen state the infiltration rate can be minimal or in some cases there is no infiltration due to the formation of the ice lenses an increase or decrease in the infiltration rate can occur during the thawing period depending on the transfer of heat and moisture levels at freezing murray and gillies 1971 the primary goal of this study is to develop a well calibrated continental scale hydrological model representative of the cold region hydrology in the nelson churchill river basin with a reliable simulation of streamflow and soil moisture this is particularly important in long term future climate simulations flood and drought predictions water allocation and permafrost analysis therefore this study specifically addresses the following research questions 1 how does the moo of model parameters affect the model simulation compared to single objective optimization at a continental scale 2 what added information does the discretized hype model provide regarding process representation and model fidelity and 3 how does the discretized hype model affects the runoff generation 2 study area and data 2 1 nelson churchill river basin the study area of interest is the nelson churchill river basin ncrb with approximately 1 4 million square kilometers of coverage fig 1 the annual average precipitation of the catchment fluctuates from 315 mm in the southern region especially in the prairies to more than 850 mm in the rockies alberta and the great lakes ontario fig 2 a fig s1 shows the major rivers that flows across the catchment the ncrb catchment is characterized by freezing temperatures during winter with the average temperature ranging from 4 in the southern region to 22 in the northern part of the catchment the majority of the land cover of the northern ncrb is dominated by forest and wetlands accounting for more than 38 of the total catchment area zubrycki et al 2016 most of the settlements are in the southern region of the catchment and hence is mainly dominated by croplands with approximately 35 of the area the water bodies cover about 11 of the land use the rest of the land cover is comprised of grassland shrubland cropland barren land and urban areas in addition the landscape of ncrb is also characterized by prairie pothole regions extending from southern alberta saskatchewan and manitoba in canada to the northern states of the united states us such as north dakota south dakota minnesota and montana prairie farm rehabilitation administration pfra 1983 fig 2 b the prairie potholes are isolated in nature forming numerous internally closed basins therefore the potholes do not contribute directly to the runoff for a low return period however the potholes can expand during wet conditions connecting with adjacent potholes resulting in larger potholes mekonnen et al 2014 shook and pomeroy 2011 the potholes are connected by surface and subsurface runoff by fill and spill mechanism contributing to the downstream streamflow shaw et al 2012 therefore the catchments with prairie potholes provide a substantial challenge for hydrological modeling due to their dynamic nature ahmed et al 2020 2021 in terms of the frozen soil permafrost layers are predominant in the northern region of the catchment where the soil remains frozen throughout the year for at least two consecutive years the frozen state of the soil causes retention of surface runoff resulting in the development of numerous wetlands kurz et al 2017 smith and riseborough 2002 zhang et al 1999 the line of continuous permafrost is found near the outlets of ncrb draining to hudson bay where 90 100 landmass is under its influence the line of discontinuous permafrost 50 90 then extends to the south as far as thompson manitoba fig 2 b zubrycki et al 2016 isolated patches of permafrost 0 50 can be observed in the middle section of saskatchewan manitoba and the rockies of alberta the rest of the landmass is free of permafrost but seasonally frozen grounds can be commonly observed ncrb is highly regulated the global reservoir and dam database grand shows that the catchment has 96 reservoirs with catchment areas ranging from 6 sq km to 100 000 sq km approximately lehner et al 2011 the reservoirs are regulated for various purposes such as hydroelectricity irrigation water supply flood control and recreational facilities however only a few of these structures possess significant alternation in the streamflow downstream over longer terms some notable reservoirs of the catchment are reindeer lake lake diefenbaker lake of the woods cedar lake lake winnipeg and southern indian lake fig 1 tefs et al 2021 since a portion of the ncrb originates in the united states of america usa this is a transboundary basin subject to the boundary waters treaty between canada and the usa and therefore of international significance environment and climate change canada 2022 2 2 meteorological data hype requires precipitation and temperature input for model setup and simulation in this research the hype model has been setup for ncrb with a regional deterministic reforecast system rdrs 10 dataset of 10 km horizontal resolution gasset et al 2021 the higher resolution of rdrs is a downscaled product obtained from the global deterministic reforecast system gdrs which utilizes era interim dee et al 2011 reanalysis dataset as the initial condition the rdrs 10 dataset is chosen over its previous version rdrs 15 as the latter is available for only five years 2010 2014 at a 15 km resolution in contrast the rdrs 10 is comparatively a higher resolution dataset available for a more extended period from 2000 to 2017 across the entire north american continent making it a suitable meteorological input for transboundary and continental scale catchment studies 2 3 streamflow and soil moisture data observed time series streamflow and soil moisture data at several locations within ncrb fig 1 were available for model calibration verification soil moisture and validation streamflow daily streamflow data are obtained from the water survey of canada hydat database the gauging stations are chosen considering the spatial distribution drainage area and data availability gauging stations with drainage areas less than 3000 sq km and stations with more than 10 missing data from the time period of analysis are excluded from the study this results in the selection of 58 gauging stations across ncrb in this study we used soil moisture and temperature data from 22 soil moisture stations across ncrb primarily in the prairie regions the soil moisture data of the stations located in alberta are provided by alberta agriculture and forestry alberta environment and parks aep and environment and climate change canada eccc the soil moisture and temperature data at these locations are available daily for 20 cm and 50 cm depth the soil moisture data for carman manitoba are retrieved from risma real time in situ soil monitoring for agriculture network installed by agriculture and agri food canada the soil moisture data for brightwater creek in central saskatchewan are obtained from the kenaston network the data are available from 2007 to 2017 for the summer months may to september at 20 cm and 50 cm depth tetlock et al 2019 the soil moisture data are excluded for the winter period due to the inaccurate readings from the instruments when the soil is frozen budhathoki et al 2020a tetlock et al 2019 2 4 gleam verification data the evapotranspiration and soil moisture products from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam v3 6b satellite data are used to verify process simulation output from the original and discretized hype models at the sub basin scale the original 0 25⁰ 0 25⁰ grid data of gleam is interpolated to the sub basin scale of hype with distance weighted average remapping for the period of 2003 2017 the soil moisture from the two models is compared with the surface soil moisture from the gleam dataset and evaluated in terms of kge metrics the systematic biases between the modeled and satellite soil moisture data can exist due to the difference in the soil layer depth and characteristics reichle and koster 2004 the systematic bias can be reduced by matching the gleam data and model simulation statistics therefore to match the mean and variance of the two datasets the simulated soil moisture at 20 cm depth is re scaled against gleam soil moisture at 10 cm depth using mean standard deviation µ σ matching lópez et al 2017 also adopted this approach to evaluate the satellite based soil moisture product at different depths however the et data do not require re scaling and can be compared directly after interpolation the re scaled model surface soil moisture is then calculated as shown in eq 1 1 θ rescaled σ θ obs σ θ sim x θ sim θ sim θ obs where θ sim is the model simulated soil moisture θ obs is the gleam soil moisture observations σ θ obs and σ θ sim are the standard deviations of the gleam and model simulated soil moisture θ obs and θ sim are the means of the gleam and model simulated soil moisture the equation suggests that the satellite data are more reliable than the model produced data 3 model configuration 3 1 the hype model the hype model is chosen for this study as the model is flexible for continental scale simulation such as ncrb and provides efficient run time at continental scale since ncrb is a northern latitude catchment cold regions process such as snowmelt glacier ablation and melt lake and river ice and flow regulations are important for a process based simulation and are well integrated into the hype model lindström et al 2010 further hype model is more computationally efficient to the previously mentioned models which makes it more suitable to simulate large scale domains in a timely manner although the existing formulation of the non contributing area calculation in hype does not provide good simulation across the prairies stadnyk et al 2020 efforts are now being made to improve such phenomenon in the hype modeling framework ahmed et al 2022 moreover the integration of major reservoir regulation into the model for this region shows statistical improvement of the long term seasonal regulated outflows tefs et al 2021 rainfall and temperature inputs are distributed in hype through several storage compartments used to simulate water movement the model simulates and outputs several hydrologic process fluxes such as evapotranspiration macropore flow infiltration snow water equivalent groundwater flow soil moisture and routing in lakes and rivers in hype the watershed is divided into multiple sub models or subbasins and the output is aggregated to the sub model scale a sub basin in hype can be further divided into slcs soil type land use combination a unique combination of soil type land use type and vegetation for example the ncrb hype model has eight land use and seven soil types generating 30 unique slcs since hype model is not purely based on physical laws but of more conceptual nature most of the surface and sub surface processes requires estimation of parameters through calibration the snow accumulation and snow melt are estimated through the degree day method the potential evaporation in hype is calculated using the priestly taylor method the priestly taylor method calculates evaporation based on net downward radiation netrad the slope of the saturated vapor pressure dsatvap latent heat of vaporization and a psychrometric constant vertical infiltration of water into the soil layer in hype is controlled by rainfall and snowmelt the properties of the soil and infiltration capacity determine the amount of water entering the soil layer the actual infiltration determines the surface runoff and macropore flow in the default hype model infiltration is calculated first based on rainfall and snowmelt on the land surface and then soil water is removed in the form of runoff evaporation and macropore flow runoff from the soil zone is calculated when soil moisture exceeds the field capacity which is dependent on soil parameters in this study the current configuration of the hype model for ncrb is adopted as a sub model from the h hype hudson bay drainage basin model setup using hydro1k dem land cover data from european space agency esa climate change initiative and a soil map from harmonized world soil database tefs et al 2021 the h hype parent model has been tailored for the river systems draining into the hudson bay significantly improving the model performance by incorporating lake specific parameterizations and basin regulation stadnyk et al 2020 tefs et al 2021 the model used in this study builds upon the h hype model advances for this study region by expanding the three soil layer scheme to accommodate seven soil layers the ncrb hype model consists of 2693 subbasins with a median area of 330 km2 3 2 soil layer discretization the original hype model accommodated three soil layers fig 3 the thickness of the first soil layer being 0 2 m the second from 0 25 m to 1 5 m and the third from 0 5 m to 2 25 m depending on the soil type fig 3 a as it is assumed that a soil layer can be as thick as 1 5 m in the upper two layers constant soil properties are assumed throughout that thickness of the soil since hydrologic properties can fluctuate significantly throughout the vertical soil profile particularly at rooting depths specifying a large number of soil layers should generally yield an improved representation of the soil moisture profile and thus the vertical water flux compared to a few soil layers martinez et al 2001 the structural modification to the hype soil model includes further discretization of the upper two soil layers with the third soil layer kept constant the upper two soil layers are discretized into three sub soil layers each fig 3 b the third soil layer is not further discretized owing to a lack of observational data for ground truthing soil moisture only available up to 3 m and because the upper two layers will be more dominant controls over the thermodynamic fluxes and vertical hydrologic discretization the first soil layer up to 20 cm is divided into three sub layers of 5 cm 10 cm and 20 cm depths the upper layer should be chosen as thin as possible to evaluate soil temperature near the surface for permafrost investigations however selecting the layer too thin can lead to a large gap between the upper two layers causing an asymmetric approximation of vertical gradients between the two layers mahrt and pan 1984 the second layer is also divided into three equal layers depending upon the thickness which varies based on the soil type the derivation of each water balance component from the original hype model is modified based on the discretized soil layers in the discretized hype model to accommodate equations for extra soil layers this requires the addition of extra columns for additional soil layers in the geoclass txt input file of the hype model the modification also allows the discretized hype model to output water balance fluxes from each discretized soil layer the discretization process resulted in up to 95 additional parameters to uniquely control the fluxes to and from each soil layer compared to the original hype model in which 155 parameters are used for calibration therefore the discretized hype model is subjected to additional calibration trials 85 000 runs over the original hype model 50 000 runs the soil layer discretization can be crucial particularly in a case such as infiltration runoff where the amount of water percolation depends on the soil temperature fig 4 that said deviations of the discretized layer soil parameters from the original soil layer parameters should be small and represent small perturbations within the overall parameter space 4 calibration techniques 4 1 calibration setup calibration using streamflow and soil moisture requires multi objective optimization moo with the selection of the calibration and validation periods depending on an overlapping period of the data record for both these variables although long term data are available for streamflow the limited availability of soil moisture data restricted our calibration and validation period from 2013 to 2017 therefore three years of data 2013 2015 are used for the calibration period and two years of data 2016 2017 are used for model validation the spin up period of 2 years 2011 2012 is used to develop an initial condition as suggested by swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi developers parameters for calibration are selected based on sensitivity analyses performed by bajracharya et al 2020 and as listed in table 1 in addition to some of the soil parameters there are seven parameters dependent upon the land use type and six parameters associated with the soil type table 1 identifies three parameters multiplied by the number of ilake clusters and two parameters multiplied by the number of olake clusters that are used in the model setup and calibration lakes in hype can be categorized as either outlet lakes olakes located at the outlet of the subbasins or internal lakes ilakes located conceptually within a subbasin stadnyk et al 2020 grouped the ilakes into three regions and olakes into four regions using k means cluster analysis based on similar physiographic characteristics in the context of soil temperature the preliminary analysis shows good model simulation compared to the measured data therefore calibration of soil temperature is not required for this study 4 2 optimization algorithm in this study we implemented optimization software toolkit for research involving computational heuristics ostrich software to calibrate the model as it is flexible with different optimization algorithms with the added advantage of parallel processing matott 2017 ostrich is a model independent optimization toolkit which can be linked with any model based on the input and output text files from that model the single objective calibration was performed using dynamically dimensioned search dds tolson and shoemaker 2007 in contrast the moo was executed using pareto archived dynamically dimensioned search padds asadzadeh and tolson 2013 in a parallel processing environment parallel computation can significantly reduce the runtime and is essential for a large number of simulations for a continental scale model such as ncrb the parallel processing version of dds and padds is referred to here as pdds and para padds respectively fig 5 pdds optimization is an efficient technique to optimize a given objective function for automatically calibrating hydrological model parameters in each iteration pdds searches in the neighborhood of the current best solution for the next best possible solution and terminates the search when it reaches the user specified maximum number of simulations besides the maximum number of simulations users have the flexibility to input a perturbation value required for the pdds algorithm in ostrich the perturbation value can range from 0 to 1 with the recommended value of 0 2 used for this calibration tolson and shoemaker 2007 the perturbation value is the ratio of standard deviation to the deviation range the higher perturbation value spreads out the sample from the current best solution matott 2017 parapadds is the multi objective optimization moo technique of dds with the addition of archiving of the solutions by identifying multiple non dominated solutions the selection of a non dominated solution to be perturbed using the parapadds algorithm from the pool of non dominated solutions is based on the selection metric there are currently four selection metrics supported by parapadds 1 uniform random selection 2 crowding distance 3 estimated hyper volume contribution hvc1 and 4 exact hyper volume contribution hvc2 in this study hvc1 has been used as the selection metric for parapadds as it is more efficient than other selection metrics asadzadeh and tolson 2013 4 3 model performance evaluation the median kling gupta efficiency kge between the measured and computed streamflow across all hydrometric stations is used as an objective function for single objective optimization and moo the median is often the preferred measure of central tendency because the median is more resistant to outliers than the mean for the distributions that have outliers or are skewed additionally in the case of multi objective optimization the median kge between the measured soil moisture and computed soil moisture at 20 cm depth across all soil moisture stations is used as the second objective function although we have soil moisture data at 50 cm depth we only used soil moisture data at 20 cm depth during calibration to afford direct comparison to the original hype model in addition not all the stations have soil moisture data at 50 cm depth kge is a preferred metric compared to nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as nse tends to underestimate the variability in the simulations in contrast kge offers balanced optimization of the model bias variability and temporal fit gupta et al 2009 eq 2 for the calculation of kge is applicable for both streamflow and soil moisture there are three major components involved in the computation of the kge metric 1 correlation 2 bias and 3 variability the equation between the measured and the simulated dataset can be formulated as below to obtain kge 2 kge 1 r 1 2 σ sim σ obs 1 2 µ sim µ obs 1 2 where r is the pearson correlation coefficient between observations and simulations σ obs is the standard deviation of measured data σ sim is the standard deviation of the simulations µ obs is the measured mean and µ sim is the simulated mean the theoretical value of kge ranges from the worst to the best simulation 1 however acceptable kge values in modeling studies range from 0 41 1 the value of kge less than 0 41 is deemed unsuitable as it indicates that the mean measured value is a better indicator than the computed value knoben et al 2019 the measured value can be either streamflow or soil moisture to calculate two different objective functions ie kge streamflow and kge soil moisture 4 4 selection of solution from pareto front single objective calibration does not require the selection of a parameter solution as the optimization converges to a single solution in the case of moo multiple non dominated solutions are available depending upon the output of each objective function a non dominated solution is achieved when none of the objective functions can be improved without affecting the other one dumedah et al 2010 huang 2014 the desired solution is then selected from the pareto front such that the distance d between the chosen solution and the reference solution is minimum the minimum distance can be calculated from eq 3 below as suggested by mostafaie et al 2018 3 d f n i 1 j f i x n j 1 p where fi is the objective function and p is the euclidean distance to estimate the distances to the reference solution since we have two objective functions a median kge between the measured and simulated streamflow i e f1 kgestreamflow and b median kge between the measured soil moisture and simulated soil moisture i e f2 kgesoil moisture nj is the reference solution of the optimization problem which is 1 for the best possible achievable kge solution and p is 2 which is used to estimate the euclidean distance to the reference solution 5 results 5 1 analysis of soil layer discretization before model calibration we compare the soil moisture simulations from the two models three and seven layer discretization at various soil moisture stations before calibration to assess the impact of discretization without the influence of calibration methodology fig 6 fig 7 fig s2 the default parameters of hype at 20 cm depth are used across additional layers of the model soil moisture simulated by both models using default hype parameters indicates an overestimation of soil moisture at all sites compared to the observed dataset the overestimation of soil moisture volume is more significant in the discretized hype model than in the original hype simulation which is expected given the parameters were selected from and previously optimized for the original hype model measured soil moisture volume across all stations varies from 18 mm to 85 mm depending upon the location with simulated soil moisture volume ranging from 37 mm to 116 mm for the original hype model and 42 124 mm for the discretized model although the discretized model overestimates soil moisture by 22 on average compared to the original model both models replicate similar patterning and timing of seasonal soil moisture content overestimation by the discretized seven layer model indicates that the increased discretization increases the retention of water within the upper soil structure relative to the original model which is caused by the same default percolation parameters being used in both models for example as the model is discretized into finer depths using the same percolation parameter for smaller soil depths allows the model to percolate more water into the soil layer below 5 2 analysis of soil layer discretization after model calibration the seven layer discretized hype model is compared to the original three layer hype model following calibration across the ncrb domain which is essential to justify the importance of soil layer discretization spatial analysis of the kge streamflow discharge between the original model and the discretized model indicates similar performance between single objective optimization fig 8 a fig 8 b and multi objective optimization moo methodologies fig 8 c fig 8 d most stations perform poorly in the non contributing areas nca region of the prairies also commonly referred to as the prairie pothole region with low or even negative kge scores the representation of the spill and runoff process from the prairie potholes can be challenging in a conceptual model like hype leading to a generally poor simulation of runoff generation and hence streamflow this issue has been the focus of several studies where models struggle to mimic the actual representation of the prairies fill and spill dynamics ahmed et al 2020 granger et al 1984 muhammad et al 2018 unduche et al 2018 ncas are incorporated into hype using the parameterization technique a volume based correction using a runoff threshold stadnyk et al 2020 although this approach reasonably improved runoff simulation across this region stadnyk et al 2020 recommend applying improved algorithms based on the dynamic fill and spill runoff generation process to have better streamflow simulation at a larger scale however the discretized hype model performs satisfactorily near the basin outlet compared to the original hype model especially at the churchill river outlet where there are few upstream nca regions the moo of the discretized model demonstrates improvement at the churchill river above red head rapids wsc id 06fd001 with a kge score of 0 80 compared to the original model simulation 0 71 fig 9 a evaluation of the time series simulation at this station indicates the discretized model is better able to capture peak flow events especially during the 2014 and 2017 floods in the context of nelson river at long spruce generation station the measured streamflow fluctuates due to the heavily fragmented and regulated lower nelson river fig 9 b the discretized hype model also performs better here with a kge score of 0 68 relative to the original model 0 65 statistically insignificant under single objective calibration the discretized model does not indicate any improvement over the original model with both models resulting in median kge scores of approximately 0 66 during the calibration period fig 10 a and 0 45 during validation fig 10 b when moo is used the discretized model shows slight but insignificant improvement for both streamflow and soil moisture relative to the original model although the improvements remain statistically insignificant the discretized hype model shows improvement of kge score by 0 02 and 0 023 calibration for streamflow and soil moisture evaluation respectively the improvements in model performance can be found to be statistically insignificant as the paired t test shows p values of 0 98 0 05 and 0 26 0 05 for streamflow and soil moisture respectively however the interquartile range iqr for discretized hype model is reduced from 0 35 to 0 29 fig 10 c also when comparing the single objective soil moisture calibration and validation results to those obtained using moo improvements are statistically significant with noticeable reductions in the iqr for both the three layer and seven layer models 5 3 impact of process based multi objective optimization both versions of hype three and seven soil layer discretization are subjected to moo measuring model performance against both observed streamflow and soil moisture data fig 11 demonstrates the trade off between maximizing kge for streamflow and soil moisture 20 cm performance that occurs the selected optimal solution red dot on fig 11 from the non dominated solutions is the nearest solution to the reference point in the objective space i e kgestreamflow 1 kgesoil moisture 1 with other non dominated solutions varying from kge of 0 5 0 65 for soil moisture and between 0 61 and 0 66 for streamflow the resulting pareto front from the two models is very similar in terms of range for the original three layer hype model the single objective calibration results in more optimal streamflow performance median kge of 0 66 relative to the median moo kge of 0 63 though the difference is statistically insignificant this is not however the case for the discretized seven layer model which results in a median kge just below 0 66 which appears to maintain better streamflow performance despite optimizing an additional objective previous studies indicate that moo may be either beneficial or detrimental to streamflow gauge performance compared to single objective calibration depending on the parameterization and model setup studies conducted by chen et al 2017 and werth et al 2009 report improvement in streamflow simulation due to moo while the studies from budhathoki et al 2020a and yang et al 2019 indicate no improvement in streamflow simulation this can be expected for a multi objective optimization when the precipitation is properly partitioned among different state variables and fluxes budhathoki et al 2020a b and would largely depend on the model structure s ability to accurately represent this partitioning all studies however agree that using moo significantly improves the simulation of the secondary objective which in this study is the soil moisture most of the simulated soil moisture profiles mimic the observed dataset during the unfrozen state after moo generally from may to october fig 12 fig 13 fig s3 with half the soil moisture stations having a kge of 0 64 and up to 0 79 soil moisture at some of the stations such as stettler fig 13 f and st albert fig 13 d in alberta are poorly simulated with the volumetric water content vwc being significantly underestimated compared to the observed dataset with pbias of approximately 40 during the calibration period table 2 conversely the soil moisture at carman fig 13 h in manitoba is generally overestimated soil types and characteristics can be very localized and heterogeneous and due to the resolution of the land use and soil maps used to construct the model i e the hype slcs the model is likely misrepresenting the soil texture in locales surrounding these particular gauges although the soil data is 300 m resolution fine resolution the site specific soil observation can be different at few locations also this fine resolution will not be able to capture the actual soil texture heterogeneity overall the calibrated models using moo effectively captures soil moisture observed profiles the original hype model increases the median kge of soil moisture from 0 22 to 0 64 and the discretized hype model median kge for soil moisture increases from 0 20 to 0 65 these results demonstrate that although the single objective optimization achieves adequate streamflow performance the soil moisture component is in fact poorly simulated in the context of the soil temperature both models perform equally well across ncrb at 20 cm depth fig s4 regardless of the season soil temperature at the soil moisture observation stations varies from 15 ⁰c during the winter season to 25 ⁰c during the summer season at the 20 cm depth it should be noted that the soil moisture stations are located in the southern region of the catchment where the air temperature is relatively warmer compared to the northern extent of the basin however unlike soil moisture which is challenging to verify in the model during the winter season due to the presence of both liquid and solid water content the hype model can accurately simulate soil temperature throughout the frozen soil state this is an important finding for future permafrost studies in response to climate change for which soil temperature simulation and feedback will be necessary 5 4 impact on runoff generation the seven layer discretized hype model shows only minor simulation performance improvement over the original hype model however the moo results offer insight into potential model fidelity improvements at a hydrologic process level the water balance components simulated by the two models reveal significant differences in runoff generation component contributions the logarithmic radar diagram suggests changes in the infiltration and evapotranspiration components which are both slightly higher fractions of the water budget in the case of the seven layer discretization of hype fig s5 evapotranspiration et is the most significant contributor to the prairie regional water balance accounting for more than 70 of total precipitation several studies have reported the annual et to be around 360 400 mm under non drought conditions in this region armstrong et al 2015 martel et al 2018 wang et al 2013 based on the optimal moo solution the original hype model estimates the average et loss to be about 340 mm across the entire domain whereas the discretized hype model results in approximately 380 mm et or 12 greater water loss this is consistent with the enhanced capacity of the discretized model to allow more water to infiltrate into the soil layers contributing to higher evapotranspiration potential from water stored in the soils we further evaluate the spatial performance of the two models for et simulation using the gleam reanalysis dataset over the entire ncrb results show that the kge values from the seven layer discretized hype model are notably improved relative to gleam across most sub basins within the prairie region fig 14 however differences in other water balance components such as the snow water equivalent and soil storage deficit results not shown are relatively small among the two model discretization schemes therefore although there is no significant difference in streamflow and soil moisture performance characteristics between the two discretized models the internal response to soil moisture i e et loss does demonstrate substantial improvement it should be noted that since the rescaled soil moisture at 20 cm depth is obtained by matching the mean and median from the gleam observations the kge values shown in fig 14 reflects on the correlation between the two datasets we similarly compare the spatial performance of both model discretization schemes in terms of their surface soil moisture representation relative to gleam data across the ncrb using the kge metric although both models show similar performance when evaluated at point ground surface observation stations the seven layer discretized hype model demonstrates improved spatial performance relative to the original hype model fig 14 d improvements are particularly notable in the prairie pothole region and across the northern permafrost impacted portion of the basin 6 discussion results indicate that moo effectively addresses the issue of poor model fidelity resulting from single objective optimization which deteriorates the simulation quality of soil moisture in the process of achieving adequate streamflow performance moo significantly improves the soil moisture simulation with negligible impact on the calibration of the streamflow soil moisture at the 20 cm depth in particular shows significant improvement in both timing and magnitude following multi objective optimization fig 12 fig 13 fig s3 at most soil moisture stations errors tend to be more significant either at the beginning of the spring season when the snow and frozen soil begin to melt or during the fall season the spring and fall seasons are thermodynamically more complex owing to soil and surface water phase change specifically the freeze thaw cycle for the ncrb since hype is a semi conceptual model with temperature index methods it lacks the specificity of thermodynamic principles to reliably mimic the real world energy exchange occurring within these processes as phase change occurs from one state to another there may also be some observational error inherent in the measured data at these times of the year when soil moisture probes capture only the liquid not solid water content residing within the soils budhathoki et al 2020a b in addition some soil moisture stations are still poorly represented after moo with poor performance correlated with the discrepancy between the soil type classification in the hype model based on the soil use map and localized soil type at those stations the soil type at any location can also vary both horizontally and vertically at the st albert location soils are described as medium to moderately fine texture soil ranging from fine to fine textured at a depth of 0 6 1 5 m below the surface and medium texture below 1 5 m depth knapik and veauvy 1975 fine texture soils typically have a high proportion of silt and clay and therefore a higher water holding capacity than medium and coarse textured soils campos et al 2011 in hype the soil classification impacting the st albert gauge i e the subbasin the gauge resides in is classified as medium soil texture resulting in faster drainage of soils within the subbasin than would be observed at the gauge the soils underlying the carman station are predominately loamy sand a fine textured soil with low water holding capacity and fast drainage rates mills and haluschak 1993 however the soil classification in hype characterizes the sub basin soil type under medium soil texture which can range from sandy loam to silty loam table 2 the medium textured soil tends to drain the soils comparatively at slower rate compared to the fine textured soil therefore the simulated soil moisture at carman station is higher compared to the measured dataset although the cci land cover soil classification used in this study is of 300 m resolution the land cover map is not an accurate representation of the ground observations for some of the soil moisture stations therefore it is suggested to update the soil classification based on the ground observations which could be beneficial for the improvement of the model calibration the benefit of moo is likely most apparent across the prairie region where complex runoff generation processes exist and hydrologic models often struggle to simulate streamflow adequately runoff generation from the prairies is one of the complex features of ncrb as these basins are highly dynamic and their contributing areas change depending on the antecedent moisture conditions of the basin shook et al 2021 runoff generation from the prairies and the amount of water infiltrating into the soil layers are governed by the connectivity of the small depressions through the fill and spill process mechanism accurately simulating channel dis connectivity and streamflow in this region is essential for flood and drought monitoring whereas accurate soil moisture estimation is crucial in regional crop forecasts and crop rotation akinremi et al 1996 mcginn and shepherd 2003 as well as long term estimation of total water loss for example when soils across the canadian prairies are under severe water stress due to low precipitation and higher evaporation demand farmers may choose to have a two year fixed rotation of fallow and spring wheat campbell et al 1987 in recent decades however fallow land across the prairies has been rapidly converting into continuous annual cropping increasing the evapotranspiration from the croplands and resulting in increased water loss and severity of drought in these regions akther and azam 2019 soil moisture estimation in this region is an essential tool to address such long term drought mitigation and management issues including sustainable land practices based on continental scale modeling under future climates several studies and climate models project an increase in precipitation and temperature for the northern hemisphere guo et al 2019 koenigk et al 2020 in our study we evaluated the two discretization schemes for the hype model only for a shorter duration due to limitations of overlapping observation availability for streamflow and soil moisture data verification against gleam reanalyses for evapotranspiration and soil moisture suggests more significant shifts in internal water balance result from the enhanced discretization scheme particularly for evaporative water loss in the context of climate change small increases in prairie precipitation relative to larger increases in air temperature are projected to enhance water loss across the prairies macdonald et al 2018 this suggests that over the longer term differences between the two models are likely to become more pronounced due to shifting inflow to water loss partitioning in subbasins particularly in the prairie region gleam data also offer insight that meaningful differences in soil moisture may be occurring in permafrost regions northern ncrb where simulation of soil temperature and moisture components will be more critical for climate change assessment of permafrost thaw our results suggest the seven layer discretized model does not degrade streamflow simulation quality despite the added parameter complexity of the enhanced discretization scheme moreover calibration using multiple objectives incorporating soil moisture requires the model calibration to meet additional criteria but does not adversely impact the streamflow performance in addition there is not much difference in computation time required between single objective and multi objective optimization these are important considerations since the primary function of the model is the prediction of streamflow though streamflow performance alone cannot justify the added model complexity we argue the seven layer model can be beneficial in three ways 1 since soil moisture simulation performance shows meaningful improvement the reliability of the discretized model is greater for long term simulation in analysing the relationship among changing water balance components e g climate change studies 2 the seven layer discretized model better captures simulated peak flows making it a better choice for flood simulation and flood frequency analysis and 3 since the discretized model operates at finer vertical discretization the model is of benefit to analyse the impact of changing climate on soil temperature and permafrost process based calibration plays an important role in improving model fidelity which is likely to be even more significant over long term large scale simulations and ungauged catchments here we have improved model fidelity by implementing process based calibration using additional observation data and improving model structure by discretizing three soil layers into seven soil layers to improve structural representation of the model in previous studies process based calibration has been limited to smaller scale catchments in the prairies budhathoki et al 2020a b due to which the application of such models has been confined to small physiographical and topographical regions to facilitate computational efficiency this study particularly emphasizes process based calibration at the continent scale nelson churchill river basin expanding across different hydroclimatic ecozones and land features such a model can be resourceful in developing an overview of the actual water resources status and assist in identifying regions where an in depth assessment may be required process based continental hydrological model is not only important in estimating the quantity of freshwater supply across the study domain stadnyk and déry 2021 but it is also vital in estimating several other components such as snow water equivalent swe soil moisture and evapotranspiration et 7 summary and conclusions calibration of hydrological model parameters is crucial to ensure that the model captures real world hydrological processes well producing reliable estimates of the system fluxes furthermore observation data play a pivotal role in tuning the model parameters as model simulations are compared to these datasets in performance evaluation this study implemented a process based calibration for hydrological simulation in two phases in the first phase the upper two soil layers of the model are discretized into finer depth increments such that the model simulates sub surface soil water balance components within each of the finer discretized soil layers in the second phase multi objective optimization moo of both the coarser and finer discretized versions of the hype model is implemented for streamflow and soil moisture datasets across the hydrologically complex ncrb domain although single objective optimization effectively simulates streamflow the sub surface soil moisture component is poorly represented in the model when single objective calibration to streamflow is used soil moisture is overestimated by up to 30 compared to the observed point data fig 6 fig 7 moo can offer improvements to simulating the soil moisture component at most stations improving the median kge from 0 21 to 0 60 with little trade off in streamflow performance however some soil moisture stations still remain poorly simulated within both model discretization schemes poor performance in these cases is linked directly with differences in the soil classification in the model hype and observational evidence of soil textures at the gauge site local scale heterogeneity the discretized hype model provides minimal improvement over the original hype model however the seven layer discretization improves the simulation of sub surface water balance partitioning specifically the evapotranspiration losses relative to gleam reanalysis data the discretization of soil layers into finer depths allows the model to infiltrate more water into subsurface soil layers which increases the amount of water available for evapotranspiration from the upper layers spatial evaluation of soil moisture against gleam data suggests the seven layer discretization better represents surface soil moisture which is essential for long term water balance and agricultural water management studies despite promising results and future opportunities with the calibrated model this study has some limitations the first limitation remains the lack of soil moisture data available in the northern portion of the catchment as most of the soil moisture stations are in the southern region the calibration of model soil moisture parameters is biased towards the physiographic characteristics of the southern portion of the basin the second limitation of this study is the inability to validate frozen soil moisture simulations against observed data this is due to hype s inability to separate the liquid and solid water content in the soil to directly compare with measurements of liquid water content only taken by the soil probes regardless of the above limitations the calibrated seven layer discretized hype model can be useful for several future applications i understanding the relationship between surface and subsurface components and the implications of climate change on their relative partitioning ii projection of permafrost degradation based on discretized soil temperature and iii agriculture water use and management studies across the prairie region particularly in water loss quantification the discretized hype model generates output at each soil layer allowing the model user flexibility in analyzing sub surface component contributions and their relationship to changing soil temperature and moisture owing to the model s continental scale domain this offers the opportunity to examine process level changes on a regional scale using a cumulative environmental effects perspective the assessment and diagnosis of process level effects resulting from climate change are crucial to improved and sustainable management of

7657,study region beijing tianjin hebei region china study focus understanding factors driving water demand is crucial for water resource planning and management however traditional models fail to capture the complex nonlinear factors that drive real world water demand while machine learning models can capture nonlinear relationships comprehending the complex mechanisms underpinning the models is difficult therefore we combined machine learning with explainable artificial intelligence to analyze the factors driving water demand in the study region new hydrological insights for the region a water demand forecasting framework is proposed for analyzing the factors driving water demand results show that the main driving factors differ across city types population is the most crucial factor influencing water demand with an effect size of 50 30 39 72 and 31 79 in service based industrial and agricultural cities respectively the second and third most important factors in service based cities are the added value of secondary industry avsi and irrigated area ia respectively in industrial and agricultural cities the second and third most important factors are avsi and temperature and temperature and ia respectively by quantifying the nonlinear relationships between water demand and driving factors we identify the critical points associated with changes in correlation structure such as urbanization rate 70 and per capita disposable income 25 000 cny per annum thus this study can serve as a valuable reference for developing accurate models to forecast water demand graphical abstract ga1 keywords water demand driving factors explainable artificial intelligence shapley additive explanations beijing tianjin hebei region data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global water demand has consistently increased over the past few decades primarily because of expanding urban areas the growing population rising living standards and increasing agricultural irrigation ercin and hoekstra 2014 sanchez et al 2020 in addition climate change is expected to exacerbate global pressure on water supplies barbieri et al 2021 mehrazar et al 2020 many countries and regions in the world are currently facing water shortage crises salehi 2022 for example cape town south africa experienced a water shortage crisis in 2018 due to drought and underestimation of water demand growth by the local government millington and scheba 2021 understanding the factors driving water demand is the basis for accurately forecasting future water demand and relevant research findings offer scientific support for effective water resource management in recent years research on the factors driving water demand has received considerable attention at present the three most widely used approaches for water demand forecasting are econometric models daw et al 2021 multivariate statistical models panagopoulos 2014 li et al 2021 and machine learning models nunes et al 2021 zanfei et al 2022 yuan et al 2007 utilized a multiple linear regression model based on economic and social data in china and reported that the added value of secondary industry avsi irrigated area ia and population were the main factors driving water demand bakker et al 2014 found that incorporating environmental variables improved the accuracy and reduced the uncertainty of water demand forecasting zhang et al 2013 utilized the cobb douglas model and reported that gross domestic product gdp and pdi were negatively correlated whereas population and ia were positively correlated with water demand in northern china anang et al 2019 employed a multiple linear regression model and reported that the main factors affecting water demand in malaysia were ia population and pdi similarly da veiga et al 2022 used a multiple linear regression model and reported that population pdi gdp and temperature showed significant effects on water demand in brazil based on the bayesian hierarchical model worland et al 2018 reported that social factors predominantly drive water demand in counties in the northwest and northeast usa while environmental factors predominate in counties in the southwest and southeast usa overall the factors driving water demand have been shown to exhibit regional and national variation while the inclusion of environmental variables has been demonstrated to improve the accuracy and reduce the uncertainty of water demand forecasting in the beijing tianjin hebei bth region china s capital economic circle wang et al 2015 water scarcity problems have been a key limiting factor for regional development zhao et al 2017 thus this region provides an ideal case for water demand research kong et al 2019 utilized the logarithmic mean divisia index decomposition method to identify the main factors driving water demand in the bth region and reported that economic factors had the greatest impact on the other hand huang et al 2020 found that population was the main factor driving water demand from 2000 to 2014 while in 2015 and 2016 the added value of tertiary industry surpassed population to become the main factor these results highlight the importance of considering specific regional factors when developing water management strategies scholars have emphasized the importance of accurate models in understanding the relationship between water demand and driving factors murdoch et al 2019 machine learning ml models have been shown to outperform multivariate statistical and econometric models in water demand forecasting lee and derrible 2020 as water demand is motivated by intricate nonlinear interactions between human society and the natural environment rezaali et al 2021 however the lack of interpretability and lack of visibility of feature importance in ml algorithms has led many researchers to avoid using ml algorithms for attribution analysis nearing et al 2021 sun and scanlon 2019 to address this attribution issue explainable artificial intelligence xai has emerged with the aim of improving the interpretability of ml models and providing understandable explanations of how various ml models determine the prediction performance meske et al 2022 the recent emergence of shapley additive explanations shap lundberg and lee 2017 provides a general explanation method for ml algorithms the shap method constructs an additive explanation model that considers all input features as contributors and assigns an importance value to each feature in order to measure the contribution of each feature in attribution analysis studies the shap method has achieved satisfactory results in various fields e g hydrology dikshit and pradhan 2021 wang et al 2022a and aqueous environments park et al 2022 wang et al 2022b we believe that the shap method can provide valuable insights into the nonlinear relationships between water demand and its driving factors to address the inadequate accuracy of traditional methods and the poor interpretability of ml techniques this study makes a first attempt to integrate ml and xai in water demand forecasting the proposed methodology applies the shap method to uncover novel insights into the factors driving water demand by objectively explaining ml models the ml xai integration facilitates water demand forecasting of greater accuracy and a better understanding of the relationship between driving factors and water demand than can be provided by multivariate statistical and econometric methods furthermore this method not only identifies the driving factors but also quantifies their impact on water demand providing a significant advantage over other methods the primary objectives of this study are 1 to develop a more accurate water demand forecasting model based on ml techniques and 2 to apply the shap method to explain the ml model identify the driving factors and accurately quantify their effects on water demand the paper is

contributions and limitations and then provides recommendations for future research 2 materials and methods 2 1 modeling methodological framework studying the factors driving water demand is essential to realize effective urban water management in this study we used an xai based method to reveal the predictive relationship between water demand and its driving factors without the involvement of subjective judgments or intermediate variables fig 1 displays the framework for the modeling methodology employed in our study this framework included the following key steps in step i the most suitable ml model was selected to establish a nonlinear predictive relationship between water demand and input variables for the study area here we partitioned the data for water demand the target and the driving factors the features into a training set and a test set to serve as inputs to ml models several common ml models including the extreme gradient boosting xgboost model chen and guestrin 2016 the random forest rf model liaw and wiener 2002 support vector machines svm schuldt et al 2004 the k nearest neighbors k nn method hand 2007 and a classic multiple linear regression mlr model were considered during model training we used the cross validation method to adjust the parameters and obtain optimal parameters for each ml model finally we selected the most suitable model based on the evaluation results in step ii the shap method was used to select features i e main factors driving water demand the shap method enabled the determination of the importance of each feature in water demand forecasting in the feature selection step we gradually eliminated input features starting from the feature of least importance according to the shap method after removing a feature we retrained the model to obtain updated feature importance scores this iterative process was repeated until a significant degradation of model performance occurred i e the change point the remaining features including the ones that caused degradation at this point were considered the main features step iii synthesized the most suitable model main driving factors and explanatory model to quantify and analyze the driving factors here we identified the order of feature importance among the factors driving water demand analyzed trends in the feature importance of factors from 2005 to 2020 and quantified the relationships between water demand and its driving factors 2 2 study area the 13 cities of the bth region which comprises beijing tianjin and 11 cities in hebei province in northern china were classified into three categories based on cluster analysis of water usage structure agricultural cities industrial cities and service based cities fig 2 as one of the three major economic zones in china the bth region has experienced rapid socioeconomic development over the last few decades han et al 2021 however this growth has resulted in increasingly impactful water issues such as severe soil erosion water pollution the drying up of rivers and groundwater overdraft worsening the problem of water scarcity dai et al 2020 furthermore the bth region is highly sensitive to the risks posed by climate change liu et al 2022 making accurate water demand forecasting crucial 2 3 data sources recent research has shown that water demand is influenced by various factors including social economic and environmental factors lindqvist et al 2022 in the present study each city s water consumption datum in billion m3 from 2005 to 2020 was considered the water demand which was referred to as the target moreover 13 variables were selected as the input features of the model including four social factors five economic factors and four environmental factors the features are described in table 1 this study utilized four primary data sources to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results 1 demographic and economic data were taken from the china statistical yearbook 2 city development data were taken from the china urban construction statistical yearbook 3 water resources data were taken from the china water resources bulletin and 4 climate data were taken from the daily value data set of china surface climate data v 3 0 and validated via a recently proposed procedure gentilucci et al 2018 gentilucci et al 2022 2 4 cross validation cross validation cv stone 1974 is a model validation method that utilizes different data subsets in different iterations to train and test a model evaluating how statistical analysis results generalize to independent datasets the purpose of cv is to test the ability of a given model to forecast fresh data that were not used to estimate the model and thereby obtain insights into how the model would summarize an independent data set in this study we employed the tenfold cv method which is a common approach desimone and ransom 2021 this method involves splitting the training set into ten folds then using nine of them for model training and finally using the remaining fold for model validation this process was repeated ten times to obtain ten trained models and their respective evaluation metrics finally the mean value for each evaluation metric was calculated in order to adjust the model parameters fig 3 2 5 shap method the shap method is an ml based result explanation technique that utilizes game theory to quantify the contribution of input features to forecast results lundberg and lee 2017 here to generate an explainable model shap utilizes an additive decomposition approach where the output model is defined as a linear addition of input features in this context the explanation model g x with inputs x 0 1 m for the initial ml model f x is defined as an additive model with features x i e 1 f x g x ϕ 0 i 1 m ϕ i x i eq 1 decomposes the total water demand into individual contributions from each driving factor based on this decomposition the feature importance is defined as the percentage that the absolute value of each driving factor s contribution represents as a component of the total water demand feature importance is calculated as 2 feature importance i ϕ i i 1 m ϕ i 100 where m represents the number of features ϕ 0 represents the average value of water demand across all samples ϕ i represents the shap value i e the contribution corresponding to feature i here x equals 1 when feature i is observed else x equals 0 eq 1 indicates that the model generates a predicted value for each sample the shap value reflects the magnitude of each feature s contribution to that predicted value in comparison traditional feature importance indicates only which feature is important and provided no information on how that feature affects the predicted values lundberg et al 2018 the shap method offers a significant advantage in that shap values can reveal the effect size of each feature including both positive and negative effects feature importance expressed as a shap value is defined as 3 ϕ i s f i s f s 1 f f x x s i f x x s here s is the feature subset f is the set of all input features x s i is the values of the input features in set s i x s is the values of the input features in set s f x x s i is the predicted value for feature x s i and f x x s is the predicted value for feature x s the standard deviation sd serves as the primary quantitative measure of uncertainty burr et al 2021 however due to variations in water demand across different cities it is necessary to standardize the uncertainties of different cities into a dimensionless quantity to facilitate meaningful comparison thus based on shap values the uncertainty of feature i for each city is defined as 4 uncertaint y i s d i 1 n j 1 n i 1 m ϕ i j 100 where s d i is the standard deviation of the shap values of feature i n is the number of shap values of feature i m is the number of features and ϕ i j is the shap value 2 6 evaluation of model performance model performance evaluation is a multidisciplinary research field with any given evaluation metric finding essential use in various domains botchkarev 2018 in ml regression models evaluation metrics are typically applied to compare a model s forecasted values with real world data from a testing dataset in order to assess the model s quality and to select an appropriate forecasting model makridakis et al 2018 we used several common evaluation metrics to test the accuracy and feasibility of various ml models for water demand forecasting the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae a high r 2 value corresponds to high consistency between actual observations and predicted values while rmse punishes models with large deviations and is typically utilized for selecting the most suitable model for the data meanwhile mae prefers models with minor absolute deviations on average therefore better model performance is indicated by a larger r 2 value but smaller rmse and mae values the r 2 rmse and mae metrics were calculated as follows respectively 5 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 1 n y i y 2 6 rmse billion m 3 1 n i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 7 mae billion m 3 1 n i 1 n y i y ˆ i here y i and y ˆ i represent the actual water demand and the predicted value respectively y is the average value of the actual observations and n is the number of samples 3 results 3 1 model selection our aim here was to obtain a high performance water demand forecasting model to explore the driving factors of water demand in this study the dataset containing the target and 13 features was divided into training and test sets with data from years 2005 through 2017 forming the training set and data from years 2018 through 2020 comprising the test set the parameters were adjusted with the tenfold cv method to obtain the parameter combinations that yielded the best generalization performance in the training set the model was then tested using the test set and evaluation metrics were calculated table 2 generally the results obtained from the test set better reflect the model s generalization performance and robustness than the training set thus the following conclusions are drawn from the results shown in table 2 1 the four nonlinear calculation based models namely xgboost rf svm and k nn all demonstrated significantly better water demand forecasting performance than the mlr model this finding demonstrates not only that water demand is driven by multiple factors but that there are complex nonlinear relationships between water demand and these factors 2 the r 2 values for the xgboost rf svm k nn and mlr models were 0 967 0 944 0 962 0 960 and 0 861 respectively the r 2 value for xgboost was higher than those for other models demonstrating that the xgboost model s forecasted values better matched the actual water demand values the magnitude relationship of rmse values was xgboost svm k nn rf lr again indicating the outstanding performance of xgboost this same trend was the observed for the mae values these results indicate that the xgboost model had the smallest error among the five models tested overall r 2 rmse and mae values obtained for the xgboost model indicate that it outperformed the other models in forecasting water demand in the bth region therefore we decided to use the xgboost model for the remaining portion of the study while putting aside all other models this allowed us to focus our resources on the model that showed the greatest potential for success 3 2 feature selection in this study we developed an xgboost model for water demand forecasting and proposed a feature selection method based on the shap method fig 4 displays the feature selection process and we observed that the change point occurred when the eighth most important feature was eliminated this finding indicates the satisfactory performance of xgboost models with at least eight input features in water demand forecasting the main driving factors for water demand were identified as rp pd ur ia avsi pdi aat and twr according to their contributions see table 1 for feature abbreviation explanations after careful analysis it was determined that the remaining features did not provide additional information beyond what was already captured by other features in the dataset as such these features were considered redundant and were no longer included in the analysis for this study 3 3 analysis of driving factors 3 3 1 identification of driving factors given the critical role that water demand forecasting plays in water resource management and planning it is crucial to obtain an accurate and meaningful interpretation and explanation of the forecasting results the shap method was used in this study to calculate shap values which indicate the contribution of each feature in the model to the predicted water demand a comprehensive understanding of how the model generates general predictions can be obtained by aggregating these shap values feature importance was determined by averaging the absolute shap values for the various features across all actual observations we used absolute values in order to prevent positive and negative values from canceling each other out fig 5 shows the order of feature importance across different city types agricultural industrial and service based arranged from top largest to bottom smallest the results reveal differences among city types in the factors driving water demand in agricultural cities the most three important factors were rp aat and ia meanwhile in industrial cities the most important factors were rp avsi and aat finally in service based cities the demographic factor rp contributed more than 50 of the water demand with avsi and ia acting as key secondary factors the results of the study indicate that population size exerts a substantial impact on water demand in the bth region notably the effect was most pronounced in service based cities where it contributed 50 30 of water demand the population effect was comparatively weaker in other city types though it still showed the highest feature importance 31 79 in agricultural cities 39 72 in industrial cities in agricultural cities the second and third most influential factors were temperature 18 39 contribution and ia 16 87 contribution in industrial cities the primary factors affecting water demand other than population size were the avsi 17 05 contribution and temperature 15 57 contribution these findings highlight that population factors are the most important factors of water demand with the main factors found to be consistent with the industrial structure of the city moreover fig 5d shows the uncertainty of the main driving factors indicating that the environmental factors of aat and twr are the most significant sources of uncertainty in water demand forecasting in the bth region 3 3 2 changes in feature importance the factors identified as driving water demand in the bth region were rp ia pd ur avsi pdi aat and twr the feature importance of these factors exhibited changes over the period 2005 2020 fig 6 attributed here to various causes such as urban expansion economic development land use change and climate variability specifically we found that some factors such as rp fig 6a ur fig 6c and pdi fig 6f exhibited similar secular trends in feature importance across different city types indicating that these changes were related to socioeconomic development rather than the city type notably there was a consistent decline in the feature importance of rp starting in 2012 with average annual decreases of approximately 2 00 1 22 and 0 74 in agricultural industrial and service based cities respectively on the other hand changes in the feature importance of some factors such as ia fig 6d avsi fig 6e and aat fig 6g were found to be closely linked to city type for instance between 2005 and 2020 the effect of aat on water demand increased substantially in agricultural cities rising from 10 85 to 26 59 conversely in industrial cities this impact significantly decreased from 21 73 to 10 56 whereas in service based cities the change was relatively minor dropping from 8 14 to 6 18 furthermore some features such as pd fig 6b and twr fig 6h showed continuous fluctuations in feature importance these results underscore the need for targeted policies and strategies that account for the unique water demand characteristics of different city types in the bth region 3 3 3 quantification of driving factors fig 7 displays a summary plot of the obtained shap values effectively showcasing the magnitude and distribution of the effects of the input features on water demand each point in fig 7 represents a shap value corresponding to that feature for a given sample here the x axis displays the shap value while the y axis depicts the input features in order of importance from the largest at the top to the smallest at the bottom the color of each dot indicates the value of the input feature with blue indicating low values and red indicating high values specifically the points on the right side of fig 7 represent positive shap values whereas the points on the left side represent negative shap values analyzing the plot we found that higher values of rp represented by red dots on the right side of the rp row tended to enhance the performance of the xgboost model in forecasting water demand conversely higher values of aat represented by red dots on the left side of the aat row had an adverse effect on the model s forecasting performance these insights can help policymakers and stakeholders to develop effective strategies for regional water resource management fig 8 depicts the changes in shap values in response to variations in driving factors offering further insights into the distribution and variability of water demand for each input feature the red lines in the figure panels illustrate the fitting lines obtained using the least squares method the solid lines signify significant results p 0 05 whereas the dotted lines indicate non significant results here negative positive shap values correspond to an inhibiting facilitating effect on water demand based on the regional average for a given feature the following results can be drawn from an analysis of fig 8 1 among social factors fig 8a 8d rp showed a nonlinear positive correlation with water demand in agricultural industrial and service based cities indicating that water demand was higher at higher population sizes pd on the other hand did not exhibit a significant relationship with water demand the relationship between ur and water demand showed a critical point which is a value at which the correlation behavior between a feature and water demand changes in this study we observed a critical point for ur at 70 with a negative correlation below 70 but a positive relationship above 70 furthermore fig 8d reveals a clear city dependent relationship between ia and water demand 2 among economic factors fig 8e and 8f we observed a strong positive correlation between avsi and water demand indicating that the economic development of a city increased the city s water demand regarding the effect of pdi on water demand we found a critical point at 25 000 cny with a negative correlation between pdi and water demand below 25 000 cny but a positive correlation above 25 000 cny 3 among environmental factors fig 8g and 8h we found that the relationship between temperature and water demand was not significant however we did observe a critical point for the relationship between twr and water demand at a value of 1 75 billion m3 this finding indicates that as twr gradually increased the water demand initially rose proportionally but eventually reached a threshold beyond which any further increase in twr was associated with a decline in demand 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of driving factors in different city types the findings above show that differences among city types in terms of industrial structure and functional positioning are associated with significant differences in the sets of factors driving water demand in the bth region water demand in agricultural cities was driven mainly by rp aat and ia while water demand in industrial cities was driven mainly by rp avsi and aat water demand in service based cities was driven primarily by rp with its impact accounting for more than 50 of total water demand similar findings have been reported in previous studies specifically ia avsi and rp have been identified as the primary driving factors for agricultural li et al 2021 industrial zhang and shen 2015 and domestic boretti and rosa 2019 water demand respectively thus changes in urban industrial structure especially trends in the development of major industries are critical to water demand forecasting the present study goes beyond identifying the driving factors closely associated with the predominant industries in each city underscoring as well the significant influence of temperature on water demand hence climate variability is also a crucial determinant of water demand for various cities the temperature component of climate showed dramatic changes in water demand over time fig 6g notably these dramatic changes differed by city type as reviewed above the impact of temperature and climate variability more broadly on water demand deserves further research further analysis based on feature importance trends is needed in order to predict future feature importance optimize water demand forecasting models and improve forecasting accuracy in sum attaining sustainable water resource management requires an accurate forecast of future water demand which in turn necessitates that planners identify the main factors driving water demand based on the current and future industrial structure of the city 4 2 critical points of driving factors quantifying the correlation between each feature and water demand allowed the identification of critical points in the effects of several features such as ur fig 8c pdi fig 8f and twr fig 8h an illustrative instance is the relationship between water demand and ur which exhibited a negative correlation below 70 but a positive correlation above 70 similarly pdi showed a critical point at 25 000 cny shifting from negative to positive correlation while twr showed a critical point at 1 75 billion m3 shifting from positive to negative correlation ur and pdi are important indicators for measuring the level of urban development and standard of living gober 2010 and li et al 2020 have reported that rapid urbanization contributes to escalating water demand and exacerbates water scarcity issues at present there is little research on the critical points for water demand with respect to urban development but previous studies on urban scale have yielded similar results as the critical point between ur and water demand sun et al 2017 identified an important threshold value for ur in china noting that a ur value of 70 marks the transition from the rapid growth stage to the stable development stage of urbanization meanwhile lu et al 2022 research based on land use found that the main stage of agricultural land conversion to residential and industrial land use takes place between 30 and 70 ur agricultural water demand per unit area is often larger than that for industrial or domestic areas so a decline in total regional water demand results from initial urbanization in contrast when ur 70 the combined effect of urban density and living standards changes leads to increases in water demand thus while rapid urbanization can contribute to water scarcity the relationship between urbanization and water demand is nuanced and varies depending on the real world context the relationship between pdi and water demand showed a critical point similar in character to that of ur at 25 000 cny indicating that the effect of pdi growth on water demand underwent a significant change at this threshold transforming from an inhibiting to a facilitating role this transformation is attributable to the high correlation between urbanization and income making it challenging to disentangle their effects jedwab and vollrath 2015 we also identified a critical point for the relationship between twr and water demand for the bth region 1 75 billion m³ research has shown that the supply of water resources is a key factor that affects water demand when water resources are scarce water demand is inevitably constrained by the limited availability of water boretti and rosa 2019 at larger amounts of total water resources the inhibiting effect on water demand is somewhat weaker conversely when water resources are abundant and the supply exceeds demand further increases in water resources tend to reduce the demand for agricultural irrigation chen et al 2020 as well as the demand for residential and ecological water bao et al 2020 leading to a decrease in overall water demand the identification and analysis of critical points in water demand are important for accurate water demand forecasting particularly in rapidly developing urban areas the accuracy of the quantitative relationship between the driving factors and water demand may be affected by the selected research year and spatial range in this study critical points were identified in the relationships between water demand and ur pdi and twr in the bth region whereas no such patterns were observed in the other driving factors however it remains possible that critical points perhaps multiple in number exist for these factors but were not detected within the study period and region therefore further research including comparisons and investigations from other regions is required to confirm our findings 4 3 uncertainty of water demand forecasting long term water demand forecasting is a complex and challenging task that demands a thorough understanding of its driving factors previous studies have recognized environmental factors as one of the major sources of uncertainty in the water demand forecasting herman et al 2020 zubaidi et al 2020 in this study we investigated the influence of social economic and environmental factors on water demand to provide a comprehensive understanding of the driving forces our findings in the bth region demonstrated that environmental factors particularly temperature substantially contribute to the uncertainty in the water demand forecasting fig 5d highlighting the need to consider these factors in such projections as a climate variable temperature and the spatiotemporal precision of temperature data significantly affect water demand forecasting models making temperature the most critical source of uncertainty due to this sensitivity the data source and data processing methods may also have subtle effects in this study the original temperature data used were daily surface 2 meter temperature data measured at multiple meteorological stations with the data for each city estimated by the inverse distance weighting method similarly other climatic data such as precipitation and sunshine hours were obtained through the same method applied to daily data from nearby meteorological stations notably in bangkok babel et al 2014 and new south wales haque et al 2015 temperature was found to have a more significant effect on water demand than precipitation or sunshine hours whereas in germany temperature was not found to have any measurable effect at all schleich and hillenbrand 2009 these findings emphasize the need to identify the key driving factors of water demand specific to each region as environmental factors affecting water demand can vary greatly depending on geographic location temperature has a complex impact on water demand with various factors influencing demand in different regions and contexts in regions where water resources are abundant rising temperatures can instigate higher water losses and augmented irrigation demand due to heightened transpiration rates of crops and soils guo and shen 2016 additionally elevated temperatures can lead to the potential for decreased crop yields necessitating increased irrigation to compensate for the loss berardy and chester 2017 moreover industrial water demand can rise when temperatures are high as processes such as power generation and manufacturing require substantial amounts of cooling water wang et al 2018 conversely in regions where water resources are scarce insufficient water supply frequently restricts water demand boretti and rosa 2019 paradoxically higher temperatures may result in a decrease in water demand despite the anticipated rise in demand due to increased evapotranspiration rates furthermore rasifaghihi et al 2020 reported that water demand can be divided into basic water demand and seasonal water demand they showed that the effect of temperature on seasonal water demand is particularly uncertain temperature fluctuations throughout the year thus also impact water demand given that temperature presents the most important environment factor for water demand forecasting in the bth region water managers should prioritize efforts to mitigate its impact such efforts could involve adjustments to agricultural and industrial structures such as the cultivation of heat resistant crops the development of water efficient industries and the implementation of targeted cropping to reduce water losses due to increased transpiration rates 5 conclusion in this paper we proposed a novel framework for water demand forecasting and for analysis of driving factors based on ml and xai the shap method was introduced to identify and quantify the factors driving water demand the proposed framework was applied to the bth region in china we found that the framework improved the model s effectiveness by reducing feature redundancy by 38 our primary conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 overall population size was the most critical factor influencing water demand particularly in service based cities where its effect exceeded 50 in agricultural and industrial cities the effect of population size was slightly weaker ranging from approximately 30 40 but it was still the single most important factor for agricultural cities the second and third most significant factors were temperature and irrigated areas with effect sizes of 18 39 and 16 87 respectively in contrast water demand in industrial cities was affected by the avsi and by temperature with effect sizes of 17 05 and 15 57 respectively 2 the feature importance of driving factors changed over time notably the effect of temperature on water demand in agricultural cities grew significantly over time increasing in feature importance by 1 14 per year on average in contrast the effect of temperature on water demand decreased over time in industrial and service based cities falling by 0 76 per year on average in industrial cities and by 0 11 per year on average in service based cities the feature importance of population size showed a decreasing trend most significantly in agricultural cities with a decrease of 2 00 per year on average 3 the proposed framework successfully quantified the complex interactions of driving factors with water demand in the bth region we identified critical points for various factors at which the correlation between the factor and water demand shifted from facilitation to inhibition or vice versa this information can be used to pinpoint key points at which driving effects change for example ur was negatively correlated with water demand below a ur value of 70 but was positively correlated with water demand above 70 similarly critical points for pdi and twr were found to be 25 000 cny and 1 75 billion m3 respectively in addition it is essential to recognize that societal behaviors such as residential water use habits and the adoption of water conservation measures in various industries can also significantly influence water demand future research should include an examination of these behaviors to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that drive water demand this study incorporates the shap method in water demand forecasting utilizing the xai technique to uncover novel insights into the driving factors and demonstrate the efficacy of shap for factor analysis the findings of this study have important practical implications for water resource management the proposed framework can be further applied in other regions worldwide but regional differences need to be carefully considered in model selection and feature selection policymakers can make more informed decisions about water allocation and conservation efforts by gaining a clearer understanding of the factors driving water demand credit authorship contribution statement zhigang ou conceptualization data curation

7657,study region beijing tianjin hebei region china study focus understanding factors driving water demand is crucial for water resource planning and management however traditional models fail to capture the complex nonlinear factors that drive real world water demand while machine learning models can capture nonlinear relationships comprehending the complex mechanisms underpinning the models is difficult therefore we combined machine learning with explainable artificial intelligence to analyze the factors driving water demand in the study region new hydrological insights for the region a water demand forecasting framework is proposed for analyzing the factors driving water demand results show that the main driving factors differ across city types population is the most crucial factor influencing water demand with an effect size of 50 30 39 72 and 31 79 in service based industrial and agricultural cities respectively the second and third most important factors in service based cities are the added value of secondary industry avsi and irrigated area ia respectively in industrial and agricultural cities the second and third most important factors are avsi and temperature and temperature and ia respectively by quantifying the nonlinear relationships between water demand and driving factors we identify the critical points associated with changes in correlation structure such as urbanization rate 70 and per capita disposable income 25 000 cny per annum thus this study can serve as a valuable reference for developing accurate models to forecast water demand graphical abstract ga1 keywords water demand driving factors explainable artificial intelligence shapley additive explanations beijing tianjin hebei region data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global water demand has consistently increased over the past few decades primarily because of expanding urban areas the growing population rising living standards and increasing agricultural irrigation ercin and hoekstra 2014 sanchez et al 2020 in addition climate change is expected to exacerbate global pressure on water supplies barbieri et al 2021 mehrazar et al 2020 many countries and regions in the world are currently facing water shortage crises salehi 2022 for example cape town south africa experienced a water shortage crisis in 2018 due to drought and underestimation of water demand growth by the local government millington and scheba 2021 understanding the factors driving water demand is the basis for accurately forecasting future water demand and relevant research findings offer scientific support for effective water resource management in recent years research on the factors driving water demand has received considerable attention at present the three most widely used approaches for water demand forecasting are econometric models daw et al 2021 multivariate statistical models panagopoulos 2014 li et al 2021 and machine learning models nunes et al 2021 zanfei et al 2022 yuan et al 2007 utilized a multiple linear regression model based on economic and social data in china and reported that the added value of secondary industry avsi irrigated area ia and population were the main factors driving water demand bakker et al 2014 found that incorporating environmental variables improved the accuracy and reduced the uncertainty of water demand forecasting zhang et al 2013 utilized the cobb douglas model and reported that gross domestic product gdp and pdi were negatively correlated whereas population and ia were positively correlated with water demand in northern china anang et al 2019 employed a multiple linear regression model and reported that the main factors affecting water demand in malaysia were ia population and pdi similarly da veiga et al 2022 used a multiple linear regression model and reported that population pdi gdp and temperature showed significant effects on water demand in brazil based on the bayesian hierarchical model worland et al 2018 reported that social factors predominantly drive water demand in counties in the northwest and northeast usa while environmental factors predominate in counties in the southwest and southeast usa overall the factors driving water demand have been shown to exhibit regional and national variation while the inclusion of environmental variables has been demonstrated to improve the accuracy and reduce the uncertainty of water demand forecasting in the beijing tianjin hebei bth region china s capital economic circle wang et al 2015 water scarcity problems have been a key limiting factor for regional development zhao et al 2017 thus this region provides an ideal case for water demand research kong et al 2019 utilized the logarithmic mean divisia index decomposition method to identify the main factors driving water demand in the bth region and reported that economic factors had the greatest impact on the other hand huang et al 2020 found that population was the main factor driving water demand from 2000 to 2014 while in 2015 and 2016 the added value of tertiary industry surpassed population to become the main factor these results highlight the importance of considering specific regional factors when developing water management strategies scholars have emphasized the importance of accurate models in understanding the relationship between water demand and driving factors murdoch et al 2019 machine learning ml models have been shown to outperform multivariate statistical and econometric models in water demand forecasting lee and derrible 2020 as water demand is motivated by intricate nonlinear interactions between human society and the natural environment rezaali et al 2021 however the lack of interpretability and lack of visibility of feature importance in ml algorithms has led many researchers to avoid using ml algorithms for attribution analysis nearing et al 2021 sun and scanlon 2019 to address this attribution issue explainable artificial intelligence xai has emerged with the aim of improving the interpretability of ml models and providing understandable explanations of how various ml models determine the prediction performance meske et al 2022 the recent emergence of shapley additive explanations shap lundberg and lee 2017 provides a general explanation method for ml algorithms the shap method constructs an additive explanation model that considers all input features as contributors and assigns an importance value to each feature in order to measure the contribution of each feature in attribution analysis studies the shap method has achieved satisfactory results in various fields e g hydrology dikshit and pradhan 2021 wang et al 2022a and aqueous environments park et al 2022 wang et al 2022b we believe that the shap method can provide valuable insights into the nonlinear relationships between water demand and its driving factors to address the inadequate accuracy of traditional methods and the poor interpretability of ml techniques this study makes a first attempt to integrate ml and xai in water demand forecasting the proposed methodology applies the shap method to uncover novel insights into the factors driving water demand by objectively explaining ml models the ml xai integration facilitates water demand forecasting of greater accuracy and a better understanding of the relationship between driving factors and water demand than can be provided by multivariate statistical and econometric methods furthermore this method not only identifies the driving factors but also quantifies their impact on water demand providing a significant advantage over other methods the primary objectives of this study are 1 to develop a more accurate water demand forecasting model based on ml techniques and 2 to apply the shap method to explain the ml model identify the driving factors and accurately quantify their effects on water demand the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the study area data sources research methods and proposed framework for forecasting water demand and analyzing the factors driving water demand section 3 reports the research results these results include the most suitable ml model for the bth region the primary factors in agricultural industrial and service based cities and the quantitative effects of these factors on water demand section 4 provides a detailed discussion and interpretation of our findings and discusses uncertainties in water demand forecasting section 5 summarizes our main contributions and limitations and then provides recommendations for future research 2 materials and methods 2 1 modeling methodological framework studying the factors driving water demand is essential to realize effective urban water management in this study we used an xai based method to reveal the predictive relationship between water demand and its driving factors without the involvement of subjective judgments or intermediate variables fig 1 displays the framework for the modeling methodology employed in our study this framework included the following key steps in step i the most suitable ml model was selected to establish a nonlinear predictive relationship between water demand and input variables for the study area here we partitioned the data for water demand the target and the driving factors the features into a training set and a test set to serve as inputs to ml models several common ml models including the extreme gradient boosting xgboost model chen and guestrin 2016 the random forest rf model liaw and wiener 2002 support vector machines svm schuldt et al 2004 the k nearest neighbors k nn method hand 2007 and a classic multiple linear regression mlr model were considered during model training we used the cross validation method to adjust the parameters and obtain optimal parameters for each ml model finally we selected the most suitable model based on the evaluation results in step ii the shap method was used to select features i e main factors driving water demand the shap method enabled the determination of the importance of each feature in water demand forecasting in the feature selection step we gradually eliminated input features starting from the feature of least importance according to the shap method after removing a feature we retrained the model to obtain updated feature importance scores this iterative process was repeated until a significant degradation of model performance occurred i e the change point the remaining features including the ones that caused degradation at this point were considered the main features step iii synthesized the most suitable model main driving factors and explanatory model to quantify and analyze the driving factors here we identified the order of feature importance among the factors driving water demand analyzed trends in the feature importance of factors from 2005 to 2020 and quantified the relationships between water demand and its driving factors 2 2 study area the 13 cities of the bth region which comprises beijing tianjin and 11 cities in hebei province in northern china were classified into three categories based on cluster analysis of water usage structure agricultural cities industrial cities and service based cities fig 2 as one of the three major economic zones in china the bth region has experienced rapid socioeconomic development over the last few decades han et al 2021 however this growth has resulted in increasingly impactful water issues such as severe soil erosion water pollution the drying up of rivers and groundwater overdraft worsening the problem of water scarcity dai et al 2020 furthermore the bth region is highly sensitive to the risks posed by climate change liu et al 2022 making accurate water demand forecasting crucial 2 3 data sources recent research has shown that water demand is influenced by various factors including social economic and environmental factors lindqvist et al 2022 in the present study each city s water consumption datum in billion m3 from 2005 to 2020 was considered the water demand which was referred to as the target moreover 13 variables were selected as the input features of the model including four social factors five economic factors and four environmental factors the features are described in table 1 this study utilized four primary data sources to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results 1 demographic and economic data were taken from the china statistical yearbook 2 city development data were taken from the china urban construction statistical yearbook 3 water resources data were taken from the china water resources bulletin and 4 climate data were taken from the daily value data set of china surface climate data v 3 0 and validated via a recently proposed procedure gentilucci et al 2018 gentilucci et al 2022 2 4 cross validation cross validation cv stone 1974 is a model validation method that utilizes different data subsets in different iterations to train and test a model evaluating how statistical analysis results generalize to independent datasets the purpose of cv is to test the ability of a given model to forecast fresh data that were not used to estimate the model and thereby obtain insights into how the model would summarize an independent data set in this study we employed the tenfold cv method which is a common approach desimone and ransom 2021 this method involves splitting the training set into ten folds then using nine of them for model training and finally using the remaining fold for model validation this process was repeated ten times to obtain ten trained models and their respective evaluation metrics finally the mean value for each evaluation metric was calculated in order to adjust the model parameters fig 3 2 5 shap method the shap method is an ml based result explanation technique that utilizes game theory to quantify the contribution of input features to forecast results lundberg and lee 2017 here to generate an explainable model shap utilizes an additive decomposition approach where the output model is defined as a linear addition of input features in this context the explanation model g x with inputs x 0 1 m for the initial ml model f x is defined as an additive model with features x i e 1 f x g x ϕ 0 i 1 m ϕ i x i eq 1 decomposes the total water demand into individual contributions from each driving factor based on this decomposition the feature importance is defined as the percentage that the absolute value of each driving factor s contribution represents as a component of the total water demand feature importance is calculated as 2 feature importance i ϕ i i 1 m ϕ i 100 where m represents the number of features ϕ 0 represents the average value of water demand across all samples ϕ i represents the shap value i e the contribution corresponding to feature i here x equals 1 when feature i is observed else x equals 0 eq 1 indicates that the model generates a predicted value for each sample the shap value reflects the magnitude of each feature s contribution to that predicted value in comparison traditional feature importance indicates only which feature is important and provided no information on how that feature affects the predicted values lundberg et al 2018 the shap method offers a significant advantage in that shap values can reveal the effect size of each feature including both positive and negative effects feature importance expressed as a shap value is defined as 3 ϕ i s f i s f s 1 f f x x s i f x x s here s is the feature subset f is the set of all input features x s i is the values of the input features in set s i x s is the values of the input features in set s f x x s i is the predicted value for feature x s i and f x x s is the predicted value for feature x s the standard deviation sd serves as the primary quantitative measure of uncertainty burr et al 2021 however due to variations in water demand across different cities it is necessary to standardize the uncertainties of different cities into a dimensionless quantity to facilitate meaningful comparison thus based on shap values the uncertainty of feature i for each city is defined as 4 uncertaint y i s d i 1 n j 1 n i 1 m ϕ i j 100 where s d i is the standard deviation of the shap values of feature i n is the number of shap values of feature i m is the number of features and ϕ i j is the shap value 2 6 evaluation of model performance model performance evaluation is a multidisciplinary research field with any given evaluation metric finding essential use in various domains botchkarev 2018 in ml regression models evaluation metrics are typically applied to compare a model s forecasted values with real world data from a testing dataset in order to assess the model s quality and to select an appropriate forecasting model makridakis et al 2018 we used several common evaluation metrics to test the accuracy and feasibility of various ml models for water demand forecasting the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae a high r 2 value corresponds to high consistency between actual observations and predicted values while rmse punishes models with large deviations and is typically utilized for selecting the most suitable model for the data meanwhile mae prefers models with minor absolute deviations on average therefore better model performance is indicated by a larger r 2 value but smaller rmse and mae values the r 2 rmse and mae metrics were calculated as follows respectively 5 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 1 n y i y 2 6 rmse billion m 3 1 n i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 7 mae billion m 3 1 n i 1 n y i y ˆ i here y i and y ˆ i represent the actual water demand and the predicted value respectively y is the average value of the actual observations and n is the number of samples 3 results 3 1 model selection our aim here was to obtain a high performance water demand forecasting model to explore the driving factors of water demand in this study the dataset containing the target and 13 features was divided into training and test sets with data from years 2005 through 2017 forming the training set and data from years 2018 through 2020 comprising the test set the parameters were adjusted with the tenfold cv method to obtain the parameter combinations that yielded the best generalization performance in the training set the model was then tested using the test set and evaluation metrics were calculated table 2 generally the results obtained from the test set better reflect the model s generalization performance and robustness than the training set thus the following conclusions are drawn from the results shown in table 2 1 the four nonlinear calculation based models namely xgboost rf svm and k nn all demonstrated significantly better water demand forecasting performance than the mlr model this finding demonstrates not only that water demand is driven by multiple factors but that there are complex nonlinear relationships between water demand and these factors 2 the r 2 values for the xgboost rf svm k nn and mlr models were 0 967 0 944 0 962 0 960 and 0 861 respectively the r 2 value for xgboost was higher than those for other models demonstrating that the xgboost model s forecasted values better matched the actual water demand values the magnitude relationship of rmse values was xgboost svm k nn rf lr again indicating the outstanding performance of xgboost this same trend was the observed for the mae values these results indicate that the xgboost model had the smallest error among the five models tested overall r 2 rmse and mae values obtained for the xgboost model indicate that it outperformed the other models in forecasting water demand in the bth region therefore we decided to use the xgboost model for the remaining portion of the study while putting aside all other models this allowed us to focus our resources on the model that showed the greatest potential for success 3 2 feature selection in this study we developed an xgboost model for water demand forecasting and proposed a feature selection method based on the shap method fig 4 displays the feature selection process and we observed that the change point occurred when the eighth most important feature was eliminated this finding indicates the satisfactory performance of xgboost models with at least eight input features in water demand forecasting the main driving factors for water demand were identified as rp pd ur ia avsi pdi aat and twr according to their contributions see table 1 for feature abbreviation explanations after careful analysis it was determined that the remaining features did not provide additional information beyond what was already captured by other features in the dataset as such these features were considered redundant and were no longer included in the analysis for this study 3 3 analysis of driving factors 3 3 1 identification of driving factors given the critical role that water demand forecasting plays in water resource management and planning it is crucial to obtain an accurate and meaningful interpretation and explanation of the forecasting results the shap method was used in this study to calculate shap values which indicate the contribution of each feature in the model to the predicted water demand a comprehensive understanding of how the model generates general predictions can be obtained by aggregating these shap values feature importance was determined by averaging the absolute shap values for the various features across all actual observations we used absolute values in order to prevent positive and negative values from canceling each other out fig 5 shows the order of feature importance across different city types agricultural industrial and service based arranged from top largest to bottom smallest the results reveal differences among city types in the factors driving water demand in agricultural cities the most three important factors were rp aat and ia meanwhile in industrial cities the most important factors were rp avsi and aat finally in service based cities the demographic factor rp contributed more than 50 of the water demand with avsi and ia acting as key secondary factors the results of the study indicate that population size exerts a substantial impact on water demand in the bth region notably the effect was most pronounced in service based cities where it contributed 50 30 of water demand the population effect was comparatively weaker in other city types though it still showed the highest feature importance 31 79 in agricultural cities 39 72 in industrial cities in agricultural cities the second and third most influential factors were temperature 18 39 contribution and ia 16 87 contribution in industrial cities the primary factors affecting water demand other than population size were the avsi 17 05 contribution and temperature 15 57 contribution these findings highlight that population factors are the most important factors of water demand with the main factors found to be consistent with the industrial structure of the city moreover fig 5d shows the uncertainty of the main driving factors indicating that the environmental factors of aat and twr are the most significant sources of uncertainty in water demand forecasting in the bth region 3 3 2 changes in feature importance the factors identified as driving water demand in the bth region were rp ia pd ur avsi pdi aat and twr the feature importance of these factors exhibited changes over the period 2005 2020 fig 6 attributed here to various causes such as urban expansion economic development land use change and climate variability specifically we found that some factors such as rp fig 6a ur fig 6c and pdi fig 6f exhibited similar secular trends in feature importance across different city types indicating that these changes were related to socioeconomic development rather than the city type notably there was a consistent decline in the feature importance of rp starting in 2012 with average annual decreases of approximately 2 00 1 22 and 0 74 in agricultural industrial and service based cities respectively on the other hand changes in the feature importance of some factors such as ia fig 6d avsi fig 6e and aat fig 6g were found to be closely linked to city type for instance between 2005 and 2020 the effect of aat on water demand increased substantially in agricultural cities rising from 10 85 to 26 59 conversely in industrial cities this impact significantly decreased from 21 73 to 10 56 whereas in service based cities the change was relatively minor dropping from 8 14 to 6 18 furthermore some features such as pd fig 6b and twr fig 6h showed continuous fluctuations in feature importance these results underscore the need for targeted policies and strategies that account for the unique water demand characteristics of different city types in the bth region 3 3 3 quantification of driving factors fig 7 displays a summary plot of the obtained shap values effectively showcasing the magnitude and distribution of the effects of the input features on water demand each point in fig 7 represents a shap value corresponding to that feature for a given sample here the x axis displays the shap value while the y axis depicts the input features in order of importance from the largest at the top to the smallest at the bottom the color of each dot indicates the value of the input feature with blue indicating low values and red indicating high values specifically the points on the right side of fig 7 represent positive shap values whereas the points on the left side represent negative shap values analyzing the plot we found that higher values of rp represented by red dots on the right side of the rp row tended to enhance the performance of the xgboost model in forecasting water demand conversely higher values of aat represented by red dots on the left side of the aat row had an adverse effect on the model s forecasting performance these insights can help policymakers and stakeholders to develop effective strategies for regional water resource management fig 8 depicts the changes in shap values in response to variations in driving factors offering further insights into the distribution and variability of water demand for each input feature the red lines in the figure panels illustrate the fitting lines obtained using the least squares method the solid lines signify significant results p 0 05 whereas the dotted lines indicate non significant results here negative positive shap values correspond to an inhibiting facilitating effect on water demand based on the regional average for a given feature the following results can be drawn from an analysis of fig 8 1 among social factors fig 8a 8d rp showed a nonlinear positive correlation with water demand in agricultural industrial and service based cities indicating that water demand was higher at higher population sizes pd on the other hand did not exhibit a significant relationship with water demand the relationship between ur and water demand showed a critical point which is a value at which the correlation behavior between a feature and water demand changes in this study we observed a critical point for ur at 70 with a negative correlation below 70 but a positive relationship above 70 furthermore fig 8d reveals a clear city dependent relationship between ia and water demand 2 among economic factors fig 8e and 8f we observed a strong positive correlation between avsi and water demand indicating that the economic development of a city increased the city s water demand regarding the effect of pdi on water demand we found a critical point at 25 000 cny with a negative correlation between pdi and water demand below 25 000 cny but a positive correlation above 25 000 cny 3 among environmental factors fig 8g and 8h we found that the relationship between temperature and water demand was not significant however we did observe a critical point for the relationship between twr and water demand at a value of 1 75 billion m3 this finding indicates that as twr gradually increased the water demand initially rose proportionally but eventually reached a threshold beyond which any further increase in twr was associated with a decline in demand 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of driving factors in different city types the findings above show that differences among city types in terms of industrial structure and functional positioning are associated with significant differences in the sets of factors driving water demand in the bth region water demand in agricultural cities was driven mainly by rp aat and ia while water demand in industrial cities was driven mainly by rp avsi and aat water demand in service based cities was driven primarily by rp with its impact accounting for more than 50 of total water demand similar findings have been reported in previous studies specifically ia avsi and rp have been identified as the primary driving factors for agricultural li et al 2021 industrial zhang and shen 2015 and domestic boretti and rosa 2019 water demand respectively thus changes in urban industrial structure especially trends in the development of major industries are critical to water demand forecasting the present study goes beyond identifying the driving factors closely associated with the predominant industries in each city underscoring as well the significant influence of temperature on water demand hence climate variability is also a crucial determinant of water demand for various cities the temperature component of climate showed dramatic changes in water demand over time fig 6g notably these dramatic changes differed by city type as reviewed above the impact of temperature and climate variability more broadly on water demand deserves further research further analysis based on feature importance trends is needed in order to predict future feature importance optimize water demand forecasting models and improve forecasting accuracy in sum attaining sustainable water resource management requires an accurate forecast of future water demand which in turn necessitates that planners identify the main factors driving water demand based on the current and future industrial structure of the city 4 2 critical points of driving factors quantifying the correlation between each feature and water demand allowed the identification of critical points in the effects of several features such as ur fig 8c pdi fig 8f and twr fig 8h an illustrative instance is the relationship between water demand and ur which exhibited a negative correlation below 70 but a positive correlation above 70 similarly pdi showed a critical point at 25 000 cny shifting from negative to positive correlation while twr showed a critical point at 1 75 billion m3 shifting from positive to negative correlation ur and pdi are important indicators for measuring the level of urban development and standard of living gober 2010 and li et al 2020 have reported that rapid urbanization contributes to escalating water demand and exacerbates water scarcity issues at present there is little research on the critical points for water demand with respect to urban development but previous studies on urban scale have yielded similar results as the critical point between ur and water demand sun et al 2017 identified an important threshold value for ur in china noting that a ur value of 70 marks the transition from the rapid growth stage to the stable development stage of urbanization meanwhile lu et al 2022 research based on land use found that the main stage of agricultural land conversion to residential and industrial land use takes place between 30 and 70 ur agricultural water demand per unit area is often larger than that for industrial or domestic areas so a decline in total regional water demand results from initial urbanization in contrast when ur 70 the combined effect of urban density and living standards changes leads to increases in water demand thus while rapid urbanization can contribute to water scarcity the relationship between urbanization and water demand is nuanced and varies depending on the real world context the relationship between pdi and water demand showed a critical point similar in character to that of ur at 25 000 cny indicating that the effect of pdi growth on water demand underwent a significant change at this threshold transforming from an inhibiting to a facilitating role this transformation is attributable to the high correlation between urbanization and income making it challenging to disentangle their effects jedwab and vollrath 2015 we also identified a critical point for the relationship between twr and water demand for the bth region 1 75 billion m³ research has shown that the supply of water resources is a key factor that affects water demand when water resources are scarce water demand is inevitably constrained by the limited availability of water boretti and rosa 2019 at larger amounts of total water resources the inhibiting effect on water demand is somewhat weaker conversely when water resources are abundant and the supply exceeds demand further increases in water resources tend to reduce the demand for agricultural irrigation chen et al 2020 as well as the demand for residential and ecological water bao et al 2020 leading to a decrease in overall water demand the identification and analysis of critical points in water demand are important for accurate water demand forecasting particularly in rapidly developing urban areas the accuracy of the quantitative relationship between the driving factors and water demand may be affected by the selected research year and spatial range in this study critical points were identified in the relationships between water demand and ur pdi and twr in the bth region whereas no such patterns were observed in the other driving factors however it remains possible that critical points perhaps multiple in number exist for these factors but were not detected within the study period and region therefore further research including comparisons and investigations from other regions is required to confirm our findings 4 3 uncertainty of water demand forecasting long term water demand forecasting is a complex and challenging task that demands a thorough understanding of its driving factors previous studies have recognized environmental factors as one of the major sources of uncertainty in the water demand forecasting herman et al 2020 zubaidi et al 2020 in this study we investigated the influence of social economic and environmental factors on water demand to provide a comprehensive understanding of the driving forces our findings in the bth region demonstrated that environmental factors particularly temperature substantially contribute to the uncertainty in the water demand forecasting fig 5d highlighting the need to consider these factors in such projections as a climate variable temperature and the spatiotemporal precision of temperature data significantly affect water demand forecasting models making temperature the most critical source of uncertainty due to this sensitivity the data source and data processing methods may also have subtle effects in this study the original temperature data used were daily surface 2 meter temperature data measured at multiple meteorological stations with the data for each city estimated by the inverse distance weighting method similarly other climatic data such as precipitation and sunshine hours were obtained through the same method applied to daily data from nearby meteorological stations notably in bangkok babel et al 2014 and new south wales haque et al 2015 temperature was found to have a more significant effect on water demand than precipitation or sunshine hours whereas in germany temperature was not found to have any measurable effect at all schleich and hillenbrand 2009 these findings emphasize the need to identify the key driving factors of water demand specific to each region as environmental factors affecting water demand can vary greatly depending on geographic location temperature has a complex impact on water demand with various factors influencing demand in different regions and contexts in regions where water resources are abundant rising temperatures can instigate higher water losses and augmented irrigation demand due to heightened transpiration rates of crops and soils guo and shen 2016 additionally elevated temperatures can lead to the potential for decreased crop yields necessitating increased irrigation to compensate for the loss berardy and chester 2017 moreover industrial water demand can rise when temperatures are high as processes such as power generation and manufacturing require substantial amounts of cooling water wang et al 2018 conversely in regions where water resources are scarce insufficient water supply frequently restricts water demand boretti and rosa 2019 paradoxically higher temperatures may result in a decrease in water demand despite the anticipated rise in demand due to increased evapotranspiration rates furthermore rasifaghihi et al 2020 reported that water demand can be divided into basic water demand and seasonal water demand they showed that the effect of temperature on seasonal water demand is particularly uncertain temperature fluctuations throughout the year thus also impact water demand given that temperature presents the most important environment factor for water demand forecasting in the bth region water managers should prioritize efforts to mitigate its impact such efforts could involve adjustments to agricultural and industrial structures such as the cultivation of heat resistant crops the development of water efficient industries and the implementation of targeted cropping to reduce water losses due to increased transpiration rates 5 conclusion in this paper we proposed a novel framework for water demand forecasting and for analysis of driving factors based on ml and xai the shap method was introduced to identify and quantify the factors driving water demand the proposed framework was applied to the bth region in china we found that the framework improved the model s effectiveness by reducing feature redundancy by 38 our primary conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 overall population size was the most critical factor influencing water demand particularly in service based cities where its effect exceeded 50 in agricultural and industrial cities the effect of population size was slightly weaker ranging from approximately 30 40 but it was still the single most important factor for agricultural cities the second and third most significant factors were temperature and irrigated areas with effect sizes of 18 39 and 16 87 respectively in contrast water demand in industrial cities was affected by the avsi and by temperature with effect sizes of 17 05 and 15 57 respectively 2 the feature importance of driving factors changed over time notably the effect of temperature on water demand in agricultural cities grew significantly over time increasing in feature importance by 1 14 per year on average in contrast the effect of temperature on water demand decreased over time in industrial and service based cities falling by 0 76 per year on average in industrial cities and by 0 11 per year on average in service based cities the feature importance of population size showed a decreasing trend most significantly in agricultural cities with a decrease of 2 00 per year on average 3 the proposed framework successfully quantified the complex interactions of driving factors with water demand in the bth region we identified critical points for various factors at which the correlation between the factor and water demand shifted from facilitation to inhibition or vice versa this information can be used to pinpoint key points at which driving effects change for example ur was negatively correlated with water demand below a ur value of 70 but was positively correlated with water demand above 70 similarly critical points for pdi and twr were found to be 25 000 cny and 1 75 billion m3 respectively in addition it is essential to recognize that societal behaviors such as residential water use habits and the adoption of water conservation measures in various industries can also significantly influence water demand future research should include an examination of these behaviors to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that drive water demand this study incorporates the shap method in water demand forecasting utilizing the xai technique to uncover novel insights into the driving factors and demonstrate the efficacy of shap for factor analysis the findings of this study have important practical implications for water resource management the proposed framework can be further applied in other regions worldwide but regional differences need to be carefully considered in model selection and feature selection policymakers can make more informed decisions about water allocation and conservation efforts by gaining a clearer understanding of the factors driving water demand credit authorship contribution statement zhigang ou conceptualization data curation

7658,study region poldokhtar city is located on the bank of the kashkan river in iran study focus this study presents a probabilistic modeling framework for flood risk assessment using monte carlo simulations we developed a machine learning ml based flood depth prediction model for poldokhtar city using the least squares support vector machine hec ras was utilized for 2d flood modeling and its performance was evaluated by comparing simulated and remote sensing derived flood extent maps the simulated results were used to develop a surrogate ml based model that predicts flood depth maps finally we used this model to estimate the flood risk of poldokhtar city as a combination of hazard exposure and vulnerability for 10000 flood scenarios new hydrological insights for the region the mean annual flood damage of the city based on the proposed framework is us 1177034 which is about three times lower than that calculated using the simplified method used in the classical risk analysis us 3455400 buildings near the floodwalls of the river and in the southwestern parts of the city have higher mean flood losses than those in other areas risk index frequencies of buildings reveal the most at risk zones in the city where there have been building constructions without considering flood hazards the proposed framework would be of use to stakeholders such as policymakers to develop effective flood management strategies graphical abstract ga1 keywords risk analysis monte carlo simulation machine learning least squares support vector machine two dimensional hydrodynamic modeling flood modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rapid and unsustainable urbanization increases flood impacts and risks hammond et al 2015 incorrectly designed and poorly maintained drainage systems along with the unsustainable development near river channels and on floodplains increase the risk of flooding liu et al 2016 sadegh et al 2018 moreover flood risks are expected to increase in the future because of climate change bates et al 2008 bouwer 2011 giorgi et al 2011 stocker et al 2013 malaekeh et al 2022 and socio economical changes hallegatte et al 2013 the historical data supports the idea of increasing the flood risk in the future previous research shows that during 1970 1989 there was us 51 8 billion in flood damage while from 1990 to 2011 there was us 496 billion in flood damage em dat 2012 it is also expected that flood losses will increase to about us 52 billion per year by 2050 without consideration of climate change impacts hallegatte et al 2013 the world s current urban population is over half which will increase to 66 by 2050 world urbanization 2014 in iran the urban population increased from 64 2 in 2000 to 75 94 in 2019 and is expected to rise to 85 82 in 2050 uno 2018 unplanned settlements in flood prone areas as well as the high population density multiple economic activities lots of infrastructure and property values contribute to relatively high flood risk in urban areas de risi 2013 pelling 2003 many studies have using qualitative risk assessment to perform flood risk analysis in urban areas e g harvey et al 2009 leitão et al 2013 weerasinghe et al 2018 however it was found that qualitative flood risk mapping is not an effective tool for flood risk management because the results of them cannot be used in the cost benefit analysis of flood mitigation measures to assess the risk of flood hazards quantitatively flood risk can be defined as a function of the probability of a flood event occurring and its negative consequences gouldby and samuels 2005 kubal et al 2009 another approach would be assembling vulnerability indicators or establishing integrated vulnerability indices emphasizing social vulnerabilities for different natural disasters fekete 2009 kaplan et al 2009 king 2001 alternatively flood risk management can be based on spatial multicriteria which seeks to evaluate flood mitigation measures rather than assessing and mapping flood risk simonovic and nirupama 2005 tkach and simonovic 1997 another method is to define flood risk as a combination of hazard exposure and vulnerability kron 2005 known as the crichton risk triangle crichton 1999 nevertheless the flood damage modeling has limitations in representing flood risks and cost benefit aspects scorzini and leopardi 2017 in quantitative flood risk assessment expected annual damage ead is used as a common indicator for flood risk r which is expressed as follows merz et al 2009 1 r e a d h 0 f h d h d h where d h is the damage caused by inundation depth h f h is the probability density function of inundation depth h and h 0 is the flood inundation depth threshold one approach to estimate the flood risk in eq 1 is to calculate flood losses for n flood events of different exceedance probabilities and determine the ead as follows scorzini and leopardi 2017 2 e a d j 1 n δ p j d j where δ p j and d j are respectively the exceedance probability increment and average damage of two events with exceedance probabilities p j and p j 1 some studies used an approach similar to eq 2 to estimate the ead e g castillo rodríguez et al 2016 scorzini and leopardi 2017 țîncu et al 2020 however the use of eq 2 has an error due to its approximation by using only a limited number of simulations to estimate the ead unlike previous studies we did not simplify eq 1 and we modeled flood risk quantitatively as a combination of hazard exposure and vulnerability by simulating 10000 flood events each representing an annual flood hazard calculating each one s cost vulnerability based on building information data exposure one of the most important steps of flood risk analysis is determining flood depth many studies have been conducted to simulate floods in floodplains by using one dimensional 1d and two dimensional 2d models e g bates and de roo 2000 di baldassarre et al 2010 neal et al 2012 while 1d models can represent the process in the river channel 2d numerical simulations are required to model flood wave dynamics on floodplains falter et al 2013 tayefi et al 2007 there are many 2 d hydrodynamic models which are capable of determination of flood depth properly for example sobek deltares systems 2019 lisflood fp horritt and bates 2002 telemac 2d lang et al 2014 hec ras 2d usace 2016 and mike flood danish hydraulics institute 2020 the 2d hydrodynamic models were used in some studies to analyze the flood risk e g arrighi et al 2018 rudari et al 2016 yalcin 2019 although the computational nature of mechanistic models makes them useful for understanding the system they are less practical for direct applications safaie et al 2016 for instance the use of 2d hydrodynamic models in the flood risk assessment limits the number of intensive repetitive calculations due to their high computational costs therefore to perform repetitive calculations such as monte carlo simulations mcss it is necessary to have a flood depth model that is capable of determining the spatial distribution of flood depth quickly to achieve this goal we developed a machine learning surrogate model that predicts flood water depth maps to be used for the flood risk assessment only a few studies used machine learning ml and deep learning dl methods for the flood inundation mapping and depth modeling based on the size of the training dataset the definition of input and output variables and the application of the developed model different ml methods have been used to create a fast implementing flood depth model such as support vector regression svr liu and pender 2015 least squares support vector machine ls svm regression bermúdez et al 2019 a combination of artificial neural network ann classifier with nonlinear autoregressive exogenous r narx chang et al 2018 gradient boosting decision tree gbdt wu et al 2020 ann berkhahn et al 2019 deep convolutional neural network kabir et al 2020 and a combination of random forest classification and multilayer perceptron hosseiny et al 2020 the ls svm method has been demonstrated to have higher accuracy and efficiency than other ml methods heddam et al 2022 jhong et al 2017 lin et al 2013 in some of the previous studies only one type of hydrograph hyetograph shape was used to train the ml models hosseiny et al 2020 liu and pender 2015 wu et al 2020 therefore if the input hydrograph hyetograph has a different shape from those used for training the model the model may not have an acceptable accuracy in predicting the flood inundation map moreover in some other studies only the maximum flood depth was estimated for each event e g berkhahn et al 2019 therefore they cannot be used in real time forecasts and resilience analysis applications furthermore many of the previous studies used rainfall as an input of the ml based model berkhahn et al 2019 chang et al 2018 wu et al 2020 however in areas that are located on banks of rivers e g poldokhtar city where floods are mainly fluvial using discharge hydrographs as the input of the flood model is considered as a suitable solution therefore in this study we proposed a method to develop a surrogate model that predicts water depth for the whole time series of flood events based on the river discharge hydrographs with different shapes and durations our study proposed a new framework that uses a surrogate ml based flood model in the monte carlo simulation to estimate the flood risk while previous studies only used a limited number of simulations to estimate expected annual damage ead we estimated the flood risk as a combination of hazard exposure and vulnerability by simulating 10000 flood events in this paper the proposed framework for flood risk assessment was used for the probabilistic modeling of flood damages for poldokhtar city which is located on the bank of the kashkan river in lorestan province in iran this river basin has experienced several extreme floods with a discharge of over 1000 cms and the latest flood occurred in march 2019 geravand et al 2020 in spite of that flood studies in this river basin are very limited and no flood risk assessment for poldokhtar city has been investigated in previous works yet for example moghim et al 2023 developed two hydraulic models including hec ras 2d and lisflood fp to simulate floods in the kashkan basin however they only analyzed the impacts of using different digital elevation models and roughness coefficients on river flood simulations thus this is the first attempt to conduct the flood risk assessment for poldokhtar city to this end we developed an ls svm model based on results of the hec ras 2d hydrodynamic model to be used in monte carlo simulations the performance of the hec ras model was evaluated by comparison of simulated and remote sensing derived flood extent maps the present study consists of two main phases i developing the ls svm model and ii performing monte carlo simulations for probabilistic flood risk assessment the detailed procedure of each phase is introduced in section 2 2 materials and methods as mentioned in the introduction section the present study has two main phases the first phase starts by developing the 2d hydrodynamic flood model the model performance was evaluated based on a flood event s extent driven by satellite imagery then based on the characteristics of the observed flood hydrographs and historical hydrometric data 20 hydrographs were generated in the next step flood modeling was performed for each of these synthetic events using the calibrated model next using the results of these 20 simulations an ls svm based model was trained and evaluated then in a monte carlo framework flood depth map time series for 10000 flood scenarios were computed using the developed ls svm model finally flood damage and cost for each building in each scenario were estimated based on depth damage curves and building information data in addition the results of the proposed framework have been compared to the result of the classical risk assessment method based on eq 2 the flowchart of the main steps of the present study is shown in fig 1 a detailed method explanation will be provided in the following 2 1 study area poldokhtar city 33 8 n 47 43 e is the capital of poldokhtar county in lorestan province and is located near the outlet of the kashkan river basin in iran the city covers an area of 397 ha and has 26352 residents kashkan river flows through this city and frequently causes flood damage the frequent flooding of the river has caused the evacuation of the city the destruction of buildings and consequent financial losses especially in march 2019 this city experienced an unprecedented flood during this event the discharge of the kashkan river reached over 4000 cms after this event floodwalls were constructed along the western and eastern banks of the river fig 2 the aerial view of the study area is shown in fig 2 the city has been divided into 13 zones with almost similar areas to analyze flood risk zonally poldokhtar city has 7868 buildings including 613 commercial buildings 78 educational buildings 12 higher educational buildings 30 medical centers 176 industrial buildings 141 office buildings four recreational buildings 21 religious buildings 6785 residential buildings and eight sports buildings the building replacement cost and the contents value of different occupancy types are illustrated in table 1 based on hazus inventory technical manual fema 2021 2 2 developing a machine learning based flood depth prediction model the flood depth of each building has been calculated using a least squares support vector machine ls svm model see the details in section 2 2 4 in order to train this model hec ras results were used see the details in section 2 2 3 first the two dimensional flood simulations based on twenty hydrographs generated for poldokhtar station fig 2 see the details in section 2 2 2 as the upstream boundary condition the topographic data and the land cover maps of the city see the details in section 2 2 1 were performed in hec ras software version 5 0 4 then the results of fifteen simulations were used to train the ls svm model and the rest were used to test the model the detailed process of developing this model has been explained in the following sections 2 2 1 data the topographic data of the study area is based on the digital elevation model dem products of the shuttle radar topography mission srtm with a spatial resolution of 30 m river cross sections were surveyed upstream of the city by the regional water authority of lorestan province in 2015 with a resolution of 0 5 m the ground surveyed river cross section measurements were integrated with dem to generate the river geometry schäppi et al 2010 the flow data were obtained from the regional water company of lorestan in two datasets for poldokhtar station 1 maximum daily discharges from 1956 to 2019 and 2 hourly hydrographs of floods from 2009 to 2018 the regional water authority of lorestan province has quality control processes in place for all observational measurements the city s land use map was obtained from poldokhtar municipality based on this map and landsat 8 satellite images the land cover map was created to determine manning s n coefficients using these land use maps and the method suggested by curtis 2016 and usace 2016 the final manning s n was considered as 0 08 for urban areas 0 04 for rocky lands 0 045 for channels 0 06 for open shrublands and 0 05 for farmlands 2 2 2 generating synthetic hydrographs generating synthetic hydrograph for the first time was introduced by snyder 1938 to be used in ungauged basins many studies were done on this topic to improve the representation of the hydrograph s shape in this method e g serinaldi and grimaldi 2011 yue et al 2002 in the current study the following procedure fig 3 was used to consider the uncertainty of hydrograph shapes which was not considered in the previous studies hydrographs mainly have three characteristics 1 maximum discharge 2 duration and 3 shape of the hydrograph based on the historical data and chi squared test the best distribution for annual maximum discharge at poldokhtar station has been estimated the final ls svm model needs to be accurate for different hydrographs so generated maximum discharge values should cover a wide range of discharge rates therefore the maximum discharge of each hydrograph is randomly generated based on a uniform distribution in a range of 1 yr to 10000 yr maximum discharge values determined based on the best distribution of annual maximum discharge the other two characteristics the hydrograph s duration and shape were determined by analyzing thirty five available flood hydrographs of poldokhtar station from 2009 to 2018 as a result the best distribution of hydrographs duration is defined based on the kolmogorov smirnov test on the observed hydrographs to determine the last characteristic each of the observed flood hydrographs of poldokhtar station transformed into a dimensionless space then the time range 1 1 was divided into 400 timesteps in each time step we have 35 dimensionless discharges based on these values a lognormal distribution was fitted to the data then each timestep s dimensionless discharge of synthetic hydrographs was generated randomly based on these distributions these synthetic hydrographs were used as the upstream boundary condition of the hec ras model 2 2 3 hec ras modeling the hec ras 5 0 4 model can solve either the 2d st venant equations or 2d diffusion wave equations in this study the 2d diffusion wave equation method was selected as follows usace 2016 3 n 2 v v r h 4 3 h by dividing both sides of the equation by the square root of their norms and rearranging them 4 v r h 2 3 n h h 1 2 where v is the velocity vector m

poldokhtar city with an upstream boundary condition of the synthetic discharge hydrograph of the kashkan river at the location of the poldokhtar hydrometric station furthermore the downstream boundary condition was considered as a normal depth of 0 005 hec ras can be used in either a fully 2d model or as a 1d 2d hybrid model the second choice needs to determine the connection between the 1d river and 2d floodplain area quirogaa et al 2016 the overflow location is necessary to determine these connections quirogaa et al 2016 since the overflow locations were unknown for the study area the fully 2d model was selected in this study to ensure the model is stable the timestep was estimated based on courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition eq 5 7 c r c δ t δ x g h δ t δ x where c r is the courant number c is the celerity m s δ t is the timestep s δ x is the grid cell size m g is the gravitational acceleration m2 s and h is the flow depth m for diffusion wave equations in hec ras the courant number can be as high as five and it still provides stable and accurate results usace 2016 the grid cell size was considered 30 m and using an iterative method the maximum flow depth between simulations was estimated at about 15 m therefore the timestep of 10 s was selected finally to evaluate the performance of the hec ras model the flood extent map was determined based on sentinel 1 synthetic aperture radar sar c band and compared with the flood extent map generated by the hec ras model for a flood event that occurred in march and april of 2019 the fitness index fi method eq 8 was used to compare inundated areas based on a hydrodynamic model and remote sensing derived inundated areas bates and de roo 2000 8 f i i a s a t i a mod i a s a t i a mod 100 where ia sat and ia mod are inundated areas from satellite imagery and model respectively 2 2 4 ls svm method the ls svm method was derived from the original support vector machines svm model vapnik 1998 a kernel based method for linear and nonlinear classification and regression problems suykens et al 2002 the model is based on the concept of transforming data from an original feature space into a higher dimensional feature space suykens et al 2002 this method s precision depends on several factors such as the kernel function the kernel parameter σ and the regularization parameter γ shi and gindy 2007 the radial basis function rbf is usually selected among different kernel functions because of its good features such as its ability to reduce the training process computational complexity and to improve the generalization performance of ls svm shi and gindy 2007 based on cross validation the simplex method was used to determine the kernel and regularization parameters then the model was trained based on the rbf kernel function and the tuned parameters the ml based flood depth prediction model was developed using the ls svmlab toolbox brabanter et al 2003 the algorithm presented in this study used each timestep s discharge and its six antecedent discharges of the hydrograph as explanatory variables the dependent variable is the depth of flood in each cell the domain of this model contains 8464 cells that cover the city s flood prone areas with a cell size of 30 m the results of 15 simulations of hec ras were used as the training dataset and five simulations of them were used as the test dataset for the ls svm model each row of the explanatory variables has seven columns and each row of the dependent variables has 8464 columns based on this dataset 8464 models for each cell were trained separately then they were included in a single model that returns the predicted depth of all cells for each row of explanatory variables 2 3 flood risk analysis 2 3 1 monte carlo simulation a monte carlo sampling with a sample size of 10000 simulations was conducted to analyze the city s flood risk in each sample based on the probability distribution of the maximum discharge and duration of flood hydrographs these two parameters were generated randomly with a correlation coefficient of 0 59 calculated based on the observed hydrographs then the cholesky decomposition method was used to generate correlated samples based on the calculated correlation coefficient besides the hydrograph shape was made based on the procedure mentioned in section 2 2 2 and the flood hydrograph of each sample was created as the ls svm model s input the generated hydrograph was used to estimate the maximum flood depth for each building this value was used to determine the damage ratio of each building using minimal buildings fragility functions mbff method in terms of contents and structural damage then based on building information data the total cost of each building was determined finally the city s total flood damage cost for each scenario is calculated by summing up the buildings damage cost for that event table 2 shows the parameters of damage curves for different classes used in this study based on the mbff method nofal and van de lindt 2020 the building archetypes descriptions of different types in table 2 are illustrated in table 3 nofal and van de lindt 2020 finally a new risk index for determining the vulnerability of buildings was defined as eq 9 this index is defined based on the ratio of the expected total loss of each building during its lifetime to its total replacement cost 9 r i s k i n d e x i e l d i t r c i l d e a d i t r c i where e l d i is the expected lifetime damage l d is the average lifetime duration of buildings e a d i is the expected annual damage of building i and t r c i is the total replacement cost of building i 2 3 2 classical method in this method the ead was calculated based on eq 2 the same as scorzini and leopardi 2017 using three flood events with return periods of 10 100 and 1000 years therefore eq 2 will be simplified as the following 10 r i s k 1 t 1 s 1 1 t 2 1 t 1 s 1 s 2 2 1 t 3 1 t 2 s 2 s 3 2 where t 1 to t 3 are return periods of 1000 100 and 10 years respectively and s 1 to s 3 are the corresponding total damage cost of the city to generate the flood hydrographs and total damage cost estimation the same method as 2 3 1 has been used but the specified return periods were used for generating the maximum discharge of hydrographs finally the results of this classical risk assessment method were compared with those obtained based on the proposed framework in this study 3 results 3 1 machine learning based model results based on the method mentioned in section 2 2 2 the best distribution of annual maximum discharge at poldokhtar station was calculated as a three parameter lognormal distribution with µ of 5 9247 σ of 0 75215 and a location parameter of 33 675 therefore the 1 yr and 10000 yr maximum annual discharge rates were 33 675 cms and 6170 cms respectively furthermore the best distribution of hydrographs duration was estimated as a rayleigh distribution with a scale factor of 63 25 then values of maximum discharge duration and shape were generated randomly for each hydrograph based on the method mentioned in section 2 2 2 generated synthetic hydrographs of kashkan river at poldokhtar station using these three characteristics are plotted in fig 4 nash sutcliff efficiency and root mean squared percentage error rmspe of the dimensionless average of generated and observed hydrographs were 98 58 and 2 84 respectively comparison of the simulated and the satellite imagery based flood extent maps indicates that the developed hec ras model was able to simulate the flood extent map with a fi index of 76 91 fig 5 then the ls svm model was trained using the training dataset of hec ras results based on the test dataset the median of errors is zero and their mean is 6 46e 4 m which indicates that the ls svm of this study is an unbiased model the root mean squared error rmse of the ls svm results on the test dataset is about 0 006 m and the mean absolute error is 0 014 m the correlation coefficient of the hec ras and ls svm models results is 0 997 fig 6 shows the heatmap plot of the predicted depths based on the ls svm model vs the depths based on the hec ras model for the test dataset pixel values represent the density of predicted water depth values that fall in that pixel an ideal model would have colored pixels on its bisector and black pixels elsewhere as we can see the majority of colored pixels are close to the bisector of the plot which indicates that the ls svm results are correlated to the hec ras results the maximum error values over the entire domain for the test hydrographs no 4 8 10 12 and 16 were 2 34 1 93 1 94 2 57 and 2 12 m respectively 2 18 m on average as an example of the model s performance in predicting the water depth the results of the ls svm model and its error relative to the corresponding results of hec ras are displayed in fig 7 in this figure the water depth map was generated based on hydrograph 4 fig 4 in hour 32 3 2 flood risk results the monte carlo simulations were performed 10000 times to calculate the total loss of each building in each iteration based on the maximum flood water depth at the location of that building then the total flood loss of the city in each iteration is determined based on the sum of the repair costs of all buildings the exceedance probability curves of the city s total flood loss based on monte carlo simulations and the classical method are shown in fig 8 a monte carlo simulations have a mean total loss of us 1177034 and a standard deviation of us 11401367 the mean total loss estimated using the classical method is us 3455400 which is about three times higher than the mean total loss based on monte carlo simulations the classical method as shown in fig 8a uses simplifications for the estimation of the integral of the area under the curve which causes an overestimation of the mean total loss the coefficient of variation of 9 69 indicates that flood risk analysis needs to be conducted using a probabilistic framework fig 8b shows the importance of using the monte carlo framework in this study this figure shows the mean total cost of the city and its standard deviation versus the number of simulations in the monte carlo framework this figure indicates that by increasing the number of simulations the fluctuation of the mean total cost of the city is decreased and will converge to a specific amount us 1177034 the mean value can be used for the city s total annual flood insurance premium moreover the annual flood insurance premium of each building can be determined based on its mean flood loss fig 9 shows the mean loss of buildings in poldokhtar city buildings near the floodwalls of the kashkan river zones 5 and 8 as well as in the southwestern parts of the city zones 1 and 2 have higher mean flood losses than those in other areas these high values for flood losses could be because of the unplanned city development regardless of the flood hazard of the kashkan river in addition some buildings in zones 3 and 7 located far from the kashkan river were severely damaged by flooding since these areas are lowlands close to croplands which are vulnerable to flooding table 4 shows the risk index frequencies of the city s buildings based on the city zones based on an average life expectancy of 100 years for buildings the risk index was calculated using eq 9 for all buildings as it is reported in table 4 42 buildings in the city have a risk index greater than one which indicates that the total experienced damage cost during the buildings lifetime caused by floods is higher than the buildings value according to table 4 the most at risk zones in the city are zones 1 2 5 and 8 in order buildings in these areas close to the kashkan river have been constructed without considering riverine flood hazards due to frequent flood inundation in these parts of the city these areas have a high flood risk index with a value greater than 0 1 zone 2 has the largest share with 40 48 for risk indices higher than 1 furthermore within the risk index interval of 0 5 1 zone 2 has the most share with a share of 29 33 and within the risk index intervals of 0 25 0 5 and 0 1 0 25 zone 1 has the most share with a share of 28 49 and 29 93 respectively furthermore zones 9 13 did not experience any flooding between 10000 simulated events resulting in flood risk indexes of zero for buildings in these zones zones 9 13 besides zone 6 are the safest zones for city development purposes and can be considered for future city development plans 4 discussion in the current study an ml based flood depth prediction model was developed because of the limitations of using 2d hydrodynamic flood models for use in probabilistic frameworks the results showed that the developed model has high accuracy and much lower computational cost than 2d hydrodynamic models the fi index of 76 91 shows that the developed hec ras model has reasonable performance in simulating the inundated areas fig 5 this value of fi is in an acceptable range compared to values reported in the previous studies for instance the best fi score among different simulations conducted by bates and de roo 2000 was 81 9 which is also close to the best fi score of 73 65 reported by moghim et al 2023 as shown in fig 5 there are some minor discrepancies in flood extent near the kashkan river and in the city since the effects of infiltration and drainage facilities were not taken into account during the flood events rmse value of the ls svm results on the test dataset is about 0 006 m which is lower compared to 0 28 m in chang et al 2018 0 11 m in kabir et al 2020 and 0 14 m in hosseiny et al 2020 furthermore the mean absolute error is 0 014 m which is lower than 0 03 m reported in hosseiny et al 2020 as shown in fig 7 error values in most parts of the city were less than 1 m except for an area northwest of the city where there were only a few spots with red color that the absolute errors were up to 2 34 m in these spots the ground elevations of the grid cells in hec ras model were lower than those in the surrounding areas therefore these grid cells experienced ponding which caused a higher absolute error since there is no building in these spots it would be expected that the developed model could be used in monte carlo simulations without causing significant errors in damage estimation in addition these values of errors were determined based on the worst case scenario with the maximum flood discharge with a return period close to 5000 years nevertheless the maximum values of errors are still lower than 3 8 m and 5 m reported in hosseiny et al 2020 and guo et al 2021 respectively therefore the model is able to predict the maximum depth which is the main result needed for flood damage estimation with high accuracy one of the features of the proposed framework is that the flood inundated areas are directly simulated by the model however the probabilistic modeling system developed by apel et al 2006 for assessing flood risks was not able to calculate inundated areas directly moreover the ls svm model reduces the simulation time from average runtime of about 28 min to about 30 s on a core i7 2 4 ghz system which allows running a large number of simulations in a monte carlo framework due to its low computational cost and high accuracy this fast prediction model of flood depth would be used as a surrogate for 2d hydrodynamic models in the risk analysis in monte carlo simulations furthermore the model unlike the previous studies hosseiny et al 2020 liu and pender 2015 wu et al 2020 is not limited to predicting flood depth for only one shape type of flood hydrographs and it considers their uncertainty additionally the model estimates not only the maximum depth which is determined by previous studies e g berkhahn et al 2019 but it also predicts flood depth over time therefore it would also be used in real time flood forecasting applications in which estimating the flood depth during flood events is necessary the methodology which was conducted in this study allows risk quantification at a micro scale based on the detailed vulnerability analysis of the buildings damages the framework includes the flood loss analysis for 10000 synthetic flood events and the results would be used in risk analysis applications to help flood management unlike the study conducted by apel et al 2006 the proposed method is performed at a micro scale building level approach and the calculation of cost for each scenario is based on a detailed simulation of flood depth and estimation of corresponding damage for each building not using a predefined inflow damage cost function the mean annual flood damage calculated by this method is us 1177034 which is much lower than that calculated using the classical method us 3455400 however it is very common in the previous works to estimate the flood damage only based on a limited number of flood events for example the classical method proposed by scorzini and leopardi 2017 only uses three flood events since the high number of simulations performed here in order to estimate the flood risk for different flood events the method used in the current study does not have the error associated with the approximation of expected annual damage based on the classical method although poldokhtar city experiences floods every year no flood risk assessment for the city has been conducted before poldokhtar city was developed in the recent 60 years by diverting the kashkan river s channel and using its floodplains for developing the city simulated results show that the water levels in the river reach to more than 10 4 m during the flood see fig 7 which can lead to the failure of riverine bridges field studies in poldokhtar city also reported that a numerous number of bridges across the river were either significantly damaged or completely destroyed during the flood events in 2019 and 2020 mansouri and pouraminian 2022 in addition simulations showed that some city zones including the western area of the city are at high risk of flooding these results are consistent with the results of a study that investigated flood prone areas in the city through remote sensing from 1990 to 2020 asadi et al 2022 furthermore march 2019 s flood showed that the city is susceptible to flooding and needs to be improved and protected against the riverine flood afterward attempts were carried out including building floodwalls on the eastern and western coasts of the kashkan river however the current study showed that several city zones remain at high risk for flooding there could be proof that the city s development in these zones was a mistake of poor management contrary to this finding the development of residential areas in poldokhtar city in recent years has taken place in these flood prone areas that have a high flood risk asadi et al 2022 several solutions are suggested to be considered such as raising the floodwalls height or extending the walls downstream of the kashkan river to the city s end based on the framework used in this study these solutions can be evaluated in future studies by modeling improved flood protection structures and comparing the costs and benefits of building such structures 5 conclusions this study proposes a probabilistic modeling framework for flood risk assessment as a combination of hazard exposure and vulnerability based on 10000 flood scenarios for poldokhtar city the core of this framework is a surrogate ml based flood model to predict the hazard component the results of the ml based flood depth prediction model in poldokhtar city show that this model would be used as a surrogate for 2d hydrodynamic models and its features enable using it in iterative frameworks such as monte carlo simulations for probabilistic risk analysis probabilistic flood damage curves and flood hydrographs are used in this framework to model the uncertainty of hazard and vulnerability components the results indicated that the city s development on the kashkan river s floodplain had put several city zones at high risk of flooding resulting in excessive flood costs for the city in recent years it should be noted that the framework proposed in this study is not limited to poldokhtar city and would also be used in other areas of study in addition since the ml based model predicts the water depth during floods it would be used to model flood interruptions during a flood event in the city system such as the effect of the flood on the road network the disruption of businesses and the recovery process in a resilience analysis the present study attempted to introduce a probabilistic framework to consider the uncertainty in flood hazard occurrence and damage estimation to consider the uncertainty associated with the random choice of training hydrographs future studies can use a sensitivity analysis based on choosing different subsets of hec ras results as training and test datasets in addition the proposed framework is not limited to the methods used in the present work for flood and machine learning modeling and any other method can be substituted in this framework in future studies to consider the uncertainty of choosing the ml model in monte carlo framework it is suggested to use different ml based methods as the surrogate model besides the ls svm method then in each scenario in monte carlo simulations one model can be chosen randomly to predict the flood depth the other uncertainty which is not considered in the present study is the uncertainty associated with damage functions to consider this uncertainty it is suggested to use different depth damage functions instead of using only mbff damage functions furthermore besides the flood depth flood velocity can be used as another parameter to estimate the damage for each building in future risk assessment studies credit authorship contribution statement oveys ziya conceptualization methodology software validation writing original draft

7658,study region poldokhtar city is located on the bank of the kashkan river in iran study focus this study presents a probabilistic modeling framework for flood risk assessment using monte carlo simulations we developed a machine learning ml based flood depth prediction model for poldokhtar city using the least squares support vector machine hec ras was utilized for 2d flood modeling and its performance was evaluated by comparing simulated and remote sensing derived flood extent maps the simulated results were used to develop a surrogate ml based model that predicts flood depth maps finally we used this model to estimate the flood risk of poldokhtar city as a combination of hazard exposure and vulnerability for 10000 flood scenarios new hydrological insights for the region the mean annual flood damage of the city based on the proposed framework is us 1177034 which is about three times lower than that calculated using the simplified method used in the classical risk analysis us 3455400 buildings near the floodwalls of the river and in the southwestern parts of the city have higher mean flood losses than those in other areas risk index frequencies of buildings reveal the most at risk zones in the city where there have been building constructions without considering flood hazards the proposed framework would be of use to stakeholders such as policymakers to develop effective flood management strategies graphical abstract ga1 keywords risk analysis monte carlo simulation machine learning least squares support vector machine two dimensional hydrodynamic modeling flood modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rapid and unsustainable urbanization increases flood impacts and risks hammond et al 2015 incorrectly designed and poorly maintained drainage systems along with the unsustainable development near river channels and on floodplains increase the risk of flooding liu et al 2016 sadegh et al 2018 moreover flood risks are expected to increase in the future because of climate change bates et al 2008 bouwer 2011 giorgi et al 2011 stocker et al 2013 malaekeh et al 2022 and socio economical changes hallegatte et al 2013 the historical data supports the idea of increasing the flood risk in the future previous research shows that during 1970 1989 there was us 51 8 billion in flood damage while from 1990 to 2011 there was us 496 billion in flood damage em dat 2012 it is also expected that flood losses will increase to about us 52 billion per year by 2050 without consideration of climate change impacts hallegatte et al 2013 the world s current urban population is over half which will increase to 66 by 2050 world urbanization 2014 in iran the urban population increased from 64 2 in 2000 to 75 94 in 2019 and is expected to rise to 85 82 in 2050 uno 2018 unplanned settlements in flood prone areas as well as the high population density multiple economic activities lots of infrastructure and property values contribute to relatively high flood risk in urban areas de risi 2013 pelling 2003 many studies have using qualitative risk assessment to perform flood risk analysis in urban areas e g harvey et al 2009 leitão et al 2013 weerasinghe et al 2018 however it was found that qualitative flood risk mapping is not an effective tool for flood risk management because the results of them cannot be used in the cost benefit analysis of flood mitigation measures to assess the risk of flood hazards quantitatively flood risk can be defined as a function of the probability of a flood event occurring and its negative consequences gouldby and samuels 2005 kubal et al 2009 another approach would be assembling vulnerability indicators or establishing integrated vulnerability indices emphasizing social vulnerabilities for different natural disasters fekete 2009 kaplan et al 2009 king 2001 alternatively flood risk management can be based on spatial multicriteria which seeks to evaluate flood mitigation measures rather than assessing and mapping flood risk simonovic and nirupama 2005 tkach and simonovic 1997 another method is to define flood risk as a combination of hazard exposure and vulnerability kron 2005 known as the crichton risk triangle crichton 1999 nevertheless the flood damage modeling has limitations in representing flood risks and cost benefit aspects scorzini and leopardi 2017 in quantitative flood risk assessment expected annual damage ead is used as a common indicator for flood risk r which is expressed as follows merz et al 2009 1 r e a d h 0 f h d h d h where d h is the damage caused by inundation depth h f h is the probability density function of inundation depth h and h 0 is the flood inundation depth threshold one approach to estimate the flood risk in eq 1 is to calculate flood losses for n flood events of different exceedance probabilities and determine the ead as follows scorzini and leopardi 2017 2 e a d j 1 n δ p j d j where δ p j and d j are respectively the exceedance probability increment and average damage of two events with exceedance probabilities p j and p j 1 some studies used an approach similar to eq 2 to estimate the ead e g castillo rodríguez et al 2016 scorzini and leopardi 2017 țîncu et al 2020 however the use of eq 2 has an error due to its approximation by using only a limited number of simulations to estimate the ead unlike previous studies we did not simplify eq 1 and we modeled flood risk quantitatively as a combination of hazard exposure and vulnerability by simulating 10000 flood events each representing an annual flood hazard calculating each one s cost vulnerability based on building information data exposure one of the most important steps of flood risk analysis is determining flood depth many studies have been conducted to simulate floods in floodplains by using one dimensional 1d and two dimensional 2d models e g bates and de roo 2000 di baldassarre et al 2010 neal et al 2012 while 1d models can represent the process in the river channel 2d numerical simulations are required to model flood wave dynamics on floodplains falter et al 2013 tayefi et al 2007 there are many 2 d hydrodynamic models which are capable of determination of flood depth properly for example sobek deltares systems 2019 lisflood fp horritt and bates 2002 telemac 2d lang et al 2014 hec ras 2d usace 2016 and mike flood danish hydraulics institute 2020 the 2d hydrodynamic models were used in some studies to analyze the flood risk e g arrighi et al 2018 rudari et al 2016 yalcin 2019 although the computational nature of mechanistic models makes them useful for understanding the system they are less practical for direct applications safaie et al 2016 for instance the use of 2d hydrodynamic models in the flood risk assessment limits the number of intensive repetitive calculations due to their high computational costs therefore to perform repetitive calculations such as monte carlo simulations mcss it is necessary to have a flood depth model that is capable of determining the spatial distribution of flood depth quickly to achieve this goal we developed a machine learning surrogate model that predicts flood water depth maps to be used for the flood risk assessment only a few studies used machine learning ml and deep learning dl methods for the flood inundation mapping and depth modeling based on the size of the training dataset the definition of input and output variables and the application of the developed model different ml methods have been used to create a fast implementing flood depth model such as support vector regression svr liu and pender 2015 least squares support vector machine ls svm regression bermúdez et al 2019 a combination of artificial neural network ann classifier with nonlinear autoregressive exogenous r narx chang et al 2018 gradient boosting decision tree gbdt wu et al 2020 ann berkhahn et al 2019 deep convolutional neural network kabir et al 2020 and a combination of random forest classification and multilayer perceptron hosseiny et al 2020 the ls svm method has been demonstrated to have higher accuracy and efficiency than other ml methods heddam et al 2022 jhong et al 2017 lin et al 2013 in some of the previous studies only one type of hydrograph hyetograph shape was used to train the ml models hosseiny et al 2020 liu and pender 2015 wu et al 2020 therefore if the input hydrograph hyetograph has a different shape from those used for training the model the model may not have an acceptable accuracy in predicting the flood inundation map moreover in some other studies only the maximum flood depth was estimated for each event e g berkhahn et al 2019 therefore they cannot be used in real time forecasts and resilience analysis applications furthermore many of the previous studies used rainfall as an input of the ml based model berkhahn et al 2019 chang et al 2018 wu et al 2020 however in areas that are located on banks of rivers e g poldokhtar city where floods are mainly fluvial using discharge hydrographs as the input of the flood model is considered as a suitable solution therefore in this study we proposed a method to develop a surrogate model that predicts water depth for the whole time series of flood events based on the river discharge hydrographs with different shapes and durations our study proposed a new framework that uses a surrogate ml based flood model in the monte carlo simulation to estimate the flood risk while previous studies only used a limited number of simulations to estimate expected annual damage ead we estimated the flood risk as a combination of hazard exposure and vulnerability by simulating 10000 flood events in this paper the proposed framework for flood risk assessment was used for the probabilistic modeling of flood damages for poldokhtar city which is located on the bank of the kashkan river in lorestan province in iran this river basin has experienced several extreme floods with a discharge of over 1000 cms and the latest flood occurred in march 2019 geravand et al 2020 in spite of that flood studies in this river basin are very limited and no flood risk assessment for poldokhtar city has been investigated in previous works yet for example moghim et al 2023 developed two hydraulic models including hec ras 2d and lisflood fp to simulate floods in the kashkan basin however they only analyzed the impacts of using different digital elevation models and roughness coefficients on river flood simulations thus this is the first attempt to conduct the flood risk assessment for poldokhtar city to this end we developed an ls svm model based on results of the hec ras 2d hydrodynamic model to be used in monte carlo simulations the performance of the hec ras model was evaluated by comparison of simulated and remote sensing derived flood extent maps the present study consists of two main phases i developing the ls svm model and ii performing monte carlo simulations for probabilistic flood risk assessment the detailed procedure of each phase is introduced in section 2 2 materials and methods as mentioned in the introduction section the present study has two main phases the first phase starts by developing the 2d hydrodynamic flood model the model performance was evaluated based on a flood event s extent driven by satellite imagery then based on the characteristics of the observed flood hydrographs and historical hydrometric data 20 hydrographs were generated in the next step flood modeling was performed for each of these synthetic events using the calibrated model next using the results of these 20 simulations an ls svm based model was trained and evaluated then in a monte carlo framework flood depth map time series for 10000 flood scenarios were computed using the developed ls svm model finally flood damage and cost for each building in each scenario were estimated based on depth damage curves and building information data in addition the results of the proposed framework have been compared to the result of the classical risk assessment method based on eq 2 the flowchart of the main steps of the present study is shown in fig 1 a detailed method explanation will be provided in the following 2 1 study area poldokhtar city 33 8 n 47 43 e is the capital of poldokhtar county in lorestan province and is located near the outlet of the kashkan river basin in iran the city covers an area of 397 ha and has 26352 residents kashkan river flows through this city and frequently causes flood damage the frequent flooding of the river has caused the evacuation of the city the destruction of buildings and consequent financial losses especially in march 2019 this city experienced an unprecedented flood during this event the discharge of the kashkan river reached over 4000 cms after this event floodwalls were constructed along the western and eastern banks of the river fig 2 the aerial view of the study area is shown in fig 2 the city has been divided into 13 zones with almost similar areas to analyze flood risk zonally poldokhtar city has 7868 buildings including 613

residential buildings and eight sports buildings the building replacement cost and the contents value of different occupancy types are illustrated in table 1 based on hazus inventory technical manual fema 2021 2 2 developing a machine learning based flood depth prediction model the flood depth of each building has been calculated using a least squares support vector machine ls svm model see the details in section 2 2 4 in order to train this model hec ras results were used see the details in section 2 2 3 first the two dimensional flood simulations based on twenty hydrographs generated for poldokhtar station fig 2 see the details in section 2 2 2 as the upstream boundary condition the topographic data and the land cover maps of the city see the details in section 2 2 1 were performed in hec ras software version 5 0 4 then the results of fifteen simulations were used to train the ls svm model and the rest were used to test the model the detailed process of developing this model has been explained in the following sections 2 2 1 data the topographic data of the study area is based on the digital elevation model dem products of the shuttle radar topography mission srtm with a spatial resolution of 30 m river cross sections were surveyed upstream of the city by the regional water authority of lorestan province in 2015 with a resolution of 0 5 m the ground surveyed river cross section measurements were integrated with dem to generate the river geometry schäppi et al 2010 the flow data were obtained from the regional water company of lorestan in two datasets for poldokhtar station 1 maximum daily discharges from 1956 to 2019 and 2 hourly hydrographs of floods from 2009 to 2018 the regional water authority of lorestan province has quality control processes in place for all observational measurements the city s land use map was obtained from poldokhtar municipality based on this map and landsat 8 satellite images the land cover map was created to determine manning s n coefficients using these land use maps and the method suggested by curtis 2016 and usace 2016 the final manning s n was considered as 0 08 for urban areas 0 04 for rocky lands 0 045 for channels 0 06 for open shrublands and 0 05 for farmlands 2 2 2 generating synthetic hydrographs generating synthetic hydrograph for the first time was introduced by snyder 1938 to be used in ungauged basins many studies were done on this topic to improve the representation of the hydrograph s shape in this method e g serinaldi and grimaldi 2011 yue et al 2002 in the current study the following procedure fig 3 was used to consider the uncertainty of hydrograph shapes which was not considered in the previous studies hydrographs mainly have three characteristics 1 maximum discharge 2 duration and 3 shape of the hydrograph based on the historical data and chi squared test the best distribution for annual maximum discharge at poldokhtar station has been estimated the final ls svm model needs to be accurate for different hydrographs so generated maximum discharge values should cover a wide range of discharge rates therefore the maximum discharge of each hydrograph is randomly generated based on a uniform distribution in a range of 1 yr to 10000 yr maximum discharge values determined based on the best distribution of annual maximum discharge the other two characteristics the hydrograph s duration and shape were determined by analyzing thirty five available flood hydrographs of poldokhtar station from 2009 to 2018 as a result the best distribution of hydrographs duration is defined based on the kolmogorov smirnov test on the observed hydrographs to determine the last characteristic each of the observed flood hydrographs of poldokhtar station transformed into a dimensionless space then the time range 1 1 was divided into 400 timesteps in each time step we have 35 dimensionless discharges based on these values a lognormal distribution was fitted to the data then each timestep s dimensionless discharge of synthetic hydrographs was generated randomly based on these distributions these synthetic hydrographs were used as the upstream boundary condition of the hec ras model 2 2 3 hec ras modeling the hec ras 5 0 4 model can solve either the 2d st venant equations or 2d diffusion wave equations in this study the 2d diffusion wave equation method was selected as follows usace 2016 3 n 2 v v r h 4 3 h by dividing both sides of the equation by the square root of their norms and rearranging them 4 v r h 2 3 n h h 1 2 where v is the velocity vector m s r is the hydraulic radius m h is the surface elevation gradient and n is the empirically derived manning s n the classical differential form of the diffusion wave approximation of the shallow water dsw equation 5 h t β h q 0 where q is the inflow or outflow m3 s and β is 6 β r h 5 3 n h 1 2 mesh computation was performed automatically in a 2d area with a mesh size of 30 m this area contains poldokhtar city with an upstream boundary condition of the synthetic discharge hydrograph of the kashkan river at the location of the poldokhtar hydrometric station furthermore the downstream boundary condition was considered as a normal depth of 0 005 hec ras can be used in either a fully 2d model or as a 1d 2d hybrid model the second choice needs to determine the connection between the 1d river and 2d floodplain area quirogaa et al 2016 the overflow location is necessary to determine these connections quirogaa et al 2016 since the overflow locations were unknown for the study area the fully 2d model was selected in this study to ensure the model is stable the timestep was estimated based on courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition eq 5 7 c r c δ t δ x g h δ t δ x where c r is the courant number c is the celerity m s δ t is the timestep s δ x is the grid cell size m g is the gravitational acceleration m2 s and h is the flow depth m for diffusion wave equations in hec ras the courant number can be as high as five and it still provides stable and accurate results usace 2016 the grid cell size was considered 30 m and using an iterative method the maximum flow depth between simulations was estimated at about 15 m therefore the timestep of 10 s was selected finally to evaluate the performance of the hec ras model the flood extent map was determined based on sentinel 1 synthetic aperture radar sar c band and compared with the flood extent map generated by the hec ras model for a flood event that occurred in march and april of 2019 the fitness index fi method eq 8 was used to compare inundated areas based on a hydrodynamic model and remote sensing derived inundated areas bates and de roo 2000 8 f i i a s a t i a mod i a s a t i a mod 100 where ia sat and ia mod are inundated areas from satellite imagery and model respectively 2 2 4 ls svm method the ls svm method was derived from the original support vector machines svm model vapnik 1998 a kernel based method for linear and nonlinear classification and regression problems suykens et al 2002 the model is based on the concept of transforming data from an original feature space into a higher dimensional feature space suykens et al 2002 this method s precision depends on several factors such as the kernel function the kernel parameter σ and the regularization parameter γ shi and gindy 2007 the radial basis function rbf is usually selected among different kernel functions because of its good features such as its ability to reduce the training process computational complexity and to improve the generalization performance of ls svm shi and gindy 2007 based on cross validation the simplex method was used to determine the kernel and regularization parameters then the model was trained based on the rbf kernel function and the tuned parameters the ml based flood depth prediction model was developed using the ls svmlab toolbox brabanter et al 2003 the algorithm presented in this study used each timestep s discharge and its six antecedent discharges of the hydrograph as explanatory variables the dependent variable is the depth of flood in each cell the domain of this model contains 8464 cells that cover the city s flood prone areas with a cell size of 30 m the results of 15 simulations of hec ras were used as the training dataset and five simulations of them were used as the test dataset for the ls svm model each row of the explanatory variables has seven columns and each row of the dependent variables has 8464 columns based on this dataset 8464 models for each cell were trained separately then they were included in a single model that returns the predicted depth of all cells for each row of explanatory variables 2 3 flood risk analysis 2 3 1 monte carlo simulation a monte carlo sampling with a sample size of 10000 simulations was conducted to analyze the city s flood risk in each sample based on the probability distribution of the maximum discharge and duration of flood hydrographs these two parameters were generated randomly with a correlation coefficient of 0 59 calculated based on the observed hydrographs then the cholesky decomposition method was used to generate correlated samples based on the calculated correlation coefficient besides the hydrograph shape was made based on the procedure mentioned in section 2 2 2 and the flood hydrograph of each sample was created as the ls svm model s input the generated hydrograph was used to estimate the maximum flood depth for each building this value was used to determine the damage ratio of each building using minimal buildings fragility functions mbff method in terms of contents and structural damage then based on building information data the total cost of each building was determined finally the city s total flood damage cost for each scenario is calculated by summing up the buildings damage cost for that event table 2 shows the parameters of damage curves for different classes used in this study based on the mbff method nofal and van de lindt 2020 the building archetypes descriptions of different types in table 2 are illustrated in table 3 nofal and van de lindt 2020 finally a new risk index for determining the vulnerability of buildings was defined as eq 9 this index is defined based on the ratio of the expected total loss of each building during its lifetime to its total replacement cost 9 r i s k i n d e x i e l d i t r c i l d e a d i t r c i where e l d i is the expected lifetime damage l d is the average lifetime duration of buildings e a d i is the expected annual damage of building i and t r c i is the total replacement cost of building i 2 3 2 classical method in this method the ead was calculated based on eq 2 the same as scorzini and leopardi 2017 using three flood events with return periods of 10 100 and 1000 years therefore eq 2 will be simplified as the following 10 r i s k 1 t 1 s 1 1 t 2 1 t 1 s 1 s 2 2 1 t 3 1 t 2 s 2 s 3 2 where t 1 to t 3 are return periods of 1000 100 and 10 years respectively and s 1 to s 3 are the corresponding total damage cost of the city to generate the flood hydrographs and total damage cost estimation the same method as 2 3 1 has been used but the specified return periods were used for generating the maximum discharge of hydrographs finally the results of this classical risk assessment method were compared with those obtained based on the proposed framework in this study 3 results 3 1 machine learning based model results based on the method mentioned in section 2 2 2 the best distribution of annual maximum discharge at poldokhtar station was calculated as a three parameter lognormal distribution with µ of 5 9247 σ of 0 75215 and a location parameter of 33 675 therefore the 1 yr and 10000 yr maximum annual discharge rates were 33 675 cms and 6170 cms respectively furthermore the best distribution of hydrographs duration was estimated as a rayleigh distribution with a scale factor of 63 25 then values of maximum discharge duration and shape were generated randomly for each hydrograph based on the method mentioned in section 2 2 2 generated synthetic hydrographs of kashkan river at poldokhtar station using these three characteristics are plotted in fig 4 nash sutcliff efficiency and root mean squared percentage error rmspe of the dimensionless average of generated and observed hydrographs were 98 58 and 2 84 respectively comparison of the simulated and the satellite imagery based flood extent maps indicates that the developed hec ras model was able to simulate the flood extent map with a fi index of 76 91 fig 5 then the ls svm model was trained using the training dataset of hec ras results based on the test dataset the median of errors is zero and their mean is 6 46e 4 m which indicates that the ls svm of this study is an unbiased model the root mean squared error rmse of the ls svm results on the test dataset is about 0 006 m and the mean absolute error is 0 014 m the correlation coefficient of the hec ras and ls svm models results is 0 997 fig 6 shows the heatmap plot of the predicted depths based on the ls svm model vs the depths based on the hec ras model for the test dataset pixel values represent the density of predicted water depth values that fall in that pixel an ideal model would have colored pixels on its bisector and black pixels elsewhere as we can see the majority of colored pixels are close to the bisector of the plot which indicates that the ls svm results are correlated to the hec ras results the maximum error values over the entire domain for the test hydrographs no 4 8 10 12 and 16 were 2 34 1 93 1 94 2 57 and 2 12 m respectively 2 18 m on average as an example of the model s performance in predicting the water depth the results of the ls svm model and its error relative to the corresponding results of hec ras are displayed in fig 7 in this figure the water depth map was generated based on hydrograph 4 fig 4 in hour 32 3 2 flood risk results the monte carlo simulations were performed 10000 times to calculate the total loss of each building in each iteration based on the maximum flood water depth at the location of that building then the total flood loss of the city in each iteration is determined based on the sum of the repair costs of all buildings the exceedance probability curves of the city s total flood loss based on monte carlo simulations and the classical method are shown in fig 8 a monte carlo simulations have a mean total loss of us 1177034 and a standard deviation of us 11401367 the mean total loss estimated using the classical method is us 3455400 which is about three times higher than the mean total loss based on monte carlo simulations the classical method as shown in fig 8a uses simplifications for the estimation of the integral of the area under the curve which causes an overestimation of the mean total loss the coefficient of variation of 9 69 indicates that flood risk analysis needs to be conducted using a probabilistic framework fig 8b shows the importance of using the monte carlo framework in this study this figure shows the mean total cost of the city and its standard deviation versus the number of simulations in the monte carlo framework this figure indicates that by increasing the number of simulations the fluctuation of the mean total cost of the city is decreased and will converge to a specific amount us 1177034 the mean value can be used for the city s total annual flood insurance premium moreover the annual flood insurance premium of each building can be determined based on its mean flood loss fig 9 shows the mean loss of buildings in poldokhtar city buildings near the floodwalls of the kashkan river zones 5 and 8 as well as in the southwestern parts of the city zones 1 and 2 have higher mean flood losses than those in other areas these high values for flood losses could be because of the unplanned city development regardless of the flood hazard of the kashkan river in addition some buildings in zones 3 and 7 located far from the kashkan river were severely damaged by flooding since these areas are lowlands close to croplands which are vulnerable to flooding table 4 shows the risk index frequencies of the city s buildings based on the city zones based on an average life expectancy of 100 years for buildings the risk index was calculated using eq 9 for all buildings as it is reported in table 4 42 buildings in the city have a risk index greater than one which indicates that the total experienced damage cost during the buildings lifetime caused by floods is higher than the buildings value according to table 4 the most at risk zones in the city are zones 1 2 5 and 8 in order buildings in these areas close to the kashkan river have been constructed without considering riverine flood hazards due to frequent flood inundation in these parts of the city these areas have a high flood risk index with a value greater than 0 1 zone 2 has the largest share with 40 48 for risk indices higher than 1 furthermore within the risk index interval of 0 5 1 zone 2 has the most share with a share of 29 33 and within the risk index intervals of 0 25 0 5 and 0 1 0 25 zone 1 has the most share with a share of 28 49 and 29 93 respectively furthermore zones 9 13 did not experience any flooding between 10000 simulated events resulting in flood risk indexes of zero for buildings in these zones zones 9 13 besides zone 6 are the safest zones for city development purposes and can be considered for future city development plans 4 discussion in the current study an ml based flood depth prediction model was developed because of the limitations of using 2d hydrodynamic flood models for use in probabilistic frameworks the results showed that the developed model has high accuracy and much lower computational cost than 2d hydrodynamic models the fi index of 76 91 shows that the developed hec ras model has reasonable performance in simulating the inundated areas fig 5 this value of fi is in an acceptable range compared to values reported in the previous studies for instance the best fi score among different simulations conducted by bates and de roo 2000 was 81 9 which is also close to the best fi score of 73 65 reported by moghim et al 2023 as shown in fig 5 there are some minor discrepancies in flood extent near the kashkan river and in the city since the effects of infiltration and drainage facilities were not taken into account during the flood events rmse value of the ls svm results on the test dataset is about 0 006 m which is lower compared to 0 28 m in chang et al 2018 0 11 m in kabir et al 2020 and 0 14 m in hosseiny et al 2020 furthermore the mean absolute error is 0 014 m which is lower than 0 03 m reported in hosseiny et al 2020 as shown in fig 7 error values in most parts of the city were less than 1 m except for an area northwest of the city where there were only a few spots with red color that the absolute errors were up to 2 34 m in these spots the ground elevations of the grid cells in hec ras model were lower than those in the surrounding areas therefore these grid cells experienced ponding which caused a higher absolute error since there is no building in these spots it would be expected that the developed model could be used in monte carlo simulations without causing significant errors in damage estimation in addition these values of errors were determined based on the worst case scenario with the maximum flood discharge with a return period close to 5000 years nevertheless the maximum values of errors are still lower than 3 8 m and 5 m reported in hosseiny et al 2020 and guo et al 2021 respectively therefore the model is able to predict the maximum depth which is the main result needed for flood damage estimation with high accuracy one of the features of the proposed framework is that the flood inundated areas are directly simulated by the model however the probabilistic modeling system developed by apel et al 2006 for assessing flood risks was not able to calculate inundated areas directly moreover the ls svm model reduces the simulation time from average runtime of about 28 min to about 30 s on a core i7 2 4 ghz system which allows running a large number of simulations in a monte carlo framework due to its low computational cost and high accuracy this fast prediction model of flood depth would be used as a surrogate for 2d hydrodynamic models in the risk analysis in monte carlo simulations furthermore the model unlike the previous studies hosseiny et al 2020 liu and pender 2015 wu et al 2020 is not limited to predicting flood depth for only one shape type of flood hydrographs and it considers their uncertainty additionally the model estimates not only the maximum depth which is determined by previous studies e g berkhahn et al 2019 but it also predicts flood depth over time therefore it would also be used in real time flood forecasting applications in which estimating the flood depth during flood events is necessary the methodology which was conducted in this study allows risk quantification at a micro scale based on the detailed vulnerability analysis of the buildings damages the framework includes the flood loss analysis for 10000 synthetic flood events and the results would be used in risk analysis applications to help flood management unlike the study conducted by apel et al 2006 the proposed method is performed at a micro scale building level approach and the calculation of cost for each scenario is based on a detailed simulation of flood depth and estimation of corresponding damage for each building not using a predefined inflow damage cost function the mean annual flood damage calculated by this method is us 1177034 which is much lower than that calculated using the classical method us 3455400 however it is very common in the previous works to estimate the flood damage only based on a limited number of flood events for example the classical method proposed by scorzini and leopardi 2017 only uses three flood events since the high number of simulations performed here in order to estimate the flood risk for different flood events the method used in the current study does not have the error associated with the approximation of expected annual damage based on the classical method although poldokhtar city experiences floods every year no flood risk assessment for the city has been conducted before poldokhtar city was developed in the recent 60 years by diverting the kashkan river s channel and using its floodplains for developing the city simulated results show that the water levels in the river reach to more than 10 4 m during the flood see fig 7 which can lead to the failure of riverine bridges field studies in poldokhtar city also reported that a numerous number of bridges across the river were either significantly damaged or completely destroyed during the flood events in 2019 and 2020 mansouri and pouraminian 2022 in addition simulations showed that some city zones including the western area of the city are at high risk of flooding these results are consistent with the results of a study that investigated flood prone areas in the city through remote sensing from 1990 to 2020 asadi et al 2022 furthermore march 2019 s flood showed that the city is susceptible to flooding and needs to be improved and protected against the riverine flood afterward attempts were carried out including building floodwalls on the eastern and western coasts of the kashkan river however the current study showed that several city zones remain at high risk for flooding there could be proof that the city s development in these zones was a mistake of poor management contrary to this finding the development of residential areas in poldokhtar city in recent years has taken place in these flood prone areas that have a high flood risk asadi et al 2022 several solutions are suggested to be considered such as raising the floodwalls height or extending the walls downstream of the kashkan river to the city s end based on the framework used in this study these solutions can be evaluated in future studies by modeling improved flood protection structures and comparing the costs and benefits of building such structures 5 conclusions this study proposes a probabilistic modeling framework for flood risk assessment as a combination of hazard exposure and vulnerability based on 10000 flood scenarios for poldokhtar city the core of this framework is a surrogate ml based flood model to predict the hazard component the results of the ml based flood depth prediction model in poldokhtar city show that this model would be used as a surrogate for 2d hydrodynamic models and its features enable using it in iterative frameworks such as monte carlo simulations for probabilistic risk analysis probabilistic flood damage curves and flood hydrographs are used in this framework to model the uncertainty of hazard and vulnerability components the results indicated that the city s development on the kashkan river s floodplain had put several city zones at high risk of flooding resulting in excessive flood costs for the city in recent years it should be noted that the framework proposed in this study is not limited to poldokhtar city and would also be used in other areas of study in addition since the ml based model predicts the water depth during floods it would be used to model flood interruptions during a flood event in the city system such as the effect of the flood on the road network the disruption of businesses and the recovery process in a resilience analysis the present study attempted to introduce a probabilistic framework to consider the uncertainty in flood hazard occurrence and damage estimation to consider the uncertainty associated with the random choice of training hydrographs future studies can use a sensitivity analysis based on choosing different subsets of hec ras results as training and test datasets in addition the proposed framework is not limited to the methods used in the present work for flood and machine learning modeling and any other method can be substituted in this framework in future studies to consider the uncertainty of choosing the ml model in monte carlo framework it is suggested to use different ml based methods as the surrogate model besides the ls svm method then in each scenario in monte carlo simulations one model can be chosen randomly to predict the flood depth the other uncertainty which is not considered in the present study is the uncertainty associated with damage functions to consider this uncertainty it is suggested to use different depth damage functions instead of using only mbff damage functions furthermore besides the flood depth flood velocity can be used as another parameter to estimate the damage for each building in future risk assessment studies credit authorship contribution statement oveys ziya conceptualization methodology software validation writing original draft

communities vary markedly and predictably with hydrological season their reproduction is synchronized with the onset of the rainy season da silva et al 2013 when the hydrological connectivity through surface water is maximum indeed each year the seasonal flood leads to an important rise of the wl in the river which invades the vast associated floodplains and increases the connectivity among rivers lakes and wetlands resulting in an intensification of nutrients and organisms exchange required for fish life cycles da silva et al 2013 trigg et al 2012 furthermore because of their relative accessibility soil fertility and fishy water floodplains are heavily populated areas in the amazon economic activities in these areas are directly influenced by climate and river water dynamics that control development of productive activities agriculture fishing logging sousa and oliveira 2016 nevertheless climate change and deforestation leading to more frequent and severe droughts and floods marengo and espinoza 2016 and anthropic activities such as hydroelectricity production mining and urban occupation along banks of rivers are all threats to these systems their biodiversity and related economic activities melack et al 2021 in this context the characterization of the hydrological connectivity is a key issue to better interpret biogeochemical cycles or fish population dynamics for example park and latrubesse 2017 nowadays most of the in situ water level wl stations in the world are located on river main courses or on largest lakes since the beginning of the 2000 s vorosmarty et al 2001 have been concerned about the decreasing number of in situ stations which is partly related to the maintenance costs of the networks the amazonian in situ network has only gauges located in the rivers except curuaí gauge which is the only one acquiring water level in a floodplain the development of alternative observation systems for in situ networks are thus necessary to improve our ability to monitor the wetlands possible evolution in response to the above cited threats climate change dam in this regard remote sensing techniques offer a unique opportunity to monitor large

al 2013 papa and frappart 2021 in order to determine wetlands extent radar sensors have strong advantages compared to optical ones as they provide information on land surfaces in all weather

measure land surfaces information e g distance between the satellite and the reflecting surface backscattering coefficient frappart et al 2006 frappart et al 2021b and thus obtain surface wl this technique has been widely used over the past two decades to monitor the temporal variations of wl of lakes and rivers abdalla et al 2021 however few studies used radar altimetry data to monitor floodplain wls see papa and frappart in 2021 for a review whereas this is a considerable information source this study aims to classify altimeter radar echoes in water covered classes and create wl time series for each representative groups over amazon floodplains as wl time series in these areas are non existent for now their creation could considerably densify the wl station network in the amazon for this purpose we follow a method based on an unsupervised classification of radar echoes to distinguish different hydrological regimes which automatically generate wl time series along altimeter tracks over the rivers and the floodplains applied on the congo river basin in africa frappart et al 2021c this method is applied and adapted to two study areas in the amazon to test the method replicability in the most tropical wooded areas and densify the non existent wl network in floodplains indeed this study targets study areas where floodplains are playing a key role for biodiversity and local populations 2 materials 2 1 study area the study areas are composed of floodplains located in two major whitewater rivers fig 1 the amazon river in the surroundings of óbidos pará from 1 63 to 2 75 s from 53 27 to 56 80 w and one of the solimões tributaries the juruá from 2 45 to 8 s from 65 75 to 73 w the lago grande de curuaí floodplain referred as curuaí floodplain hereafter is separated from the amazon mainstream to the north by narrow levees and to the south by upland terra firme it is composed of several large and shallow lakes connected temporary or permanently to the mainstream by several channels the flooded area can vary from less than 600 km² up to 2500 km² during floods with the maximum flood flow having a return period between 5 and 10 years bonnet et al 2008 callede et al 2002 each year the rising phase of the floodplain starts between november and december and reaches its maximum in may june the falling phase begins in july and lasts until november with the greatest volume exported occurring from august to september the climate of the curuaí várzea is tropical monsoon with a mean annual temperature of about 26 5 c and a mean annual rainfall of 2033 mm bonnet et al 2008 climate in juruá basin is very similar with also two distinct seasons the dry season which extends from april to september and the rainy season which extends from october to march da silva abel et al 2021 annual rainfall generally ranges between 1800 and 2200 mm and average annual temperature is about 24 5 c the juruá basin is one of the most important basins in the southwestern amazon with a territorial extension of 224 000 km² its source is at an altitude of about 453 m in the ucayali region of peru 10 05 s 72 49 w sousa and oliveira 2016 the river course extends over 3280 km until it reaches its mouth in the northeast joining the right bank of the solimões river at an altitude of 36 m 2 63 s 65 76 w over its entire course the river has a difference in altitude of more than 400 m giving a slope of about 0 007 km according to the fluvial morphology the juruá is classified as a meandering river with high sinuosity high suspended load and relative stability mota da silva 2020 it is considered the most meandering river in the world characterized by numerous irregular and tortuous meanders with a huge floodplain of over 20 400 km² containing thousands of lakes many of which are abandoned meanders sousa and oliveira 2016 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 altimetry datasets radar altimetry data used in this study were acquired by envisat and saral on their nominal orbits they were placed on a 790 km sun synchronous orbit with a 98 54 inclination sun synchronous orbit with a 35 day repeat cycle and an equatorial ground track spacing of about 85 km envisat payload was composed of 10 instruments including the advanced radar altimeter ra 2 ra 2 was a nadir looking pulse limited ra operating at two frequencies ku 13 575 ghz and s 3 2 ghz bands benveniste et al 2003 data were acquired from 05 2002 10 2010 the radar footprint is 15 km diameter which leads to more than 200 km² of coverage ku band measurements are acquired with 350 m space between footprints along the satellite tracks saral payload was composed of 4 instruments including the altimeter radar altika which is the first altimeter to operate at ka band 35 5 ghz verron et al 2015 data were acquired from 02 2013 07 2016 the radar footprint is 8 km diameter which leads to more than 60 km² of coverage higher pulse repeat frequency 500 mhz against 320 mhz of saral allows a shorter space of 180 m between footprints along the satellite tracks saral has a smaller footprint and higher along track and vertical resolutions than envisat bonnefond et al 2018 verron et al 2021 radar altimeter measures the two way travel time of the electromagnetic pulse emitted by the sensor and the power reflected by the earth s surface the two way travel time is used to derive an approximate distance between the satellite and the surface the analysis of the radar echo power received by the satellite as a function of the time allows to refine the distance estimate applying a retracking process and to estimate the backscattering coefficient cretaux et al 2017 two types of altimetry data are used here raw data from the geophysical data records gdr and normalized tracks data these are computed along each ground track clustering and for each cycle to obtain 3d gridded information see frappart et al 2021c for more details both datasets are made available by the ctoh through altis data request from http ctoh legos obs mip fr 2 2 2 reference land cover map the reference land cover map will be used as validation of the radar echoes classifications by constructing confusion matrices section 4 1 1 the curuaí region map is from arantes et al 2019 supplementary material figure a a the juruá basin s map is shown in supplementary material figure a b and is available on ornl daac for biogeochemical dynamics website http daac ornl gov high water season maps is available and used here to see the entire inundation extent the overall accuracy for wetland mapping is 93 and 86 for vegetation mapping hess et al 2015 curuaí and juruá regions morphologies and properties are totally contrasted in terms of vegetation density and river width which allow us to test the method in different environments 2 2 3 water level time series 2 2 3 1 wl gauge stations wl gauge records are used to validate the automatically generated wl from radar altimetry data was downloaded from the water s brazilian national agency website hidro telemetria http www snirh gov br hidrotelemetria mapa aspx one wl gauge located in the lago grande 2 25 s 55 33 w near curuaí has collected data since 1982 and has been levelled by high precision gps based on wgs84 coordinate system calmant et al 2013 and reported to egm2008 gravity field model pavlis et al 2012 in the juruá watershed the santos dumont wl gauge 6 44 s 68 24 w is chosen to be the reference because of its proximity to a satellite track and its similar wl recording s period this wl gauge is about 3000 km upstream from the mouth of the juruá see fig 1 and record wl since 1981 it has not been levelled the comparison with altimetry data will be in a relative way to focus on the hydrological cycle s changes 2 2 3 2 altis time series time series of wl can be manually retrieved using the altimetry time series altis software frappart et al 2021a a new version of the maps software multi mission altimetry processing software frappart et al 2015b normandin et al 2018 these time series of wl are used to validate the automatic method presented in this study the software enables the user to select the altimetry data inside a google earth polygon it can display parameters supplied by ctoh backscatter coefficients and wl estimations these parameters are presented as time series obtained computing the median of each cycle valid observations following the processing proposed in cretaux et al 2017 some outliers may still be present in the time series and can be manually removed thanks to a specialized tool 3 methods 3 1 methodology summary the method applied in this study to generate wl from a classification of the radar altimetry echoes is summarized in fig 2 first step consists of applying a k means unsupervised classification technique to radar altimetry parameters as in frappart et al 2021c then best parameter combinations are determined with confusion matrices and accuracy computing finally vs were built on the water covered surfaces and some comparisons are presented with in situ and altis software 3 2 classification of radar altimetry echoes 3 2 1 temporal variations of radar altimetry data the classification s methodology is applied to one or several radar altimetry parameters as their responses differ according to the presence or not of water over open water areas such as rivers and lakes there are large seasonal variations in the backscatter coefficient in ku and ka bands supplementary material figure b frappart et al 2021a 2021b these temporal variations are related to changes in river width or lake extent in the altimeter footprint caused by the increase in wl the larger the water extent the more power backscattered to the radar altimeter as this sensor is nadir pointing large variations of the backscatter coefficients occur along the hydrological cycle well synchronized with the temporal variations of the wl over rivers and lakes in the amazon maxima occur in may june and minima in november december there is smaller variation in the backscatter coefficient over the flooding forests but some variation still remains due to changes in flooding extent present in the several km wide altimeter footprints even when the flooded areas are under vegetation large backscattering responses are observed frappart et al 2015a frappart et al 2021b and time series of water levels can be derived frappart et al 2006 frappart et al 2021c over non flooded forest smaller variations of backscattering and height are observed not related to the changes caused by the hydrological cycle see also frappart et al 2015b frappart et al 2021a these changes can be mostly attributed to orbital drifts plus or minus 1 km around the nominal orbit of the satellite and to changes in local roughness as the wavelength of the electromagnetic waves at ku and ka bands is lower than 0 1 m the chaotic variations in the height observed in the envisat and saral time series are outliers when the tracking is operating well the height is estimated to be continuous these very different temporal behaviors observed in radar altimetry echoes over open water and forest covered areas are used to classify the echoes by type of aquatic environment the unsupervised clustering algorithm k means is used in our method to classify echoes jain and dubes 1988 likas et al 2003 k means is suitable for our purpose as no training dataset can be used due to the complexity of the radar altimeter echoes in very heterogenous environments stammer and cazenave 2017 echoes are grouped into k different clusters based on their shape similarities see fig 3 a translating the soils backscatter coefficient and thus characterizing the land cover a python algorithm is used to obtain these k groups and classify them as fig 3 show it panel b and process to vs creation panel c 3 2 2 echoes classifications tests were conducted considering three to six classes by taking into account the classification test results and as an analysis of the best number of classes was already performed in a previous study frappart et al 2021c the optimal number of k classes is four 0 3 to best represent the different hydrological regimes in the amazon rivers lakes and wetlands without over interpreting the radar echoes kodinariya and makwana 2013 however curuaí and juruá s classes of the validation maps are more than four in order to simplify the comparison closest aquatic environments were grouped together to approximate our four classes classification to assess table 1 summarizes the validation groups of reference classes for our radar echo classification the radar altimetry echoes are classified according to three combinations of parameters backscatter coefficient only b as in frappart et al 2021c backscatter coefficient and raw wl b rwl and backscatter coefficient and normalized wl b nwl indeed the backscatter coefficient is an important parameter to keep to detect the water presence and wl normalization highlights major phases of the hydrological regime in contrast to raw wl where the amplitude variations are highlighted 3 2 3 classification validation then the best parameter accuracy combination is determined for each satellite mission over each study area by analysing confusion matrices between reference land cover maps see fig annexe a and our classifications confusion matrices and accuracies are calculated to quantify the agreement between both and determine the best combination of parameters for each confusion matrix obtained with the classifications the accuracy index is calculated eq 1 this index determines which combination of parameters gives the best classification of radar altimeter echoes it can take values ranging from 0 for poor accuracy to 1 for very good accuracy 1 tp tn tp fp tn fn with tp true positive fp false positive tn true negative and fn false negative 3 3 wl time series 3 3 1 automatic generation of wl time series time series of altimetry derived water levels are generated over the clusters identified as covered with water i e open water and flooded areas for each water covered classes 0 2 a virtual station vs is created fig 3 c indicating the intersection between the ground and a water body vs are created under some conditions depending on water bodies widths a minimal number of 5 radar echoes is required for creating a vs in curuaí for juruá watershed the minimal number is 1 because of the narrowness of the river sections where variations in surface type can be spatially significant the distance between two radar echoes from the same vs of one class must be less than 5 km in curuaí 1 5 km in the juruá watershed the distance between two vs from any class must be at least 1 km in curuaí and in the juruá watershed the maximal distance for a vs process from the same class is 50 km in curuaí 5 km in the juruá watershed then a wl time series is automatically created for each vs to be sure of the classification parameter to keep for wl time series study vs are numerically analysed these results are presented in sub section 4 1 3 3 2 wl time series validation in order to validate the automatic method time series from the parameter presenting the best classification accuracies is analysed here curuaí and juruá s time series of wl are compared with the manually retrieved time series of wl obtained using the altis software and to in situ data these time series are compared in terms of anomalies of wl validation between created vs from the three water presence classes with the in situ data and altis software based wl are achieved by correlation test of r² and rmse some wl comparison results are shown in section 4 2 4 results 4 1 radar echoes classification and virtual station detection 4 1 1 classification of radar altimetry echoes the results of the along track classifications of envisat and saral radar echoes over curuaí and the juruá river are shown in figs 4 5 and supplementary material figures c and d respectively for each parameter corresponding confusion matrix results computed between reference class maps and radar echoes classifications are shown in fig 6 more details are presented in supplementary material tables a and b the four classes represent all the major hydrological regimes present in the study areas very similar results were obtained when considering four to six classes as in frappart et al 2021c not shown here but best solutions were obtained with four classes classes 0 and 3 represent the most and the least widely covered with water areas respectively classes 1 and 2 correspond to intermediate water regimes class 1 corresponding with longer presence of water than class 2 for envisat results over curuaí region true positive tp and false negative fn results are predominant 70 80 representing good correlation for both parameters with a slightly better class correlation for b nwl parameter concerning saral results over curuaí 60 of the results are in good agreement with the map references for b and b nwl parameters but only 25 are in good agreement for b rwl parameter for envisat results over the juruá watershed 41 of the b and b nwl results and 25 of the b rwl results are in good agreement with map reference classes concerning saral results over juruá watershed 33 of the b and b nwl results and 25 of the b rwl are in good agreement 4 1 2 classification selection classification accuracies are shown in table 2 accuracy varies between 0 52 and 0 74 for b and b nwl parameters and between 0 25 and 0 59 for b rwl parameter indeed mixing effects between different types of soil due to the large radar footprint over the surface are taken into account which can explain the moderate accuracy values considering the very small differences between b and b nwl accuracies we only focus on the b nwl parameter because of its innovative character these results are available online on the data repository enguehard et al 2023 4 1 3 virtual station creation for each series of radar echo in the same class and respecting the conditions listed in section 3 3 a vs is created fig 7 presents the number of vs created according to the different combination of parameters and area satellite independently from the accuracies first we can see that the b rwl combination does not allow to create more than 10 vs for at least two classes except for the juruá saral combination where class 0 is over represented more than 500 vs in contrast b and b nwl present similar distribution for each area satellite combination as expected there is much more class 1 vs created in the juruá than in curuaí because of the largest floodplain area crossed by the altimeter finally envisat and saral exhibit similar vs classes distributions in juruá and curuaí for b and b nwl parameters but much less vs are created for curuaí saral compared to curuaí envisat probably due to the only 3 years of saral data used here compared to the 8 years of envisat data however the method proves to be efficient to create vs over amazon floodplains 4 2 wl time series validation time series of wl results are available online on the data repository enguehard et al 2023 here we choose to focus on b nwl time series because of its innovative character compared to the b parameter that has been already studied frappart et al 2021c with the large number of results only vs at the closest location to the gauging stations have been selected for comparison figs 8 and 9 present these vs as well as the r² and rmse between our results and those obtained using altis software supplementary material figs e and f are presenting r² and rmse between our results altis results with the gauging station our results show good correlation with those from altis table 3 summarizes r² and rmse according to areas and sensors our automatic results give better r² and rmse near curuaí with envisat sensor whereas altis results are better compared when using saral data near santos dumont altis results are slightly better than automatic ones when using envisat data finally no automatic vs has been created over the river near santos dumont using saral data then comparisons with our method can t be possible but altis and in situ method seems to be accurate enough 5 discussion 5 1 identification of water regime along altimetry ground tracks through the use of k means clustering and validation against reference land cover maps we are able to attribute hydrological status open water flooded and non flooded areas to each class as in frédéric frappart et al 2021c our classifications and associated regimes coincide well with reference classes arantes et al 2019 hess et al 2015 class 0 is very often located on open water lakes or rivers on the contrary class 3 is mainly located in non flooded areas classes 1 and 2 correspond to intermediate hydrological environment such as permanently or seasonally flooded and seasonally or infrequently flooded respectively nevertheless reference land cover maps may be strongly methodology dependant and thus may not be always accurate for our comparison indeed the reference map over curuaí from arantes et al 2019 has been obtained using landsat optical images acquired between 2008 and 2009 and the one over juruá river from hess et al 2015 has been obtained using sar during the 1996 high water season may to july whereas envisat and saral respectively provide altimetry data over 2002 2010 and 2013 2016 this lack of time concordance may reduce accuracy classifications best classifications are obtained with both b and b nwl parameter for both satellites but we focus on b nwl results only to assess these new results envisat classifications are generally better than saral s ones several reasons are likely to account for such lower accuracies of saral results compared to envisat s the most obvious one is the drift of the saral mission on its nominal orbit of several kilometres from one cycle to another the land cover contained in the saral footprint was different causing inaccuracies in the classification process another one is related to the great time lag between reference maps period 1995 1996 juruá and 2009 2010 for curuaí finally saral is the first sensor to operate at ka band larger scattering in the vegetation and more power backscattered at ka band are measured by saral than at ku band and then affect calculated accuracies 5 2 vs creation and validation vs detection over curuaí is effective river width is up to 6 km and floodplain lakes are large enough to allow a good detection of open water in the radar footprint however the juruá river is narrower locally up to 400 m width downstream and up to 200 m width upstream as well as abandoned meanders that are now lakes detection of water is therefore more difficult nevertheless the virtual stations created are quite numerous especially when using the b or b nwl parameters with this method a significant densification of the virtual station network is therefore achieved as a comparison 6 vs from the hydroweb database http hydroweb theialand fr are available over the amazon in curuaí region while about 100 vs have been created over the river and floodplains with our method for the juruá more than 100 vs from the hydroweb database are available over the river while about 1500 vs have been created over the river and floodplains the backscatter coefficient parameter combined with the raw water levels b rwl did not give satisfying results either for classification accuracies or for number of vs created this may be due to the extreme changes between water levels over the different surface types a bias of almost 2 m can be observed for envisat data and 1 5 m for saral data over curuaí and has been respectively removed previous studies showed that envisat has a 1 m bias compared to in situ gauges calmant et al 2013 santos da silva et al 2010 still part of the bias could be due to the distance between automatic vs and in situ gauges nevertheless r² and rmse are estimated and show good agreement between the automatic time series and altis ones as over the congo river frappart et al 2021c the automatic method over amazon s forest is more efficient than the manual altis software indeed automatic method is faster than altis computation and allow monitoring floodplains areas moreover removing outliers from altis software induce fewer elements in time series despite the slightly worse r² and rmse results than for curuaí the method is rather effective in santos dumont however as it can be seen in fig 9 c juruá river automatic results should be considered with caution juruá river and ancient meanders are well detected using envisat data but during low water period some anomalous water levels can be retrieved most probably due to the narrowness of the river 5 3 river floodplain connectivity using the automatically generated wl series it is possible to carry out a connectivity analysis between floodplain lakes and rivers by examining the duration of the connection between the mainstream and the lakes or between lakes during floods and recessions detecting different filling emptying dynamics between lakes the methodology that leads to an important densification of the number of water level measurement points in rivers and floodplains is an important contribution for the scientific community to better understand the dynamics of river floodplain exchanges and their evolution over time with this method the new densified vs network permits to obtain information on water bodies wl along the river and along river cross sections enabling to analyse hydrologic connectivity between river and lakes and lakes with each other and determine flood duration and rising draining velocities at each vs as an example vs time series in the river and the curuaí floodplain created using envisat data b nwl parameter are shown in fig 10a most of the time the river is flooded before the floodplain except for some years during which the flood is beginning earlier e g 2006 2007 and can last from 6 to 8 months depending on the year generally from november december to may june mean rising velocity is about 0 8 m month in the river and in the floodplain except in the lago grande do curuaí where the flood is slower 0 7 m month then falling phase is beginning and can last from 4 5 to 7 months depending on the year generally until november december draining velocities are about 1 m month in the river and in the floodplain except in the lago grande do curuaí where the flood is slower 0 9 m month indeed west of the floodplain is flooded by the upstream river and small channels before the east which is flooded both by the west floodplain and by channels connected to the downstream river bonnet et al 2008 park and latrubesse 2017 the double input of east floodplain by the channels river is easily seen for some years with the double peaks in the time series e g 2003 2004 2008 2009 vs time series in the juruá river and the floodplain near santos dumont created from envisat b nwl parameter are shown in fig 10b rising can last from 5 to 8 months depending on the year generally from september to march april rising velocity is about 1 2 m month in the river whereas they are slower 0 4 0 7 m month in the floodplain then falling phase is beginning and can last from 4 5 to 8 months depending on the year generally until september draining velocity is about 1 4 m month in the river whereas they are slower 0 5 0 7 m month in the floodplain in this case river is always flooded first and propagation of rising water in the floodplains is well seen after the flood begun several months ago times of connection can be easily recognised when the river is low from the moment when flood begin until the floodplains is rising four months has past e g 2003 2004 2006 2007 times of disconnection between the river and the floodplains are lasting about 6 months in this juruá portion this kind of information coupled with bathymetry can possibly permit to better interpret fish population dynamics hurd et al 2016 park and latrubesse 2017 even if envisat and saral allow to analyse surface water connectivity at monthly time scale the opportunity of the new ka band wide swath radar altimeter of the surface water and ocean topography swot mission will be unique biancamaria et al 2016 owing to its capability to map water levels at 100 m of spatial resolution several times during its 21 day repeat period this new dataset will allow a finer monitoring of the surface water connectivity between river and floodplains 6 conclusion in this study we confirm the strong potential of radar altimetry backscattering coefficient to identify land water surfaces along the tracks compared to a previous study we showed that the discrimination between land and water is enhanced when taking into consideration in the classification process the normalized water level in areas with a complex hydrodynamics such as the curuaí várzea and the juruá watershed in amazon results show good replicability and efficiency over a densely vegetated equatorial area indeed classification accuracies of 0 74 0 53 and 0 69 0 59 were obtained for envisat saral when comparing with reference land cover maps in the curuaí várzea and the juruá watershed respectively using a k means clustering approach based on these results wl time series were automatically generated along the tracks over the classes associated to open water and inundation their creation permitted to strongly densify vs network in the river and the floodplains 4650 vs were created in both areas comparisons show an accuracy ranging from 0 52 0 53 to 0 97 0 98 when comparing the time series of wl automatically generated with envisat saral with ones from the in situ station or the ones manually created in the curuaí várzea on the one hand this method offers possibility to include floodplain water level in current database and allow better surface water stock estimations to monitor areas where in situ data does not exist on the other hand the created wls allow a better connectivity analysis between the river the lakes and the floodplains the wetlands filling dynamic is better understood especially in curuaí where the varzea is filled to the west first via the upstream river and then to the east via channels connected to the western floodplain and the downstream river this information coupled with bathymetry would allow to better understand fish population dynamics and floodplain biogeochemical functioning the recent launch of the swot mission offers new opportunities for better monitoring the channel floodplains connectivity as this new mission will provide water level maps at 100 m of spatial resolution 2 or 3 times every 21 days in equatorial areas credit authorship contribution statement pauline enguehard

7659,study region the curuaí floodplain in the low amazon river in the pará state of brazil and juruá basin a major solimões tributary study focus characterizing the hydrological dynamics of amazon floodplains is essential to better understand and preserve these environments providing important resources to local populations radar altimetry is an effective remote sensing tool for monitoring water levels of continental hydrosystems including floodplains an unsupervised classification approach on radar echoes to determine hydrological regimes has recently been tested and showed a strong potential on the congo river basin this method is adapted to envisat and saral satellite radar altimetry data on two study areas in the amazon basin the aim is to improve inland water detection along

reserve regulating many species life cycle of fauna and flora and hosting characteristic biotopes da silva et al 2013 jézéquel et al 2020 for example in the whitewater rivers of the amazon fish communities vary markedly and predictably with hydrological season their reproduction is synchronized with the onset of the rainy season da silva et al 2013 when the hydrological connectivity through surface water is maximum indeed each year the seasonal flood leads to an important rise of the wl in the river which invades the vast associated floodplains and increases the connectivity among rivers lakes and wetlands resulting in an intensification of nutrients and organisms exchange required for fish life cycles da silva et al 2013 trigg et al 2012 furthermore because of their relative accessibility soil fertility and fishy water floodplains are heavily populated areas in the amazon economic activities in these areas are directly influenced by climate and river water dynamics that control development of productive activities agriculture fishing logging sousa and oliveira 2016 nevertheless climate change and deforestation leading to more frequent and severe droughts and floods marengo and espinoza 2016 and anthropic activities such as hydroelectricity production mining and urban occupation along banks of rivers are all threats to these systems their biodiversity and related economic activities melack et al 2021 in this context the characterization of the hydrological connectivity is a key issue to better interpret biogeochemical cycles or fish population dynamics for example park and latrubesse 2017 nowadays most of the in situ water level wl stations in the world are located on river main courses or on largest lakes since the beginning of the 2000 s vorosmarty et al 2001 have been concerned about the decreasing number of in situ stations which is partly related to the maintenance costs of the networks the amazonian in situ network has only gauges located in the rivers except curuaí gauge which is the only one acquiring water level in a floodplain the development of alternative observation systems for in situ networks are thus necessary to improve our ability to monitor the wetlands possible evolution in response to the above cited threats climate change dam in this regard remote sensing techniques offer a unique opportunity to monitor large watersheds hydrology and characterizing connectivity in areas where in situ information is lacking because of difficult access as it is the case for amazon wetlands alsdorf et al 2007 2000 jung et al

amazon hess 2003 frappart et al 2015 shu et al 2021 especially radar altimeters and their nadir pointing vision mostly operating at ku or ka frequency bands these characteristics allow altimeters to measure land surfaces information e g distance between the satellite and the reflecting surface backscattering coefficient frappart et al 2006 frappart et al 2021b and thus obtain surface wl this technique has been widely used over the past two decades to monitor the temporal variations of wl of lakes and rivers abdalla et al 2021 however few studies used radar altimetry data to monitor floodplain wls see papa and frappart in 2021 for a review whereas this is a considerable information source this study aims to classify altimeter radar echoes in water covered classes and create wl time series for each representative groups over amazon floodplains as wl time series in these areas are non existent for now their creation could considerably densify the wl station network in the amazon for this purpose we follow a method based on an unsupervised classification of radar echoes to distinguish different hydrological regimes which automatically generate wl time series along altimeter tracks over the rivers and the floodplains applied on the congo river basin in africa frappart et al 2021c this method is applied and adapted to two study areas in the amazon to test the method replicability in the most tropical wooded areas and densify the non existent wl network in floodplains indeed this study targets study areas where floodplains are playing a key role for biodiversity and local populations 2 materials 2 1 study area the study areas are composed of floodplains located in two major whitewater rivers fig 1 the amazon river in the surroundings of óbidos pará from 1 63 to 2 75 s from 53 27 to 56 80 w and one of the solimões tributaries the juruá from 2 45 to 8 s from 65 75 to 73 w the lago grande de curuaí floodplain referred as curuaí floodplain hereafter is separated from the amazon mainstream to the north by narrow levees and to the south by upland terra firme it is composed of several large and shallow lakes connected temporary or permanently to the mainstream by several channels the flooded area can vary from less than 600 km² up to 2500 km² during floods with the maximum flood flow having a return period between 5 and 10 years bonnet et al 2008 callede et al 2002 each year the rising phase of the floodplain starts between november and december and reaches its maximum in may june the falling phase begins in july and lasts until november with the greatest volume exported occurring from august to september the climate of the curuaí várzea is tropical monsoon with a mean annual temperature of about 26 5 c and a mean annual rainfall of 2033 mm bonnet et al 2008 climate in juruá basin is very similar with also two distinct seasons the dry season which extends from april to september and the rainy season which extends from october to march da silva abel et al 2021 annual rainfall generally ranges between 1800 and 2200 mm and average annual temperature is about 24 5 c the juruá basin is one of the most important basins in the southwestern amazon with a territorial extension of 224 000 km² its source is at an altitude of about 453 m in the ucayali region of peru 10 05 s 72 49 w sousa and oliveira 2016 the river course extends over 3280 km until it reaches its mouth in the northeast joining the right bank of the solimões river at an altitude of 36 m 2 63 s 65 76 w over its entire course the river has a difference in altitude of more than 400 m giving a slope of about 0 007 km according to the fluvial morphology the juruá is classified as a meandering river with high sinuosity high suspended load and relative stability mota da silva 2020 it is considered the most meandering river in the world characterized by numerous irregular and tortuous meanders with a huge floodplain of over 20 400 km² containing thousands of lakes many of which are abandoned meanders sousa and oliveira 2016 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 altimetry datasets radar altimetry data used in this study were acquired by envisat and saral on their nominal orbits they were placed on a 790 km sun synchronous orbit with a 98 54 inclination sun synchronous orbit with a 35 day repeat cycle and an equatorial ground track spacing of about 85 km envisat payload was composed of 10 instruments including the advanced radar altimeter ra 2 ra 2 was a nadir looking pulse limited ra operating at two frequencies ku 13 575 ghz and s 3 2 ghz bands benveniste et al 2003 data were acquired from 05 2002 10 2010 the radar footprint is 15 km diameter which leads to more than 200 km² of coverage ku band measurements are acquired with 350 m space between footprints along the satellite tracks saral payload was composed of 4 instruments including the altimeter radar altika which is the first altimeter to operate at ka band 35 5 ghz verron et al 2015 data were acquired from 02 2013 07 2016 the radar footprint is 8 km diameter which leads to more than 60 km² of coverage higher pulse repeat frequency 500 mhz against 320 mhz of saral allows a shorter space of 180 m between footprints along the satellite tracks saral has a smaller footprint and higher along track and vertical resolutions than envisat bonnefond et al 2018 verron et al 2021 radar altimeter measures the two way travel time of the electromagnetic pulse emitted by the sensor and the power reflected by the earth s surface the two way travel time is used to derive an approximate distance between the satellite and the surface the analysis of the radar echo power received by the satellite as a function of the time allows to refine the distance estimate applying a retracking process and to estimate the backscattering coefficient cretaux et al 2017 two types of altimetry data are used here raw data from the geophysical data records gdr and normalized tracks data these are computed along each ground track clustering and for each cycle to obtain 3d gridded information see frappart et al 2021c for more details both datasets are made available by the ctoh through altis data request from http ctoh legos obs mip fr 2 2 2 reference land cover map the reference land cover map will be used as validation of the radar echoes classifications by constructing confusion matrices section 4 1 1 the curuaí region map is from arantes et al 2019 supplementary material figure a a the juruá basin s map is shown in supplementary material figure a b and is available on ornl daac for biogeochemical dynamics website http daac ornl gov high water season maps is available and used here to see the entire inundation extent the overall accuracy for wetland mapping is 93 and 86 for vegetation mapping hess et al 2015 curuaí and juruá regions morphologies and properties are totally contrasted in terms of vegetation density and river width which allow us to test the method in different environments 2 2 3 water level time series 2 2 3 1 wl gauge stations wl gauge records are used to validate the automatically generated wl from radar altimetry data was downloaded from the water s brazilian national agency website hidro telemetria http www snirh gov br hidrotelemetria mapa aspx one wl gauge located in the lago grande 2 25 s 55 33 w near curuaí has collected data since 1982 and has been levelled by high precision gps based on wgs84 coordinate system calmant et al 2013 and reported to egm2008 gravity field model pavlis et al 2012 in the juruá watershed the santos dumont wl gauge 6 44 s 68 24 w is chosen to be the reference because of its proximity to a satellite track and its similar wl recording s period this wl gauge is about 3000 km upstream from the mouth of the juruá see fig 1 and record wl since 1981 it has not been levelled the comparison with altimetry data will be in a relative way to focus on the hydrological cycle s changes 2 2 3 2 altis time series time series of wl can be manually retrieved using the altimetry time series altis software frappart et al 2021a a new version of the maps software multi mission altimetry processing software frappart et al 2015b normandin et al 2018 these time series of wl are used to validate the automatic method presented in this study the software enables the user to select the altimetry data inside a google earth polygon it can display parameters supplied by ctoh backscatter coefficients and wl estimations these parameters are presented as time series obtained computing the median of each cycle valid observations following the processing proposed in cretaux et al 2017 some outliers may still be present in the time series and can be manually removed thanks to a specialized tool 3 methods 3 1 methodology summary the method applied in this study to generate wl from a classification of the radar altimetry echoes is summarized in fig 2 first step consists of applying a k means unsupervised classification technique to radar altimetry parameters as in frappart et al 2021c then best parameter combinations are determined with confusion matrices and accuracy computing finally vs were built on the water covered surfaces and some comparisons are presented with in situ and altis software 3 2 classification of radar altimetry echoes 3 2 1 temporal variations of radar altimetry data the classification s methodology is applied to one or several radar altimetry parameters as their responses differ according to the presence or not of water over open water areas such as rivers and lakes there are large seasonal variations in the backscatter coefficient in ku and ka bands supplementary material figure b frappart et al 2021a 2021b these temporal variations are related to changes in river width or lake extent in the altimeter footprint caused by the increase in wl the larger the water extent the more power backscattered to the radar altimeter as this sensor is nadir pointing large variations of the backscatter coefficients occur along the hydrological cycle well synchronized with the temporal variations of the wl over rivers and lakes in the amazon maxima occur in may june and minima in november december there is smaller variation in the backscatter coefficient over the flooding forests but some variation still remains due to changes in flooding extent present in the several km wide altimeter footprints even when the flooded areas are under vegetation large backscattering responses are observed frappart et al 2015a frappart et al 2021b and time series of water levels can be derived frappart et al 2006 frappart et al 2021c over non flooded forest smaller variations of backscattering and height are observed not related to the changes caused by the hydrological cycle see also frappart et al 2015b frappart et al 2021a these changes can be mostly attributed to orbital drifts plus or minus 1 km around the nominal orbit of the satellite and to changes in local roughness as the wavelength of the electromagnetic waves at ku and ka bands is lower than 0 1 m the chaotic variations in the height observed in the envisat and saral time series are outliers when the tracking is operating well the height is estimated to be continuous these very different temporal behaviors observed in radar altimetry echoes over open water and forest covered areas are used to classify the echoes by type of aquatic environment the unsupervised clustering algorithm k means is used in our method to classify echoes jain and dubes 1988 likas et al 2003 k means is suitable for our purpose as no training dataset can be used due to the complexity of the radar altimeter echoes in very heterogenous environments stammer and cazenave 2017 echoes are grouped into k different clusters based on their shape similarities see fig 3 a translating the soils backscatter coefficient and thus characterizing the land cover a python algorithm is used to obtain these k groups and classify them as fig 3 show it panel b and process to vs creation panel c 3 2 2 echoes classifications tests were conducted considering three to six classes by taking into account the classification test results and as an analysis of the best number of classes was already performed in a previous study frappart et al 2021c the optimal number of k classes is four 0 3 to best represent the different hydrological regimes in the amazon rivers lakes and wetlands without over interpreting the radar echoes kodinariya and makwana 2013 however curuaí and juruá s classes of the validation maps are more than four in order to simplify the comparison closest aquatic environments were grouped together to approximate our four classes classification to assess table 1 summarizes the validation groups of reference classes for our radar echo classification the radar altimetry echoes are classified according to three combinations of parameters backscatter coefficient only b as in frappart et al 2021c backscatter coefficient and raw wl b rwl and backscatter coefficient and normalized wl b nwl indeed the backscatter coefficient is an important parameter to keep to detect the water presence and wl normalization highlights major phases of the hydrological regime in contrast to raw wl where the amplitude variations are highlighted 3 2 3 classification validation then the best parameter accuracy combination is determined for each satellite mission over each study area by analysing confusion matrices between reference land cover maps see fig annexe a and our classifications confusion matrices and accuracies are calculated to quantify the agreement between both and determine the best combination of parameters for each confusion matrix obtained with the classifications the accuracy index is calculated eq 1 this index determines which combination of parameters gives the best classification of radar altimeter echoes it can take values ranging from 0 for poor accuracy to 1 for very good accuracy 1 tp tn tp fp tn fn with tp true positive fp false positive tn true negative and fn false negative 3 3 wl time series 3 3 1 automatic generation of wl time series time series of altimetry derived water levels are generated over the clusters identified as covered with water i e open water and flooded areas for each water covered classes 0 2 a virtual station vs is created fig 3 c indicating the intersection between the ground and a water body vs are created under some conditions depending on water bodies widths a minimal number of 5 radar echoes is required for creating a vs in curuaí for juruá watershed the minimal number is 1 because of the narrowness of the river sections where variations in surface type can be spatially significant the distance between two radar echoes from the same vs of one class must be less than 5 km in curuaí 1 5 km in the juruá watershed the distance between two vs from any class must be at least 1 km in curuaí and in the juruá watershed the maximal distance for a vs process from the same class is 50 km in curuaí 5 km in the juruá watershed then a wl time series is automatically created for each vs to be sure of the classification parameter to keep for wl time series study vs are numerically analysed these results are presented in sub section 4 1 3 3 2 wl time series validation in order to validate the automatic method time series from the parameter presenting the best classification accuracies is analysed here curuaí and juruá s time series of wl are compared with the manually retrieved time series of wl obtained using the altis software and to in situ data these time series are compared in terms of anomalies of wl validation between created vs from the three water presence classes with the in situ data and altis software based wl are achieved by correlation test of r² and rmse some wl comparison results are shown in section 4 2 4 results 4 1 radar echoes classification and virtual station detection 4 1 1 classification of radar altimetry echoes the results of the along track classifications of envisat and saral radar echoes over curuaí and the juruá river are shown in figs 4 5 and supplementary material figures c and d respectively for each parameter corresponding confusion matrix results computed between reference class maps and radar echoes classifications are shown in fig 6 more details are presented in supplementary material tables a and b the four classes represent all the major hydrological regimes present in the study areas very similar results were obtained when considering four to six classes as in frappart et al 2021c not shown here but best solutions were obtained with four classes classes 0 and 3 represent the most and the least widely covered with water areas respectively classes 1 and 2 correspond to intermediate water regimes class 1 corresponding with longer presence of water than class 2 for envisat results over curuaí region true positive tp and false negative fn results are predominant 70 80 representing good correlation for both parameters with a slightly better class correlation for b nwl parameter concerning saral results over curuaí 60 of the results are in good agreement with the map references for b and b nwl parameters but only 25 are in good agreement for b rwl parameter for envisat results over the juruá watershed 41 of the b and b nwl results and 25 of the b rwl results are in good agreement with map reference classes concerning saral results over juruá watershed 33 of the b and b nwl results and 25 of the b rwl are in good agreement 4 1 2 classification selection classification accuracies are shown in table 2 accuracy varies between 0 52 and 0 74 for b and b nwl parameters and between 0 25 and 0 59 for b rwl parameter indeed mixing effects between different types of soil due to the large radar footprint over the surface are taken into account which can explain the moderate accuracy values considering the very small differences between b and b nwl accuracies we only focus on the b nwl parameter because of its innovative character these results are available online on the data repository enguehard et al 2023 4 1 3 virtual station creation for each series of radar echo in the same class and respecting the conditions listed in section 3 3 a vs is created fig 7 presents the number of vs created according to the different combination of parameters and area satellite independently from the accuracies first we can see that the b rwl combination does not allow to create more than 10 vs for at least two classes except for the juruá saral combination where class 0 is over represented more than 500 vs in contrast b and b nwl present similar distribution for each area satellite combination as expected there is much more class 1 vs created in the juruá than in curuaí because of the largest floodplain area crossed by the altimeter finally envisat and saral exhibit similar vs classes distributions in juruá and curuaí for b and b nwl parameters but much less vs are created for curuaí saral compared to curuaí envisat probably due to the only 3 years of saral data used here compared to the 8 years of envisat data however the method proves to be efficient to create vs over amazon floodplains 4 2 wl time series validation time series of wl results are available online on the data repository enguehard et al 2023 here we choose to focus on b nwl time series because of its innovative character compared to the b parameter that has been already studied frappart et al 2021c with the large number of results only vs at the closest location to the gauging stations have been selected for comparison figs 8 and 9 present these vs as well as the r² and rmse between our results and those obtained using altis software supplementary material figs e and f are presenting r² and rmse between our results altis results with the gauging station our results show good correlation with those from altis table 3 summarizes r² and rmse according to areas and sensors our automatic results give better r² and rmse near curuaí with envisat sensor whereas altis results are better compared when using saral data near santos dumont altis results are slightly better than automatic ones when using envisat data finally no automatic vs has been created over the river near santos dumont using saral data then comparisons with our method can t be possible but altis and in situ method seems to be accurate enough 5 discussion 5 1 identification of water regime along altimetry ground tracks through the use of k means clustering and validation against reference land cover maps we are able to attribute hydrological status open water flooded and non flooded areas to each class as in frédéric frappart et al 2021c our classifications and associated regimes coincide well with reference classes arantes et al 2019 hess et al 2015 class 0 is very often located on open water lakes or rivers on the contrary class 3 is mainly located in non flooded areas classes 1 and 2 correspond to intermediate hydrological environment such as permanently or seasonally flooded and seasonally or infrequently flooded respectively nevertheless reference land cover maps may be strongly methodology dependant and thus may not be always accurate for our comparison indeed the reference map over curuaí from arantes et al 2019 has been obtained using landsat optical images acquired between 2008 and 2009 and the one over juruá river from hess et al 2015 has been obtained using sar during the 1996 high water season may to july whereas envisat and saral respectively provide altimetry data over 2002 2010 and 2013 2016 this lack of time concordance may reduce accuracy classifications best classifications are obtained with both b and b nwl parameter for both satellites but we focus on b nwl results only to assess these new results envisat classifications are generally better than saral s ones several reasons are likely to account for such lower accuracies of saral results compared to envisat s the most obvious one is the drift of the saral mission on its nominal orbit of several kilometres from one cycle to another the land cover contained in the saral footprint was different causing inaccuracies in the classification process another one is related to the great time lag between reference maps period 1995 1996 juruá and 2009 2010 for curuaí finally saral is the first sensor to operate at ka band larger scattering in the vegetation and more power backscattered at ka band are measured by saral than at ku band and then affect calculated accuracies 5 2 vs creation and validation vs detection over curuaí is effective river width is up to 6 km and floodplain lakes are large enough to allow a good detection of open water in the radar footprint however the juruá river is narrower locally up to 400 m width downstream and up to 200 m width upstream as well as abandoned meanders that are now lakes detection of water is therefore more difficult nevertheless the virtual stations created are quite numerous especially when using the b or b nwl parameters with this method a significant densification of the virtual station network is therefore achieved as a comparison 6 vs from the hydroweb database http hydroweb theialand fr are available over the amazon in curuaí region while about 100 vs have been created over the river and floodplains with our method for the juruá more than 100 vs from the hydroweb database are available over the river while about 1500 vs have been created over the river and floodplains the backscatter coefficient parameter combined with the raw water levels b rwl did not give satisfying results either for classification accuracies or for number of vs created this may be due to the extreme changes between water levels over the different surface types a bias of almost 2 m can be observed for envisat data and 1 5 m for saral data over curuaí and has been respectively removed previous studies showed that envisat has a 1 m bias compared to in situ gauges calmant et al 2013 santos da silva et al 2010 still part of the bias could be due to the distance between automatic vs and in situ gauges nevertheless r² and rmse are estimated and show good agreement between the automatic time series and altis ones as over the congo river frappart et al 2021c the automatic method over amazon s forest is more efficient than the manual altis software indeed automatic method is faster than altis computation and allow monitoring floodplains areas moreover removing outliers from altis software induce fewer elements in time series despite the slightly worse r² and rmse results than for curuaí the method is rather effective in santos dumont however as it can be seen in fig 9 c juruá river automatic results should be considered with caution juruá river and ancient meanders are well detected using envisat data but during low water period some anomalous water levels can be retrieved most probably due to the narrowness of the river 5 3 river floodplain connectivity using the automatically generated wl series it is possible to carry out a connectivity analysis between floodplain lakes and rivers by examining the duration of the connection between the mainstream and the lakes or between lakes during floods and recessions detecting different filling emptying dynamics between lakes the methodology that leads to an important densification of the number of water level measurement points in rivers and floodplains is an important contribution for the scientific community to better understand the dynamics of river floodplain exchanges and their evolution over time with this method the new densified vs network permits to obtain information on water bodies wl along the river and along river cross sections enabling to analyse hydrologic connectivity between river and lakes and lakes with each other and determine flood duration and rising draining velocities at each vs as an example vs time series in the river and the curuaí floodplain created using envisat data b nwl parameter are shown in fig 10a most of the time the river is flooded before the floodplain except for some years during which the flood is beginning earlier e g 2006 2007 and can last from 6 to 8 months depending on the year generally from november december to may june mean rising velocity is about 0 8 m month in the river and in the floodplain except in the lago grande do curuaí where the flood is slower 0 7 m month then falling phase is beginning and can last from 4 5 to 7 months depending on the year generally until november december draining velocities are about 1 m month in the river and in the floodplain except in the lago grande do curuaí where the flood is slower 0 9 m month indeed west of the floodplain is flooded by the upstream river and small channels before the east which is flooded both by the west floodplain and by channels connected to the downstream river bonnet et al 2008 park and latrubesse 2017 the double input of east floodplain by the channels river is easily seen for some years with the double peaks in the time series e g 2003 2004 2008 2009 vs time series in the juruá river and the floodplain near santos dumont created from envisat b nwl parameter are shown in fig 10b rising can last from 5 to 8 months depending on the year generally from september to march april rising velocity is about 1 2 m month in the river whereas they are slower 0 4 0 7 m month in the floodplain then falling phase is beginning and can last from 4 5 to 8 months depending on the year generally until september draining velocity is about 1 4 m month in the river whereas they are slower 0 5 0 7 m month in the floodplain in this case river is always flooded first and propagation of rising water in the floodplains is well seen after the flood begun several months ago times of connection can be easily recognised when the river is low from the moment when flood begin until the floodplains is rising four months has past e g 2003 2004 2006 2007 times of disconnection between the river and the floodplains are lasting about 6 months in this juruá portion this kind of information coupled with bathymetry can possibly permit to better interpret fish population dynamics hurd et al 2016 park and latrubesse 2017 even if envisat and saral allow to analyse surface water connectivity at monthly time scale the opportunity of the new ka band wide swath radar altimeter of the surface water and ocean topography swot mission will be unique biancamaria et al 2016 owing to its capability to map water levels at 100 m of spatial resolution several times during its 21 day repeat period this new dataset will allow a finer monitoring of the surface water connectivity between river and floodplains 6 conclusion in this study we confirm the strong potential of radar altimetry backscattering coefficient to identify land water surfaces along the tracks compared to a previous study we showed that the discrimination between land and water is enhanced when taking into consideration in the classification process the normalized water level in areas with a complex hydrodynamics such as the curuaí várzea and the juruá watershed in amazon results show good replicability and efficiency over a densely vegetated equatorial area indeed classification accuracies of 0 74 0 53 and 0 69 0 59 were obtained for envisat saral when comparing with reference land cover maps in the curuaí várzea and the juruá watershed respectively using a k means clustering approach based on these results wl time series were automatically generated along the tracks over the classes associated to open water and inundation their creation permitted to strongly densify vs network in the river and the floodplains 4650 vs were created in both areas comparisons show an accuracy ranging from 0 52 0 53 to 0 97 0 98 when comparing the time series of wl automatically generated with envisat saral with ones from the in situ station or the ones manually created in the curuaí várzea on the one hand this method offers possibility to include floodplain water level in current database and allow better surface water stock estimations to monitor areas where in situ data does not exist on the other hand the created wls allow a better connectivity analysis between the river the lakes and the floodplains the wetlands filling dynamic is better understood especially in curuaí where the varzea is filled to the west first via the upstream river and then to the east via channels connected to the western floodplain and the downstream river this information coupled with bathymetry would allow to better understand fish population dynamics and floodplain biogeochemical functioning the recent launch of the swot mission offers new opportunities for better monitoring the channel floodplains connectivity as this new mission will provide water level maps at 100 m of spatial resolution 2 or 3 times every 21 days in equatorial areas credit authorship contribution statement pauline enguehard
