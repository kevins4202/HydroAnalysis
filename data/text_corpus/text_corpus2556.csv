12780,superwettability modification of membrane surface has attracted extensive attention for efficient oil water emulsion separation in view of membrane antifouling the design of micro and nanoscale structure on membrane surface which plays an important role in improving wettability is significant but remains challenging in this study inspired by polyphenols coating and multifunctional metal phenolic networks mpns a series of superwettable membranes with double layer and hierarchical structure derived from pca coating and various ca metal ions nanoparticles networks were facilely obtained specifically the pca former layer provided hydrophilic basis and the ca metal ions nanoparticles networks provided hierarchical micro and nanoscale structures the obtained membranes with double layer and hierarchical structures were thus bestowed superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic and antifouling features which made it capable of efficient oil water emulsion separation with high oil rejection all higher than 98 8 in addition the obtained membranes possessed satisfactory self clean ability stability and mechanical property the demonstrated pca ca metal ion nanoparticles derived strategy for double layer and hierarchical structures modification in this work may offer a pave way to endow various materials with superwettability and antifouling property for multiple applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords caffeic acid metal ions nanoparticles hierarchical structure superwettability oil water emulsion separation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction great efforts have been devoted to developing global industrialization and exploring marine resources 1 2 along with exponentially increasing industrial oily wastewater discharge and oil spill accidents 3 6 to solve these urgent problems many techniques e g air flotation 7 coagulation and gravity separation 8 have been designed for oil water separation however the techniques mentioned above suffered from relatively low oil water separation efficiency 2 especially for oil water emulsion with small oil droplets 9 membrane separation technique has been intensively developed for stable oil water emulsion separation 10 however most commercial polymer membranes are semi hydrophobic materials 11 12 resulting in intractable membrane fouling 13 16 thus membranes with superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity shl uwsob have been constructed to reduce membrane fouling for efficient oil water emulsion separation 14 19 as reported the hydrophilicity and underwater oleophobicity of membranes could be sharply enhanced by fabricating the hierarchical structure with micro and nanoscale roughness on membrane surface directed by wenzel and cassie models 17 19 thus great efforts have been devoted to obtaining shl uwsob membranes by constructing hydrophilic coating with hierarchical structure on membrane surface 20 of late years nature polyphenols such as catechin cat tannic acid ta 21 and epigallocatechin egcg 22 with special physic chemical characteristics have been extensively used in preparing shl uwsob membrane with hierarchical structure 23 24 xiao et al 25 used ta and metal ion to make a stable and anti fouling coating on nanofiltration nf membranes surface by a layer by layer lbl self assembly method and the nf membrane had a permeance of 40 9 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 with over 93 9 dye rejection wang et al 26 introduced ta hydrolysable 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes and fe3 onto membrane surface a hierarchical coating was successfully developed the modified membrane possessed outstanding shl uwsob nonetheless the utilization of plant polyphenols based strategy for fabricating shl uwsob membrane with hierarchical structure has not yet been extensively explored caffeic acid 3 4 dihydroxycinnamic acid ca as a natural phenolic acid compound has gained growing research interests in various biological applications 27 29 with special catechol and cc groups ca has excellent hydrophilicity and feasibility in terms of chemical modification 30 notably the cooh of ca was easily to ionize and hydrate 28 thus better performance can be achieved in shl uwsob membrane modification 31 wang et al 32 designed a superwettable cotton fibers by co depositing ca and chitosan the modified fibers showed outstanding performance in wastewater treatment lai et al 33 used ca and polyethyleneimine to prepare a superwetting melamine sponge for oil water emulsion separation as well as dye adsorption he et al 34 developed h2o2 triggered pca coatings on filtration membranes which exhibited good hydrophilicity and underwater oleophobicity although the hydrophilic composition was successfully formed on the surface of some material by the ca derived networks mentioned above these works still suffered limitation in building hierarchical micro and nanoscale structures which restricted the antifouling property thus the construction of both the hydrophilic layer and hierarchical structures of membrane basing on ca derived networks are fascinating which can greatly enrich the application of ca metal phenolic networks mpns an emerging coating layer combing the features of nature polyphenols and metal ions have been extensively applied in surface functionalization 26 inspired by the multifunctional mpns our attention has been paid to the chelation and reduction ability of ca we supposed that ca metal networks could be introduced onto membrane like other common mpns and simultaneously forming ca metal particles to the best of our knowledge the surface micro and nanoscale structure modification based on the coordination of ca and transition mental ions nanoparticles has barely been reported the polyphenols coating and mpns inspired us to fabricate shl uwsob membrane with double layer as well as hierarchical micro and nanoscale structures via a pca ca metal ion nanoparticles derived strategy in this research pca layer was formed on the pristine pvdf membrane by a self assembly process at first which provided the hydrophilic basis during the self assembly process fig 1 benzoquinone was generated via an oxidation reaction in catechol group of ca followed by its polymerization through 1 4 michael addition reaction 31 35 36 metal ions fe2 cu2 ag were further introduced to form ca metal ions networks fig 1 which provided hierarchical micro and nanoscale structures the second layer noteworthily we found it surprisedly that ag could be rapidly reduced into ag atoms and then ag nanoparticles agnps were in situ formed on the membrane surface 35 37 by integrating the advantages of hydrophilic pca coating and hierarchical structures the modified membranes showed superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity and favorable antifouling property which not only improve the pure water flux but also endow the membrane with exceptional oil water emulsion separation performance besides the pca ca metal modified membranes also showed favorable recyclability mechanical ability and stability which promised the application of the modified membrane in a real oily wastewater treatment 2

optical surface analyzer lsa60 lauda scientific germany 2 4 permeation performance the pure water permeation test for modified membranes was carried out in a vacuum filter apparatus under 0 1 mpa the effective membrane area was 12 56 cm2 the dry membranes were pre wetted and pre pressured for 5 min and then the stable pure water flux was recorded triplicate experiments were conducted to ensure the repeatability of the experiment the pure water flux j w l m 2 h 1 was calculated as follows 1 j w v a t where v l was the volume of feed solution fixed at 100 ml a m 2 was the effective separation area and t h was the permeation time 2 5 oil water emulsion separation a sds stabilized oil water emulsion namely sds kerosene water was prepared for the test specifically the emulsified oil was prepared by mixing oil and water 1 99 v v with sds 0 2 mg ml and then dispersed by a high speed dispersion machine en630 2s0007lj modern environment china at a high stirring speed 3500 rpm for 5 h to obtain the stabilized off white emulsions the size distribution of oil droplets was analyzed via laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern uk and nano measure software the oil water

cyclic filtration sds kerosene water emulsion experiment was performed during this process the modified membrane was subjected to pure water filtration and emulsion separation alternately and only a simple rinse with the di water 60 s was required before next cycle for each cycle the pure water flux emulsion flux oil rejection as well as pure water flux recovery ratio were recorded 2 7 mechanical property a fifth cyclic abrasion test was used to examine the mechanical property of the pca ca metal modified membranes the modified membrane was fixed on the table subsequently an 800 mesh sandpaper with 200 g weight was dragged though the modified membrane fig s1 the scratch resistance of the modified membranes was evaluated by measuring the initial wca as well as uoca after each five cycle and observing the membrane surface by fe sem after been abrased for 50 cycles 2 8 stability assessment the stability of the superwettability of pca ca metal modified membranes was assessed by carrying out rinsing test the different membranes were fixed onto the inner surface of a transparent plastic measuring cup 5000 ml followed by adding the pure water or sds kerosene water emulsion into the measuring cup until the liquid level was above the membrane fig s2 the solution was stirred at 1500 rpm for a certain time 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h 10 h by a high speed dispersion machine en630 2s0007lj modern environment china the initial wca and uoca of the modified membranes were recorded after been treated for different time 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of membranes 3 1 1 morphologies the self assembly of ca metal ions nanoparticles coordination happened on the pvdf membranes surface after the self assembly process a sharp change in the color of the pca ca fe pvdf dark blue pca ca cu pvdf black and pca ca ag pvdf tawny could be clearly observed in fig 3a respectively the color change might result from the ligand to metal charge transfer band 38 additionally the surface morphologies of the pristine pvdf pca pvdf pca ca fe pvdf pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes were further revealed by fe sem the fe sem images of pca coating membrane were shown in fig 3a unlike the smooth surface of the pristine membrane after oxidation by o2 and aps several clustered pca particles were found attached on the pca pvdf membrane surface 39 fig 3b c after immersing the pca pvdf membrane into metal ion fe2 cu2 and ag solution the number of nano sized particles sharply increased fig 3b c which could be caused by the in suit complexing of metal ions nanoparticles with ca 40 41 in addition significant differences appeared in the distribution and quantity of the nano sized particles forming above the pca coating layer on pca ca fe pvdf pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes surface as compared with pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes the nano sized particles of the pca ca fe pvdf membrane were distributed more evenly especially the composite ca fe nano sized particles deposited uniformity not only on the surface of the membrane but also on the beneath micropore surface fig s3 these significant surface morphology of pca ca fe pvdf membrane could result in the best hydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity among pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes which would be testified in the following section for the pca ca cu pvdf membrane the generated ca cu nano sized particles showed relatively low distribution above the pca coating layer moreover numerous silver nanoparticles agnps were observed on the pca ca ag pvdf membrane surface this phenomenon illustrated that ca with strong reducibility could chelate and simultaneously reduce ag them into ag0 particles 35 these results implicated that hierarchical micro nano structures were successfully designed which provided by pca as well as ca metal networks simultaneously the hierarchical structures endowed the membranes with great surface roughness to better reveal the surface roughness of resultant membranes three dimensional afm images were captured and the results were shown in fig 3d as compared with the pristine membrane the average roughness ra values of the modified membranes considerably increased from 35 1 nm pristine pvdf to 110 nm 173 nm 179 nm and 181 nm for pca pvdf pca ca fe pvdf pca ca ag pvdf and pca ca cu pvdf membranes respectively which might lead to their better hydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity 42 eds mapping was conducted to determine metal element distribution as we can see in fig 3f fe and cu elements were well distributed whereas the distribution of agnps is uneven accompanied with a slight agglomeration on pca ca ag pvdf membrane the phenomenon could be explained from two aspects 1 ag could be easily reduced into agnps 22 43 2 the concentration of ag could be sufficiently high as to surpass a saturation point and present agglomeration 44 3 1 2 chemical features evolution of the chemical structures of the membranes were analyzed by atr ftir fig 4a and xps fig 4b table 1 the atr ftir spectra between pca pvdf pca ca fe pvdf pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes did not show significant differences however in contrasted with the origin pvdf the ftir spectra of the pca pvdf pca ca fe pvdf pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes exhibited new peaks at 1722 cm 1 and 1510 cm 1 which were attributed to the stretching vibration of oco and the benzene ring skeleton 45 31 32 respectively the phenomena indicated the coating of the former pca layer on the membranes surface the characteristic absorption peak of pvdf membrane at 1400 cm 1 corresponding to the cf2 stretching vibration 46 by xps measurement the constituent elements of the origin and modified membranes surface could be further evaluated the wide scan spectra fig 4b of all the membranes contained c 1s o 1s n 1s and f 1s signals there was a stronger o 1s signal on the pca pvdf compared to the origin pvdf which verified that pca was successfully deposited on the membrane surface in addition three new peaks fe 2p cu 2p and ag 3d at 710 9 ev 934 1 and 368 ev 47 49 appeared on the pca ca fe pvdf pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes respectively it was shown that the pca ca metal modified pvdf membranes were successfully prepared the element compositions of different membranes were shown in table 1 compared with the pristine pvdf the atomic percentage of oxygen was enhanced from 3 2 to 5 7 on the pca pvdf membrane surface result from the plentiful phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl of ca 46 of note the atomic percentage of oxygen on the surface of pca ca fe pvdf pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes were obviously increased the phenomenon indicated that the oxidation of catechol group in ca could be further promoted by the reaction between metal ion and ca 43 46 50 it was also found that the atomic percentage of fluorine declined significantly from 41 97 to 25 46 ca fe pvdf 31 05 ca cu pvdf and 27 85 ca ag pvdf possibly due to the coverage of the membrane surface by the newly formed double layer 51 the core level xps spectra of c 1s and o 1s for all modified membranes were shown in fig 4c f and g j respectively in the case of c 1s core level xps spectrum the main peaks of cc cc 284 1 ev co 285 6 ev c o 287 5 ev cf 290 1 ev were detected 52 the co bond was from the former pca coating on the membranes surface 31 the presence of more co moiety with the introduction of fe2 cu2 and ag could further confirm that the oxidation of catechol groups cloud be accelerated by the reaction between metal ion and ca 43 46 50 the o 1s core level xps spectrum of pca pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes could be deconvoluted into two peaks corresponding to co 531 ev and co 532 5 ev while the o 1 s peak of pca ca fe pvdf membrane at 531 1 ev belongs to co and feo 53 55 simultaneously the o 1s core level xps spectrum of pca ca cu pvdf could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 531 1 532 5 and 530 4 ev corresponding to co co cuo respectively 48 56 as can be seen from fig 5a the peaks with the binding energy of 710 9 ev and 724 4 ev corresponded to fe ii 2p3 2 and fe ii 2p1 2 respectively further indicating the presence of fe element in the pca ca fe pvdf membrane 47 meanwhile ag 3d3 2 374 ev and ag 3d5 2 368 ev peaks were emerged on the ag 3d core level spectrum of pca ca ag pvdf membrane obviously fig 5c 44 49 besides ag0 species there was no peak of other chemical states existing in the spectrum 49 further indicating the formation of agnps on the pca ca ag pvdf membrane surface moreover the cu 2p core level spectrum of pca ca cu pvdf membrane could be curve fitted into eight peaks fig 5b the peaks at 933 1 ev and 952 2 ev referred to cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 respectively 48 the peaks at 932 2 ev and 934 1 ev could be ascribed to cu2o and cu oh 2 46 56 the peak at 954 3 ev could be regarded as cuo cu2 48 besides there were peaks around 940 ev and 960 ev which represented cu2 satellite 48 the results of xps analysis further confirmed that the ca metal ions nanoparticles were successfully fabricated on the membrane surface based on the ftir and xps results above the possible chemical structure of the pca ca metal double layer was illustrated in fig 5d in a word the pca coating laid the foundation of hydrophilicity on membrane surface and ca metal networks provided the hierarchical micro and nano structural which were the two indispensable factors for obtaining the shl uwsob membrane with exceptional antifouling ability 3 1 3 wettability oil repellency and self cleaning capability wettability is an essential characteristic of the modified membranes which was comprehensively assessed by measuring the initial wca and uoca kerosene n hexane 1 2 dichloromethane 1 2 dichloroethane as seen in fig 6a b due to the highly hydrophobic nature of the original pvdf membrane 43 the initial wca was 131 94 with negligible change in 10 s with pca coating on the membrane surface the initial wca decreased to 22 5 and the membrane could be completely permeated by a water droplet 5 Î¼l within 15 04 s result from the polar surface generated by pca 32 after further treatment with metal ion the initial wca declined to 14 6 pca ca fe pvdf 20 51 pca ca cu pvdf and 18 3 pca ca ag pvdf respectively all pca ca metal modified membranes could be wetted by a water droplet within 8 21s pca ca fe pvdf 12 61s pca ca cu pvdf and 10 67s pca ca ag pvdf the corresponding dynamic photographs of the wca were shown in fig 6c and videos 1 4 comparing to pca pvdf membrane the better hydrophilicity of pca ca metal modified membranes indicated that the incorporated ca metal networks were favorable to membrane hydrophilicity the improvement of the hydrophilicity might be due to the hydrogen bond hydration of water interacting with ca and iron 57 58 for the pca ca ag pvdf the enhanced hydrophilicity also provided by the hydrophilic agnps 59 in addition according to the wenzel model 4 cosÎ¸ w rcosÎ¸ i wettability is an essential characteristic of the modified membranes which was comprehensively assessed by measuring the initial wca and uoca

59 in addition according to the wenzel model 4 cosÎ¸ w rcosÎ¸ i Î¸w the apparent contact angle of a water droplet on a solid surface Î¸i the intrinsic contact angle of a water droplet on a solid surface r the surface roughness factor 60 61 we can clearly find that the roughness of modified membrane surfaces provided by ca metal nanoparticles can magnify the membrane hydrophilicity when Î¸i 90 9 62 furthermore the uoca for four types of oil including kerosene n hexane 1 2 dichloromethane and 1 2 dichloroethane were presented in fig 7a d the pristine membrane exhibited less oleophobicity in water and its uoca towards different oil was about 120 after only coated by pca although the uoca increased about 147 it did not show underwater superoleophobicity uoca 150 and yet due to the ca metal networks and the sharply improved roughness hierarchical micro nano structures which could induce a robust water layer and avoid the applied oil droplets move into the structure grooves 63 64 fig 7e the uoca of pca ca fe pvdf pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes towards different tested oils were 150 especially all the uoca of pca ca fe pvdf membrane was higher than 156 12 and the uoca of pca ca fe pvdf membrane could reach to 160 86 almost spherical shape for the 1 2 dichloromethane indicating underwater superoleophobicity to better understand the oil repellency of the pca ca metal pvdf modified membranes in water environment the dynamically pressing and lifting experiment of the oil droplets on the pca ca fe pvdf pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes surface were conducted an oil droplet 6 Î¼l of kerosene n hexane 1 2 dichloromethane and 1 2 dichloroethane in water was forced to adequately contact the membrane surface under a large force and then the oil droplet was lifted up by a syringe respectively fig 8a d for pca ca fe pvdf fig s4a h for pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf videos 5 16 in all cases the oil droplets could be easily removed from the membrane surface returning to spheres without any obvious deformation clean membrane surfaces were observed without oil residue demonstrating the ultrahigh oil repellency of the pca ca metal modified membranes to better understand the oil repellency of the pca ca metal pvdf modified membranes in water environment the dynamically pressing and lifting experiment of the oil droplets on the pca ca fe pvdf pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes surface were conducted an oil droplet 6 Î¼l of kerosene n hexane 1 2 dichloromethane and 1 2 dichloroethane in water was forced to adequately contact the membrane surface under a large force and then the oil droplet was lifted up by a syringe respectively fig 8a d for pca ca fe pvdf fig s4a h for pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf videos 5 16 in all cases the oil droplets could be easily removed from the membrane surface returning to spheres without any obvious deformation clean membrane surfaces were observed without oil residue demonstrating the ultrahigh oil repellency of the pca ca metal modified membranes fig 9a c and videos 17 19 displayed the self cleaning performance of the pca ca metal modified membranes colored kerosene was dropped on pca ca fe fig 9a c and videos 17 19 displayed the self cleaning performance of the pca ca metal modified membranes colored kerosene was dropped on pca ca fe pvdf pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes which were prewetted by di water respectively then the membranes were immersed in water completely it was observed that the oil stains on the membrane surface were readily removed indicating a superior self cleaning property of the pca ca metal modified membranes to further evaluate the self cleaning feature measurements on uosa underwater oil slide angle of pca ca metal pvdf in terms of kerosene n hexane and 1 2 dichloromethane were carried out as long as the modified membranes were slightly tilted the oil droplet could easily roll away from the sample surface fig 10a c video 20 22 for pca ca fe pvdf fig s5a c video 23 25 for pca ca cu pvdf fig s5d f video 26 28 for pca ca ag pvdf and could maintain an ultra low sliding angle of below 5 of multiple oil especially the uosa of pca ca fe pvdf membrane was nearly to 0 for both the kerosene and n hexane indicating outstanding self cleaning performance to further evaluate the self cleaning feature measurements on uosa underwater oil slide angle of pca ca metal pvdf in terms of kerosene n hexane and 1 2 dichloromethane were carried out as long as the modified membranes were slightly tilted the oil droplet could easily roll away from the sample surface fig 10a c video 20 22 for pca ca fe pvdf fig s5a c video 23 25 for pca ca cu pvdf fig s5d f video 26 28 for pca ca ag pvdf and could maintain an ultra low sliding angle of below 5 of multiple oil especially the uosa of pca ca fe pvdf membrane was nearly to 0 for both the kerosene and n hexane indicating outstanding self cleaning performance 3 2 permeation and oil water separation performance fig 11a showed the pure water permeability of different membranes coated with pca the pure water flux of pca pvdf membrane was 4038 73 l m2h the pca pvdf modified with different metal ion nanoparticles exhibited significantly improved water permeability all higher than 4900 l m2h the optimum flux of pca ca metal modified membranes was about 5847 96 l m2h pca ca fe pvdf which is nearly 1 5 times of the pca pvdf membrane the sds kerosene water emulsion separation experiment was further conducted fig 11b d was the emulsion permeation performance of different pca ca metal modified membranes during the filtration process water penetrated through the pca ca metal modified membranes while the oil was repelled after purified by pca ca metal modified membranes the milky white emulsions with an average oil droplet size of 2417 nm fig 11f became transparent and significant differences between the feed and filtrate could also be seen from the optical micrographs in addition the droplet size of the filtrate of pca ca fe pvdf was 10 nm with an average oil droplet size of 6 52 nm 38 01 nm of pca ca cu 27 3 nm of pca ca ag fig s7a c which could intuitively display that almost all kerosene oil droplets were removed by pca ca metal membranes of note the as prepared emulsion could remain stable without demulsification for at least 1 month fig s6 the results above indicated that the oil droplets in the sds kerosene water emulsion could be effectively intercepted by the pca ca metal modified membranes and couldn t enter the filtrate fig 11e showed the emulsion flux and separation efficiency oil rejection of different membranes by comparing with pca pvdf membrane 1829 65 l m2h 98 41 the emulsion flux and separation efficiency of pca ca metal modified membranes increased obviously all higher than 2100 l m2h and 98 8 among them the pca ca fe pvdf membrane demonstrated the highest emulsion flux of 2955 15 which is nearly 1 7 times of the pca pvdf membrane and optimum separation efficiency 99 67 besides the oil content in the filtrate and the feed emulsions were displayed in table s1 the average oil content of the filtrate 13 8 mg l of pca ca fe 49 9 mg l of pca ca cu 36 3 mg l of pca ca ag were obviously lower than that of the pca pvdf membrane 68 2 mg l showing a better performance in oil water separation 3 3 recyclability and antifouling property the superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity of the pca ca metal membranes were believed to endow membranes with remarkable antifouling property and thus ensure desirable performance in cycle separation experiments recyclability the recyclability and antifouling property of the pca ca metal membranes were evaluated by subjecting them to repeated filtration cycles five cycle of the sds kerosene water emulsion in each cycle pure water flux and the emulsion flux of the pca ca fe pvdf membrane could maintain a high level which were all above 5200 l m2 h and 2900 l m2 h respectively fig 12a and no remarkable flux decline could be seen after five cycles the pure water flux of the pca ca fe pvdf membrane could recover 90 of the original level fig 12b while the prepared pca ca cu and pca ca ag membranes demonstrated lower pure water flux 4342 07 l m2 h for pca ca cu 4630 86 l m2 h for pca ca ag emulsion flux 2108 51 l m2 h for pca ca cu 2402 07 l m2 h for pca ca ag and flux recovery 87 80 for pca ca cu 89 38 for pca ca ag after the filtration experiment compared to pca ca fe pvdf membrane both exhibited excellent recyclable oil resistance with stable oil rejection 98 84 for pca ca cu 99 16 for pca ca ag fig s8 a f in contrast after a five cycle filtration test the pca coated membrane showed a relatively high reduction in both pure water flux and emulsion flux indicating the limitation of hydrophilic pca coating in avoiding oil fouling and the pure water flux of the pca pvdf membrane could only recover 76 3 of the original level fig 12a b although the pca pvdf membranes successfully rejected oil with stable oil rejection 98 4 after five cycle filtration test the pca ca metal pvdf membrane still exhibited higher emulsion purification efficiency particularly for pca ca fe pvdf 99 67 fig 12c under transmembrane pressure the pca ca metal modified membranes were covered by the oil fig 13a c the oil layer on the modified membranes surface were rapidly rinsed off by di water fig 13a c which further indicated the modified membranes possessed outstanding antifouling property according to the above results the superhydrophilic coating and hierarchical micro nano structures which were provided by ca metal networks greatly enhanced the antifouling capacity and recyclability of membrane a possible antifouling mechanism for the pca ca metal modified membranes was illustrated in fig 7e in water environment the pca coating former layer which contributed greatly to the hydrophilicity of membrane surface could attract water molecules and a great number of water micropockets could be further trapped in hierarchical micro and nanoscale structures on the pca ca metal modified membranes surface 65 during the emulsion separation process the oil droplets in water environment tended to approach and accumulate on membrane surface under transmembrane pressure 66 the water layer and water micropockets could avoid the further contact between the immiscible oil droplets and inner membranes surface thus the pca ca metal modified membranes displayed super low adhesion for oil droplets in water and the oil droplets could be easily rinsed off by water flow 3 4 stability the stability of the pca ca metal modified membranes was examined by a rinsing test for different time 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h 10 h during the process of rinsing test fig 14a c the initial wca values fluctuate around the 14 pca ca fe pvdf 20 pca ca cu pvdf and 18 pca ca ag pvdf as well as the uoca 1 2 dichloroethane values were around 158 pca ca fe pvdf 151 pca ca cu pvdf and 154 pca ca ag pvdf negligible decrease in both the initial wca and uoca of the pca ca metal modified membranes was observed after pure water rinsing test the sds kerosene water emulsion rinsing test of the pca ca metal modified membranes was illustrated in fig 14d f in spite a slight increase the membranes remained satisfactory hydrophilicity with initial wca around 16 67 pca ca fe pvdf 23 24 pca ca cu pvdf and 20 58 pca ca ag pvdf and there was a slight drop in the uoca whereas the uoca of the pca ca metal modified membrane were higher than 149 after

12780,superwettability modification of membrane surface has attracted extensive attention for efficient oil water emulsion separation in view of membrane antifouling the design of micro and nanoscale structure on membrane surface which plays an important role in improving wettability is significant but remains challenging in this study inspired by polyphenols coating and multifunctional metal phenolic networks mpns a series of superwettable membranes with double layer and hierarchical structure derived from pca coating and various ca metal ions nanoparticles networks were facilely obtained specifically the pca former layer provided hydrophilic basis and the ca metal ions nanoparticles networks provided hierarchical micro and nanoscale structures the obtained membranes with double layer and hierarchical structures were thus bestowed superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic and antifouling features which made it capable of efficient oil water emulsion separation with high oil rejection all higher than 98 8 in addition the obtained membranes possessed satisfactory self clean ability stability and mechanical property the demonstrated pca ca metal ion nanoparticles derived strategy for double layer and hierarchical structures modification in this work may offer a pave way to endow various materials with superwettability and antifouling property for multiple applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords caffeic acid metal ions nanoparticles hierarchical structure superwettability oil water emulsion separation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction great efforts have been devoted to developing global industrialization and exploring marine resources 1 2 along with exponentially increasing industrial oily wastewater discharge and oil spill accidents 3 6 to solve these urgent problems many techniques e g air flotation 7 coagulation and gravity separation 8 have been designed for oil water separation however the techniques mentioned above suffered from relatively low oil water separation efficiency 2 especially for oil water emulsion with small oil droplets 9 membrane separation technique has been intensively developed for stable oil water emulsion separation 10 however most commercial polymer membranes are semi hydrophobic materials 11 12 resulting in intractable membrane fouling 13 16 thus membranes with superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity shl uwsob have been constructed to reduce membrane fouling for efficient oil water emulsion separation 14 19 as reported the hydrophilicity and underwater oleophobicity of membranes could be sharply enhanced by fabricating the hierarchical structure with micro and nanoscale roughness on membrane surface directed by wenzel and cassie models 17 19 thus great efforts have been devoted to obtaining shl uwsob membranes by constructing hydrophilic coating with hierarchical structure on membrane surface 20 of late years nature polyphenols such as catechin cat tannic acid ta 21 and epigallocatechin egcg 22 with special physic chemical characteristics have been extensively used in preparing shl uwsob membrane with hierarchical structure 23 24 xiao et al 25 used ta and metal ion to make a stable and anti fouling coating on nanofiltration nf membranes surface by a layer by layer lbl self assembly method and the nf membrane had a permeance of 40 9 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 with over 93 9 dye rejection wang et al 26 introduced ta hydrolysable 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes and fe3 onto membrane surface a hierarchical coating was successfully developed the modified membrane possessed outstanding shl uwsob nonetheless the utilization of plant polyphenols based strategy for fabricating shl uwsob membrane with hierarchical structure has not yet been extensively explored caffeic acid 3 4 dihydroxycinnamic acid ca as a natural phenolic acid compound has gained growing research interests in various biological applications 27 29 with special catechol and cc groups ca has excellent hydrophilicity and feasibility in terms of chemical modification 30 notably the cooh of ca was easily to ionize and hydrate 28 thus better performance can be achieved in shl uwsob membrane modification 31 wang et al 32 designed a superwettable cotton fibers by co depositing ca and chitosan the modified fibers showed outstanding performance in wastewater treatment lai et al 33 used ca and polyethyleneimine to prepare a superwetting melamine sponge for oil water emulsion separation as well as dye adsorption he et al 34 developed h2o2 triggered pca coatings on filtration membranes which exhibited good hydrophilicity and underwater oleophobicity although the hydrophilic composition was successfully formed on the surface of some material by the ca derived networks mentioned above these works still suffered limitation in building hierarchical micro and nanoscale structures which restricted the antifouling property thus the construction of both the hydrophilic layer and hierarchical structures of membrane basing on ca derived networks are fascinating which can greatly enrich the application of ca metal phenolic networks mpns an emerging coating layer combing the features of nature polyphenols and metal ions have been extensively applied in surface functionalization 26 inspired by the multifunctional mpns our attention has been paid to the chelation and reduction ability of ca we supposed that ca metal networks could be introduced onto membrane like other common mpns and simultaneously forming ca metal particles to the best of our knowledge the surface micro and nanoscale structure modification based on the coordination of ca and transition mental ions nanoparticles has barely been reported the polyphenols coating and mpns inspired us to fabricate shl uwsob membrane with double layer as well as hierarchical micro and nanoscale structures via a pca ca metal ion nanoparticles derived strategy in this research pca layer was formed on the pristine pvdf membrane by a self assembly process at first which provided the hydrophilic basis during the self assembly process fig 1 benzoquinone was generated via an oxidation reaction in catechol group of ca followed by its polymerization through 1 4 michael addition reaction 31 35 36 metal ions fe2 cu2 ag were further introduced to form ca metal ions networks fig 1 which provided hierarchical micro and nanoscale structures the second layer noteworthily we found it surprisedly that ag could be rapidly reduced into ag atoms and then ag nanoparticles agnps were in situ formed on the membrane surface 35 37 by integrating the advantages of hydrophilic pca coating and hierarchical structures the modified membranes showed superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity and favorable antifouling property which not only improve the pure water flux but also endow the membrane with exceptional oil water emulsion separation performance besides the pca ca metal modified membranes also showed favorable recyclability mechanical ability and stability which promised the application of the modified membrane in a real oily wastewater treatment 2

optical surface analyzer lsa60 lauda scientific germany 2 4 permeation performance the pure water permeation test for modified membranes was carried out in a vacuum filter apparatus under 0 1 mpa the effective membrane area was 12 56 cm2 the dry membranes were pre wetted and pre pressured for 5 min and then the stable pure water flux was recorded triplicate experiments were conducted to ensure the repeatability of the experiment the pure water flux j w l m 2 h 1 was calculated as follows 1 j w v a t where v l was the volume of feed solution fixed at 100 ml a m 2 was the effective separation area and t h was the permeation time 2 5 oil water emulsion separation a sds stabilized oil water emulsion namely sds kerosene water was prepared for the test specifically the emulsified oil was prepared by mixing oil and water 1 99 v v with sds 0 2 mg ml and then dispersed by a high speed dispersion machine en630 2s0007lj modern environment china at a high stirring speed 3500 rpm for 5 h to obtain the stabilized off white emulsions the size distribution of oil droplets was analyzed via laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern uk and nano measure software the oil water

cyclic filtration sds kerosene water emulsion experiment was performed during this process the modified membrane was subjected to pure water filtration and emulsion separation alternately and only a simple rinse with the di water 60 s was required before next cycle for each cycle the pure water flux emulsion flux oil rejection as well as pure water flux recovery ratio were recorded 2 7 mechanical property a fifth cyclic abrasion test was used to examine the mechanical property of the pca ca metal modified membranes the modified membrane was fixed on the table subsequently an 800 mesh sandpaper with 200 g weight was dragged though the modified membrane fig s1 the scratch resistance of the modified membranes was evaluated by measuring the initial wca as well as uoca after each five cycle and observing the membrane surface by fe sem after been abrased for 50 cycles 2 8 stability assessment the stability of the superwettability of pca ca metal modified membranes was assessed by carrying out rinsing test the different membranes were fixed onto the inner surface of a transparent plastic measuring cup 5000 ml followed by adding the pure water or sds kerosene water emulsion into the

environment china the initial wca and uoca of the modified membranes were recorded after been treated for different time 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of membranes 3 1 1 morphologies the self assembly of ca metal ions nanoparticles coordination happened on the pvdf membranes surface after the self assembly process a sharp change in the color of the pca ca fe pvdf dark blue pca ca cu pvdf black and pca ca ag pvdf tawny could be clearly observed in fig 3a respectively the color change might result from the ligand to metal charge transfer band 38 additionally the surface morphologies of the pristine pvdf pca pvdf pca ca fe pvdf pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes were further revealed by fe sem the fe sem images of pca coating membrane were shown in fig 3a unlike the smooth surface of the pristine membrane after oxidation by o2 and aps several clustered pca particles were found attached on the pca pvdf membrane surface 39 fig 3b c after immersing the pca pvdf membrane into metal ion fe2 cu2 and ag solution the number of nano sized particles sharply increased fig 3b c which could be caused by the in suit complexing of metal ions nanoparticles with ca 40 41 in addition significant differences appeared in the distribution and quantity of the nano sized particles forming above the pca coating layer on pca ca fe pvdf pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes surface as compared with pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes the nano sized particles of the pca ca fe pvdf membrane were distributed more evenly especially the composite ca fe nano sized particles deposited uniformity not only on the surface of the membrane but also on the beneath micropore surface fig s3 these significant surface morphology of pca ca fe pvdf membrane could result in the best hydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity among pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes which would be testified in the following section for the pca ca cu pvdf membrane the generated ca cu nano sized particles showed relatively low distribution above the pca coating layer moreover numerous silver nanoparticles agnps were observed on the pca ca ag pvdf membrane surface this phenomenon illustrated that ca with strong reducibility could chelate and simultaneously reduce ag them into ag0 particles 35 these results implicated that hierarchical micro nano structures were successfully designed which provided by pca as well as ca metal networks simultaneously the hierarchical structures endowed the membranes with great surface roughness to better reveal the surface roughness of resultant membranes three dimensional afm images were captured and the results were shown in fig 3d as compared with the pristine membrane the average roughness ra values of the modified membranes considerably increased from 35 1 nm pristine pvdf to 110 nm 173 nm 179 nm and 181 nm for pca pvdf pca ca fe pvdf pca ca ag pvdf and pca ca cu pvdf membranes respectively which might lead to their better hydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity 42 eds mapping was conducted to determine metal element distribution as we can see in fig 3f fe and cu elements were well distributed whereas the distribution of agnps is uneven accompanied with a slight agglomeration on pca ca ag pvdf membrane the phenomenon could be explained from two aspects 1 ag could be easily reduced into agnps 22 43 2 the concentration of ag could be sufficiently high as to surpass a saturation point and present agglomeration 44 3 1 2 chemical features evolution of the chemical structures of the membranes were analyzed by atr ftir fig 4a and xps fig 4b table 1 the atr ftir spectra between pca pvdf pca ca fe pvdf pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes did not show significant differences however in contrasted with the origin pvdf the ftir spectra of the pca pvdf pca ca fe pvdf pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes exhibited new peaks at 1722 cm 1 and 1510 cm 1 which were attributed to the stretching vibration of oco and the benzene ring skeleton 45 31 32 respectively the phenomena indicated the coating of the former pca layer on the membranes surface the characteristic absorption peak of pvdf membrane at 1400 cm 1 corresponding to the cf2 stretching vibration 46 by xps measurement the constituent elements of the origin and modified membranes surface could be further evaluated the wide scan spectra fig 4b of all the membranes contained c 1s o 1s n 1s and f 1s signals there was a stronger o 1s signal on the pca pvdf compared to the origin pvdf which verified that pca was successfully deposited on the membrane surface in addition three new peaks fe 2p cu 2p and ag 3d at 710 9 ev 934 1 and 368 ev 47 49 appeared on the pca ca fe pvdf pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes respectively it was shown that the pca ca metal modified pvdf membranes were successfully prepared the element compositions of different membranes were shown in table 1 compared with the pristine pvdf the atomic percentage of oxygen was enhanced from 3 2 to 5 7 on the pca pvdf membrane surface result from the plentiful phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl of ca 46 of note the atomic percentage of oxygen on the surface of pca ca fe pvdf pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes were obviously increased the phenomenon indicated that the oxidation of catechol group in ca could be further promoted by the reaction between metal ion and ca 43 46 50 it was also found that the atomic percentage of fluorine declined significantly from 41 97 to 25 46 ca fe pvdf 31 05 ca cu pvdf and 27 85 ca ag pvdf possibly due to the coverage of the membrane surface by the newly formed double layer 51 the core level xps spectra of c 1s and o 1s for all modified membranes were shown in fig 4c f and g j respectively in the case of c 1s core level xps spectrum the main peaks of cc cc 284 1 ev co 285 6 ev c o 287 5 ev cf 290 1 ev were detected 52 the co bond was from the former pca coating on the membranes surface 31 the presence of more co moiety with the introduction of fe2 cu2 and ag could further confirm that the oxidation of catechol groups cloud be accelerated by the reaction between metal ion and ca 43 46 50 the o 1s core level xps spectrum of pca pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes could be deconvoluted into two peaks corresponding to co 531 ev and co 532 5 ev while the o 1 s peak of pca ca fe pvdf membrane at 531 1 ev belongs to co and feo 53 55 simultaneously the o 1s core level xps spectrum of pca ca cu pvdf could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 531 1 532 5 and 530 4 ev corresponding to co co cuo respectively 48 56 as can be seen from fig 5a the peaks with the binding energy of 710 9 ev and 724 4 ev corresponded to fe ii 2p3 2 and fe ii 2p1 2 respectively further indicating the presence of fe element in the pca ca fe pvdf membrane 47 meanwhile ag 3d3 2 374 ev and ag 3d5 2 368 ev peaks were emerged on the ag 3d core level spectrum of pca ca ag pvdf membrane obviously fig 5c 44 49 besides ag0 species there was no peak of other chemical states existing in the spectrum 49 further indicating the formation of agnps on the pca ca ag pvdf membrane surface moreover the cu 2p core level spectrum of pca ca cu pvdf membrane could be curve fitted into eight peaks fig 5b the peaks at 933 1 ev and 952 2 ev referred to cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 respectively 48 the peaks at 932 2 ev and 934 1 ev could be ascribed to cu2o and cu oh 2 46 56 the peak at 954 3 ev could be regarded as cuo cu2 48 besides there were peaks around 940 ev and 960 ev which represented cu2 satellite 48 the results of xps analysis further confirmed that the ca metal ions nanoparticles were successfully fabricated on the membrane surface based on the ftir and xps results above the possible chemical structure of the pca ca metal double layer was illustrated in fig 5d in a word the pca coating laid the foundation of hydrophilicity on membrane surface and ca metal networks provided the hierarchical micro and nano structural which were the two indispensable factors for obtaining the shl uwsob membrane with exceptional antifouling ability 3 1 3 wettability oil repellency and self cleaning capability wettability is an essential characteristic of the modified membranes which was comprehensively assessed by measuring the initial wca and uoca kerosene n hexane 1 2 dichloromethane 1 2 dichloroethane as seen in fig 6a b due to the highly hydrophobic nature of the original pvdf membrane 43 the initial wca was 131 94 with negligible change in 10 s with pca coating on the membrane surface the initial wca decreased to 22 5 and the membrane could be completely permeated by a water droplet 5 Î¼l within 15 04 s result from the polar surface generated by pca 32 after further treatment with metal ion the initial wca declined to 14 6 pca ca fe pvdf 20 51 pca ca cu pvdf and 18 3 pca ca ag pvdf respectively all pca ca metal modified membranes could be wetted by a water droplet within 8 21s pca ca fe pvdf 12 61s pca ca cu pvdf and 10 67s pca ca ag pvdf the corresponding dynamic photographs of the wca were shown in fig 6c and videos 1 4 comparing to pca pvdf membrane the better hydrophilicity of pca ca metal modified membranes indicated that the incorporated ca metal networks were favorable to membrane hydrophilicity the improvement of the hydrophilicity might be due to the hydrogen bond hydration of water interacting with ca and iron 57 58 for the pca ca ag pvdf the enhanced hydrophilicity also provided by the hydrophilic agnps 59 in addition according to the wenzel model 4 cosÎ¸ w rcosÎ¸ i wettability is an essential characteristic of the modified membranes which was comprehensively assessed by measuring the initial wca and uoca

surface r the surface roughness factor 60 61 we can clearly find that the roughness of modified membrane surfaces provided by ca metal nanoparticles can magnify the membrane hydrophilicity when Î¸i 90 9 62 furthermore the uoca for four types of oil including kerosene n hexane 1 2 dichloromethane and 1 2 dichloroethane were presented in fig 7a d the pristine membrane exhibited less oleophobicity in water and its uoca towards different oil was about 120 after only coated by pca although the uoca increased about 147 it did not show underwater superoleophobicity uoca 150 and yet due to the ca metal networks and the sharply improved roughness hierarchical micro nano structures which could induce a robust water layer and avoid the applied oil droplets move into the structure grooves 63 64 fig 7e the uoca of pca ca fe pvdf pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes towards different tested oils were 150 especially all the uoca of pca ca fe pvdf membrane was higher than 156 12 and the uoca of pca ca fe pvdf membrane could reach to 160 86 almost spherical shape for the 1 2 dichloromethane indicating underwater superoleophobicity to better understand the oil repellency of the pca ca metal pvdf modified membranes in water environment the dynamically pressing and lifting experiment of the oil droplets on the pca ca fe pvdf pca ca cu pvdf and pca ca ag pvdf membranes surface were conducted an oil droplet 6 Î¼l of kerosene n hexane 1 2 dichloromethane and 1 2 dichloroethane in water was forced to adequately contact the membrane surface under a large force and then the oil

modified membranes the milky white emulsions with an average oil droplet size of 2417 nm fig 11f became transparent and significant differences between the feed and filtrate could also be seen from the optical micrographs in addition the droplet size of the filtrate of pca ca fe pvdf was 10 nm with an average oil droplet size of 6 52 nm 38 01 nm of pca ca cu 27 3 nm of pca ca ag fig s7a c which could intuitively display that almost all kerosene oil droplets were removed by pca ca metal membranes of note the as prepared emulsion could remain stable without demulsification for at least 1 month fig s6 the results above indicated that the oil droplets in the sds kerosene water emulsion could be effectively intercepted by the pca ca metal modified membranes and couldn t enter the filtrate fig 11e showed the emulsion flux and separation efficiency oil rejection of different membranes by comparing with pca pvdf membrane 1829 65 l m2h 98 41 the emulsion flux and separation efficiency of pca ca metal modified membranes increased obviously all higher than 2100 l m2h and 98 8 among them the pca ca fe pvdf membrane demonstrated the highest emulsion flux of 2955 15 which is nearly 1 7 times of the pca pvdf membrane and optimum separation efficiency 99 67 besides the oil content in the filtrate and the feed emulsions were displayed in table s1 the average oil content of the filtrate 13 8 mg l of pca ca fe 49 9 mg l of pca ca cu 36 3 mg l of pca ca ag were obviously lower than that of the pca pvdf membrane 68 2 mg l showing a better performance in oil water separation 3 3 recyclability and antifouling property the superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity of the pca ca metal membranes were believed to endow membranes with remarkable antifouling property and thus ensure desirable performance in cycle separation experiments recyclability the recyclability and antifouling property of the pca ca metal membranes were evaluated by subjecting them to repeated filtration cycles five cycle of the sds kerosene water emulsion in each cycle pure water flux and the emulsion flux of the pca ca fe pvdf membrane could maintain a high level which were all above 5200 l m2 h and 2900 l m2 h respectively fig 12a and no remarkable flux decline could be seen after five cycles the pure water flux of the pca ca fe pvdf membrane could recover 90 of the original level fig 12b while the prepared pca ca cu and pca ca ag membranes demonstrated lower pure water flux 4342 07 l m2 h for pca ca cu 4630 86 l m2 h for pca ca ag emulsion flux 2108 51 l m2 h for pca ca cu 2402 07 l m2 h for pca ca ag and flux recovery 87 80 for pca ca cu 89 38 for pca ca ag after the filtration experiment compared to pca ca fe pvdf membrane both exhibited excellent recyclable oil resistance with stable oil rejection 98 84 for pca ca cu 99 16 for pca ca ag fig s8 a f in contrast after a five cycle filtration test the pca coated membrane showed a relatively high reduction in both pure water flux and emulsion flux indicating the limitation of hydrophilic pca coating in avoiding oil fouling and the pure water flux of the pca pvdf membrane could only recover 76 3 of the original level fig 12a b although the pca pvdf membranes successfully rejected oil with stable oil rejection 98 4 after five cycle filtration test the pca ca metal pvdf membrane still exhibited higher emulsion purification efficiency particularly for pca ca fe pvdf 99 67 fig 12c under transmembrane pressure the pca ca metal modified membranes were covered by the oil fig 13a c the oil layer on the modified membranes surface were rapidly rinsed off by di water fig 13a c which further indicated the modified membranes possessed outstanding antifouling property according to the above results the superhydrophilic coating and hierarchical micro nano structures which were provided by ca metal networks greatly enhanced the antifouling capacity and recyclability of membrane a possible antifouling mechanism for the pca ca metal modified membranes was illustrated in fig 7e in water environment the pca coating former layer which contributed greatly to the hydrophilicity of membrane surface could attract water molecules and a great number of water micropockets could be further trapped in hierarchical micro and nanoscale structures on the pca ca metal modified membranes surface 65 during the emulsion separation process the oil droplets in water environment tended to approach and accumulate on membrane surface under transmembrane pressure 66 the water layer and water micropockets could avoid the further contact between the immiscible oil droplets and inner membranes surface thus the pca ca metal modified membranes displayed super low adhesion for oil droplets in water and the oil droplets could be easily rinsed off by water flow 3 4 stability the stability of the pca ca metal modified membranes was examined by a rinsing test for different time 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h 10 h during the process of rinsing test fig 14a c the initial wca values fluctuate around the 14 pca ca fe pvdf 20 pca ca cu pvdf and 18 pca ca ag pvdf as well as the uoca 1 2 dichloroethane values were around 158 pca ca fe pvdf 151 pca ca cu pvdf and 154 pca ca ag pvdf negligible decrease in both the initial wca and uoca of the pca ca metal modified membranes was observed after pure water rinsing test the sds kerosene water emulsion rinsing test of the pca ca metal modified membranes was illustrated in fig 14d f in spite a slight increase the membranes remained satisfactory hydrophilicity with initial wca around 16 67 pca ca fe pvdf 23 24 pca ca cu pvdf and 20 58 pca ca ag pvdf and there was a slight drop in the uoca whereas the uoca of the pca ca metal modified membrane were higher than 149 after treatment for 10 h particularly the uoca remained as high as 156 99 in the case of the pca ca fe pvdf membrane fig 14g i displayed the well reserved hierarchical micro and nanostructure provided by ca fe ca cu and ca ag networks after long time rinsing tests which manifesting that the pca ca metal modified membranes possessed superior stability even after vigorous rinsing test 3 5 mechanical property the mechanical property of the pca ca metal modified membranes was systematically evaluated by a fifth cyclic abrasion test and the results were displayed in fig 15a c the initial wca data collected after each five abrasion tests revealed a slight increase in the wca from 14 6 to 16 43 pca ca fe pvdf 20 51 to 23 29 pca ca cu pvdf and 18 3 to 20 45 the uoca of the pca ca metal modified membranes remained stable after fifth abrasion cycles these results verified that the pca ca metal ion nanoparticles coating on membrane surface were firm enough to resist physical damage 4 conclusion a superwettable coating with double layer as well as hierarchical micro and nanostructure was successfully constructed on the membrane surface via pca ca metal ion nanoparticles derived strategy pca coating layer and ca metal networks provided the crucial hydrophilic basis and hierarchical structures respectively the special double layer on membrane surface significantly enhanced the surface roughness of membranes thus greatly increasing the repelling capability to various oils kerosene n hexane 1 2 dichloromethane and 1 2 dichloroethane and self cleaning ability as compared with pca coated membrane the emulsion separation efficiency and membrane flux of the as fabricated pca ca metal modified membranes were greatly enhanced in addition the pca ca metal modified membranes exhibited outstanding stability recyclability and mechanical property this study offered a pave way to endow various materials with superwettability and antifouling property for multiple applications

12781,in recent years there has been significant interest in yeast based wastewater treatment due to its high pollutant removal rate and ability to perform in non sterile environments in this work a kinetic model was developed to predict yeast growth and substrate consumption during wastewater treatment to determine the biological constants for use in the kinetic models a unique approach is presented candida utilis was cultivated in synthetic wastewater using eight different ratios of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus to determine its growth rate and the removal rates of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus the concentrations of c n and p were chosen within the range of secondary effluent wastewater in all experiments carbon was found to be the limiting substrate and 100 toc removal was achieved in all cases candida utilis reduced the cod concentration by up to 99 in 24 h in the model both yeast growth and substrate consumption were satisfactorily described by monod kinetics the apparent half saturation coefficients for carbon nitrogen and phosphorus determined via the optimization of the model were found to the function of initial substrate concentration the maximum specific growth rate found was 0 59 h 1 this model was used on different initial concentrations of substrates and predicted data with an r2 above 80 both model and experimental results suggest that candida utilis can be used in the tertiary treatment of wastewater the simple approach described here can be applied to find biological coefficients for other microorganisms keywords monod kinetic modelling

essential need for sustainable and reasonable water reclamation processes which should have a minimal environmental impact including reduced energy requirement and reduced associated greenhouse gas emissions that produce positive externalities such as protein and lipid production 1 currently the most widely and conventionally used wastewater treatment biological process activated sludge process trickle bed filters etc effectively reduce organic carbon however nutrients n and p removal efficiencies are not satisfactory high concentrations of nitrogen in the forms nh 4 n and no 3 n and phosphorus in the forms of po 4 3 p lead to microalgal blooms that cause eutrophication in such eutrophications microalgae blooms cover fresh water bodies surface and prevent oxygen transfer and cut out sunlight causing anaerobic bottom environments resulting in turbidity increases increased odour and death of desirable flora and fauna 2 4 therefore many changes have been suggested in the secondary biological treatment to remove nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus 5 also many tertiary treatment technologies have been introduced for higher nutrient removal efficiencies and to meet the effluent standards for safe disposal 6 8 these tertiary treatments are generally biological or chemical and incur significant extra operational costs 9 11 in tertiary wastewater treatment yeast can be an effective microorganism although yeast has been used on industrial wastewater with high oil content high salinity ammonia organic compounds and carbohydrates 12 its application for tertiary treatment has not yet been fully explored yeast is a unicellular organism mainly consisting of carbon hydrogen nitrogen and phosphorus yeast has approximately 3 5 phosphorus and 10 nitrogen content 13 whereas seawater algae typically contain 0 87 phosphorus and 6 nitrogen content 14 the higher level of nitrogen and phosphorus suggests that yeasts can more effectively remove these pollutants from wastewater although yeast cannot fix molecular nitrogen it can consume inorganic nitrogen in the form of ammonium salts 13 15 carbon is a primary substrate for yeast growth therefore yeast can also effectively reduce carbon concentration in lab scale studies yeast has been used to treat numerous wastes chinese cabbage waste 16 pineapple cannery waste 17 silage effluent 18 waste capsicum powder 19 and bamboo wastes 20 yeast growth at low nutrient concentrations has not been fully explored although it has been reported that yeast can grow in low carbon environments there is no information on their use for low strength pollutant removal yeast can potentially be used for tertiary wastewater treatment to use yeast efficiently in tertiary wastewater treatment it is important to have a robust kinetic model that can be used for the prediction of nutrient removal biomass productivity and optimisation of operating conditions an understanding of microbial kinetics is an obvious prerequisite for this purpose microbial kinetic expression correlates specific growth rate and substrate concentration these kinetic models are mathematical expressions that originated to define the kinetics and therefore operation of biological systems microbiological processes and activities can be defined by the kinetic equations which describe the microorganisms growth and metabolism with respect to substrate concentration hence they could mathematically predict the growth by recognizing the growth parameters governing microbial growth 22 monod in 1929 presented an empirical kinetic model in the form of eq 1 23 which shows the relation of a limiting substrate concentration to the growth rate of microorganism the monod model is only applicable when pseudo steady state inside the cells is achieved therefore it is not valid in the lag phase 24 1 Î¼ Î¼ max s k s s here Î¼ is the monod specific growth rate and s is the substrate concentration Î¼max is the maximum growth rate and is different for every microorganism ks is the half saturation coefficient in monod kinetics biological constants such as half saturation constants are required the half saturation constant is the substrate concentration at which half of the maximum rate occurs 25 note that the growth and substrate utilization are also dependent on operating conditions such as temperature initial ph etc but the monod model does not include any such terms so it should be considered as a simplified isothermal model for microorganism growth to find the rate of biomass production and substrate consumption the equation can also be written as 2 dx dt Î¼ max s k s s x 3 ds dt 1 y s x Î¼ max s k s s x here x is the biomass concentration in mg l 1 s is substrate concentration in mg l 1 and ys x is the yield of biomass per unit substrate consumed mg biomass mg substrate 26 in batch culture the monod constant can be determined by measuring the initial growth rates at the different initial concentrations of substrate the eq 1 can be simply linearized using lineweaver burk plots to find the Î¼max and ks 4 1 Î¼ k s Î¼ max s 1 Î¼ max the monod single substrate model has also been applied to mixed homologous substrates e g two different carbon substrates according to existing research microbes can be governed by two or more limiting substrates 27 although the monod equation was initially restricted to one limiting substrate carbon several multi substrate models have been developed based on monod for the degradation of multi source carbon 28 29 the growth of microorganisms on heterologous substrates has also been studied substrates having distinct functions such as carbon and nitrogen mixtures 30 31 nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are equally significant and play a vital role in the growth of microorganisms 32 in these models it is assumed that growth is affected simultaneously by more than one substrate the monod model can be extended to describe the dual limited growth model 30 31 5 Î¼ Î¼ max s 1 k 1 s 1 s 2 k 2 s 2 here s1 and s2 are two different substrates though this model s scope of functionality was not fully tested this monod based model does not consider any additional

functionality few models have been developed for the kinetic behaviour of candida utilis during aerobic growth butyric acid was used as a carbon source and ammonium sulphate as an ammonium nitrogen source 34 at a high concentration of butyric acid an inhibitory effect was observed whereas at low concentrations growth was stimulated on the other hand free ammonia showed an inhibitory effect when ph was 8 0 34 it is also reported that the specific growth rate of candida utilis is dependent on ph 34 six models were also developed based on glucose and or dissolved oxygen limitation for continuous culture for candida utilis 35 however a kinetic model for wastewater treatment that considers three major nutrients such as carbon nitrogen and phosphorus is not available in the literature a new model named silva and cerqueira model has been developed for microalgae 8 Î¼ Î¼ max s m k s app m s m here ks app is apparent half saturation constant and m is the silva and cerqueira model order this model incorporated three major macronutrients carbon nitrogen and phosphorus while adding the m order and apparent half saturation constant to the monod equation where ks app ks p p is the fitting constant interestingly this approached increased the accuracy of the model 32 there is still a gap in the literature regarding the kinetic modelling of microorganisms this gap is based on the varying concentration of multiple substrates such as carbon nitrogen and phosphorus after optimization detailed in the section 3 4 a new model which was based on monod kinetic was proposed in this paper 9 Î¼ Î¼ max s s ks app here s is the substrate concentration Î¼max is maximum specific growth rate h 1 and k s app is the apparent half saturation coefficient which is the function of initial

effluent these kinetics will provide useful information for designing the reactors for secondary and tertiary treatment using yeast this study aims to develop the double monod kinetic model that describes both the growth of candida utilis and nutrient removal carbon nitrogen and phosphorus simultaneously in secondary treated effluents candida utilis is selected as it has been preciously used for the kinetic modelling as well as wastewater treatment 34 36 to develop this kinetic model candida utilis was cultivated in synthetic wastewater to determine the yeast growth and nutrient carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal rate experimentally and to determine the half saturation constant for the monod equation once the kinetic parameters were determined a simple kinetic model was presented to describe the growth of yeast and pollutant consumption in wastewater treatment at three different ph 2 methodology 2 1 synthetic wastewater wastewater at different c n p ratios was synthesized by dissolving the following chemicals in distilled water c6h12o6 125 563 mg l 1 nh4cl 31 138 mg l 1 kh2po4 9 24 mg l 1 cacl2 84 mg l 1 mgso4 7h2o 1000 mg l 1 and 0 5 ml of trace element

ph of the synthetic wastewater was adjusted to 6 5 5 5 and 4 0 using naoh 0 1 m or hcl 0 1 m these ph values are selected because yeast prefer acidic or slightly acidic ph condition these are the typical ph values for wastewater treatment by yeast all the chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich uk 2 2 the candida utilis preservation and reactor inoculum preparation a pure culture of candida utilis was purchased from public health england it was grown in yeast extract peptone dextrose ypd broth formedium uk which was prepared by dissolving 50 g of ypd in 1 l of distilled water using a magnetic stirrer the solution was autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min and cooled in the sterile chamber candida utilis inoculated in broth solution was placed in an incubator ika ks 4000 i control at 30 c and 120 rpm for 14 h after reaching the log phase the grown culture was centrifuged eppendorf centrifuge 5810 at 3500 rpm 10 min in 50 ml falcon tubes the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 0 9 saline water to wash the biomass the suspension was centrifuged again this washing step was repeated 3 times 2 3 experimental plan to investigate the growth kinetics of candida utilis and nutrient removal efficiencies eight batch reactors 1 l with a working volume of 0 8 l were established at 6 5 ph the ratio of c n p was kept constant in all reactors at 6 25 1 00 0 314 representing optimum c n ratio for yeast growth and excess phosphorus 39 the concentrations of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus were varied to mimic the secondary treated effluent concentration available in the literature with slight variations 40 41 the concentration of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in all reactors is given in table 1 after achieving the concentrations of n and p all eight reactors were autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min and cooled down to room temperature in the uv sterile chamber the reactors were placed in sterilization chambers under uv light overnight in each reactor 1 ml of the washed candida utilis suspension in saline solution was used as an inoculum so that the final concentration of each reactor became 10 mg l 1 reactors had a volume of 800 ml they were kept in the incubator ika ks 4000i control uk at 30 c with constant shaking at 120 rpm for 30 h to measure biomass growth and remaining nutrients in the reactor samples 15 ml were taken from the reactors for the first hours until a stationary phase was reached and the limiting substrate completely utilized later experiments were conducted at initial ph of 5 5 and 4 according to the same procedure to verify the kinetic model obtained from the two set of experiments and evaluate the effect of ph on the constant of kinetic models experiments were conducted in duplicates 2 4 analytical methods yeast growth was measured via dry weight and optical density techniques in dry weight nuclepore polycarbonate 0 22 Î¼m porous size were used the optical density at 600 nm od600 was measured using a uv visible spectrophotometer 7305 jenway staffordshire uk for ammonia nitrogen nh3 n orthophosphate po4 3 and glucose samples were filtered through fisherbrand nylon syringe filter 0 2 Î¼m nh3 n was measured by the nessler method 8038 42 phosphorus was measured using an amino acid method 8178 43 glucose was measured in the form of total organic carbon toc by vario toc elemental analyser 44 dissolved oxygen do was measured using an atlas scientific lab grade do meter env 40 dox us with a range from 0 to 100 mg l 1 and accuracy 0 05 mg l 1 ph env 40 ph us was measured using an atlas scientific lab grade ph probe with 0 002 accuracy vfa was measured by thermos fisher aquino uk the column used was ice asi 4 250 mm and the suppressor was acrs ice 500 4 mm a volume of 1 mm heptafluorobutyric acid was used as eluent the column temperature was 30oc with a flow rate of 0 16 ml min 2 5 determining the estimated chemical composition of yeast the chemical composition of yeast depends upon several environmental factors such as substrate concentration salt concentration and degree of aeration however the substrate concentration is the most significant in most cases substrate concentration is the rate limiting step the estimated typical molecular formula for budding yeast biomass is ch1 613o0 557n0 158p0 012 45 yeast also contains sulphur magnesium potassium and calcium however their concentrations are much lower than carbon nitrogen and phosphorus therefore for simplicity we omitted these in our consideration based on their molecular formula for 1 mol of carbon there are 1 613 mol of hydrogen 0 557 mol of oxygen 0 158 mol of nitrogen and 0 012 mol of phosphorus it is difficult to experimentally estimate the carbon balance for the yeast growth as carbon rapidly converted to co2 which is undetected in our case co2 production was estimated based on carbon consumption in the wastewater and carbon found in the yeast cell phosphorus consumption was low therefore nitrogen consumption was selected to determine the carbon ratio 2 6 kinetic model for wastewater treatment the kinetic model investigation had the following assumptions 1 no change in temperature 2 zero evaporation 3 oxygen was consumed from the environment 4 dissolved oxygen was consumed from culturing medium and no mass transfer limitation and 5 inhibition effect of multi substrates is neglected data for the designed model was obtained from batch cultivations in 1 l reactor volumes at 30 c and 120 rpm and for the concentration of secondary effluent wastewater in this

and yp are the removal coefficient for carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in mg mg yeast 1 there are different multiple kinetic models based on monod kinetic in the literature 46 47 however only few of them have incorporated all three major nutrients such as carbon nitrogen and phosphorous some models used monod kinetic to define the growth only and used different equations such as luedeking piret to determine the consumption of substrates 48 other models described substrate consumption with the order reaction constant 49 which shows that the growth and the substrate consumption have not been interrelated in this model both growth and substrate consumption are described in conjunction using the monod kinetics hence interlinked with each other 3 results and discussions 3 1 growth and substrate utilization rates of candida utilis the candida utilis growth reached a stationary phase within 8 12 h at lower substrate concentrations 50 100 mg l 1 whereas it took 12 15 h to reach the stationary phase at the higher concentrations of substrate 125 225 mg l 1 fig 1 higher concentrations of substrates led to higher biomass concentrations candida utilis rapidly reduced carbon achieving complete reduction in 24 h fig 1b in all experiments the reactors with carbon content in the range 50 100 mg l 1 achieved 100 removal rate within 8 12 h the reactors with carbon in the range 125 175 mg l 1 achieved 100 removal rates within 22 h in addition when the carbon was consumed completely the growth of the candida utilis stopped and a stationary phase was reached generally higher inoculum concentrations of yeast avoid contamination and suppress the growth of unwanted microorganisms 50 different concentrations of yeast inoculum have been mentioned in the literature ranging from single cell colonies to 15 g l 1 for instance the removal of carbon and nitrogen from wastewater 75 ml 5 v v 1 inoculum of precultures were used as an inoculum in 1 5 l of culturing medium 34 the concentration of inoculum is selected based on the cultivation stage for instance growing the first culture in liquid media 100 ml required a single cell from agar plates whereas for volumes higher than 100 ml required larger inoculum concentrations inoculum concentration will have a significant effect on biomass production 51 results fig 1 showed that a low concentration of yeast inoculum of 14 mg is sufficient in 800 ml for 100 cod removal and 52 68 removal of nitrogen and 33 61 of phosphorus within 30 h from sterile synthetic wastewater the highest specific growth rates of 0 30 0 314 h 1 were achieved in the higher substrate concentration reactors c 150 225 mg l 1 n 24 36 mg l 1 and p 7 6 9 77 mg l 1 at low concentrations of substrate c 50 125 mg l 1 n 8 20 mg l 1 and p 3 44 5 6 mg l 1 the specific growth rate was found to be 0 23 0 28 h 1 0 28 h 1 during the early stages of treatment nitrogen removal rates were low fig 1 c shows that nitrogen removal rates increased between 8 and 12 h but dropped to zero at 12 h this is because during this duration the rate of consumption of carbon was high which supports the consumption of nitrogen c utilis consumed phosphorus at a lower rate than carbon and nitrogen thus the initial phosphorus concentration in the culturing medium was lower additionally as shown in fig 1 d consumption of phosphorus stopped after 16 h this clearly shows that when the limiting substrate carbon was consumed completely the consumption of nitrogen and phosphorus were stopped as well the overall removal efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus were between 53 69 and 34 61 depending upon the initial concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus the substrate consumption per mg of yeast for carbon nitrogen and phosphorus were 0 8 0 92 0 08 0 09 and 0 01 0 03 mg of substrate per mg of yeast as shown in fig 2 the c n and p n ratios used in the experiments are 6 25 and 0 317 0 05 and carbon was found to be a limiting substrate 3 2 changes in the ph and dissolved oxygen parameters that can be externally controlled such as aeration ph temperature co2 or light intensity and duration on microalgae can be considered external substrates 52 they are equally significant not only for growth but for substrate utilization in the first 4 h yeast continuously decreases the ph of the culturing medium to acidic the decrease in ph stopped when ph reached between3 5 3 0 as shown in fig 3 since the time interval for the sampling was 4 h leg phase duration was not detected yeast reduced the culturing medium ph during the first hours of cultivation which indicates that culturing media at neutral conditions would not affect yeast growth as it can quickly reduce the ph to acidic level it was also noted that the ph drop was lower at lower concentrations of substrate and higher in the high concentration of substrates there could be several factors that lead to the decrease in ph one of them is that yeast nutrient consumption leads to production of organic acids that decrease ph studies reveal no simple relationship between dissolved oxygen oxygen uptake co2 output growth rate and organic acid production 53 the presence of small concentration of acetic acid and propionic acid were detected during vfa analysis another reason could be the lack of aeration causing yeast to accumulate co2 from dissolved oxygen consumption when the concentration of dissolved co2 reaches between 0 042 and 0 130 m the partial yeast respiration changes to anaerobic which leads to volatile organic acids 38 finally yeast also produces h when consuming ammonium 54 in all these experiments ammonia was used as a nitrogen source and a significant amount of nitrogen was consumed by yeast producing h ions causing the decrease in ph for all experiments the do concentration drastically dropped from 6 25 mg l 1 and once the yeast achieved the stationary phases the concentration of do started to recover as shown in fig 3 this could be because the decrease in the requirement of do consumption by yeast and the agitation from the incubator supported the oxygen intake it has also been shown that a fraction of oxygen is used for the maintenance of other physiological functions which are not exactly associated with growth 35 55 the term energy for maintenance was proposed for the energy that is necessary to maintain the cellular motility turnover of cellular material concentration and ph gradients 56 in the aerobic process the intake of carbon is highest when the do concentration in the surroundings of the cell is sufficient to eliminate the possibility of oxygen limitation therefore knowing the concentration of dissolved oxygen is necessary 36 for biological wastewater treatment achieving a satisfactory amount of do concentration in the culturing medium is always difficult to reduce the energy requirement do is often kept at a low level 1 mg l 1 52 3 3 chemical composition and co2 production the estimated molecular formula of c utilis found in this research is c 3 8 5 h 4 9 13 85 o 1 6 4 8 p 0 03 0 23 increase in the initial carbon concentration increased the biomass and the mole of co2 production a linear relation was found between the biomass and moles of co2 produced r2 0 9773 as shown in fig 4 the co2 production has previously been measured during the growth of c utilis which exhibited the lag exponential and stationary phases similar to the growth phases 57 3 4 optimisation this kinetic investigation required several sets of experimental data hence an experimental design was developed consisting of 16 sets of experiments an optimisation technique using solver was used to adjust the parameters only so that the model results were consistent with experimental data only two data set 75 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 of carbon concentration were used for the optimization numerical euler methods were performed in excel the model was optimized using a solver by reducing the least square error of experimental data and model data the monod half saturation coefficient can change with the nature of the growth medium which includes the concentration of substrates and trace metals ph and temperature of the medium and duration of exposure 58 the half saturation coefficients were observed to be influenced by the overall process rate suggesting that a single value for this parameter is not appropriate 59 several relations of half saturation coefficient have been suggested it is suggested that ks depends upon the microbial growth rate 60 when nitrate is being used as a substrate kno3 is a function of denitrification rate 61 in batch culture of c utilis half saturation values slightly changes from 29 Î¼m to 33 Î¼m when thiamine was introduced in the culture medium 58 half saturation is also influenced by the actual availability of substrate at the cell surface 62 therefore different terminologies were used such as half saturation index or affinity coefficient to describe ks 63 the half saturation parameters for denitrification systems are routinely adjusted to better mimic the final effluent concentrations rather than being independently calculated and are therefore unverifiable 59 the presented model parameters were adjusted through optimisation in a way that it could cover a wide range of initial concentrations of substrates this is only possible if the apparent saturation coefficient becomes a function of initial substrate concentration this approach was also presented in a previous study 36 one of the benefits of optimisation is that the optimized parameter also incorporated the effect of other hidden factors such as other nutrient consumption micronutrients such as trace metals change in ph during treatment oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production for the prediction of growth and substrate utilization once the biological coefficient was determined the model was compared with all experimental data included additional 8 set of experiment which was conducted at different ph the optimized kinetic parameters are given in table 2 3 5 kinetic modelling optimisation of kinetic modelling demonstrated that the apparent half saturation coefficients of substrate using c utilis for wastewater treatment varied with initial substrate concentration rather than being constants if the initial ph was between 4 0 and 6 5 it has been reported in previous study that the ratio of initial substrate concentration to initial biomass concentration influencing the identifiability of kinetic parameters 64 in presented model the initial biomass concentration was kept constant however the initial substrate concentrations were varied through kinetic modelling the apparent half saturation coefficient of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus were found to be the function of initial substrate concentration the apparent half saturation coefficients for carbon nitrogen and phosphorus found through modelling were k c app c 0 n k n app n 0 n and k p app p 0 n therefore the model is represented via eqs 15 to 18 15 d yeast i dt Î¼ max yeast i c 0 c 0 c 0 n n 0 n 0 n 0 n p 0 p 0 p 0 n 16 dc dt y c Î¼ max yeast i c 0 c 0 c 0 n n 0 n 0 n 0 n p 0 p 0 p 0 n 17 dn

mg substrates mg yeast 1 the half saturation coefficient of carbon found in another study were kc 0 3co 36 though this result were extracted when only carbon was considered as substrate however in this study three major substrates carbon nitrogen and phosphorus were considered the effect on initial substrate concentration on half saturation value presented in other studies as well 21 65 this dependence of the half saturation coefficient of nitrogen and phosphorus on their initial concentrations has not been presented before several different correlations of half saturation have been described one of the reasons for the variation is that the half saturation coefficients significantly depend on the system considered so have to be determined on a case to case basis 63 it has previously been reported that the correlation and standard deviation of monod parameters were functions of initial substrate concentration and cell concentration 66 it was also suggested that low and high concentrations of glucose could exhibit different saturation coefficients 65 half saturation coefficients have also been shown to be dependent on microbial growth rate these findings show that they are not true constants 60 half saturation coefficient of a particular substrate could also be dependent on the removal rate of that substrate for example samples were collected from wastewater treatment plant and additional nutrients were added to find the half saturation coefficient of nitrate which had been found to be a function of the denitrification rate 61 it has also been suggested that half saturation is strongly influenced by substrate diffusion into the cell 67 these biological coefficients are a basis not only for predicting biomass growth and substrate consumption but can also be used to simulate the time course of the other relevant parameters involved in the system in practice the initial substrate concentration of waste in a secondary effluent would depend on the prior treatment processes conducted the monod equation has been widely used to describe microbial growth of microorganisms including c utilis however most of the studies have focused on one or two substrates and a constant value of half saturation constant which are only valid for a limited range of substrate concentrations several half saturation constants for carbon have been calculated when only carbon was considered as a substrate in the medium c utilis was grown in a simple black box model based on introducing substrate microorganisms and their products and observing the growth output over time but this model only considered carbon as substrate 36 3 6 model validation when a wastewater treatment plant is designed to achieve low effluent concentrations half saturation coefficients need to be considered carefully since they have a strong influence on the growth of microorganisms 59 wastewater is a complex medium in which multiple substrate and complex compounds are present therefore it is difficult to apply multi substrate monod kinetic to predict biomass growth and substrate utilization here the proposed model containing multiple substrate dependencies is compared with the experimental data because of the error minimization approach used in this research the half saturation coefficient and maximum specific growth rate are applicable over a range of data to predict the biomass concentration and substrate consumption the only coefficient derived from experimental data was the yield coefficient the model successfully predicted the growth rate and substrate utilization as shown in figs 5 8 the maximum specific growth rate found in this study is similar to the one found previously 0 59 h 1 21 previously it was found that there is a negligible effect of ph on maximum specific growth between ph 6 0 to 4 0 58 similarly kinetic modelling shows that ph has no effect on the maximum specific growth rate this implies that the only coefficient in the monod model that varies with ph is the yield coefficient therefore the yield coefficient has a significant impact on the prediction of biomass growth and substrate utilization it was observed that the initial concentration of substrate does not affect the maximum specific growth in the kinetic model the only critical parameter which is often neglected during kinetic modelling is substrate removal coefficient it was previously assumed that the yield factor the reciprocal of substrate removal was constant and independent of the growth rate however recent studies found that the yield varies with the specific growth rate substrate uptake rate and oxygen consumption 68 based on our experiments the yield coefficient varied significantly only when the initial ph of the wastewater was altered these experimental values of substrate removal coefficient strongly support the model data for the prediction of substrate utilization and biomass growth it can be concluded that the substrate removal coefficient is an important parameter for the prediction of biomass growth and substrate utilization which usually does not get attention in the monod model 3 7 comparison of specific growth rate the specific growth rate calculated from the model eq 10 was compared to the experimental data and the model data it is found that the with the specific growth rate extracted from the model data and experimental data is quite similar whereas the specific growth rate determined from the specific growth rate equation is much higher as shown in fig 9 this implies that the amount of yeast concentration present in the system during treatment has an influence on the specific growth rate it is previously suggested that the biomass concentration has an impact on specific growth rate therefore it affects the overall rate of reaction 69 3 8 sensitivity analysis to determine at which condition the model reflects substrate limitation sensitivity analysis on the multi substrate model were performed via changing the initial substrate concentration of carbon and nitrogen in the model carbon was shown to be the limiting substrate when the c n ratio was below 10 0 and nitrogen the limiting substrate when the c n ratio was above 10 7 at initial ph of 4 0 6 5 and reactor was shaken at 120 rm similar results were observed previously in a batch reactor study which used bacteria carbon was the limiting substrate when c n 7 1 whilst nitrogen was the limiting substrate when c n 12 6 70 4 conclusions to the author s current knowledge this manuscript is the first to incorporate three substrates in the monod model for candida utilis wastewater treatment and to investigate the relationship between their half saturation coefficient and the initial substrate concentration c utilis was cultivated in synthetic wastewater medium at eight different combinations of concentrations of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus to determine the yeast growth and pollutant carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates experimentally in all experiments carbon was found to be the limiting substrate and 100 toc removal was achieved in all cases the maximum specific growth rate 0 59 h 1 agreed well with previous findings a kinetic model based on all substrates carbon phosphorus and nitrogen was developed to predict the yeast growth and substrate consumption it was found that the apparent half saturation coefficients were not constant but instead were better expressed as functions of the initial concentrations of the respective substrates hence the apparent half saturation coefficient for carbon nitrogen and phosphorus found through modelling were k c app c 0 n k n app n 0 n and k p app p 0 n the half saturation coefficients and maximum specific growth rates found in this study incorporated the effect of other nutrients and external factors with the aim of better predicting the growth and substrate uptake the biological constants derived here are valid when the initial ph is in the range 4 0 6 5 at an operating temperature of 30 c the half saturation coefficient relationship to initial concentration and maximum specific growth rate remained constant under the tested condition substrate removal coefficient is an important parameter that is often overlooked in the monod model this research showed for instance that it can change with varying ph the improved model developed here should be helpful in predicting yeast growth and pollutant removal to help design and operate tertiary wastewater treatment systems using yeast further investigations are required to increase the functional range of the kinetic model for multiple substrates to improve the model accuracy for real wastewater treatment it can be further optimized with real wastewater treatment data which could provide more accuracy according to real system this approach should also be applicable for determining biological coefficient in other microorganism systems although the yeast based treatment technology appears promising it is still a long way off before its practical application can be realised as several critical issues need to be addressed prior to its real application such as cultivating yeast in an open environment harvesting yeast for the production of high quality water and scalability this model should continue its development so it can be further refined to be able to

12781,in recent years there has been significant interest in yeast based wastewater treatment due to its high pollutant removal rate and ability to perform in non sterile environments in this work a kinetic model was developed to predict yeast growth and substrate consumption during wastewater treatment to determine the biological constants for use in the kinetic models a unique approach is presented candida utilis was cultivated in synthetic wastewater using eight different ratios of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus to determine its growth rate and the removal rates of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus the concentrations of c n and p were chosen within the range of secondary effluent wastewater in all experiments carbon was found to be the limiting substrate and 100 toc removal was achieved in all cases candida utilis reduced the cod concentration by up to 99 in 24 h in the model both yeast growth and substrate consumption were satisfactorily described by monod kinetics the apparent half saturation coefficients for carbon nitrogen and phosphorus determined via the optimization of the model were found to the function of initial substrate concentration the maximum specific growth rate found was 0 59 h 1 this model was used on different initial concentrations of substrates and predicted data with an r2 above 80 both model and experimental results suggest that candida utilis can be used in the tertiary treatment of wastewater the simple approach described here can be applied to find biological coefficients for other microorganisms keywords monod kinetic modelling

essential need for sustainable and reasonable water reclamation processes which should have a minimal environmental impact including reduced energy requirement and reduced associated greenhouse gas emissions that produce positive externalities such as protein and lipid production 1 currently the most widely and conventionally used wastewater treatment biological process activated sludge process trickle bed filters etc effectively reduce organic carbon however nutrients n and p removal efficiencies are not satisfactory high concentrations of nitrogen in the forms nh 4 n and no 3 n and phosphorus in the forms of po 4 3 p lead to microalgal blooms that cause eutrophication in such eutrophications microalgae blooms cover fresh water bodies surface and prevent oxygen transfer and cut out sunlight causing anaerobic bottom environments resulting in turbidity increases increased odour and death of desirable flora and fauna 2 4 therefore many changes have been suggested in the secondary biological treatment to remove nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus 5 also many tertiary treatment technologies have been introduced for higher nutrient removal efficiencies and to meet the effluent standards for safe disposal 6 8 these tertiary treatments are generally biological or chemical and incur significant extra operational costs 9 11 in tertiary wastewater treatment yeast can be an effective microorganism although yeast has been used on industrial wastewater with high oil content high salinity ammonia organic compounds and carbohydrates 12 its application for tertiary treatment has not yet been fully explored yeast is a unicellular organism mainly consisting of carbon hydrogen nitrogen and phosphorus yeast has approximately 3 5 phosphorus and 10 nitrogen content 13 whereas seawater algae typically contain 0 87 phosphorus and 6 nitrogen content 14 the higher level of nitrogen and phosphorus suggests that yeasts can more effectively remove these pollutants from wastewater although yeast cannot fix molecular nitrogen it can consume inorganic nitrogen in the form of ammonium salts 13 15 carbon is a primary substrate for yeast growth therefore yeast can also effectively reduce carbon concentration in lab scale studies yeast has been used to treat numerous wastes chinese cabbage waste 16 pineapple cannery waste 17 silage effluent 18 waste capsicum powder 19 and bamboo wastes 20 yeast growth at low nutrient concentrations has not been fully explored although it has been reported that yeast can grow in low carbon environments there is no information on their use for low strength pollutant removal yeast can potentially be used for tertiary wastewater treatment to use yeast efficiently in tertiary wastewater treatment it is important to have a robust kinetic model that can be used for the prediction of nutrient removal biomass productivity and optimisation of operating conditions an understanding of microbial kinetics is an obvious prerequisite for this purpose microbial kinetic expression correlates specific growth rate and substrate concentration these kinetic models are mathematical expressions that originated to define the kinetics and therefore operation of biological systems microbiological processes and activities can be defined by the kinetic equations which describe the microorganisms growth and metabolism with respect to substrate concentration hence they could mathematically predict the growth by recognizing the growth parameters governing microbial growth 22 monod in 1929 presented an empirical kinetic model in the form of eq 1 23 which shows the relation of a limiting substrate concentration to the growth rate of microorganism the monod model is only applicable when pseudo steady state inside the cells is achieved therefore it is not valid in the lag phase 24 1 Î¼ Î¼ max s k s s here Î¼ is the monod specific growth rate and s is the substrate concentration Î¼max is the maximum growth rate and is different for every microorganism ks is the half saturation coefficient in monod kinetics biological constants such as half saturation constants are required the half saturation constant is the substrate concentration at which half of the maximum rate occurs 25 note that the growth and substrate utilization are also dependent on operating conditions such as temperature initial ph etc but the monod model does not include any such terms so it should be considered as a simplified isothermal model for microorganism growth to find the rate of biomass production and substrate consumption the equation can also be written as 2 dx dt Î¼ max s k s s x 3 ds dt 1 y s x Î¼ max s k s s x here x is the biomass concentration in mg l 1 s is substrate concentration in mg l 1 and ys x is the yield of biomass per unit substrate consumed mg biomass mg substrate 26 in batch culture the monod constant can be determined by measuring the initial growth rates at the different initial concentrations of substrate the eq 1 can be simply linearized using lineweaver burk plots to find the Î¼max and ks 4 1 Î¼ k s Î¼ max s 1 Î¼ max the monod single substrate model has also been applied to mixed homologous substrates e g two different carbon substrates according to existing research microbes can be governed by two or more limiting substrates 27 although the monod equation was initially restricted to one limiting substrate carbon several multi substrate models have been developed based on monod for the degradation of multi source carbon 28 29 the growth of microorganisms on heterologous substrates has also been studied substrates having distinct functions such as carbon and nitrogen mixtures 30 31 nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are equally significant and play a vital role in the growth of microorganisms 32 in these models it is assumed that growth is affected simultaneously by more than one substrate the monod model can be extended to describe the dual limited growth model 30 31 5 Î¼ Î¼ max s 1 k 1 s 1 s 2 k 2 s 2 here s1 and s2 are two different substrates though this model s scope of functionality was not fully tested this monod based model does not consider any additional

functionality few models have been developed for the kinetic behaviour of candida utilis during aerobic growth butyric acid was used as a carbon source and ammonium sulphate as an ammonium nitrogen source 34 at a high concentration of butyric acid an inhibitory effect was observed whereas at low concentrations growth was stimulated on the other hand free ammonia showed an inhibitory effect when ph was 8 0 34 it is also reported that the specific growth rate of candida utilis is dependent on ph 34 six models were also developed based on glucose and or dissolved oxygen limitation for continuous culture for candida utilis 35 however a kinetic model for wastewater treatment that considers three major nutrients such as carbon nitrogen and phosphorus is not available in the literature a new model named silva and cerqueira model has been developed for microalgae 8 Î¼ Î¼ max s m k s app m s m here ks app is apparent half saturation constant and m is the silva and cerqueira model order this model incorporated three major macronutrients carbon nitrogen and phosphorus while adding the m order and apparent half saturation constant to the monod equation where ks app ks p p is the

varying concentration of multiple substrates such as carbon nitrogen and phosphorus after optimization detailed in the section 3 4 a new model which was based on monod kinetic was proposed in this paper 9 Î¼ Î¼ max s s ks app here s is the substrate concentration Î¼max is maximum specific growth rate h 1 and k s app is the apparent half saturation coefficient which is the function of initial

effluent these kinetics will provide useful information for designing the reactors for secondary and tertiary treatment using yeast this study aims to develop the double monod kinetic model that describes both the growth of candida utilis and nutrient removal carbon nitrogen and phosphorus simultaneously in secondary treated effluents candida utilis is selected as it has been preciously used for the kinetic modelling as well as wastewater treatment 34 36 to develop this kinetic model candida utilis was cultivated in synthetic wastewater to determine the yeast growth and nutrient carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal rate experimentally and to determine the half saturation constant for the monod equation once the kinetic parameters were determined a simple kinetic model was presented to describe the growth of yeast and pollutant consumption in wastewater treatment at three different ph 2 methodology 2 1 synthetic wastewater wastewater at different c n p ratios was synthesized by dissolving the following chemicals in distilled water c6h12o6 125 563 mg l 1 nh4cl 31 138 mg l 1 kh2po4 9 24 mg l 1 cacl2 84 mg l 1 mgso4 7h2o 1000 mg l 1 and 0 5 ml of trace element

ph of the synthetic wastewater was adjusted to 6 5 5 5 and 4 0 using naoh 0 1 m or hcl 0 1 m these ph values are selected because yeast prefer acidic or slightly acidic ph condition these are the typical ph values for wastewater treatment by yeast all the chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich uk 2 2 the candida utilis preservation and reactor inoculum preparation a pure culture of candida utilis was purchased from public health england it was grown in yeast extract peptone dextrose ypd broth formedium uk which was prepared by dissolving 50 g of ypd in 1 l of distilled water using a magnetic stirrer the solution was autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min and cooled in the sterile chamber candida utilis inoculated in broth solution was placed in an incubator ika ks 4000 i control at 30 c and 120 rpm for 14 h after reaching the log phase the grown culture was centrifuged eppendorf centrifuge 5810 at 3500 rpm 10 min in 50 ml falcon tubes the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 0 9 saline water to wash the biomass the suspension was centrifuged again this washing step was repeated 3 times 2 3 experimental plan to investigate the growth kinetics of candida utilis and nutrient removal efficiencies eight batch reactors 1 l with a working volume of 0 8 l were established at 6 5 ph the ratio of c n p was kept constant in all reactors at 6 25 1 00 0 314 representing optimum c n ratio for yeast growth and excess phosphorus 39 the concentrations of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus were varied to mimic the secondary treated effluent concentration available in the literature with slight variations 40 41 the concentration of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in all reactors is given in table 1 after achieving the concentrations of n and p all eight reactors were autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min and cooled down to room temperature in the uv sterile chamber the reactors were placed in sterilization chambers under uv light overnight in each reactor 1 ml of the washed candida utilis suspension in saline solution was used as an inoculum so that the final concentration of each reactor became 10 mg l 1 reactors had a volume of 800 ml they were kept in the incubator ika ks 4000i control uk at 30 c with constant shaking at 120 rpm for 30 h to measure biomass growth and remaining nutrients in the reactor samples 15 ml were taken from the reactors for the first hours until a stationary phase was reached and the limiting substrate completely utilized later experiments were conducted at initial ph of 5 5 and 4 according to the same procedure to verify the kinetic model obtained from the two set of experiments and evaluate the effect of ph on the constant of kinetic models experiments were conducted in duplicates 2 4 analytical methods yeast growth was measured via dry weight and optical density techniques in dry weight nuclepore polycarbonate 0 22 Î¼m porous size were used the optical density at 600 nm od600 was measured using a uv visible spectrophotometer 7305 jenway staffordshire uk for ammonia nitrogen nh3 n orthophosphate po4 3 and glucose samples were filtered through fisherbrand nylon syringe filter 0 2 Î¼m nh3 n was measured by the nessler method 8038 42 phosphorus was measured using an amino acid method 8178 43 glucose was measured in the form of total organic carbon toc by vario toc elemental analyser 44 dissolved oxygen do was measured using an atlas scientific lab grade do meter env 40 dox us with a range from 0 to 100 mg l 1 and accuracy 0 05 mg l 1 ph env 40 ph us was measured using an atlas scientific lab grade ph probe with 0 002 accuracy vfa was measured by thermos fisher aquino uk the column used was ice asi 4 250 mm and the suppressor was acrs ice 500 4 mm a volume of 1 mm heptafluorobutyric acid was used as eluent the column temperature was 30oc with a flow rate of 0 16 ml min 2 5 determining the estimated chemical composition of yeast the chemical composition of yeast depends upon several environmental factors such as substrate concentration salt concentration and degree of aeration however the substrate concentration is the most significant in most cases substrate concentration is the rate limiting step the estimated typical molecular formula for budding yeast biomass is ch1 613o0 557n0 158p0 012 45 yeast also contains sulphur magnesium potassium and calcium however their concentrations are much lower than carbon nitrogen and phosphorus therefore for simplicity we omitted these in our consideration based on their molecular formula for 1 mol of carbon there are 1 613 mol of hydrogen 0 557 mol of oxygen 0 158 mol of nitrogen and 0 012 mol of phosphorus it is difficult to experimentally estimate the carbon balance for the yeast growth as carbon rapidly converted to co2 which is undetected in our case co2 production was estimated based on carbon consumption in the wastewater and carbon found in the yeast cell phosphorus consumption was low therefore nitrogen consumption was selected to determine the carbon ratio 2 6 kinetic model for wastewater treatment the kinetic model investigation had the following assumptions 1 no change in temperature 2 zero evaporation 3 oxygen was consumed from the environment 4 dissolved oxygen was consumed from culturing medium and no mass transfer limitation and 5 inhibition effect of multi substrates is neglected data for the designed model was obtained from batch cultivations in 1 l reactor volumes at 30 c and 120 rpm and for the concentration of secondary effluent wastewater in this

and yp are the removal coefficient for carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in mg mg yeast 1 there are different multiple kinetic models based on monod kinetic in the literature 46 47 however only few of them have incorporated all three major nutrients such as carbon nitrogen and phosphorous some models used monod kinetic to define the growth only and used different equations such as luedeking piret to determine the consumption of substrates 48 other models described substrate consumption with the order reaction constant 49 which shows that the growth and the substrate consumption have not been interrelated in this model both growth and substrate consumption are described in conjunction using the monod kinetics hence interlinked with each other 3 results and discussions 3 1 growth and substrate utilization rates of candida utilis the candida utilis growth reached a stationary phase within 8 12 h at lower substrate concentrations 50 100 mg l 1 whereas it took 12 15 h to reach the stationary phase at the higher concentrations of substrate 125 225 mg l 1 fig 1 higher concentrations of substrates led to higher biomass concentrations candida utilis rapidly reduced carbon achieving complete reduction in 24 h fig 1b in all experiments the reactors with carbon content in the range 50 100 mg l 1 achieved 100 removal rate within 8 12 h the reactors with carbon in the range 125 175 mg l 1 achieved 100 removal rates within 22 h in addition when the carbon was consumed completely the growth of the candida utilis stopped and a stationary phase was reached generally higher inoculum concentrations of yeast avoid contamination and suppress the growth of unwanted microorganisms 50 different concentrations of yeast inoculum have been mentioned in the literature ranging from single cell colonies to 15 g l 1 for instance the removal of carbon and nitrogen from wastewater 75 ml 5 v v 1 inoculum of precultures were used as an inoculum in 1 5 l of culturing medium 34 the concentration of inoculum is selected based on the cultivation stage for instance growing the first culture in liquid media 100 ml required a single cell from agar plates whereas for volumes higher than 100 ml required larger inoculum concentrations inoculum concentration will have a significant effect on biomass production 51 results fig 1 showed that a low concentration of yeast inoculum of 14 mg is sufficient in 800 ml for 100 cod removal and 52 68 removal of nitrogen and 33 61 of phosphorus within 30 h from sterile synthetic wastewater the highest specific growth rates of 0 30 0 314 h 1 were achieved in the higher substrate concentration reactors c 150 225 mg l 1 n 24 36 mg l 1 and p 7 6 9 77 mg l 1 at low concentrations of substrate c 50 125 mg l 1 n 8 20 mg l 1 and p 3 44 5 6 mg l 1 the specific growth rate was found to be 0 23 0 28 h 1 0 28 h 1 during the early stages of treatment nitrogen removal rates were low fig 1 c shows that nitrogen removal rates increased between 8 and 12 h but dropped to zero at 12 h this is because during this duration the rate of consumption of carbon was high which supports the consumption of nitrogen c utilis consumed phosphorus at a lower rate than carbon and nitrogen thus the initial phosphorus concentration in the culturing medium was lower additionally as shown in fig 1 d consumption of phosphorus stopped after 16 h this clearly shows that when the limiting substrate carbon was consumed completely the consumption of nitrogen and phosphorus were stopped as well the overall removal efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus were between 53 69 and 34 61 depending upon the initial concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus the substrate consumption per mg of yeast for carbon nitrogen and phosphorus were 0 8 0 92 0 08 0 09 and 0 01 0 03 mg of substrate per mg of yeast as shown in fig 2 the c n and p n ratios used in the experiments are 6 25 and 0 317 0 05 and carbon was found to be a limiting substrate 3 2 changes in the ph and dissolved oxygen parameters that can be externally controlled such as aeration ph temperature co2 or light intensity and duration on microalgae can be considered external substrates 52 they are equally significant not only for growth but for substrate utilization in the first 4 h yeast continuously decreases the ph of the culturing medium to acidic the decrease in ph stopped when ph reached between3 5 3 0 as shown in fig 3 since the time interval for the sampling was 4 h leg phase duration was not detected yeast reduced the culturing medium ph during the first hours of cultivation which indicates that culturing media at neutral conditions would not affect yeast growth as it can quickly reduce the ph to acidic level it was also noted that the ph drop was lower at lower concentrations of substrate and higher in the high concentration of substrates there could be several factors that lead to the decrease in ph one of them is that yeast nutrient consumption leads to production of organic acids that decrease ph studies reveal no simple relationship between dissolved oxygen oxygen uptake co2 output growth rate and organic acid production 53 the presence of small concentration of acetic acid and propionic acid were detected during vfa analysis another reason could be the lack of aeration causing yeast to accumulate co2 from dissolved oxygen consumption when the concentration of dissolved co2 reaches between 0 042 and 0 130 m the partial yeast respiration changes to anaerobic which leads to volatile organic acids 38 finally yeast also produces h when consuming ammonium 54 in all these experiments ammonia was used as a nitrogen source and a significant amount of nitrogen was consumed by yeast producing h ions causing the decrease in ph for all experiments the do concentration drastically dropped from 6 25 mg l 1 and once the yeast achieved the stationary phases the concentration of do started to recover as shown in fig 3 this could be because the decrease in the requirement of do consumption by yeast and the agitation from the incubator supported the oxygen intake it has also been shown that a fraction of oxygen is used for the maintenance of other physiological functions which are not exactly associated with growth 35 55 the term energy for maintenance was proposed for the energy that is necessary to maintain the cellular motility turnover of cellular material concentration and ph gradients 56 in the aerobic process the intake of carbon is highest when the do concentration in the surroundings of the cell is sufficient to eliminate the possibility of oxygen limitation therefore knowing the concentration of dissolved oxygen is necessary 36 for biological wastewater treatment achieving a satisfactory amount of do concentration in the culturing medium is always difficult to reduce the energy requirement do is often kept at a low level 1 mg l 1 52 3 3 chemical composition and co2 production the estimated molecular formula of c utilis found in this research is c 3 8 5 h 4 9 13 85 o 1 6 4 8 p 0 03 0 23 increase in the initial carbon concentration increased the biomass and the mole of co2 production a linear relation was found between the biomass and moles of co2 produced r2 0 9773 as shown in fig 4 the co2 production has previously been measured during the growth of c utilis which exhibited the lag exponential and stationary phases similar to the growth phases 57 3 4 optimisation this kinetic investigation required several sets of experimental data hence an experimental design was developed consisting of 16 sets of experiments an optimisation technique using solver was used to adjust the parameters only so that the model results were consistent with experimental data only two data set 75 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 of carbon concentration were used for the optimization numerical euler methods were performed in excel the model was optimized using a solver by reducing the least square error of experimental data and model data the monod half saturation coefficient can change with the nature of the growth medium which includes the concentration of substrates and trace metals ph and temperature of the medium and duration of exposure 58 the half saturation coefficients were observed to be influenced by the overall process rate suggesting that a single value for this parameter is not appropriate 59 several relations of half saturation coefficient have been suggested it is suggested that ks depends upon the microbial growth rate 60 when nitrate is being used as a substrate kno3 is a function of denitrification rate 61 in batch culture of c utilis half saturation values slightly changes from 29 Î¼m to 33 Î¼m when thiamine was introduced in the culture medium 58 half saturation is also influenced by the actual availability of substrate at the cell surface 62 therefore different terminologies were used such as half saturation index or affinity coefficient to describe ks 63 the half saturation parameters for denitrification systems are routinely adjusted to better mimic the final effluent concentrations rather than being independently calculated and are therefore unverifiable 59 the presented model parameters were adjusted through optimisation in a way that it could cover a wide range of initial concentrations of substrates this is only possible if the apparent saturation coefficient becomes a function of initial substrate concentration this approach was also presented in a previous study 36 one of the benefits of optimisation is that the optimized parameter also incorporated the effect of other hidden factors such as other nutrient consumption micronutrients such as trace metals change in ph during treatment oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production for the prediction of growth and substrate utilization once the biological coefficient was determined the model was compared with all experimental data included additional 8 set of experiment which was conducted at different ph the optimized kinetic parameters are given in table 2 3 5 kinetic modelling optimisation of kinetic modelling demonstrated that the apparent half saturation coefficients of substrate using c utilis for wastewater treatment varied with initial substrate concentration rather than being constants if the initial ph was between 4 0 and 6 5 it has been reported in previous study that the ratio of initial substrate concentration to initial biomass concentration influencing the identifiability of kinetic parameters 64 in presented model the initial biomass concentration was kept constant however the initial substrate concentrations were varied through kinetic modelling the apparent half saturation coefficient of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus were found to be the function of initial substrate concentration the apparent half saturation coefficients for carbon nitrogen and phosphorus found through modelling were k c app c 0 n k n app n 0 n and k p app p 0 n therefore the model is represented via eqs 15 to 18 15 d yeast i dt Î¼ max yeast i c 0 c 0 c 0 n n 0 n 0 n 0 n p 0 p 0 p 0 n 16 dc dt y c Î¼ max yeast i c 0 c 0 c 0 n n 0 n 0 n 0 n p 0 p 0 p 0 n 17 dn

p0 are the initial concentration of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in mg l 1 Î¼max is the maximum specific growth rate h 1 and yc yn and yp are the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal coefficient mg substrates mg yeast 1 the half saturation coefficient of carbon found in another study were kc 0 3co 36 though this result were extracted when only carbon was considered as substrate however in this study three major substrates carbon nitrogen and phosphorus were considered the effect on initial substrate concentration on half saturation value presented in other studies as well 21 65 this dependence of the half saturation coefficient of nitrogen and phosphorus on their initial concentrations has not been presented before several different correlations of half saturation have been described one of the reasons for the variation is that the half saturation coefficients significantly depend on the system considered so have to be determined on a case to case basis 63 it has previously been reported that the correlation and standard deviation of monod parameters were functions of initial substrate concentration and cell concentration 66 it was also suggested that low and high concentrations of glucose could exhibit different saturation coefficients 65 half saturation coefficients have also been shown to be dependent on microbial growth rate these findings show that they are not true constants 60 half saturation coefficient of a particular substrate could also be dependent on the removal rate of that substrate for example samples were collected from wastewater treatment plant and additional nutrients were added to find the half saturation coefficient of nitrate which had been found to be a function of the denitrification rate 61 it has also been suggested that half saturation is strongly influenced by substrate diffusion into the cell 67 these biological coefficients are a basis not only for predicting biomass growth and substrate consumption but can also be used to simulate the time course of the other relevant parameters involved in the system in practice the initial substrate concentration of waste in a secondary effluent would depend on the prior treatment processes conducted the monod equation has been widely used to describe microbial growth of microorganisms including c utilis however most of the studies have focused on one or two substrates and a constant value of half saturation constant which are only valid for a limited range of substrate concentrations several half saturation constants for carbon have been calculated when only carbon was considered as a substrate in the medium c utilis was grown in a simple black box model based on introducing substrate microorganisms and their products and observing the growth output over time but this model only considered carbon as substrate 36 3 6 model validation when a wastewater treatment plant is designed to achieve low effluent concentrations half saturation coefficients need to be considered carefully since they have a strong influence on the growth of microorganisms 59 wastewater is a complex medium in which multiple substrate and complex compounds are present therefore it is difficult to apply multi substrate monod kinetic to predict biomass growth and substrate utilization here the proposed model containing multiple substrate dependencies is compared with the experimental data because of the error minimization approach used in this research the half saturation coefficient and maximum specific growth rate are applicable over a range of data to predict the biomass concentration and substrate consumption the only coefficient derived from experimental data was the yield coefficient the model successfully predicted the growth rate and substrate utilization as shown in figs 5 8 the maximum specific growth rate found in this study is similar to the one found previously 0 59 h 1 21 previously it was found that there is a negligible effect of ph on maximum specific growth between ph 6 0 to 4 0 58 similarly kinetic modelling shows that ph has no effect on the maximum specific growth rate this implies that the only coefficient in the monod model that varies with ph is the yield coefficient therefore the yield coefficient has a significant impact on the prediction of biomass growth and substrate utilization it was observed that the initial concentration of substrate does not affect the maximum specific growth in the kinetic model the only critical parameter which is often neglected during kinetic modelling is substrate removal coefficient it was previously assumed that the yield factor the reciprocal of substrate removal was constant and independent of the growth rate however recent studies found that the yield varies with the specific growth rate substrate uptake rate and oxygen consumption 68 based on our experiments the yield coefficient varied significantly only when the initial ph of the wastewater was altered these experimental values of substrate removal coefficient strongly support the model data for the prediction of substrate utilization and biomass growth it can be concluded that the substrate removal coefficient is an important parameter for the prediction of biomass growth and substrate utilization which usually does not get attention in the monod model 3 7 comparison of specific growth rate the specific growth rate calculated from the model eq 10 was compared to the experimental data and the model data it is found that the with the specific growth rate extracted from the model data and experimental data is quite similar whereas the specific growth rate determined from the specific growth rate equation is much higher as shown in fig 9 this implies that the amount of yeast concentration present in the system during treatment has an influence on the specific growth rate it is previously suggested that the biomass concentration has an impact on specific growth rate therefore it affects the overall rate of reaction 69 3 8 sensitivity analysis to determine at which condition the model reflects substrate limitation sensitivity analysis on the multi substrate model were performed via changing the initial substrate concentration of carbon and nitrogen in the model carbon was shown to be the limiting substrate when the c n ratio was below 10 0 and nitrogen the limiting substrate when the c n ratio was above 10 7 at initial ph of 4 0 6 5 and reactor was shaken at 120 rm similar results were observed previously in a batch reactor study which used bacteria carbon was the limiting substrate when c n 7 1 whilst nitrogen was the limiting substrate when c n 12 6 70 4 conclusions to the author s current knowledge this manuscript is the first to incorporate three substrates in the monod model for candida utilis wastewater treatment and to investigate the relationship between their half saturation coefficient and the initial substrate concentration c utilis was cultivated in synthetic wastewater medium at eight different combinations of concentrations of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus to determine the yeast growth and pollutant carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates experimentally in all experiments carbon was found to be the limiting substrate and 100 toc removal was achieved in all cases the maximum specific growth rate 0 59 h 1 agreed well with previous findings a kinetic model based on all substrates carbon phosphorus and nitrogen was developed to predict the yeast growth and substrate consumption it was found that the apparent half saturation coefficients were not constant but instead were better expressed as functions of the initial concentrations of the respective substrates hence the apparent half saturation coefficient for carbon nitrogen and phosphorus found through modelling were k c app c 0 n k n app n 0 n and k p app p 0 n the half saturation coefficients and maximum specific growth rates found in this study incorporated the effect of other nutrients and external factors with the aim of better predicting the growth and substrate uptake the biological constants derived here are valid when the initial ph is in the range 4 0 6 5 at an operating temperature of 30 c the half saturation coefficient relationship to initial concentration and maximum specific growth rate remained constant under the tested condition substrate removal coefficient is an important parameter that is often overlooked in the monod model this research showed for instance that it can change with varying ph the improved model developed here should be helpful in predicting yeast growth and pollutant removal to help design and operate tertiary wastewater treatment systems using yeast further investigations are required to increase the functional range of the kinetic model for multiple substrates to improve the model accuracy for real wastewater treatment it can be further optimized with real wastewater treatment data which could provide more accuracy according to real system this approach should also be applicable for determining biological coefficient in other microorganism systems although the yeast based treatment technology appears promising it is still a long way off before its practical application can be realised as several critical issues need to be addressed prior to its real application such as cultivating yeast in an open environment harvesting yeast for the production of high quality water and scalability this model should continue its development so it can be further refined to be able to

12782,most aeration tanks in wastewater treatment plants wwtps operate at fixed dissolved oxygen do concentrations of 2 0 mg l such control systems do not consider various influent loadings thus it does not respond effectively to fluctuating influent behavior resulting in energy and cost wastage this paper proposes a dynamic supervised machine learning model dependent on real time influent biochemical oxygen demand predictions and biological treatment oxygen constraints that have not been considered in previous studies for optimizing air blower operation in wwtp aeration tanks the model is tested against wwtp operating based on the modified ludzack ettinger process the dataset covers three years and two months of operation containing 1155 daily readings the random forest and gradient boost models predicted the optimum do concentration by achieving a 1 00 coefficient of determination and 0 01 mean absolute error the optimization led to a 23 reduction in energy consumption such an intelligence framework can be extended to other air blower applications and generalized nationwide to optimize energy consumption and cost savings for intelligent wwtps the proposed system is

solids data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction according to the united nations world urbanization prospects report in 1950 only 30 of the world s population lived in urban settlements it is projected that 68 of the world s population will live in urban settlements by 2050 1 the shift from rural to urban cities has witnessed a dramatic increase from 751 million in 1950 to 4 2 billion in 2018 and is expected to increase by an additional 2 5 billion by 2050 reaching 6 7 billion 1 2 countries are forced to invest heavily in infrastructure development owing to the rapid global increase in population leading to high wastewater production therefore more wastewater treatment plants wwtps are expected to be developed as a result sustainable development and operational optimization are critical for smart city development and urban resilience it is estimated that wwtps consume 3 5 of global electricity 3 this percentage is expected to increase in the future in wwtps energy consumption represents the second highest expenditure after labor costs 4 air blowers and pumps are responsible for approximately 75 of the electricity demand of wwtps air blowers consume approximately 50 of the plant s energy consumption 5 6 they are essential for biological treatment and nutrient removal the problem with conventional aeration tank control systems is that most plants neglect influent loading and set air blowers at fixed dissolved oxygen do concentrations of 2 0 mg l 7 these traditional operating systems are insensitive to influent conditions because of following pre determined treatment static setpoints that disregard them 8 10 the current control process leads to unnecessary energy consumption and unjustified cost therefore the amount of aeration depends on the influent loading to achieve an optimum cost effective treatment however the main factor influencing the do requirement is biochemical oxygen demand bod5 which requires five days to be measured through laboratory tests fortunately machine learning ml can be utilized to predict bod5 and optimize do concentrations accordingly machine learning can model complex nonlinear relationships without explicitly describing the treatment process using mathematical or chemical equations unlike legacy models 11 12 it has great potential to explore a new understanding of wastewater behavior which is challenging to observe machine learning integration with wastewater treatment processes will be a guidance tool to improve the treatment process reduce energy consumption and operational costs 13 optimize plant performance 14 15 and enhance environmental preservation this integration will facilitate the realization of intelligent wwtps which can be considered essential components of smart cities hernÃ¡ndez del olmo et al 16 developed a wwtp control model free reinforcement learning rl agent to optimize do injection in an active sludge process plant the rl agent learns to adjust the air blower injection setpoints based on the operational cost function that measures the agent action s energy and environmental costs asadi et al 5 utilized four data mining algorithms to optimize air injection and water quality algorithms are required to minimize the energy consumption of air blowers without compromising the treated sewage effluent tse quality the results showed that the multivariate adaptive regression splines model had the best air prediction results achieving a 0 937 coefficient of determination r2 the results showed that optimizing energy by reducing do by 5 4 led to an 18 reduction in effluent quality in contrast a 16 improvement in the tse is possible by increasing the do concentration by 9 6 their study showed that 31 4 energy saving is plausible nourani et al 17 proposed a wastewater treatment performance analysis model the authors trained and compared the results of several single and ensemble models using an artificial neural network ann an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis support vector machines and linear regression the anfis algorithm achieved the best bod5 and total nitrogen tn prediction results for the single models in contrast the ann showed the best chemical oxygen demand cod prediction results the ann showed the best results for ensemble models by increasing the single model performance of bod5 prediction up to 24 and up to 5 for cod and tn prediction wang et al 12 introduced an optimization model for minimizing wwtp energy and material consumption trained on two years of daily frequency data the model uses convolutional neural networks and long short term memory algorithms to predict effluent parameters based on influent input parameters subsequently a genetic algorithm optimizes the consumed energy and materials the optimization model achieved an overall 10 15 reduction in energy and material costs compared to the collected data while maintaining the tse quality within standards based on the above the research gap addressed in this study is that none of the previous studies considered the biological treatment environment constraints when optimizing the do setpoint in addition none of the previous studies developed a complete dynamic do optimization model based on real time influent loading predictions to address delayed influent readings and the static do setpoint problems therefore this paper primarily proposes an automated and intelligent supervised ml model dependent on real time influent bod5 predictions and biological treatment oxygen constraints for optimizing the operation of air blowers in wwtp aeration tanks this study aims to reduce energy consumption and wwtp operational costs by satisfying the required effluent quality and wastewater treatment constraints the proposed model can be extended to other air blower applications and wwtp mechanisms this study considered a full scale municipal wwtp in the kingdom of bahrain as a case study this paper proposes and presents the following i to develop a machine learning model for predicting influent biochemical oxygen demand ii to develop a machine learning model for predicting optimized do from the bod5 prediction model output with respect to wastewater treatment constraints and iii to study the energy reduction realized after optimizing air blower operation the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methods and modeling algorithms section 3 presents the data analysis section 4 presents the modeling results and discussion finally section 5 concludes the study 2 methods and modeling algorithms 2 1 oxygen requirement wastewater treatment consists of several complex treatment stages in multiple units before disposing of the treated effluent back to the tse network or water bodies these are typically classified into four stages 18 preliminary primary secondary and tertiary treatments in conventional primary and secondary treatment arrangements with suspended growth primary clarifiers are followed by aeration tanks for nutrient removal and secondary clarifiers however in the sequencing batch reactor sbr arrangement the same reactor tank merges the primary and secondary treatments in a single tank followed by a sludge digester tank 4 in sbr treatment a predefined repeated treatment cycle based on the ultimate design parameters starts regardless of the actual wastewater flow loadings figs a 1 and a 2 of supplementary material show the differences between conventional and sbr arrangements the bod removal process is described in eq 1 1 3 c 6 h 12 o 6 8 o 2 2 nh 3 oxidization 2 c 5 h 7 no 2 8 c o 2 14 h 2 o where 3c6h12o6 is an organic matter and 2c5h7no2 is a new cell based on the above it can be concluded that bod removal requires 1 42 g of oxygen per bod hence it is crucial to promptly identify the influent bod5 to identify the optimum oxygen injection during the bod removal process and biodegradation of organic matter the nitrogen removal process begins by breaking the organic matter and separating the nitrogen content which converts it to ammonia nh3 19 the nitrification process then starts with the help of air blowers that inject oxygen to compensate for the oxygen consumed by aerobic autotrophic organisms 4 this leads to the conversion of ammonia nh3 to nitrite and subsequently nitrate 4 20 both reactions required oxygen to facilitate nitrification the total nitrification process consumption per nitrate mg is 4 57 mg of oxygen 4 accordingly the oxygen requirement for bod removal and nitrification is shown in eqs 2 and 3 2 r o q s 0 s 1 42 p x bio 4 57 q no x nitrified 3 no x tkn n e 0 12 p x bio q where r o oxygen requirement q influent flow rate s

equation represents the oxygen required to provide microorganisms with the energy to oxidize biodegradable cod oxygen consumed during the endogenous respiration process ammonia and nitrite oxidation to nitrate and deduction of sludge waste 4 accordingly this study used do concentration as an energy consumption indicator for wwtps aeration operations 2 2 regression regression is a variable relationship measurement used to forecast continuous dependent values given other independent variables it is a common ml problem applied to various tasks such as forecasting traffic flow temperature and the stock market their performances were measured using the root mean square error rmse mean square error mse and mean absolute error mae several algorithms can be used in regression tasks including linear regression decision tree regression random forest adaptive boosting gradient boosting extreme gradient boosting and artificial neural networks the following is a brief explanation of the algorithms used 2 2 1 random forest algorithm the random forest rf algorithm is based on assembling a group of trained decision trees the decision tree was trained on slightly different portions of the dataset to predict the numerical values using the bootstrapping technique this technique creates subsamples from a dataset having the same distribution with replacement let x 1 x n d the number of estimators t maximum depth l and minimum depth p are selected the algorithm starts by selecting bootstrap datasets Ñ± x 1 x n d x 1 x n with a random set of features m m for t estimators in parallel to nominate the node splitting candidates once the node is split node prediction y t x is calculated and retained for each estimator the error was calculated using eq 4 the final prediction is the mean value 21 4 e x 1 n x i n y y m x 2 2 2 2 adaptive boosting algorithm the adaptive boosting adb algorithm uses a boosting technique that combine multiple weak individual models to produce accurate results the boosting concept is based on training individual models in sequence in which data observations are weighted based on previous model performance 22 let x 1 x n d after selecting the number of estimators t the observation weights w n 1 n and sampling probability p i w i w i are initialized 23 next the stump trees were created sequentially the stump tree performance was measured using l t i 1 n l t i p t i where l t can be in the form of a square loss function as shown in eq 5 where h x i and y i are the predicted and actual targets respectively 5 l t i h x i y i max i 1 h x i y i 2 the predicted value h x i which differs the most from the actual target value y i are given more weight in the next estimator prediction the updated weight coefficient w i t 1 w i Î² t 1 l t i z where Î² l t 1 l t is a measure of the predictor confidence and z is the normalization factor 24 accordingly the sampling probability increases for observations that incorrectly predict an actual target hence they are more likely to be selected for the following estimator after completing t number of estimators the final tree prediction is the weighted median as shown in eq 6 6 h x final inf y y t h t x log 1 Î² t 1 2 t log 1 Î² t 2 2 3 gradient boosting algorithm the gradient boost algorithm gb is based on minimizing the predicted target residuals using a gradient descent algorithm let x 1 x n d and t be the number of estimators the algorithm starts with an initial guess f 0 x by taking the derivative of the loss function Î³ i 1 n l where l 0 5 y i Î³ 2 25 the observation residuals were calculated using eq 7 7 r i t l y i f x i f x i f x f t 1 x 1 2 y i f t 1 x i 2 f t 1 y i f t 1 x i 0 the regression tree was trained to predict the observation residuals using Î³ j t 1 n x i r i j j r i t the newly predicted value is used to update the previously calculated target predictions by introducing a learning rate to suppress overfitting as shown in eq 8 where Î± is the learning rate 8 f t x f t 1 x Î± j 1 j Î³ j t x r j t the process continues until the selected number of trees is reached or the residuals are not reduced further the final algorithm solution is the solution summation of the grown trees f x t 0 t f t x where f x is the incremental final prediction and f t x is the incrementing function for a number of t trees 2 2 4 extreme gradient boosting algorithm extreme gradient boosting xgb is an effective and efficient ensemble decision tree based algorithm based on the gradient boosting algorithm 26 the algorithm aims to minimize the regularized equation shown in eq 9 9 l i 1 n l y i y i Î³t 1 2 Î» Ï j 2 where l y i y i is the regression loss function and equals 0 5 y i Î³ 2 Î³ is the model complexity penalizing term t is the number of terminal nodes Î» is the regularization parameter and Ï j is the node j prediction value a greedy algorithm starts with a single leaf assuming an initial prediction 26 this was followed by fitting the xgboost regression tree growing an xgboost regression tree begins by creating recursive stump trees over potential split candidates to determine the root node rule corresponding to the highest splitting gain each stump tree evaluates an xgboost regression tree root node potential split candidate by starting the stump tree with a root node that contains all observations next the split loss reduction is calculated for each branch root and child node using eq 10 where g i and h i are the loss functions of the first and second order gradients respectively 10 l split 1 2 i i l n g i 2 i i l n h i Î» i i r n g i 2 i i r n h i Î» i root n g i 2 i root n h i Î» Î³ once the highest split loss reduction is retained the related splitting candidate is chosen to be the xgboost regression tree root node splitting rule and the observations are divided accordingly the observations retained in a terminal node cannot be divided further the algorithm continues to determine each branch splitting rule until it reaches the maximum number of trees or node splitting the final prediction is given by eq 11 where Îµ is the learning rate 11 Ï j Ï j m t Îµ j 1 j Ï j m x r j m 2 3 model performance evaluation each model was trained on several algorithms its prediction performance was assessed and it was subjected to different hyperparameter tuning cases the algorithm performance was evaluated based on the coefficient of determination r2 and mae metrics shown in eqs 12 and 13 respectively in addition k fold cross validation was performed 12 r 2 i 1 n x i x i y i y i i 1 n x i x i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 2 13 mae i 1 n y i x i n dataset splitting into training validation and testing datasets along with k fold cross validation were used to validate the model performance the k fold cross validation is preferred over a single validation split set because it enables training and testing of the developed tuned model on several train test splits such validation provides a better evaluation of the model performance than having one validation set hence sampling bias is minimized in the case of a single validation split 27 the k fold cross validation technique randomly shuffled the dataset it is then split into k folds of approximately equal size in general practice the k value is generally chosen to be five or ten 28 next the ml model was tested k times where each fold was considered a testing dataset and the other k 1 folds were considered the training dataset 29 the average score and standard deviation of model performance were calculated fig 1 demonstrates the k fold cross validation methodology 3 data analysis 3 1 plant description the madinat salman wwtp is a 40 000 m3 day capacity plant that can later be expanded to 60 000 m3 day located in north bahrain its construction started in 2015 and was completed in 2018 to serve madinat salman and parts of the northern governorate areas the plant was designed based on the modified ludzack ettinger mle process to produce a tertiary class tse used for irrigation the dataset covers three years and two months of operation containing 1155 daily readings distributed over 38 features each the features were divided into 16 influent features seven aeration stage features and 15 effluent features fig 2 shows an aerial photo of the wwtp tables 1 and 2 shows the dataset feature description and statistics respectively fig a 3 in the supplementary material shows the dataset visualization the treatment processes in the madinat salman plant operates following a non intelligent fixed setpoints to control the treatment operations the current operation processes assume receiving the ultimate influent loading that the plant was designed based on which is not the case table 3 compares the treatment process parameters with the average influent load received in the plant the plant s actual influent load is below the treatment capacity by a minimum of 12 in the worst case scenario which occurred during approximately three years of plant operation where a variety of influent loading and weather condition scenarios occurred air blowers mixers and chemical injectors operate under suboptimal conditions leading to unnecessary energy consumption and unjustified costs as a result there is a high potential for energy saving and cost reduction 3 2 data preprocessing the madinat salman dataset did not have null values or categorical data several feature combinations were selected for the modeling stage the feature selection shown in table 4 was based on features that greatly influence the do requirement in practice the features were normalized since they were on different scales a correlation coefficient matrix was developed for influent features it shows a high positive correlation coefficient between several influent features total suspended solids tss and chemical oxygen demand cod cod and bod5 and ammonia nh3 and tn the dataset was divided into 70 10 and 20 training validation and testing respectively hence there were 808 116 and 231 training validation and testing data points respectively machine learning models were then developed and the hyperparameters were tuned using the validation dataset finally the performance of the models was verified using the testing dataset and validated using k fold cross validation and the model performance metrics described in section 2 3 fig 3 shows the correlation coefficient matrix fig a 4 of supplementary material shows the modeling workflow 4 results and discussion 4 1 influent bod5 prediction the modeling results showed that feature combination b1 consisting of conductivity nh3 and tn performed the worst in predicting influent bod5 the maximum testing results by the b1 feature combination were obtained using the gb algorithm scoring only 0 40 r2 and 22 71 mae in contrast the other feature combinations b2 to b5 achieved excellent performance the best influent bod5 testing prediction results were obtained using the feature combination b3 and rf algorithm scoring 0 92 r2 and 6 72 mae the algorithm hyperparameters were tuned using the validation dataset to avoid overfitting and underfitting the model had a minimum sample split of 47 a maximum tree depth of 30 and 30 ensemble trees as shown in table 5 and fig 4 by observing the training validation and testing as well as mae results shown in tables 6 7 and 8 for the model mentioned above it can be concluded that no overfitting or underfitting exists in the model in terms of algorithms rf performed the best compared to other algorithms although gb had a slightly better testing coefficient of determination than the rf results the mae of the testing dataset was higher than that of rf despite the tss feature has a correlation coefficient of 0 9 with bod5 it did not improve the model performance results when combined with the cod feature in feature combination b5 the model performance deteriorated slightly in the gb and xgb algorithms compared with the feature combination models b3 and b4 using the same algorithms tables 5 6 7 and 8 summarize the modeling results with the accurate and prompt bod5 prediction results obtained above a new ml model was trained to predict the optimum do requirement for biological treatment the ground truth optimum do values of the ml model were calculated using the equations illustrated in section 2 1 4 2 optimum do concentration prediction modeling results showed that feature combinations d1 d3 and d6 achieved low performance in predicting the optimum do concentration in contrast the feature combinations d2 d4 and d5 achieved excellent prediction results the results showed that the flow feature had the greatest influence on improving the results it can be observed that the feature combinations that did not have the flow as input performed the worst its inclusion almost doubles the coefficient of determination the rf models achieved excellent performance as listed in tables 6 7 and 8 feature combinations d2 and d4 achieved the maximum results scoring 1 00 r2 and 0 01 mae in training validation and testing respectively feature combination d4 performance was achieved by tuning the rf hyperparameters to 11 trees a maximum tree depth of 11 and a minimum node sample split of 11 the hyperparameter tuning results are shown in fig 5 conversely the feature combination d5 score is not significantly different from that of the previous models it scored 0 99 r2 and 0 03 mae although the adb algorithm showed excellent results it was negligibly lower than that of the rf algorithm meanwhile the gb algorithm restored high performance achieving maximum results unlike the adb models the performance of feature combinations d1 and d3 was slightly improved nevertheless they did not achieve rf performance in terms of mae on the contrary the combination d4 achieved the maximum results scoring 1 00 r2 and 0 01 mae matching the rf algorithm s best model performance tables 5 6 7 8 and fig 5 show that combination d4 results were achieved using 38 trees hyperparameter tuning shows that overfitting and underfitting behaviors do not influence the model predictions feature combination d4 is recommended for the optimum do prediction model because the optimum do is directly related to flow measurement mixed liquor suspended solids mlss bod5 and tn any change in these input features directly affects the required oxygen concentration thus to develop a robust model all these features are fundamental for accurately predicting the optimum do concentration 4 3 results summary and discussion all the algorithm modeling results achieved excellent performance in predicting the optimum do requirement the algorithms agreed on the best input feature combination to use flow mlss bod5 and tn the rf and gb algorithms had the best results scoring 1 00 r2 and 0 01 mae respectively table 9 summarizes the best model performances obtained the performances of the rf and gb best models were validated again using k fold cross validation the dataset was divided into ten folds with shuffling which were used for validation each fold had 116 observations and was tested against k 1 folds in other words ten combinations of 116 observations were tested against nine combinations of 1039 observations used for model training the k fold testing results in table 9 validate and confirm the modeling results the influent bod5 prediction model scored 0 94 r2 and 0 01 standard deviation similarly rf and gb optimum do models scored 1 00 r2 with a standard deviation of 0 01 and zero respectively against ten different testing data combinations hence the results confirm the robustness of the models in predicting the influent bod5 and optimum do requirement for biological treatment processes however using the optimum do requirement predictions as it is not recommended from practical and operational point of view this is because nitrification denitrification and bod removal bacteria require specific environmental conditions to be satisfied in addition air blowers with continuous real time changes in their settings may cause damage for instance metcalf and eddy 4 stated that do concentration should be maintained at 1 5 2 0 mg l nevertheless they added that the do concentration was commonly set at 2 0 mg l although a do concentration of less than 1 0 mg l can save cost and energy it requires larger reactors similarly do concentrations above 2 0 mg l slightly enhanced the nitrification but led to additional operating costs in the other case there was almost no improvement for the values exceeding 4 0 mg l higher do levels than required may adversely impact the treatment process leading to the growth of process disturbing organisms metcalf and eddy 4 highlighted that nitrification requires a minimum do concentration of 0 7 mg l for initiation the heterotrophic bacterial oxidization rate responsible for bod removal was not affected until the do concentration was below 0 20 mg l in contrast denitrifying bacteria only function at do concentrations below 0 20 mg l this could also be related to the filamentous bacteria dominating at deficient do levels reducing sludge settling and quality hence all such factors must be carefully considered while dynamically adjusting the do setpoint to better visualize the current do concentration levels of the madinat salman wwtp fig 6 shows the actual do concentration the predicted optimum do concentration and the difference between them highlighted in green representing the possible energy savings based on the above prediction results and operational constraints several setpoint levels are recommended at 0 25 mg l intervals the minimum do concentration level was 1 5 mg l furthermore to suppress the treated effluent quality violation risks and ensure redundancy in supplying sufficient oxygen rates during the treatment process and avoid model prediction drifts abnormal influent loading or other factors fluctuating or default impacting the treatment process such as return activated sludge or waste activated sludge the above modeling was trained to include a safety factor of 1 2 therefore neither the predicted do amount is less than the required to lead to biological treatment failures nor is it at the edge that it cannot accommodate any unforeseen incidents nor is the provided do amount much more than required leading to sludge floating or growth of treatment disturbing organisms or waste of energy the analysis revealed that an average of 23 energy and cost savings could be realized without violating effluent quality the results obtained agree with the findings of wang et al 12 and asadi et al 5 this modeling methodology ensures that the effluent quality meets the requirements because the calculated ground truth optimum do for model training already incorporates the required effluent quality parameters for instance the no x formula requires an effluent nh4 n concentration p x bio biomass wasted requires effluent substrate concentration s which represents the cod bod both values are inputs to eqs 2 and 3 accordingly the ml model was already trained to predict the optimum do value with respect to the required effluent quality limits fig 7 shows the recommended operational optimum do concentration setpoint highlighting the resulting energy and cost savings it can be observed that the model recommends 1 5 mg l for most days at the influent loading peaks the do setpoint increases to 1 75 mg l or even 2 0 mg l a week was extracted from the dataset to better visualize the adaptive do setpoints fig 8 shows how the adaptive do setpoint was controlled by comparing it with the predicted optimum do concentration such a control can be performed several times throughout the day for instance in sbr wwtps the do setpoint can be adjusted for each treatment cycle alternatively the do setpoint can be changed once a day in the mle wwtp such as madinat salman wwtp based on the above automation and intelligence are achieved using sensors that provide real time readings as input for the developed ml models to dynamically predict and adjust to the treatment processes without human intervention hence it enables an intelligent wwtp operation and management approach that optimizes energy and resources similarly quality assurance and risk management are achieved by having an intelligent model that dynamically adapts to the fluctuating influent loading to better control the treatment processes rather than a static control approach following a non intelligent static do setpoint might not always work as shown in fig 8 hence an intelligent model that dynamically adjust to the treatment processes with accounting for a safety factor in air injection to suppress the impact of abnormal loading or treatment default enables the proper management of the effluent default risks while ensuring effluent quality 5 conclusion a substantial amount of energy and money is wasted because most wwtp worldwide operate at fixed do setpoints as such the current operating policy cannot be followed especially given the rapid increase in population scarcity of financial resources and fluctuations in fuel prices this paper presents an automated intelligent framework for optimizing the operation of air blowers in wwtp aeration tanks based on real time influent bod5 predictions the proposed do optimization model can be deployed in an integrated framework of remote sensing and ml to dynamically adjust the wwtp aeration tank do concentration setpoints facilitating the realization of intelligent wwtps the merits of the proposed framework can be further maximized by extending it to cover other air blower applications in wwtp such as aerobic digester tanks to gain the maximum benefit of reducing energy consumption and operational costs in addition it can be generalized to various wwtp types the proposed optimization achieves an energy

12782,most aeration tanks in wastewater treatment plants wwtps operate at fixed dissolved oxygen do concentrations of 2 0 mg l such control systems do not consider various influent loadings thus it does not respond effectively to fluctuating influent behavior resulting in energy and cost wastage this paper proposes a dynamic supervised machine learning model dependent on real time influent biochemical oxygen demand predictions and biological treatment oxygen constraints that have not been considered in previous studies for optimizing air blower operation in wwtp aeration tanks the model is tested against wwtp operating based on the modified ludzack ettinger process the dataset covers three years and two months of operation containing 1155 daily readings the random forest and gradient boost models predicted the optimum do concentration by achieving a 1 00 coefficient of determination and 0 01 mean absolute error the optimization led to a 23 reduction in energy consumption such an intelligence framework can be extended to other air blower applications and generalized nationwide to optimize energy consumption and cost savings for intelligent wwtps the proposed system is

urban settlements it is projected that 68 of the world s population will live in urban settlements by 2050 1 the shift from rural to urban cities has witnessed a dramatic increase from 751 million in 1950 to 4 2 billion in 2018 and is expected to increase by an additional 2 5 billion by 2050 reaching 6 7 billion 1 2 countries are forced to invest heavily in infrastructure development owing to the rapid global increase in population leading to high wastewater production therefore more wastewater treatment plants wwtps are expected to be developed as a result sustainable development and operational optimization are critical for smart city development and urban resilience it is estimated that wwtps consume 3 5 of global electricity 3 this percentage is expected to increase in the future in wwtps energy consumption represents the second highest expenditure after labor costs 4 air blowers and pumps are responsible for approximately 75 of the electricity demand of wwtps air blowers consume approximately 50 of the plant s energy consumption 5 6 they are essential for biological treatment and nutrient removal the problem with conventional aeration tank control systems is that most plants neglect influent loading and set air blowers at fixed dissolved oxygen do concentrations of 2 0 mg l 7 these traditional operating systems are insensitive to influent conditions because of following pre determined treatment static setpoints that disregard them 8 10 the current control process leads to unnecessary energy consumption and unjustified cost therefore the amount of aeration depends on the influent loading to achieve an optimum cost effective treatment however the main factor influencing the do requirement is biochemical oxygen demand bod5 which requires five days to be measured through laboratory tests fortunately machine learning ml can be utilized to predict bod5 and optimize do concentrations accordingly machine learning can model complex nonlinear relationships without explicitly describing the treatment process using mathematical or chemical equations unlike legacy models 11 12 it has great potential to explore a new understanding of wastewater behavior which is challenging to observe machine learning integration with wastewater treatment processes will be a guidance tool to improve the treatment process reduce energy consumption and operational costs 13 optimize plant performance 14 15 and enhance environmental preservation this integration will facilitate the realization of intelligent wwtps which can be considered essential components of smart cities hernÃ¡ndez del olmo et al 16 developed a wwtp control model free reinforcement learning rl agent to optimize do injection in an active sludge process plant the rl agent learns to adjust the air blower injection setpoints based on the operational cost function that measures the agent action s energy and environmental costs asadi et al 5 utilized four data mining algorithms to optimize air injection and water quality algorithms are required to minimize the energy consumption of air blowers without compromising the treated sewage effluent tse quality the results showed that the multivariate adaptive regression splines model had the best air prediction results achieving a 0 937 coefficient of determination r2 the results showed that optimizing energy by reducing do by 5 4 led to an 18 reduction in effluent quality in contrast a 16 improvement in the tse is possible by increasing the do concentration by 9 6 their study showed that 31 4 energy saving is plausible nourani et al 17 proposed a wastewater treatment performance analysis model the authors trained and compared the results of several single and ensemble models using an artificial neural network ann an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis support vector machines and linear regression the anfis algorithm achieved the best bod5 and total nitrogen tn prediction results for the single models in contrast the ann showed the best chemical oxygen demand cod prediction results the ann showed the best results for ensemble models by increasing the single model performance of bod5 prediction up to 24 and up to 5 for cod and tn prediction wang et al 12 introduced an optimization model for minimizing wwtp energy and material consumption trained on two years of daily frequency data the model uses convolutional neural networks and long short term memory algorithms to predict effluent parameters based on influent input parameters subsequently a genetic algorithm optimizes the consumed energy and materials the optimization model achieved an overall 10 15 reduction in energy and material costs compared to the collected data while maintaining the tse quality within standards based on the above the research gap addressed in this study is that none of the previous studies considered the biological treatment environment constraints when optimizing the do setpoint in addition none of the previous studies developed a complete dynamic do optimization model based on real time influent loading predictions to address delayed influent readings and the static do setpoint problems therefore this paper primarily proposes an automated and intelligent supervised ml model dependent on real time influent bod5 predictions and biological treatment oxygen constraints for optimizing the operation of air blowers in wwtp aeration tanks this study aims to reduce energy consumption and wwtp operational costs by satisfying the required effluent quality and wastewater treatment constraints the proposed model can be extended to other air blower applications and wwtp mechanisms this study considered a full scale municipal wwtp in the kingdom of bahrain as a case study this paper proposes and presents the following i to develop a machine learning model for predicting influent biochemical oxygen demand ii to develop a machine learning model for predicting optimized do from the bod5 prediction model output with respect to wastewater treatment constraints and iii to study the energy reduction realized after optimizing air blower operation the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methods and modeling algorithms section 3 presents the data analysis section 4 presents the modeling results and discussion finally section 5 concludes the study 2 methods and modeling algorithms 2 1 oxygen requirement wastewater treatment consists of several complex treatment stages in multiple units before disposing of the treated effluent back to the tse network or water bodies these are typically classified into four stages 18 preliminary primary secondary and tertiary treatments in conventional primary and secondary treatment arrangements with suspended growth primary clarifiers are followed by aeration tanks for nutrient removal and secondary clarifiers however in the sequencing batch reactor sbr arrangement the same reactor tank merges the primary and secondary treatments in a single tank followed by a sludge digester tank 4 in sbr treatment a predefined repeated treatment cycle based on the ultimate design parameters starts regardless of the actual wastewater flow loadings figs a 1 and a 2 of supplementary material show the differences between conventional and sbr arrangements the bod removal process is described in eq 1 1 3 c 6 h 12 o 6 8 o 2 2 nh 3 oxidization 2 c 5 h 7 no 2 8 c o 2 14 h 2 o where 3c6h12o6 is an organic matter and 2c5h7no2 is a new cell based on the above it can be concluded that bod removal requires 1 42 g of oxygen per bod hence it is crucial to promptly identify the influent bod5 to identify the optimum oxygen injection during the bod removal process and biodegradation of organic matter the nitrogen removal process begins by breaking the organic matter and separating the nitrogen content which converts it to ammonia nh3 19 the nitrification process then starts with the help of air blowers that inject oxygen to compensate for the oxygen consumed by aerobic autotrophic organisms 4 this leads to the conversion of ammonia nh3 to nitrite and subsequently nitrate 4 20 both reactions required oxygen to facilitate nitrification the total nitrification process consumption per nitrate mg is 4 57 mg of oxygen 4 accordingly the oxygen requirement for bod removal and nitrification is shown in eqs 2 and 3 2 r o q s 0 s 1 42 p x bio 4 57 q no x nitrified 3 no x tkn n e 0 12 p x bio q where r o oxygen requirement q influent flow rate s 0 influent substrate concentration s effluent substrate concentration p x bio biomass wasted no x nitrogen oxidized tkn influent total kjeldahl nitrogen n e effluent nh4 n concentration the above equation represents the oxygen required to provide microorganisms with the energy to oxidize biodegradable cod oxygen consumed during the endogenous respiration process ammonia and nitrite oxidation to nitrate and deduction of sludge waste 4 accordingly this study used do concentration as an energy consumption indicator for wwtps aeration operations 2 2 regression regression is a variable relationship measurement used to forecast continuous dependent values given other independent variables it is a common ml problem applied to various tasks such as forecasting traffic flow temperature and the stock market their performances were measured using the root mean square error rmse mean square error mse and mean absolute error mae several algorithms can be used in regression tasks including linear regression decision tree regression random forest adaptive boosting gradient boosting extreme gradient boosting and artificial neural networks the following is a brief explanation of the algorithms used 2 2 1 random forest algorithm the random forest rf algorithm is based on assembling a group of trained decision trees the decision tree was trained on slightly different portions of the dataset to predict the numerical values using the bootstrapping technique this technique creates subsamples from a dataset having the same distribution with replacement let x 1 x n d the number of estimators t maximum depth l and minimum depth p are selected the algorithm starts by selecting bootstrap datasets Ñ± x 1 x n d x 1 x n with a random set of features m m for t estimators in parallel to nominate the node splitting candidates once the node is split node prediction y t x is calculated and retained for each estimator the error was calculated using eq 4 the final prediction is the mean value 21 4 e x 1 n x i n y y m x 2 2 2 2 adaptive boosting algorithm the adaptive boosting adb algorithm uses a boosting technique that combine multiple weak individual models to produce accurate results the boosting concept is based on training individual models in sequence in which data observations are weighted based on previous model performance 22 let x 1 x n d after selecting the number of estimators t the observation weights w n 1 n and sampling probability p i w i w i are initialized 23 next the stump trees were created sequentially the stump tree performance was measured using l t i 1 n l t i p t i where l t can be in the form of a square loss function as shown in eq 5 where h x i and y i are the predicted and actual targets respectively 5 l t i h x i y i max i 1 h x i y i 2 the predicted value h x i which differs the most from the actual target value y i are given more weight in the next estimator prediction the updated weight coefficient w i t 1 w i Î² t 1 l t i z where Î² l t 1 l t is a measure of the predictor confidence and z is the normalization factor 24 accordingly the sampling probability increases for observations that incorrectly predict an actual target hence they are more likely to be selected for the following estimator after completing t number of estimators the final tree prediction is the weighted median as shown in eq 6 6 h x final inf y y t h t x log 1 Î² t 1 2 t log 1 Î² t 2 2 3 gradient boosting algorithm the gradient boost algorithm gb is based on minimizing the predicted target residuals using a gradient descent algorithm let x 1 x n d and t be the number of estimators the algorithm starts with an initial guess f 0 x by taking the derivative of the loss function Î³ i 1 n l where l 0 5 y i Î³ 2 25 the observation residuals were calculated using eq 7 7 r i t l y i f x i f x i f x f t 1 x 1 2 y i f t 1 x i 2 f t 1 y i f t 1 x i 0 the regression tree was trained to predict the observation residuals using Î³ j t 1 n x i r i j j r i t the newly predicted value is used to update the previously calculated target predictions by introducing a learning rate to suppress overfitting as shown in eq 8 where Î± is the learning rate 8 f t x f t 1 x Î± j 1 j Î³ j t x r j t the process continues until the selected number of trees is reached or the residuals are not reduced further the final algorithm solution is the solution summation of the grown trees f x t 0 t f t x where f x is the incremental final prediction and f t x is the incrementing function for a number of t trees 2 2 4 extreme gradient boosting algorithm extreme gradient boosting xgb is an effective and efficient ensemble decision tree based algorithm based on the gradient boosting algorithm 26 the algorithm aims to minimize the regularized equation shown in eq 9 9 l i 1 n l y i y i Î³t 1 2 Î» Ï j 2 where l y i y i is the regression loss function and equals 0 5 y i Î³ 2 Î³ is the model complexity penalizing term t is the number of terminal nodes Î» is the regularization parameter and Ï j is the node j prediction value a greedy algorithm starts with a single leaf assuming an initial prediction 26 this was followed by fitting the xgboost regression tree growing an xgboost regression tree begins by creating recursive stump trees over potential split candidates to determine the root node rule corresponding to the highest splitting gain each stump tree evaluates an xgboost regression tree root node potential split candidate by starting the stump tree with a root node that contains all observations next the split loss reduction is calculated for each branch root and child node using eq 10 where g i and h i are the loss functions of the first and second order gradients respectively 10 l split 1 2 i i l n g i 2 i i l n h i Î» i i r n g i 2 i i r n h i Î» i root n g i 2 i root n h i Î» Î³ once the highest split loss reduction is retained the related splitting candidate is chosen to be the xgboost regression tree root node splitting rule and the observations are divided accordingly the observations retained in a terminal node cannot be divided further the algorithm continues to determine each branch splitting rule until it reaches the maximum number of trees or node splitting the final prediction is given by eq 11 where Îµ is the learning rate 11 Ï j Ï j m t Îµ j 1 j Ï j m x r j m 2 3 model performance evaluation each model was trained on several algorithms its prediction performance was assessed and it was subjected to different hyperparameter tuning cases the algorithm performance was evaluated based on the coefficient of determination r2 and mae metrics shown in eqs 12 and 13 respectively in addition k fold cross validation was performed 12 r 2 i 1 n x i x i y i y i i 1 n x i x i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 2 13 mae i 1 n y i x i n dataset splitting into training validation and testing datasets along with k fold cross validation were used to validate the model performance the k fold cross validation is preferred over a single validation split set because it enables training and testing of the developed tuned model on several train test splits such validation provides a better evaluation of the model performance than having one validation set hence sampling bias is minimized in the case of a single validation split 27 the k fold cross validation technique randomly shuffled the dataset it is then split into k folds of approximately equal size in general practice the k value is generally chosen to be five or ten 28 next the ml model was tested k times where each fold was considered a testing dataset and the other k 1 folds were considered the training dataset 29 the average score and standard deviation of model performance were calculated fig 1 demonstrates the k fold cross validation methodology 3 data analysis 3 1 plant description the madinat salman wwtp is a 40 000 m3 day capacity plant that can later be expanded to 60 000 m3 day located in north bahrain its construction started in 2015 and was completed in 2018 to serve madinat salman and parts of the northern governorate areas the plant was designed based on the modified ludzack ettinger mle process to produce a tertiary class tse used for irrigation the dataset covers three years and two months of operation containing 1155 daily readings distributed over 38 features each the features were divided into 16 influent features seven aeration stage features and 15 effluent features fig 2 shows an aerial photo of the wwtp tables 1 and 2 shows the dataset feature description and statistics respectively fig a 3 in the supplementary material shows the dataset visualization the treatment processes in the madinat salman plant operates following a non intelligent fixed setpoints to control the treatment operations the current operation processes assume receiving the ultimate influent loading that the plant was designed based on which is not the case table 3 compares the treatment process parameters with the average influent load received in the plant the plant s actual influent load is below the treatment capacity by a minimum of 12 in the worst case scenario which occurred during approximately three years of plant operation where a variety of influent loading and weather condition scenarios occurred air blowers mixers and chemical injectors operate under suboptimal conditions leading to unnecessary energy consumption and unjustified costs as a result there is a high potential for energy saving and cost reduction 3 2 data preprocessing the madinat salman dataset did not have null values or categorical data several feature combinations were selected for the modeling stage the feature selection shown in table 4 was based on features that greatly influence the do requirement in practice the features were normalized since they were on different scales a correlation coefficient matrix was developed for influent features it shows a high positive correlation coefficient between several influent features total suspended solids tss and chemical oxygen demand cod cod and bod5 and ammonia nh3 and tn the dataset was divided into 70 10 and 20 training validation and testing respectively hence there were 808 116 and 231 training validation and testing data points respectively machine learning models were then developed and the hyperparameters were tuned using the validation dataset finally the performance of the models was verified using the testing dataset and validated using k fold cross validation and the model performance metrics described in section 2 3 fig 3 shows the correlation coefficient matrix fig a 4 of supplementary material shows the modeling workflow 4 results and discussion 4 1 influent bod5 prediction the modeling results showed that feature combination b1 consisting of conductivity nh3 and tn performed the worst in predicting influent bod5 the maximum testing results by the b1 feature combination were obtained using the gb algorithm scoring only 0 40 r2 and 22 71 mae in contrast the other feature combinations b2 to b5 achieved excellent performance the best influent bod5 testing prediction results were obtained using the feature combination b3 and rf algorithm scoring 0 92 r2 and 6 72 mae the algorithm hyperparameters were tuned using the validation dataset to avoid overfitting and underfitting the model had a minimum sample split of 47 a maximum tree depth of 30 and 30 ensemble trees as shown in table 5 and fig 4 by observing the training validation and testing as well as mae results shown in tables 6 7 and 8 for the model mentioned above it can be concluded that no overfitting or underfitting exists in the model in terms of algorithms rf performed the best compared to other algorithms although gb had a slightly better testing coefficient of determination than the rf results the mae of the testing dataset was higher than that of rf despite the tss feature has a correlation coefficient of 0 9 with bod5 it did not improve the model performance results when combined with the cod feature in feature combination b5 the model performance deteriorated slightly in the gb and xgb algorithms compared with the feature combination models b3 and b4 using the same algorithms tables 5 6 7 and 8 summarize the modeling results with the accurate and prompt bod5 prediction results obtained above a new ml model was trained to predict the optimum do requirement for biological treatment the ground truth optimum do values of the ml model were calculated using the equations illustrated in section 2 1 4 2 optimum do concentration prediction modeling results showed that feature combinations d1 d3 and d6 achieved low performance in predicting the optimum do concentration in contrast the feature combinations d2 d4 and d5 achieved excellent prediction results the results showed that the flow feature had the greatest influence on improving the results it can be observed that the feature combinations that did not have the flow as input performed the worst its inclusion almost doubles the coefficient of determination the rf models achieved excellent performance as listed in tables 6 7 and 8 feature combinations d2 and d4 achieved the maximum results scoring 1 00 r2 and 0 01 mae in training validation and testing respectively feature combination d4 performance was achieved by tuning the rf hyperparameters to 11 trees a maximum tree depth of 11 and a minimum node sample split of 11 the hyperparameter tuning results are shown in fig 5 conversely the feature combination d5 score is not significantly different from that of the previous models it scored 0 99 r2 and 0 03 mae although the adb algorithm showed excellent results it was negligibly lower than that of the rf algorithm meanwhile the gb algorithm restored high performance achieving maximum results unlike the adb models the performance of feature combinations d1 and d3 was slightly improved nevertheless they did not achieve rf performance in terms of mae on the contrary the combination d4 achieved the maximum results scoring 1 00 r2 and 0 01 mae matching the rf algorithm s best model performance tables 5 6 7 8 and fig 5 show that combination d4 results were achieved using 38 trees hyperparameter tuning shows that overfitting and underfitting behaviors do not influence the model predictions feature combination d4 is recommended for the optimum do prediction model because the optimum do is directly related to flow measurement mixed liquor suspended solids mlss bod5 and tn any change in these input features directly affects the required oxygen concentration thus to develop a robust model all these features are fundamental for accurately predicting the optimum do concentration 4 3 results summary and discussion all the algorithm modeling results achieved excellent performance in predicting the optimum do requirement the algorithms agreed on the best input feature combination to use flow mlss bod5 and tn the rf and gb algorithms had the best results scoring 1 00 r2 and 0 01 mae respectively table 9 summarizes the best model performances obtained the performances of the rf and gb best models were validated again using k fold cross validation the dataset was divided into ten folds with shuffling which were used for validation each fold had 116 observations and was tested against k 1 folds in other words ten combinations of 116 observations were tested against nine combinations of 1039 observations used for model training the k fold testing results in table 9 validate and confirm the modeling results the influent bod5 prediction model scored 0 94 r2 and 0 01 standard deviation similarly rf and gb optimum do models scored 1 00 r2 with a standard deviation of 0 01 and zero respectively against ten different testing data combinations hence the results confirm the robustness of the models in predicting the influent bod5 and optimum do requirement for biological treatment processes however using the optimum do requirement predictions as it is not recommended from practical and operational point of view this is because nitrification denitrification and bod removal bacteria require specific environmental conditions to be satisfied in addition air blowers with continuous real time changes in their settings may cause damage for instance metcalf and eddy 4 stated that do concentration should be maintained at 1 5 2 0 mg l nevertheless they added that the do concentration was commonly set at 2 0 mg l although a do concentration of less than 1 0 mg l can save cost and energy it requires larger reactors similarly do concentrations above 2 0 mg l slightly enhanced the nitrification but led to additional operating costs in the other case there was almost no improvement for the values exceeding 4 0 mg l higher do levels than required may adversely impact the treatment process leading to the growth of process disturbing organisms metcalf and eddy 4 highlighted that nitrification requires a minimum do concentration of 0 7 mg l for initiation the heterotrophic bacterial oxidization rate responsible for bod removal was not affected until the do concentration was below 0 20 mg l in contrast denitrifying bacteria only function at do concentrations below 0 20 mg l this could also be related to the filamentous bacteria dominating at deficient do levels reducing sludge settling and quality hence all such factors must be carefully considered while dynamically adjusting the do setpoint to better visualize the current do concentration levels of the madinat salman wwtp fig 6 shows the actual do concentration the predicted optimum do concentration and the difference between them highlighted in green representing the possible energy savings based on the above prediction results and operational constraints several setpoint levels are recommended at 0 25 mg l intervals the minimum do concentration level was 1 5 mg l furthermore to suppress the treated effluent quality violation risks and ensure redundancy in supplying sufficient oxygen rates during the treatment process and avoid model prediction drifts abnormal influent loading or other factors fluctuating or default impacting the treatment process such as return activated sludge or waste activated sludge the above modeling was trained to include a safety factor of 1 2 therefore neither the predicted do amount is less than the required to lead to biological treatment failures nor is it at the edge that it cannot accommodate any unforeseen incidents nor is the provided do amount much more than required leading to sludge floating or growth of treatment disturbing organisms or waste of energy the analysis revealed that an average of 23 energy and cost savings could be realized without violating effluent quality the results obtained agree with the findings of wang et al 12 and asadi et al 5 this modeling methodology ensures that the effluent quality meets the requirements because the calculated ground truth optimum do for model training already incorporates the required effluent quality parameters for instance the no x formula requires an effluent nh4 n concentration p x bio biomass wasted requires effluent substrate concentration s which represents the cod bod both values are inputs to eqs 2 and 3 accordingly the ml model was already trained to predict the optimum do value with respect to the required effluent quality limits fig 7 shows the recommended operational optimum do concentration setpoint highlighting the resulting energy and cost savings it can be observed that the model recommends 1 5 mg l for most days at the influent loading peaks the do setpoint increases to 1 75 mg l or even 2 0 mg l a week was extracted from the dataset to better visualize the adaptive do setpoints fig 8 shows how the adaptive do setpoint was controlled by comparing it with the predicted optimum do concentration such a control can be performed several times throughout the day for instance in sbr wwtps the do setpoint can be adjusted for each treatment cycle alternatively the do setpoint can be changed once a day in the mle wwtp such as madinat salman wwtp based on the above automation and intelligence are achieved using sensors that provide real time readings as input for the developed ml models to dynamically predict and adjust to the treatment processes without human intervention hence it enables an intelligent wwtp operation and management approach that optimizes energy and resources similarly quality assurance and risk management are achieved by having an intelligent model that dynamically adapts to the fluctuating influent loading to better control the treatment processes rather than a static control approach following a non intelligent static do setpoint might not always work as shown in fig 8 hence an intelligent model that dynamically adjust to the treatment processes with accounting for a safety factor in air injection to suppress the impact of abnormal loading or treatment default enables the proper management of the effluent default risks while ensuring effluent quality 5 conclusion a substantial amount of energy and money is wasted because most wwtp worldwide operate at fixed do setpoints as such the current operating policy cannot be followed especially given the rapid increase in population scarcity of financial resources and fluctuations in fuel prices this paper presents an automated intelligent framework for optimizing the operation of air blowers in wwtp aeration tanks based on real time influent bod5 predictions the proposed do optimization model can be deployed in an integrated framework of remote sensing and ml to dynamically adjust the wwtp aeration tank do concentration setpoints facilitating the realization of intelligent wwtps the merits of the proposed framework can be further maximized by extending it to cover other air blower applications in wwtp such as aerobic digester tanks to gain the maximum benefit of reducing energy consumption and operational costs in addition it can be generalized to various wwtp types the proposed optimization achieves an energy

12783,the search for a simple affordable and rapid separation method for oil water mixtures is one of the most serious challenges that the world is facing today superhydrophobic or superoleophilic materials and surfaces are promising choices for these types of separations in the present study a high speed gravity driven oil water separation method has been realized by using pre wetting of river sand sea sand and desert sand the superoleophobicity properties of these pre wetted sand materials have been found to be good with a maximum oil contact angle of about 141 1 for desert sand and a minimum oil contact angel of 113 8 for sea sand also the relationship between the porosity of the respective sand type and the water phase separation rate was for the first time obtained by using the lbm shan chen model and micro ct characterization as a result of a simple particle size screening the highest kerosene water separation rate for sea sand was 24 3 2 4 mm s in fact this is the highest oil water separation rate that has ever been achieved for a sand material in addition to the effect of sand particle size other factors affecting the rate of oil water separation such as number of separation cycles thickness of sand layer temperature ph value salt concentration and different oil water mixtures have also been investigated keywords pre wetting superoleophobicity sand separation rate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years the living environment for aquatic organisms and mankind have become severely affected by offshore oil spills and oil containing wastewater originating from both the industry and daily life 1 3 methods like gravity sedimentation 4 adsorption separation 5 biodegradation 6 in situ combustion 7 and chemical dispersant degradation 8 have been used for the traditional separation of these oil water mixtures however these methods are both time consuming and have quite complex operation problems special wettability materials with high separation rates have been used in trying to solve these problems for instance water blocking materials 9 12 with superhydrophobic or superoleophilic properties have been used to filter or adsorb oil from the oil water mixtures oil blocking materials are superhydrophilic 13 or superoleophobic in water 14 which allow water to pass quickly over the surface there are also smart materials 15 17 that can switch their wettability for oil water separation in response to the environmental ph value heat and light a lot of progress has thereby been made in the search for separation methods and materials with specific wettability properties however low flux complex manufacturing methods and high costs still restrict the large scale application of these materials it is therefore a big challenge to develop a simple affordable and reusable method for the separation of oil water mixtures desert sand with natural superhydrophilic and superoleophobic in water properties has in recent years been presented for oil water separation 18 19 the desert sand has environmentally friendly properties in addition to a very low cost production it has therefore been used for large scale applications in the field of oil water separation moreover surface modification technologies are expected to change the wettability of desert sand for example sun et al 20 prepared a highly hydrophobic sand material by coating with polydimethylsiloxane pdms and polymethylmethacrylate pmma in one step furthermore wang et al 21 prepared superhydrophobic sand by grafting the sand surface with 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane ptes this superhydrophobic sand was used to separate both surfactant free and surfactant stabilized water in oil emulsions moreover the formation of nanostructures on the desert sand surface has also attracted a lot of attention liu et al 22 treated the raw sand surface with nano sio2 which was followed by the modification with hexadecyltrimethoxysilane to obtain a superhydrophobic sand the water contact angle was then increased to 158 and this superhydrophobic sand could be used for oil water separation with an exception of chemical modification other methods have also been used for surface modification kerosene combustion was used to create a nano micro soot deposition on the surface of sand 23 a highly hydrophobic sand surface with a water contact angle of 134 5 was then obtained for an oil water mixture surprisingly liu et al 19 used raw desert sand to absorb and separate water from a water in oil emulsion they used a simple washing and drying process without any chemical treatment notably the oil water separation rate was still high even though the sand layer gap was larger than the emulsion particle size methods types of wettability driving forces fluxes as well as advantages and disadvantages with oil water separation based on desert sand is summarized in table s1 in supplementary information in previous studies changeable or switchable wettabilities 24 25 of desert sand as obtained by surface modification or nanostructure fabrication has proven to be one effective way to improve the separation efficiency however the complicated chemistry reagent process or manufacturing process still limits the applications of desert sand for oil water separation more importantly the oil water separation efficiency by using desert sand is far from the efficiency obtained by using metal mesh 26 pwnf membrane 14 and other non woven fabrics 27 in fact the separation rate of these latter materials is generally ten times higher than that of sand therefore to find a simple and high speed separation method based on sand is still of largest interest for the researchers in the field a simple large scale low cost and high speed gravity driven oil water separation method has here been developed by using pre wetting of sand the principle of oil water separation and the relationship between the porosity of the sand layer and the water phase separation rate have been determined by using the lbm shan chen model and micro ct characterization in addition the effect of key factors such as sand particle size number of oil water separation cycles sand layer thickness temperature ph value salt concentration and different oil water mixtures have been explored with the purpose to establish the usefulness of sand more precisely the separation ability of river sand sea sand and desert sand have been investigated and compared the results from the present study are thereby expected to contribute to the development of a simple efficient and reusable oil water separation method for future applications harsh conditions 2 experimental section 2 1 materials kerosene has been purchased from maoming runhua petrochemical co ltd maoming china and deionized di water was purchased from guangzhou golden leaf health technology co ltd guangzhou china moreover oil red o dye was purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china furthermore industrial water based pigments were directly obtained from shenzhen jinfuyuan pigment technology co ltd shenzhen china moreover paraffin oil was supplied by lircin medical technology inc dezhou china and peanut oil and sesame oil were purchased from yihai kerry oils grains foodstuffs industries co ltd guangzhou china all chemicals were used directly without further purification the stainless steel used for sieving was purchased online from changzhou laikou metal products co ltd and the river sand sea sand and desert sand were taken from the huai river section of huainan city in china the north sea of china and the alxa desert of china respectively 2 2 sand characterization helium ion beam microscopy him carl zeiss orion nanofab and field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem jsm 7900f equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer edax ltd octane elect super were used in the analyzes of the morphology and composition of the sand materials prior to characterization the three different types of sands were after cleaning and drying added to the surface of a conductive glue the samples that were used for fesem characterization were also coated with a thin layer of au by using evaporation to improve the surface image moreover an electron flood gun was mounted in the him it was used for charge neutralization to provide high contrast images of insulating samples with a high level of surface details 28 the operating voltage of him and fesem was 30 kv and 10 kv respectively the three dimensional structures of the sand materials were characterized by using a micro ct system sanying precision instruments co ltd nanovoxel 3000d the sand samples were then after cleaning and drying sealed into a transparent tube of 7 mm in diameter the tubes were thereafter positioned horizontally on the scanning table and the scanning parameters were set as follows the applied voltage current exposure time image merging frame number and resolution of the scanning system was set to 90 kv 40 Î¼a 0 8 s 2 and 4 Î¼m respectively each of the tubes was rotated 360 during scanning with an increment of 0 25 the rotation axis was perpendicular to the scanning table finally 3d models of the different sand materials were constructed by using projection images from the scans at different rotation angles moreover the avizo software was used to analyze the microchannel size and porosity in the tomographic image of each sample the contact angle of oil under water was measured by using a contact angle measurement instrument ningbo nb scientific instruments co ltd osa200s t and a home made device as shown in fig s1 in supporting information the detailed measurement process is presented in section 2 supplementary information 2 3 oil water separation experiment a home made oil water separation device was constructed which should be used for the oil water separation experiment an upper separation pipe waterproof gasket 150 mesh steel net waterproof gasket and a lower separation pipe were put together to form the final device as shown in fig 1a b the typical gravity driven oil water separation process is schematically presented in fig 1b c a 6 mm layer of sand was placed on top of the steel net this sand layer obtained an oleophobic property after prewetting with di water as the next step a mixture of 4 ml kerosene and 4 ml water was slowly poured into the upper separation of the device the separation of the solution was gravity driven in that the water in the solution passed through the sand layer while kerosene was sustained in the sand layer the separation time was recorded from the start of the water dripping in the lower separation tube until it completely stopped each experiment was repeated three times and an average value was obtained furthermore the oil water separation processes were also documented by using digital images and videos and they were found to be similar to the results in our previous work 14 as the next step in the experiment sand layer thickness and temperature were varied according to some pre set values finally the oil water separation rate was calculated by using the unit volume flow velocity equation 1 v v at where v is the oil water separation rate v is the unit volume of the liquid that has passed through the sand layer t is the time it takes for a unit volume to pass the sand layer and a is the sectional area of the sand layer in the gravity driven oil water separation test v 4 ml and a 19 625 mm2 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and eds characterization of sand prior to the oil water experiment dry river sand sea sand and desert sand were sieved by using steel meshes of different size 150 120 meshes 120 100 meshes 80 60 meshes and 40 30 meshes the sand samples were thereafter divided into 4 groups depending on sand particle size 0 11 mm 0 15 mm for group a 0 15 mm 0 18 mm for group b 0 25 mm 0 35 mm for group c and 0 52 mm 0 7 mm for group d unfortunately desert sand particles with a diameter between 0 52 mm and 0 7 mm could not be found it is clear from the sem images fig 2 and him images fig 8 that the particle size distribution of the three types of sand material became relatively uniform after sieving in addition the surface of the desert sand was much smoother than those of the river sand and sea sand also the surface roughness of the river sand and sea sand was close to that of the modified desert sand 20 25 this means that the river sand and sea sand can be used for oil water separation furthermore difference in sand surface morphology will have a direct effect on the difference in bearing capacity of the water films which in turn will affect the difference in oil water separation ability energy dispersive spectrometry eds has revealed that the main component of sand is silicon dioxide see fig 2b d f all sand samples did also contain a variety of metallic elements 23 see table s2 in supplementary information section s3 silicon dioxide and metals have generally a high surface free energy 19 in addition the surfaces of the sand particles contain a lot of adsorbed oh groups 19 thus the sand surfaces show very good hydrophilic properties 19 furthermore the micro ct characterization showed tiny gaps between the sand particles see figs 4 and s4 in supporting information those micro sized gaps are formed when sand particles are stacked and can be used as water passage channels a water film is expected to fill these gaps upon pre wetting in short the morphologies and the results from the eds characterization have shown that it is possible to create an oil water separation setup only by using pre wetting of the river sand sea sand and desert sand 3 2 principle of oil water separation kerosene and sea sand were especially chosen in studying the effect of sand pre wetting on the oil water separation as can be seen in figs 2a c e and 3a microchannels were formed when the sea sand particles were stacked furthermore a water film was formed on the surface of the sand particles as a result of pre wetting after the addition of kerosene an approximate spherical oil water contact was formed between the sand particles where the sphere center was facing the oil phase see fig 3b due to the oil water interfacial tension the spherical surface has the tendency to form the most stable shape with the smallest interfacial area consequently the oil water interfacial tension generates a force f Î³ directed upwards in our experiment and toward the oil phase thereby preventing the oil phase from passing through the microchannels between the sea sand particles when all water in the mixture has passed through the microchannels the water film on the surface of the sea sand particles together with the water in the microchannels between the sand particles will prevent any oil immersion as shown in fig 3c the pressure generated by the oil water interfacial tension and the maximum oil water mixture height can be obtained from the young laplace equation 14 29 2 p 2 Î³ o w r 4 Î³ o w cos Î¸ ca d Ï oil gh where Î´p is the pressure generated by the oil water interfacial tension Î³ o w r is the equivalent radius of the oil water interface Î¸ ca is the oil contact angle for the wetted sand layer in water d is the equivalent diameter of the microchannel Ï oil is the kerosene density g is the acceleration due to gravity and h is the maximum separation height the interface can sustain as can be understood from eq 2 Î´p is proportional to cos Î¸ ca and d furthermore cos Î¸ ca is determined by the natural properties of sand also d is determined by the size of the sand particles after sieving the micro ct characterizations did also confirm that the size of the microchannels were different for different sizes of the sand particles see figs 4 and s4 in supporting information 3 3 simulation of oil water separation to study the relationship between the microchannels in sand and the oil water separation rate a 5 mm thick sea sand layer with sand particle sizes in the range 0 25 mm to 0 35 mm was scanned by using micro ct characterization thereby building a 3d model cross sectional and vertical images of the sea sand layer are shown in fig 4b and c respectively the results from the micro ct characterization of river sand and desert sand are shown in figs s3 and s4 respectively in supporting information furthermore the distribution of microchannel sizes in the sea sand layer is presented in fig 4d about 73 of the microchannel sizes in stacked sea sand was found to be in the range 10 Î¼m to 100 Î¼m finally a 3d model of sea sand was constructed by using the avizo software in simulating the oil water separation the 3d model was thereafter transformed by using the multiphase flow lattice boltzmann method a multiphase flow system consisting of sea sand kerosene and water can be described by using the lbm shan chen model 30 32 a discrete form of the single relaxation d2q9 pattern is then used in the simulations and the evolution equation of the distribution function is presented below 3 f i Ï x e i Î´ t t Î´ t f i Ï x t 1 Ï Ï f i Ï x t f i Ï eq x t where f i x t is the distribution function of particles at position in x space at time t and for velocity i i 0 1 2 8 furthermore Ï represents the different components in the system Î´t is the time step e i is the migration velocity of particle i in the grid Ï is the dimensionless relaxation time and f i Ï eq is the equilibrium distribution function for particle i this distribution function can be expressed with the following equation 4 f i Ï eq x t Ï i Ï Ï x t 1 e i u x t c s 2 e i u x t 2 2 c s 4 u x t 2 2 c s 2 the density and velocity of the fluid on the macro scale is expressed in eqs 4 and 5 respectively 5 Ï Ï x t i f i x t 6 u Ï x t u x t Ï Ï f Ï x t Ï Ï x t where u x t is the mixing velocity and f Ï x t is the force exerted on the fluid the mixing velocity can be calculated by using the following equation 7 u x t Ï i f i Ï x t e i Ï Ï Ï i f i Ï x t Ï Ï moreover the force on the fluid consists of three parts i interaction forces between fluid particles in the same component ii interaction forces between fluid particles in different components and iii forces between the solid phase and the fluid the interaction forces between fluid particles in the same component can be expressed as 8 f c x t g c Ï Ï Ï x t i Ï i Ï Ï x e i Î´ t t e i where g c Ï is the interaction coefficient between the fluid particles in the same component and Ï Ï is the effective density of component Ï the latter expression represents the function of the macroscopic density of component Ï and is here expressed as Ï Ï x t 1 exp Ï x t the following equation describes the interactions between fluid particles in different components 9 f c Ï x t g c Ï Ï Ï Ï x t i Ï i Ï Ï x e i Î´ t t e i where Ï and Ï represents two different components and g c Ï Ï is the interaction coefficient between fluid particles in different components finally the interaction between the solid phase and the fluid can be expressed as 10 f ads Ï x t g ads Ï Ï Ï x t i Ï i s x e i Î´ t t e i where g ads Ï is the coefficient describing the fluid solid interaction the simulations were carried out by using a dimensionless acceleration of 0 00012 a contact angle of 130 48 and a two dimensional grid of n x n y 600 300 moreover the upper and lower boundaries were of no slip conditions and the left and right boundaries where of periodic boundary conditions in addition the acceleration direction was to the right the sand particles were simply added to form circles and the positions and particle sizes were randomly generated in this calculation area as can be seen in fig 5 density distributions with a porosity of 54 95 59 96 65 14 and 70 18 for an iteration number of 80 000 were then obtained the results show that the water phase was relatively dispersed for a small sand porosity moreover the water phase and oil phase were interlaced while separated into many droplets by the dense sand particles however the situation for a larger sand porosity was different the flow obstruction was then smaller each phase had a larger tendency to gather to form larger fluids furthermore the corresponding separation rates of the oil water mixture can be seen in fig 6 i e for the different sand porosities and an iteration number of 60 000 the oil water phase separation occurred in the first 10 000 iterations but with a largely fluctuating separation rate the important oil water two phase flow could thus be observed after the phase separation for a small sand porosity the flow rate of the water phase was higher than that of the oil phase whereas the overall flow rate was close to that of the water phase as a matter of fact the oil phase flow was close to zero and sometimes even negative consequently the water phase could pass through the sand while the oil phase was blocked thereby achieving a good separation on the other hand the flow rates of the water phase and the oil phase were quite similar for a large sand porosity with a resulting smaller separation effect consequently the overall flow rate was a superposition of the flow rates of the two phases oil and water the average separation rates i e over time as a function of sand porosity is shown in fig 7 it s clear that oil water separation rates have decreased with a decrease in sand porosity and that the water phase flow rate has gradually exceeded the one for the oil phase i e when going from a sand porosity of approximately 55 to approximately 60 thus the flow rates of the two phases were dominated by the water phase the water phase flow rate reached a maximum at 59 96 where the oil phase flow rate was found to be negative i e the oil flow rate was in the opposite direction 3 4 gravity driven oil water separation measured oil contact angles for sand layers in water is shown in fig 8a it is then clear that all sand materials showed superoleophobicity properties when placed in water more specifically the oil contact angle was larger for the desert sand than for the other two sand materials in fact the oil contact angle of sea sand was the smallest one the maximum oil contact angle was about 141 1 for desert sand and the minimum one was about 113 8 for sea sand the interesting thing here is that the span between the maximum and minimum oil contact angle was equal to 27 3 this means that it is possible to obtain different oil water separation rates by simply classifying the sand with type and particle size according to eq 1 the separation rates of the kerosene water mixtures for four groups with different particle sizes of river sand were higher than 1 7 0 1 mm s more specifically the separation rate of the river sand with a particle size in the region 0 52 mm to 0 7 mm was as high as 20 3 1 0 mm s for the sea sand and desert sand materials the lowest kerosene water separation rates were 1 9 0 1 mm s and 0 99 0 02 mm s respectively the most interesting result was the observation of a maximum kerosene water separation rate of 24 3 2 4 mm s for group d of sea sand which is 20 times higher than the separation rate for desert sand in a previous study 18 a comparison between the results obtained in the present study with the ones in a previous study is summarized in table s1 in supporting information it is clear that the separation rates of most sand layers were higher than those reported earlier thus the river sand sea sand and desert sand are all suitable for a rapid oil water separation this is especially the situation for group d of sea sand and river sand the results are shown in fig 8a which also reveals that the oil water separation rate of the sand layer has a positive correlation with the size of the sand particles thus the kerosene water separation rate was observed to increase with an increase in sand particle size in fact the relationship between separation rate and sand particle size can be calculated by using the hagen poiseuille equation 33 11 j ÎµÏ r p 2 p 8 Î¼l where j is the flow of water at the separation Îµ is the sand porosity r p is the pore radius p is the pressure drop Î¼ is the viscosity of the oil and l is the effective filtration distance according to eq 11 the water flow is proportional to the surface porosity Îµ and the square of the pore radius r p 2 to investigate the size dependency of the separation ratio the sand particle sizes and positions of four groups of river sand sea sand and desert sand were determined by using micro ct characterization the area of equivalent pores of each sand layer was then calculated by using the avizo software this area is to be regarded as an approximation of a circle area and the circle area can be calculated by using the following equation 12 r s Ï where s is the equivalent pore area and r is the equivalent pore radius thus the porosity of the sand is equal to the ratio of the pore volume to the total volume of the sand layer the results in fig 9a show that the r values of the a b c and d groups of the river sand were 0 099 0 004 mm 0 267 0 021 mm 0 419 0 037 mm and 0 810 0 081 mm respectively moreover the r values of the sea sand were 0 095 0 004 mm 0 221 0 023 mm 0 469 0 033 mm and 0 902 0 071 mm respectively and the r values of the desert sand were 0 074 0 002 mm 0 169 0 019 mm and 0 404 0 034 mm respectively as shown in fig 9 b the porosity of the river sand material in groups a b c and d groups were 39 76 2 15 44 23 3 03 41 07 3 33 and 39 55 1 96 respectively furthermore the porosity of the sea sand were 43 67 2 35 59 83 3 23 42 92 3 13 and 39 82 2 03 respectively and the porosity of the desert sand were 44 89 2 15 48 22 3 13 and 35 36 2 33 respectively thus the pore radius of the sand materials decreased with an increase in sand particle size however the equivalent radius showed a different trend according to the hagen poiseuille equation the water flow was directly proportional to the sand surface porosity Îµ and to the square of the pore radius r p 2 it can then be understood that large particle sizes of sand will increase the separation rates this conclusion is in agreement with the results of the kerosene water separation experiment in the present study moreover the separation rates for the river sand sea sand and desert sand were observed to slightly decrease within each group i e a b c and d this is demonstrated in the movies s1 s3 in the supporting information this phenomenon can be explained by the variation in equivalent pore radius for sand particles with the same particle size as shown in fig 8a the separation rate decreased when going from the river sand to the sea sand and further on to the desert sand however in group d the separation rate for the sea sand was 24 3 2 4 mm s which was 4 17 mm s higher than the value for the river sand this change in order can be explained by the fact that the pore radius of sea sand was 0 902 0 07 mm which was 0 09 mm larger than the pore radius of river sand see fig 9a moreover the separation rates for the river sand sea sand and desert sand were observed to slightly decrease within each group i e a b c and d this is demonstrated in the movies s1 s3 in the supporting information this phenomenon can be explained by the variation in equivalent pore radius for sand particles with the same particle size as shown in fig 8a the separation rate decreased when going from the river sand to the sea sand and further on to the desert sand however in group d the separation rate for the sea sand was 24 3 2 4 mm s which was 4 17 mm s higher than the value for the river sand this change in order can be explained by the fact that the pore radius of sea sand was 0 902 0 07 mm which was 0 09 mm larger than the pore radius of river sand see fig 9a 3 5 oil water separation ability of sand in order to explore the reusability and separation ability of river sand sea sand and desert sand for oil water mixtures under different environmental conditions the influence of number of separation cycles sand layer thickness salt concentration ph value temperature and other conditions have also be investigated and will be presented below 3 5 1 influence of the number of oil water separation cycles cycle experiments was set up to investigate the stability of river sand sea sand and desert sand the separation of the kerosene water mixture was repeated 40 times at room temperature and the thickness of the sand layer in all experiments was 6 mm after the first separation 4 ml of water was slowly injected into the upper separation pipe to form a kerosene water mixture for the next separation cycle the results in fig 10a c illustrate a very interesting phenomenon the separation rate of the river sand and the sea sand for a particle size in the region 0 7 mm to 0 52 mm did significant decline with number of cycles in fact the separation ratios of those two types of sand dropped by 48 and 23 respectively however the separation ratios for all three types of sand were well maintained by 90 of the initial separation rate after 40 times of cycling in other groups i e for other particle sizes surprisingly the separation rate of the sand layers with particle sizes in the ranges 0 15 mm 0 18 mm and 0 11 mm 0 15 mm did not change at all as comparable with other wettability materials such as nio ni mesh 34 and highly hydrophobic sand 35 this extremely stable result proves that the river sand sea sand and desert sand still have good reusability properties while highly resistant to fouling by oil to explore the underlying reasons to the reduction in separation rate for group d the separation process for different particle sizes of sea sand 0 11 mm 0 15 mm and 0 25 mm 0 35 mm have been recorded by using an apple iphone11 as can be seen in fig 10d some dyed kerosene was observed to still adhere to the surface of the small sized sand particles after the separation of the kerosene water mixture a significant pollution of the sea sand by kerosene can also be seen in fig 10b furthermore the results from the ct characterization in fig 9 show that the equivalent pore radius in a sand layer of large particle size was about 4 times larger than the equivalent pore radius for a sand layer of small particle size thus the small sized dyed kerosene can be trapped in a sand layer with large microchannels this phenomenon became even more pronounced when increasing the cycling times which is an observation that was also made in our previous work concerning the pwnf separation membrane 14 for sand materials with smaller sand particles the smaller size of the water films showed an improved resistance against the added water oil mixture as can be seen in fig 4d the height of the kerosene which is maintained by the small size of the water films was also found to be larger than the height of the kerosene for larger sizes of the water film i e formed on the surface of larger sand particles thus the dyed kerosene had difficulties to penetrate sand materials with small particle sizes thus the smaller sand particles showed an improved stability for oil water separation 3 5 2 influence of sand layer thickness the thickness of the sand layer was in this experiment set to 6 mm 7 mm 8 mm 9 mm and 10 mm the results demonstrated in fig 11a c show that the separation rates of the river sand sea sand and desert sand of different particle sizes decreased with an increase in layer thickness this phenomenon can be explained by the filling height of the quartz sand and the flux 36 that is the effective penetration distance gradually increased with an increase in sand thickness which resulted in a gradual decrease in flux 36 more precisely the separation rates of river sand and sea sand of size 0 52 mm 0 7 mm decreased faster than the other groups of sand with 23 and 31 respectively the separation rates of river sand sea sand and desert sand in groups a b and c was decreased by about 20 15 and 10 respectively the relationship between sand layer thickness and oil water separation rate can also be expressed by using the hagen poiseuille equation the effective filtration depth in the sand layer will increase with an increase in sand layer thickness according to eq 11 the flow of water at separation j is inversely proportional to the effective filtration distance l when the thickness of the river sand with a particle size of 0 52 mm 0 7 mm increases from 6 mm to 10 mm it increases by a factor of 1 67 consequently the water flow decreases by a factor of 1 67 according to the inverse relationship in eq 11 this is the reason why the water flow decreased with an increase in sand layer thickness in the separation process moreover the separation rate for the same type of sand was found to decrease with different ratios for an increase in sand layer thickness it is clear that this decline was more rapid for an increased particle size this phenomenon can be explained by the water film area for different sizes of sand particles the equivalent pore radius r of sand with particles in the range 0 52 mm 0 7 mm was about 3 times that large as that of sand with particles in the range 0 25 mm 0 35 mm in addition the water flow was about 7 times that large according to eq 11 consequently the separation rate was found to increase for an increase in particle size 3 5 3 influence of ph values on the separation rates sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl were used in the preparation of aqueous solutions with ph values 1 4 7 9 and 13 the detailed preparation process of the solutions is presented in section 5 in the supplementary information these solutions were thereafter used in studying the effect of ph values on the separation ability of the sand materials as can be seen in fig 11d f the separation rate of kerosene water mixtures at different ph values was found to vary for the different types of sand materials the separation rate of kerosene water was observed to decrease under both acidic and alkaline conditions that is the maximum separation rate of the solution took place in neutral water moreover the largest decrease in separation rate took place for sand materials with the largest particle size the separation rate for river sand and sea sand decreased by a maximum of 65 and 50 at ph 13 respectively furthermore the separation rate of desert sand decreased by a maximum of 60 at ph 1 it is well known that the main component in silicon oxide is sand and silicon oxide is prone to chemical reactions in both acid and alkaline environments 37 13 si o 2 h 2 o si o 2 o h 14 si o h 2 o si oh o h 15 si oh h 3 o si o h 2 h 2 o it can be concluded from eqs 13 15 that the h or oh ions in acidic or alkaline water solutions will inhibit or react with the adsorbed oh groups on the sand surface these reactions will thereby destroy i e deactivate the oh groups on the sand surface moreover those reactions will change the hydrophilicity of the sand surface which otherwise causes an irregular water film on the sand surface and thereby increases the resistance of the water flow 38 in other words an acidic or alkaline water solution will affect the separation rate of the sand layer although pre wetted sand can separate oil water mixtures in acidic or alkaline environments the stability of oil water separation was decreased slightly than surface modification technology as previous studies 37 38 therefore before using pre wetted sand in the separation of oil from water one must pay attention to the ph value of the water 3 5 4 influence of the temperature in considering the influence of the ambient temperature both during different seasons and at different latitudes in the world the test temperature was set to different values between 0 c and 75 c the minimum temperature was set to 0 c since water will freeze to ice below this temperature which is not suitable for the separation of oil water mixtures moreover the temperature of the liquid to be separated was kept stable at a constant temperature by using a water bath as can be seen in fig 12a c the separation rate for the sea sand layer with a particle size of 0 52 mm 0 7 mm increased from 16 85 0 85 mm s at 0 c to 35 79 2 83 mm s at 75 c by using sea sand with a smaller particle size 0 25 mm 0 35 mm it increased from 3 63 0 08 mm s at 0 c to 15 88 0 73 mm s at 75 c finally by using an even smaller particle size 0 15 mm 0 18 mm the separation rate was found to increase from 2 54 0 17 mm s at 0 c to 6 36 0 35 mm s at 75 c finally the smallest particle size 0 11 mm 0 15 mm resulted in an increase from 1 19 0 05 mm s at 0 c to 3 36 0 16 mm s at 75 c hence the separation rates of all sea sand layers increased 2 times when going from 0 c to 75 c and similar results were also obtained for the river sand and desert sand the results were similar to those obtained in our previous study on pwnf membranes 14 an explanation to these results is that the viscosity of the liquid decreased with an increase in the water temperature the water contact angle was also affected by the temperature 39 the volume flow rate became thereby improved which resulted in an improved oil water separation rate see section s6 in supplementary information for further details this discovery has provided a reference method for improving oil water separation rates in high latitude colder regions 3 5 5 influence of salt solution concentration sodium chloride nacl solutions of different concentrations was used to simulate different water environments and mixtures consisting of kerosene and the nacl solution was used to test the separation ability of the sand the experimental results in fig 12d f show that the separation rates of three types of sand became decreased with an increase in salt concentration furthermore the amplitude of the decrease in separation rate was also increased with the increase in sand size for the sea sand material the separation rates of an oil water mixture including salt were all 60 of the separation rates without any salt for the river sand and dessert sand the presence of salt resulted in 40 75 and 50 60 respectively of the separation rates obtained without any salt in the oil water mixture see fig 12d f moreover the separation rate was slightly decreased for a small size of the sand particles which was similar to the reduction trend for the pwnf membrane in one of our previous works 14 as the liquids passed through the porous medium the separation rate decreased for an increase in liquid viscosity of salt concentrations increasing in addition the liquid viscosity increased with an increase in salt concentration moreover the flow rate became inversely proportional to the viscosity for a constant pressure thus the flow rate decreased with the increase in viscosity when the liquid passed through the sand layer see section s6 in supplementary information for further details these results did also show that the sea sand layer can be used for filtration and separation of oil water mixtures with water from the sea 3 6 separation of other oil water mixtures to test the separation ability of sand layers for different types of oil paraffin oil water mixtures sesame oil water mixtures and peanut oil water mixtures were also included in our separation experiments a sea sand layer was used for these experiments as can be seen in fig 13 the highest separation rate was 25 09 mm s which was obtained for sea sand with a particle size in the range of 0 52 mm to 0 7 mm however the separation rate was still maintained at 94 of the initial separation rate after 5 cycles by comparing the results from cycle 5 with cycle 1 the separation rates of the kerosene water mixture and paraffin oil water mixture were still maintained at 84 of the initial separation rate however the separation rate of both sesame oil water mixture and peanut oil water mixture decreased by 40 furthermore the lowest separation rate was 0 089 0 052 mm s for a sea sand particle size of 0 15 mm to 0 18 mm this separation rate was only 6 of the rate from the 1st cycle this type of separation sand layer was basically a failure for these specific oil water mixtures to find the reason to this failure four mixtures of dyed kerosene paraffin oil sesame oil and peanut oil dyed red with oil red o with undyed water were used for further analysis and observations by recording the image of the sand layers after the 5th separation cycle of the different oil water mixtures it was found that the dyed sesame oil and peanut oil were trapped in the sand layer see fig s5 in supplementary information consequently the trapped oil blocked the microchannels in the sand thereby hindering the flow of water through the sand layer kerosene was basically not trapped by the sand layer so the decrease in kerosene separation rate was not that apparent the results for the sesame oil and peanut oil can be explained by the larger viscosity of these oils as compared with the paraffin oil and kerosene oil 40 41 it was thus easier for the sesame oil and peanut oil to adhere to the surface of the sand particles blocking the microchannels of the sand layer and thus reduce its pore radius and porosity according to eq 11 the flow of water will decrease for a decrease in porosity and pore radius of the separating sand layer 4 conclusion the oil water mixtures were successfully separated by pre wetting the river sand sea sand and desert sand the maximum oil water separation rate was 24 3 2 4 mm s which was obtained for sea sand with a particle size in the range 0 52 mm to 0 7 mm based on the micro ct characterization and the young laplace equation the principle of oil water separation by gravity was well established this was also the situation with the relationship between the porosity of the sand layer and the water flow rate the separation rate of sand layers with particle sizes in the ranges 0 15 mm 0 18 mm and 0 11 mm 0 15 mm were determined with high accuracy moreover the oil water separation rate was observed to decrease with an increase in sand layer thickness for the same type of sand this decline in separation rate was more rapid for an increased particle size furthermore the separation rate was decreased under both acidic and alkaline conditions also the separation rates of all sea sand layers increased by 2 times when going from 0 c to 75 c in summary the use of the here developed efficient and convenient separation method brings promising prospects for the recycling of oil containing industrial wastewater and oil spills the following are the supplementary data related to this article movie s1 video of the

12783,the search for a simple affordable and rapid separation method for oil water mixtures is one of the most serious challenges that the world is facing today superhydrophobic or superoleophilic materials and surfaces are promising choices for these types of separations in the present study a high speed gravity driven oil water separation method has been realized by using pre wetting of river sand sea sand and desert sand the superoleophobicity properties of these pre wetted sand materials have been found to be good with a maximum oil contact angle of about 141 1 for desert sand and a minimum oil contact angel of 113 8 for sea sand also the relationship between the porosity of the respective sand type and the water phase separation rate was for the first time obtained by using the lbm shan chen model and micro ct characterization as a result of a simple particle size screening the highest kerosene water separation rate for sea sand was 24 3 2 4 mm s in fact this is the highest oil water separation rate that has ever been achieved for a sand material in addition to the effect of sand particle size other factors affecting the rate of oil water separation such as number of separation cycles thickness of sand layer temperature ph value salt concentration and different oil water mixtures have also been investigated keywords pre wetting superoleophobicity sand separation rate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years the living environment for aquatic organisms and mankind have become severely affected by offshore oil spills and oil containing wastewater originating from both the industry and daily life 1 3 methods like gravity sedimentation 4 adsorption separation 5 biodegradation 6 in situ combustion 7 and chemical dispersant degradation 8 have been used for the traditional separation of these oil water mixtures however these methods are both time consuming and have quite complex operation problems special wettability materials with high separation rates have been used in trying to solve these problems for instance water blocking materials 9 12 with superhydrophobic or superoleophilic properties have been used to filter or adsorb oil from the oil water mixtures oil blocking materials are superhydrophilic 13 or superoleophobic in water 14 which allow water to pass quickly over the surface there are also smart materials 15 17 that can switch their wettability for oil water separation in response to the environmental ph value heat and light a lot of progress has thereby been made in the search for separation methods and materials with specific wettability properties however low flux complex manufacturing methods and high costs still restrict the large scale application of these materials it is therefore a big challenge to develop a simple affordable and reusable method for the separation of oil water mixtures desert sand with natural superhydrophilic and superoleophobic in water properties has in recent years been presented for oil water separation 18 19 the desert sand has environmentally friendly properties in addition to a very low cost production it has therefore been used for large scale applications in the field of oil water separation moreover surface modification technologies are expected to change the wettability of desert sand for example sun et al 20 prepared a highly hydrophobic sand material by coating with polydimethylsiloxane pdms and polymethylmethacrylate pmma in one step furthermore wang et al 21 prepared superhydrophobic sand by grafting the sand surface with 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane ptes this superhydrophobic sand was used to separate both surfactant free and surfactant stabilized water in oil emulsions moreover the formation of nanostructures on the desert sand surface has also attracted a lot of attention liu et al 22 treated the raw sand surface with nano sio2 which was followed by the modification with hexadecyltrimethoxysilane to obtain a superhydrophobic sand the water contact angle was then increased to 158 and this superhydrophobic sand could be used for oil water separation with an exception of chemical modification other methods have also been used for surface modification kerosene combustion was used to create a nano micro soot deposition on the surface of sand 23 a highly hydrophobic sand surface with a water contact angle of 134 5 was then obtained for an oil water mixture surprisingly liu et al 19 used raw desert sand to absorb and separate water from a water in oil emulsion they used a simple washing and drying process without any chemical treatment notably the oil water separation rate was still high even though the sand layer gap was larger than the emulsion particle size methods types of wettability driving forces fluxes as well as advantages and disadvantages with oil water separation based on desert sand is summarized in table s1 in supplementary information in previous studies changeable or switchable wettabilities 24 25 of desert sand as obtained by surface modification or nanostructure fabrication has proven to be one effective way to improve the separation efficiency however the complicated chemistry reagent process or manufacturing process still limits the applications of desert sand for oil water separation more importantly the oil water separation efficiency by using desert sand is far from the efficiency obtained by using metal mesh 26 pwnf membrane 14 and other non woven fabrics 27 in fact the separation rate of these latter materials is generally ten times higher than that of sand therefore to find a simple and high speed separation method based on sand is still of largest interest for the researchers in the field a simple large scale low cost and high speed gravity driven oil water separation method has here been developed by using pre wetting of sand the principle of oil water separation and the relationship between the porosity of the sand layer and the water phase separation rate have been determined by using the lbm shan chen model and micro ct characterization in addition the effect of key factors such as sand particle size number of oil water separation cycles sand layer thickness temperature ph value salt concentration and different oil water mixtures have been explored with the purpose to establish the usefulness of sand more precisely the separation ability of river sand sea sand and desert sand have been investigated and compared the results from the present study are thereby expected to contribute to the development of a simple efficient and reusable oil water separation method for future applications harsh conditions 2 experimental section 2 1 materials kerosene has been purchased from maoming runhua petrochemical co ltd maoming china and deionized di water was purchased from guangzhou golden leaf health technology co ltd guangzhou china moreover oil red o dye was purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china furthermore industrial water based pigments were directly obtained from shenzhen jinfuyuan pigment technology co ltd shenzhen china moreover paraffin oil was supplied by lircin medical technology inc dezhou china and peanut oil and sesame oil were purchased from yihai kerry oils grains foodstuffs industries co ltd guangzhou china all chemicals were used directly without further purification the stainless steel used for sieving was purchased online from changzhou laikou metal products co ltd and the river sand sea sand and desert sand were taken from the huai river section of huainan city in china the north sea of china and the alxa desert of china respectively 2 2 sand characterization helium ion beam microscopy him carl zeiss orion nanofab and field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem jsm 7900f equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer edax ltd octane elect super were used in the analyzes of the morphology and composition of the sand materials prior to characterization the three different types of sands were after cleaning and drying added to the surface of a conductive glue the samples that were used for fesem characterization were also coated with a thin layer of au by using evaporation to improve the surface image moreover an electron flood gun was mounted in the him it was used for charge neutralization to provide high contrast images of insulating samples with a high level of surface details 28 the operating voltage of him and fesem was 30 kv and 10 kv respectively the three dimensional structures of the sand materials were characterized by using a micro ct system sanying precision instruments co ltd nanovoxel 3000d the sand samples were then after cleaning and drying sealed into a transparent tube of 7 mm in diameter the tubes were thereafter positioned horizontally on the scanning table and the scanning parameters were set as follows the applied voltage current exposure time image merging frame number and resolution of the scanning system was set to 90 kv 40 Î¼a 0 8 s 2 and 4 Î¼m respectively each of the tubes was rotated 360 during scanning with an increment of 0 25 the rotation axis was perpendicular to the scanning table finally 3d models of the different sand materials were constructed by using projection images from the scans at different rotation angles moreover the avizo software was used to analyze the microchannel size and porosity in the tomographic image of each sample the contact angle of oil under water was measured by using a contact angle measurement instrument ningbo nb scientific instruments co ltd osa200s t and a home made device as shown in fig s1 in supporting information the detailed measurement process is presented in section 2 supplementary information 2 3 oil water separation experiment a home made oil water separation device was constructed which should be used for the oil water separation experiment an upper separation pipe waterproof gasket 150 mesh steel net waterproof gasket and a lower separation pipe were put together to form the final device as shown in fig 1a b the typical gravity driven oil water separation process is schematically presented in fig 1b c a 6 mm layer of sand was placed on top of the steel net this sand layer obtained an oleophobic property after prewetting with di water as the next step a mixture of 4 ml kerosene and 4 ml water was slowly poured into the upper separation of the device the separation of the solution was gravity driven in that the water in the solution passed through the sand layer while kerosene was sustained in the sand layer the separation time was recorded from the start of the water dripping in the lower separation tube until it completely stopped each experiment was repeated three times and an average value was obtained furthermore the oil water separation processes were also documented by using digital images and videos and they were found to be similar to the results in our previous work 14 as the next step in the experiment sand layer thickness and temperature were varied according to some pre set values finally the oil water separation rate was calculated by using the unit volume flow velocity equation 1 v v at where v is the oil water separation rate v is the unit volume of the liquid that has passed through the sand layer t is the time it takes for a unit volume to pass the sand layer and a is the sectional area of the sand layer in the gravity driven oil water separation test v 4 ml and a 19 625 mm2 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and eds characterization of sand prior to the oil water experiment dry river sand sea sand and desert sand were sieved by using steel meshes of different size 150 120 meshes 120 100 meshes 80 60 meshes and 40 30 meshes the sand samples were thereafter divided into 4 groups depending on sand particle size 0 11 mm 0 15 mm for group a 0 15 mm 0 18 mm for group b 0 25 mm 0 35 mm for group c and 0 52 mm 0 7 mm for group d unfortunately desert sand particles with a diameter between 0 52 mm and 0 7 mm could not be found it is clear from the sem images fig 2 and him images fig 8 that the particle size distribution of the three types of sand material became relatively uniform after sieving in addition the surface of the desert sand was much smoother than those of the river sand and sea sand also the surface roughness of the river sand and sea sand was close to that of the modified desert sand 20 25 this means that the river sand and sea sand can be used for oil water separation furthermore difference in sand surface morphology will have a direct effect on the difference in bearing capacity of the water films which in turn will affect the difference in oil water separation ability energy dispersive spectrometry eds has revealed that the main component of sand is silicon dioxide see fig 2b d f all sand samples did also contain a variety of metallic elements 23 see table s2 in supplementary information section s3 silicon dioxide and metals have generally a high surface free energy 19 in addition the surfaces of the sand particles contain a lot of adsorbed oh groups 19 thus the sand surfaces show very good hydrophilic properties 19 furthermore the micro ct characterization showed tiny gaps between the sand particles see figs 4 and s4 in supporting information those micro sized gaps are formed when sand particles are stacked and can be used as water passage channels a water film is expected to fill these gaps upon pre wetting in short the morphologies and the results from the eds characterization have shown that it is possible to create an oil water separation setup only by using pre wetting of the river sand sea sand and desert sand 3 2 principle of oil water separation kerosene and sea sand were especially chosen in studying the effect of sand pre wetting on the oil water separation as can be seen in figs 2a c e and 3a microchannels were formed when the sea sand particles were stacked furthermore a water film was formed on the surface of the sand particles as a result of pre wetting after the addition of kerosene an approximate spherical oil water contact was formed between the sand particles where the sphere center was facing the oil phase see fig 3b due to the oil water interfacial tension the spherical surface has the tendency to form the most stable shape with the smallest interfacial area consequently the oil water interfacial tension generates a force f Î³ directed upwards in our experiment and toward the oil phase thereby preventing the oil phase from passing through the microchannels between the sea sand particles when all water in the mixture has passed through the microchannels the water film on the surface of the sea sand particles together with the water in the microchannels between the sand particles will prevent any oil immersion as shown in fig 3c the pressure generated by the oil water interfacial tension and the maximum oil water mixture height can be obtained from the young laplace equation 14 29 2 p 2 Î³ o w r 4 Î³ o w cos Î¸ ca d Ï oil gh where Î´p is the pressure generated by the oil water interfacial tension Î³ o w r is the equivalent radius of the oil water interface Î¸ ca is the oil contact angle for the wetted sand layer in water d is the equivalent diameter of the microchannel Ï oil is the kerosene density g is the acceleration due to gravity and h is the maximum separation height the interface can sustain as can be understood from eq 2 Î´p is proportional to cos Î¸ ca and d furthermore cos Î¸ ca is determined by the natural properties of sand also d is determined by the size of the sand particles after sieving the micro ct characterizations did also confirm that the size of the microchannels were different for different sizes of the sand particles see figs 4 and s4 in supporting information 3 3 simulation of oil water separation to study the relationship between the microchannels in sand and the oil water separation rate a 5 mm thick sea sand layer with sand particle sizes in the range 0 25 mm to 0 35 mm was scanned by using micro ct characterization thereby building a 3d model cross sectional and vertical images of the sea sand layer are shown in fig 4b and c respectively the results from the micro ct characterization of river sand and desert sand are shown in figs s3 and s4 respectively in supporting information furthermore the distribution of microchannel sizes in the sea sand layer is presented in fig 4d about 73 of the microchannel sizes in stacked sea sand was found to be in the range 10 Î¼m to 100 Î¼m finally a 3d model of sea sand was constructed by using the avizo software in simulating the oil water separation the 3d model was thereafter transformed by using the multiphase flow lattice boltzmann method a multiphase flow system consisting of sea sand kerosene and water can be described by using the lbm shan chen model 30 32 a discrete form of the single relaxation d2q9 pattern is then used in the simulations and the evolution equation of the distribution function is presented below 3 f i Ï x e i Î´ t t Î´ t f i Ï x t 1 Ï Ï f i Ï x t f i Ï eq x t where f i x t is the distribution function of particles at position in x space at time t and for velocity i i 0 1 2 8 furthermore Ï represents the different components in the system Î´t is the time step e i is the migration velocity of particle i in the grid Ï is the dimensionless relaxation time and f i Ï eq is the equilibrium distribution function for particle i this distribution function can be expressed with the following equation 4 f i Ï eq x t Ï i Ï Ï x t 1 e i u x t c s 2 e i u x t 2 2 c s 4 u x t 2 2 c s 2 the density and velocity of the fluid on the macro scale is expressed in eqs 4 and 5 respectively 5 Ï Ï x t i f i x t 6 u Ï x t u x t Ï Ï f Ï x t Ï Ï x t where u x t is the mixing velocity and f Ï x t is the force exerted on the fluid the mixing velocity can be calculated by using the following equation 7 u x t Ï i f i Ï x t e i Ï Ï Ï i f i Ï x t Ï Ï moreover the force on the fluid consists of three parts i interaction forces between fluid particles in the same component ii interaction forces between fluid particles in different components and iii forces between the solid phase and the fluid the interaction forces between fluid particles in the same component can be expressed as 8 f c x t g c Ï Ï Ï x t i Ï i Ï Ï x e i Î´ t t e i where g c Ï is the interaction coefficient between the fluid particles in the same component and Ï Ï is the effective density of component Ï the latter expression represents the function of the macroscopic density of component Ï and is here expressed as Ï Ï x t 1 exp Ï x t the following equation describes the interactions between fluid particles in different components 9 f c Ï x t g c Ï Ï Ï Ï x t i Ï i Ï Ï x e i Î´ t t e i where Ï and Ï represents two different components and g c Ï Ï is the interaction coefficient between fluid particles in different components finally the interaction between the solid phase and the fluid can be expressed as 10 f ads Ï x t g ads Ï Ï Ï x t i Ï i s x e i Î´ t t e i where g ads Ï is the coefficient describing the fluid solid interaction the simulations were carried out by using a dimensionless acceleration of 0 00012 a contact angle of 130 48 and a two dimensional grid of n x n y 600 300 moreover the upper and lower boundaries were of no slip conditions and the left and right boundaries where of periodic boundary conditions in addition the acceleration direction was to the right the sand particles were simply added to form circles and the positions and particle sizes were randomly generated in this calculation area as can be seen in fig 5 density distributions with a porosity of 54 95 59 96 65 14 and 70 18 for an iteration number of 80 000 were then obtained the results show that the water phase was relatively dispersed for a small sand porosity moreover the water phase and oil phase were interlaced while separated into many droplets by the dense sand particles however the situation for a larger sand porosity was different the flow obstruction was then smaller each phase had a larger tendency to gather to form larger fluids furthermore the corresponding separation rates of the oil water mixture can be seen in fig 6 i e for the different sand porosities and an iteration number of 60 000 the oil water phase separation occurred in the first 10 000 iterations but with a largely fluctuating separation rate the important oil water two phase flow could thus be observed after the phase separation for a small sand porosity the flow rate of the water phase was higher than that of the oil phase whereas the overall flow rate was close to that of the water phase as a matter of fact the oil phase flow was close to zero and sometimes even negative consequently the water phase could pass through the sand while the oil phase was blocked thereby achieving a good separation on the other hand the flow rates of the water phase and the oil phase were quite similar for a large sand porosity with a resulting smaller separation effect consequently the overall flow rate was a superposition of the flow rates of the two phases oil and water the average separation rates i e over time as a function of sand porosity is shown in fig 7 it s clear that oil water separation rates have decreased with a decrease in sand porosity and that the water phase flow rate has gradually exceeded the one for the oil phase i e when going from a sand porosity of approximately 55 to approximately 60 thus the flow rates of the two phases were dominated by the water phase the water phase flow rate reached a maximum at 59 96 where the oil phase flow rate was found to be negative i e the oil flow rate was in the opposite direction 3 4 gravity driven oil water separation measured oil contact angles for sand layers in water is shown in fig 8a it is then clear that all sand materials showed superoleophobicity properties when placed in water more specifically the oil contact angle was larger for the desert sand than for the other two sand materials in fact the oil contact angle of sea sand was the smallest one the maximum oil contact angle was about 141 1 for desert sand and the minimum one was about 113 8 for sea sand the interesting thing here is that the span between the maximum and minimum oil contact angle was equal to 27 3 this means that it is possible to obtain different oil water separation rates by simply classifying the sand with type and particle size according to eq 1 the separation rates of the kerosene water mixtures for four groups with different particle sizes of river sand were higher than 1 7 0 1 mm s more specifically the separation rate of the river sand with a particle size in the region 0 52 mm to 0 7 mm was as high as 20 3 1 0 mm s for the sea sand and desert sand materials the lowest kerosene water separation rates were 1 9 0 1 mm s and 0 99 0 02 mm s respectively the most interesting result was the observation of a maximum kerosene water separation rate of 24 3 2 4 mm s for group d of sea sand which is 20 times higher than the separation rate for desert sand in a previous study 18 a comparison between the results obtained in the present study with the ones in a previous study is summarized in table s1 in supporting information it is clear that the separation rates of most sand layers were higher than those reported earlier thus the river sand sea sand and desert sand are all suitable for a rapid oil water separation this is especially the situation for group d of sea sand and river sand the results are shown in fig 8a which also reveals that the oil water separation rate of the sand layer has a positive correlation with the size of the sand particles thus the kerosene water separation rate was observed to increase with an increase in sand particle size in fact the relationship between separation rate and sand particle size can be calculated by using the hagen poiseuille equation 33 11 j ÎµÏ r p 2 p 8 Î¼l where j is the flow of water at the separation Îµ is the sand porosity r p is the pore radius p is the pressure drop Î¼ is the viscosity of the oil and l is the effective filtration distance according to eq 11 the water flow is proportional to the surface porosity Îµ and the square of the pore radius r p 2 to investigate the size dependency of the separation ratio the sand particle sizes and positions of four groups of river sand sea sand and desert sand were determined by using micro ct characterization the area of equivalent pores of each sand layer was then calculated by using the avizo software this area is to be regarded as an approximation of a circle area and the circle area can be calculated by using the following equation 12 r s Ï where s is the equivalent pore area and r is the equivalent pore radius thus the porosity of the sand is equal to the ratio of the pore volume to the total volume of the sand layer the results in fig 9a show that the r values of the a b c and d groups of the river sand were 0 099 0 004 mm 0 267 0 021 mm 0 419 0 037 mm and 0 810 0 081 mm respectively moreover the r values of the sea sand were 0 095 0 004 mm 0 221 0 023 mm 0 469 0 033 mm and 0 902 0 071 mm respectively and the r values of the desert sand were 0 074 0 002 mm 0 169 0 019 mm and 0 404 0 034 mm respectively as shown in fig 9 b the porosity of the river sand material in groups a b c and d groups were 39 76 2 15 44 23 3 03 41 07 3 33 and 39 55 1 96 respectively furthermore the porosity of the sea sand were 43 67 2 35 59 83 3 23 42 92 3 13 and 39 82 2 03 respectively and the porosity of the desert sand were 44 89 2 15 48 22 3 13 and 35 36 2 33 respectively thus the pore radius of the sand materials decreased with an increase in sand particle size however the equivalent radius showed a different trend according to the hagen poiseuille equation the water flow was directly proportional to the sand surface porosity Îµ and to the square of the pore radius r p 2 it can then be understood that large particle sizes of sand will increase the separation rates this conclusion is in agreement with the results of the kerosene water separation experiment in the present study moreover the separation rates for the river sand sea sand and desert sand were observed to slightly decrease within each group i e a b c and d this is demonstrated in the movies s1 s3 in the supporting information this phenomenon can be explained by the variation in equivalent pore radius for sand particles with the same particle size as shown in fig 8a the separation rate decreased when going from the river sand to the sea sand and further on to the desert sand however in group d the separation rate for the sea sand was 24 3 2 4 mm s which was 4 17 mm s higher than the value for the river sand this change in order can be explained by the fact that the pore radius of sea sand was 0 902 0 07 mm which was 0 09 mm larger than the pore radius of river sand see fig 9a moreover the separation rates for the river sand sea sand and desert sand were observed to slightly decrease within each group i e a b c and d this is demonstrated in the movies s1 s3 in the supporting information this phenomenon can be explained by the variation in equivalent pore radius for sand particles with the same particle size as shown in fig 8a the separation rate decreased when going from the river sand to the sea sand and further on to the desert sand however in group d the separation rate for the sea sand was 24 3 2 4 mm s which was 4 17 mm s higher than the value for the river sand this change in order can be explained by the fact that the pore radius of sea sand was 0 902 0 07 mm which was 0 09 mm larger than the pore radius of river sand see fig 9a 3 5 oil water separation ability of sand in order to explore the reusability and separation ability of river sand sea sand and desert sand for oil water mixtures under different environmental conditions the influence of number of separation cycles sand layer thickness salt concentration ph value temperature and other conditions have also be investigated and will be presented below 3 5 1 influence of the number of oil water separation cycles cycle experiments was set up to investigate the stability of river sand sea sand and desert sand the separation of the kerosene water mixture was repeated 40 times at room temperature and the thickness of the sand layer in all experiments was 6 mm after the first separation 4 ml of water was slowly injected into the upper separation pipe to form a kerosene water mixture for the next separation cycle the results in fig 10a c illustrate a very interesting phenomenon the separation rate of the river sand and the sea sand for a particle size in the region 0 7 mm to 0 52 mm did significant decline with number of cycles in fact the separation ratios of those two types of sand dropped by 48 and 23 respectively however the separation ratios for all three types of sand were well maintained by 90 of the initial separation rate after 40 times of cycling in other groups i e for other particle sizes surprisingly the separation rate of the sand layers with particle sizes in the ranges 0 15 mm 0 18 mm and 0 11 mm 0 15 mm did not change at all as comparable with other wettability materials such as nio ni mesh 34 and highly hydrophobic sand 35 this extremely stable result proves that the river sand sea sand and desert sand still have good reusability properties while highly resistant to fouling by oil to explore the underlying reasons to the reduction in separation rate for group d the separation process for different particle sizes of sea sand 0 11 mm 0 15 mm and 0 25 mm 0 35 mm have been recorded by using an apple iphone11 as can be seen in fig 10d some dyed kerosene was observed to still adhere to the surface of the small sized sand particles after the separation of the kerosene water mixture a significant pollution of the sea sand by kerosene can also be seen in fig 10b furthermore the results from the ct characterization in fig 9 show that the equivalent pore radius in a sand layer of large particle size was about 4 times larger than the equivalent pore radius for a sand layer of small particle size thus the small sized dyed kerosene can be trapped in a sand layer with large microchannels this phenomenon became even more pronounced when increasing the cycling times which is an observation that was also made in our previous work concerning the pwnf separation membrane 14 for sand materials with smaller sand particles the smaller size of the water films showed an improved resistance against the added water oil mixture as can be seen in fig 4d the height of the kerosene which is maintained by the small size of the water films was also found to be larger than the height of the kerosene for larger sizes of the water film i e formed on the surface of larger sand particles thus the dyed kerosene had difficulties to penetrate sand materials with small particle sizes thus the smaller sand particles showed an improved stability for oil water separation 3 5 2 influence of sand layer thickness the thickness of the sand layer was in this experiment set to 6 mm 7 mm 8 mm 9 mm and 10 mm the results demonstrated in fig 11a c show that the separation rates of the river sand sea sand and desert sand of different particle sizes decreased with an increase in layer thickness this phenomenon can be explained by the filling height of the quartz sand and the flux 36 that is the effective penetration distance gradually increased with an increase in sand thickness which resulted in a gradual decrease in flux 36 more precisely the separation rates of river sand and sea sand of size 0 52 mm 0 7 mm decreased faster than the other groups of sand with 23 and 31 respectively the separation rates of river sand sea sand and desert sand in groups a b and c was decreased by about 20 15 and 10 respectively the relationship between sand layer thickness and oil water separation rate can also be expressed by using the hagen poiseuille equation the effective filtration depth in the sand layer will increase with an increase in sand layer thickness according to eq 11 the flow of water at separation j is inversely proportional to the effective filtration distance l when the thickness of the river sand with a particle size of 0 52 mm 0 7 mm increases from 6 mm to 10 mm it increases by a factor of 1 67 consequently the water flow decreases by a factor of 1 67 according to the inverse relationship in eq 11 this is the reason why the water flow decreased with an increase in sand layer thickness in the separation process moreover the separation rate for the same type of sand was found to decrease with different ratios for an increase in sand layer thickness it is clear that this decline was more rapid for an increased particle size this phenomenon can be explained by the water film area for different sizes of sand particles the equivalent pore radius r of sand with particles in the range 0 52 mm 0 7 mm was about 3 times that large as that of sand with particles in the range 0 25 mm 0 35 mm in addition the water flow was about 7 times that large according to eq 11 consequently the separation rate was found to increase for an increase in particle size 3 5 3 influence of ph values on the separation rates sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl were used in the preparation of aqueous solutions with ph values 1 4 7 9 and 13 the detailed preparation process of the solutions is presented in section 5 in the supplementary information these solutions were thereafter used in studying the effect of ph values on the separation ability of the sand materials as can be seen in fig 11d f the separation rate of kerosene water mixtures at different ph values was found to vary for the different types of sand materials the separation rate of kerosene water was observed to decrease under both acidic and alkaline conditions that is the maximum separation rate of the solution took place in neutral water moreover the largest decrease in separation rate took place for sand materials with the largest particle size the separation rate for river sand and sea sand decreased by a maximum of 65 and 50 at ph 13 respectively furthermore the separation rate of desert sand decreased by a maximum of 60 at ph 1 it is well known that the main component in silicon oxide is sand and silicon oxide is prone to chemical reactions in both acid and alkaline environments 37 13 si o 2 h 2 o si o 2 o h 14 si o h 2 o si oh o h 15 si oh h 3 o si o h 2 h 2 o it can be concluded from eqs 13 15 that the h or oh ions in acidic or alkaline water solutions will inhibit or react with the adsorbed oh groups on the sand surface these reactions will thereby destroy i e deactivate the oh groups on the sand surface moreover those reactions will change the hydrophilicity of the sand surface which otherwise causes an irregular water film on the sand surface and thereby increases the resistance of the water flow 38 in other words an acidic or alkaline water solution will affect the separation rate of the sand layer although pre wetted sand can separate oil water mixtures in acidic or alkaline environments the stability of oil water separation was decreased slightly than surface modification technology as previous studies 37 38 therefore before using pre wetted sand in the separation of oil from water one must pay attention to the ph value of the water 3 5 4 influence of the temperature in considering the influence of the ambient temperature both during different seasons and at different latitudes in the world the test temperature was set to different values between 0 c and 75 c the minimum temperature was set to 0 c since water will freeze to ice below this temperature which is not suitable for the separation of oil water mixtures moreover the temperature of the liquid to be separated was kept stable at a constant temperature by using a water bath as can be seen in fig 12a c the separation rate for the sea sand layer with a particle size of 0 52 mm 0 7 mm increased from 16 85 0 85 mm s at 0 c to 35 79 2 83 mm s at 75 c by using sea sand with a smaller particle size 0 25 mm 0 35 mm it increased from 3 63 0 08 mm s at 0 c to 15 88 0 73 mm s at 75 c finally by using an even smaller particle size 0 15 mm 0 18 mm the separation rate was found to increase from 2 54 0 17 mm s at 0 c to 6 36 0 35 mm s at 75 c finally the smallest particle size 0 11 mm 0 15 mm resulted in an increase from 1 19 0 05 mm s at 0 c to 3 36 0 16 mm s at 75 c hence the separation rates of all sea sand layers increased 2 times when going from 0 c to 75 c and similar results were also obtained for the river sand and desert sand the results were similar to those obtained in our previous study on pwnf membranes 14 an explanation to these results is that the viscosity of the liquid decreased with an increase in the water temperature the water contact angle was also affected by the temperature 39 the volume flow rate became thereby improved which resulted in an improved oil water separation rate see section s6 in supplementary information for further details this discovery has provided a reference method for improving oil water separation rates in high latitude colder regions 3 5 5 influence of salt solution concentration sodium chloride nacl solutions of different concentrations was used to simulate different water environments and mixtures consisting of kerosene and the nacl solution was used to test the separation ability of the sand the experimental results in fig 12d f show that the separation rates of three types of sand became decreased with an increase in salt concentration furthermore the amplitude of the decrease in separation rate was also increased with the increase in sand size for the sea sand material the separation rates of an oil water mixture including salt were all 60 of the separation rates without any salt for the river sand and dessert sand the presence of salt resulted in 40 75 and 50 60 respectively of the separation rates obtained without any salt in the oil water mixture see fig 12d f moreover the separation rate was slightly decreased for a small size of the sand particles which was similar to the reduction trend for the pwnf membrane in one of our previous works 14 as the liquids passed through the porous medium the separation rate decreased for an increase in liquid viscosity of salt concentrations increasing in addition the liquid viscosity increased with an increase in salt concentration moreover the flow rate became inversely proportional to the viscosity for a constant pressure thus the flow rate decreased with the increase in viscosity when the liquid passed through the sand layer see section s6 in supplementary information for further details these results did also show that the sea sand layer can be used for filtration and separation of oil water mixtures with water from the sea 3 6 separation of other oil water mixtures to test the separation ability of sand layers for different types of oil paraffin oil water mixtures sesame oil water mixtures and peanut oil water mixtures were also included in our separation experiments a sea sand layer was used for these experiments as can be seen in fig 13 the highest separation rate was 25 09 mm s which was obtained for sea sand with a particle size in the range of 0 52 mm to 0 7 mm however the separation rate was still maintained at 94 of the initial separation rate after 5 cycles by comparing the results from cycle 5 with cycle 1 the separation rates of the kerosene water mixture and paraffin oil water mixture were still maintained at 84 of the initial separation rate however the separation rate of both sesame oil water mixture and peanut oil water mixture decreased by 40 furthermore the lowest separation rate was 0 089 0 052 mm s for a sea sand particle size of 0 15 mm to 0 18 mm this separation rate was only 6 of the rate from the 1st cycle this type of separation sand layer was basically a failure for these specific oil water mixtures to find the reason to this failure four mixtures of dyed kerosene paraffin oil sesame oil and peanut oil dyed red with oil red o with undyed water were used for further analysis and observations by recording the image of the sand layers after the 5th separation cycle of the different oil water mixtures it was found that the dyed sesame oil and peanut oil were trapped in the sand layer see fig s5 in supplementary information consequently the trapped oil blocked the microchannels in the sand thereby hindering the flow of water through the sand layer kerosene was basically not trapped by the sand layer so the decrease in kerosene separation rate was not that apparent the results for the sesame oil and peanut oil can be explained by the larger viscosity of these oils as compared with the paraffin oil and kerosene oil 40 41 it was thus easier for the sesame oil and peanut oil to adhere to the surface of the sand particles blocking the microchannels of the sand layer and thus reduce its pore radius and porosity according to eq 11 the flow of water will decrease for a decrease in porosity and pore radius of the separating sand layer 4 conclusion the oil water mixtures were successfully separated by pre wetting the river sand sea sand and desert sand the maximum oil water separation rate was 24 3 2 4 mm s which was obtained for sea sand with a particle size in the range 0 52 mm to 0 7 mm based on the micro ct characterization and the young laplace equation the principle of oil water separation by gravity was well established this was also the situation with the relationship between the porosity of the sand layer and the water flow rate the separation rate of sand layers with particle sizes in the ranges 0 15 mm 0 18 mm and 0 11 mm 0 15 mm were determined with high accuracy moreover the oil water separation rate was observed to decrease with an increase in sand layer thickness for the same type of sand this decline in separation rate was more rapid for an increased particle size furthermore the separation rate was decreased under both acidic and alkaline conditions also the separation rates of all sea sand layers increased by 2 times when going from 0 c to 75 c in summary the use of the here developed efficient and convenient separation method brings promising prospects for the recycling of oil containing industrial wastewater and oil spills the following are the supplementary data related to this article movie s1 video of the

12784,nanofiltration nf membranes with positive charge are essential for efficient removal of heavy metals and salts from waste water in this work surface modified positively charged novel ceramic supported polymeric csp composite nf membranes were fabricated with the copper ions embedded crosslinked polyethyleneimine polymer matrix over tubular ceramic substrate using facile dipcoating method edx atr ftir xps fesem afm and contact angle analyses were performed to characterize the chemical structures and morphologies of the prepared membranes the composite nf membrane exhibited satisfactory pure water permeability pwp of 8 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and promising salt 87 19 and 74 41 for mg2 and ca2 respectively and heavy metal ion rejections 91 73 83 15 and 75 50 for zn2 ni2 and cd2 respectively activation energy and overall size exclusion dehydration phenomena along with steric hindrance and donnan electrostatic exclusion plays an important role for heavy metals and salts rejection in

treatment under critical conditions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords composite membrane nanofiltration heavy metal antifouling antibacterial data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water pollution is one of the critical global issues nowadays due to fast industrial growth urban development and increase in population growth 1 2 the release of heavy metal from polluted waste water can have serious impact on the environment rapid development of industries such as metal plating battery manufacturing tanneries petroleum refining mining operations paint manufacturing pesticide and so on combined with lack of well defined protocols for the treatment of generated waste water leads to such challenging situation 3 5 association of hazardous heavy metals such as zinc zn nickel ni and cadmium cd together with high levels of acid or alkali in waste water often makes the treatment such water challenging 5 6 several conventional technologies such as precipitation coagulation flocculation and adsorption have been used to remove heavy metals from water 7 8 however high operational costs secondary pollutant generation sluggish operation and non reusability are the principal drawbacks which make these technologies relatively challenging 9 10 on the other hand membrane filtration is considered as an effective modern technology for wastewater treatment 7 11 12 due to low energy footprint and less solid waste production 13 nanofiltration nf has emerged as a potential membrane separation technique among all with numerous features including high rejection of multivalent ions and organic compounds low operating pressure simple but mature processing and lower costs 14 15 polymeric nf membranes exhibits good rejection towards various contaminants but are not very successful for longer run in extreme conditions due to the poor mechanical strength and high sensitivity towards acid and alkali 16 17 on the other hand inorganic nf membranes are very stable with respect to mechanical chemical and thermal resilience 18 19 however pore size fine tuning towards nf range is difficult and expensive 20 ceramic supported polymeric nf csp nf membranes have gained considerable attention recently due to their stability and high removal efficiency of contaminants 20 21 csp nf membranes combine the mechanical thermal and chemical stability of the ceramic support with the pore size tunability of the polymeric functional layer via various preparation procedures where the supports of polymeric membranes are replaced with ceramic substrate 20 moreover the polymeric functional layer on the ceramic substrate gives the requisite pore size and functionality to the composite membrane which allows improved rejection 14 20 the degree of adherence between the ceramic substrate and the polymeric functional layer essentially governs the stability of csp composite membranes the microstructure of the ceramic substrate and the functionality of the polymeric top layer as well as the technique used during membrane fabrication affect the adhesion and compatibility between the substrate and top layer commercially available nf membranes are mostly negatively charged and effectively remove polyvalent anions such as so4 2 co3 2 and po4 3 ions via donnan repulsion 22 23 however the poor separation of multivalent cations by commercial nf membranes triggers the demand for nf membranes with improved rejection efficiency for positively charged ions and heavy metals in this context polyethyleneimine pei is used to prepare positively charged nf membranes using different fabrication process such as interfacial polymerization chemical cross linking and layer by layer self assembly 24 pei has several benefits compared to the other polycations a it is a commercially accessible material with a significant number of chelate groups b it has large number of amino groups which strengthens coordination with metal ions and c it is a fairly weak polyelectrolyte that promotes the formation of an active layer with high selectivity however positive nf membranes are prone to fouling that cannot be neglected presence of negatively charged pollutants in aqueous solution enhances the membrane fouling due to the electrostatic attraction 25 therefore studies have been carried out on modification of the membrane active layer to increase the hydrophilicity charge functionality and reduce roughness in order to enhance the fouling resistivity as well as permeability and rejection 26 28 recently in situ ionization mineralization and metallization have been demonstrated as important factors for modifying the aforementioned membrane characteristics resulting in enhanced separation performance and antifouling property 29 30 various metals and metal ions such as silver copper iron zinc and gold immobilized on the top surface are used to provide anti fouling and antimicrobial properties to the membranes 31 33 copper has gained considerable interest among all the metals owing to its broad spectrum of bactericidal characteristics and low cost 34 35 researchers have also investigated the use of polymer supported copper nanoparticles complexes for catalytic reduction degradation and depletion of hazardous aqueous pollutants 36 it has also been shown that presence of chelated copper complex on the membrane active layer improves membrane permeability 20 37 however the influence of copper induced membrane ionization on separation behavior particularly the rejection of salts and cationic heavy metals its antifouling and antibacterial characteristics has not been thoroughly investigated in this work a new and facile technique of preparing antifouling csp composite nf membranes with polycation copper ii complex has been explored and their performances in salts and cationic heavy metals ni ii cd ii and zn ii removal from aqueous solution are examined a simple method of complexing copper ions with the cross linked pei polymer matrix on the membrane active layer via ionization has been studied the chelation ability of copper ions with the amino groups presents in pei and chemical stability of the prepared csp composite nf membrane have also been thoroughly evaluated in this study additionally the antifouling characteristic of the developed membrane with optimal properties has been studied using humic acid ha solution and the antibiofouling property of the membrane has been studied with both gram positive and gram negative strains to establish the stability of the membrane for application in complex waste water condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials tubular shaped clay alumina based substrate indigenously developed with pore size 1 6 Î¼m average

bacterial properties of the prepared membranes 2 2 pei cu ii complex formation pei contains primary secondary and tertiary amines and their theoretical distribution are 25 50 and 25 respectively therefore the amine groups concentration in pei solution and the moles ratio of cu2 with amine groups in pei can be determined by the concentration of pei in order to prepare pei cu ii complexes numbers of solutions with fixed pei concentration 2 wt and different cucl2 concentration 0 5 wt were prepared separately prepared homogenous solution of pei and cucl2 were mixed followed by stirring for 5 min at 300 rpm prior uv measurement carry50 australia at 630 nm 2 3 preparation of insitu copper complexed csp composite nf membranes the pristine macroporous supports were modified prior fabrication of polymeric functional layer for this purpose we incorporated an intermediate layer of alumina over the support tubes and the detailed procedure was described in our earlier study 21 in short finely powdered alumina and boehmite 4 1 were mixed with di water and binder pva to form slurry later the support tubes were coated with this aqueous slurry and sintered at 1200 c after incorporating the intermediate layer the substrates again were dip coated with 10 wt ga crosslinker solution for 1 min and to form the functional layer with copper ions by insitu ionization various pei cu ii complex solutions with different coating times table s1 were finally coated via dip coating method thereafter the coated membranes were dried for 1 h in air followed by placing in a hot air oven at 100 c for 5 min for adequate polymer cross linking 1 wt 0 1 wt and 0 05 wt copper chloride solutions were used to investigate its influence on active layer ionization of membrane and pore size

consecutive three measurements the csp membranes were prepared on both sides of the tubular substrates using similar approach as stated earlier section 2 3 for ease of the analysis 2 4 4 pure water permeability and molecular weight cutoff study membranes with filtration area effective of 0 00267 m2 and length 150 mm were used for water flux and all the rejection study firstly compaction study was performed with the prepared csp composite membranes and later the water fluxes were measured from 2 to 10 bar inlet pressure the pure water permeability pwp was calculated by the following equation 1 permeability p v a t p where v is the permeate volume in l a is the effective membrane area in m2 t is the time interval in h and Î´p is the operating pressure in bar polyethylene glycol peg was used to determine molecular weight cutoff mwco of the prepared membranes the different molecular weights of peg solution 200 400 600 1000 1500 2000 and 6000 with 2 5 wt were prepared as feed refractometer anton paar austria was used to measure the rejection of peg solutions at 4 bar inlet pressure for determining the mwco of the fabricated membranes 38 the rejection percentage of peg was calculated by the following equation 2 rejection 1 c p c f 100 where cf and cp are concentration of feed and permeate respectively mwco steric hindrance pore model was applied to determine the

used to measure heavy metal ions concentration the reproducibility was confirmed by repeating all the experiments for three times the rejection of heavy metals was calculated using the eq 2 2 6 antifouling study humic acid ha was selected as a typical foulant and the antifouling property of the csp nf membrane was measured using a laboratory crossflow filtration setup at 4 bar and 25 1 c firstly di water was circulated through the membrane for 30 min at 4 bar pressure and the average flux was denoted as the pure permeate flux j0 after that 0 3 g l 1 foulant ha solution was circulated through the same membrane at constant pressure 4 bar and the corresponding flux values were recorded average of these fluxes is denoted as j1 later the surface of the fouled membrane was cleaned in a cross flow filtration setup only with di water for 60 min without applying pressure then again average water flux j2 of the cleaned membrane at 4 bar pressure using di water was measured this study was done in triplicate to calculate the indexes of flux recovery ratio frr total fouling ratio rt irreversible fouling ratio rir and reversible fouling ratio rr for evaluating the anti fouling nature

absorbance at a wavelength of 280 nm the rejection of ha was calculated using eq 2 2 7 anti bacterial study antibacterial activity of the cu2 coated membrane was tested against two indigenous microbes isolated from sanitary landfill leachate they were characterized as brevibacillusagri s1 mt186161 gram positive and leclerciaadecarboxylata s2 mt186162 gram negative antibacterial activity was assessed in the form of colony forming unit cfu at od600nm both the strains were overnight grown in minimal salt medium msm upto a cfu of 1 106 cells ml 1 for this 50 Î¼l of each overnight grown culture was inoculated into 125 ml fresh msm medium along with gp and gpc membranes and incubated in an orbital shaker at 100 rpm at 37 c for 5 days at different time interval samples were withdrawn to check the od600 the results were represented in the form of cfu for calculating antimicrobial activity of the membranes against nutrient medium as well as in culture control 3 results and discussion 3 1 confirmation of pei cu ii complex formation a pei branched with primary secondary and tertiary amine groups in the ratio of 25 50 25 is capable of forming stable complexes with metal ions the association constant kf of amines with copper 1 1 1013for cu nh3 4 2 is higher than most of the other metal ions such as cobalt kf of co nh3 6 2 5 0 104 silver kf of ag nh3 2 1 6 107 and zinc zn nh3 4 2 7 8 108 results in easy pei cu ii complex formation during functional layer coating on the membrane surface 40 therefore generated pei cu ii complex square planar geometric arrangement was selected for coating membrane active layer that also has very promising antifouling and antibacterial property the stability of the chelate complex was investigated by preparing a series of solutions using cucl2 and pei the uv vis absorbance intensity of the complex was measured at 630 nm fig s1 the color of the chelated complex shifted gradually from pale to dark blue with increasing the concentration of cucl2 fig s1b implying that the pei cu ii complex is stable below a threshold ratio of 0 33 m cu2 m amine group of pei or 2 3 wt cucl2 solution 40 additionally it was observed that with increasing the cu2 concentration over this threshold ratio value results in precipitation that tends to destabilize the complex fig s1a therefore the charge density of the pei cu ii complex plays a crucial role for stability of the complex as well as for formation of the active layers over the ga coated ceramic substrate the charge density of the complex decreases with increasing the concentration of cu2 at constant ph when higher number of amine groups in the pei chain coordinates with cu2 the difficulty in protonation of the remaining groups increases resulting in lesser number of available sites for bonding with ga coated ceramic substrate thus complexes with relatively higher concentrations of cu2 are not suitable for the membrane preparation fig s1b the coating solutions without ph adjustment were prepared using2 wt pei along with three concentrations of cucl2 including a reference as 0 0 05 0 1 and 1 wt respectively they were further used to form functional layers which are significantly different in color due to the stronger interaction between complex and substrate implying the stability of metal ligand coordination complexes in the solid state due to crystal field splitting the complex was prepared by mixing 4 wt aqueous pei and 0 1 wt aqueous cucl2 solutions followed by homogeneously stirring at 300 rpm and then the absorption spectrum of pei cu2 complexed solutions were measured by uv vis spectrophotometer 200 nm to 800 nm the peak at 215 nm appeared due to the n Ï transition for the ch2 nh2 bond 41 42 which indicates the presence of free amine groups fig s1c whereas a broad absorption peak at 261 nm appeared due to the red shift of cn bond implying that the amine groups of pei reacted with cu2 ion fig s1c the presence of 215 nm peak in peicu2 solution indicates the existence of excess pei that will later bind with ga of modified ceramic tubular substrate 3 2 determination of complexation of pei cu ii chelated csp composite nf membrane edx analysis was performed of the prepared pei cu ii chelated composite membrane to determine the surface structure chemical the edx mapping of copper on surface of the prepared gpc membrane with 0 05 wt cu fig 1 showed homogeneous distribution of copper ion all over the active layer indicating its uniformity in immobilization the cross sectional edx shows the nature of the membrane asymmetric and a steady increase in carbon peak indicates the presence of polymeric top active layer of the membrane the highest intensity of copper was found at the active layer and a very small amount of its presence was detected through the intermediate layer implying the partial infiltration of copper with the polymer through the porous substrate fig 1 atr ftir of the prepared gp and gpc composite membrane was done for identifying the available main functional groups present on the skin layer fig s2 two peaks at 1550 cm 1 and 1460 cm 1 were observed owing to nh bending 1 of amine and ch bond respectively 21 43 the peak of nh bond in the gpc spectrum shifted compare to gp membrane from 3383 cm 1to 3393 cm 1 due to the coordination between amine group of pei with cu2 44 the peak at 1685 cm 1 represents cn stretching and confirms the bond formation between ga and pei for both the membranes xps analysis was performed to understand the elemental composition on the membrane surface three most important peaks at binding energy of 284 74 ev 399 48 ev and 532 43 ev were found for gp and gpc membrane these peaks were related to the c1s n1s o1s spectrum fig 2a 45 46 additionally a new peak at binding energy of 932 34 ev corresponding to cu2p was observed in the composite gpc membrane fig 2a 47 and confirms the existence of cu2 on the membrane surface the c1s and n1s core peaks were further evaluated fig 2b c d e deconvulation of the c1s spectrum shows two peaks around 284 38 ev and 285 32 ev corresponding to c c c h and cn bonds respectively fig 2c 48 a small shift in the c1s core peaks in the composite membrane was observed due to the presence of cn bond in case of gpc membrane the fitted c1s spectra shows characteristics peaks of cn at 286 53 ev and cc ch at 284 76 ev fig 2b 49 the peaks at 398 58 ev represents nc nh bond and 400 36 ev represents protonated amine nh3 in the n1s core peaks of gp composite membrane fig 2e 50 nevertheless about 0 83 to 1 5 ev shift of nh bond was again observed for the composite gpc membrane compared to gp membrane the peak shift from 398 58 ev to 399 41 ev of nh bond for gpc membrane fig 2d occurs due to the coordination of cu2 with the lone pair electron of n in primary secondary amine thus the nh peak shifted towards higher binding energy due to higher oxidized state of amines primary secondary additionally peaks at 400 76 ev and 401 86 ev binding energy fig 2d confirms the i formation of chelate complexes between amine groups of pei and metal ion via coordination bonds and ii adherence of the complex with ga cross linked ceramic substrate via covalent bonding two characteristic asymmetric and broad peaks corresponding to cu2 were observed at 933 12 ev cu 2p 3 2 and 952 68 ev cu 2p 1 2 in the cu 2p spectrum fig 2f these findings imply that cu2 was embedded into the membrane active layer via coordination these results are in well agreement with atr ftir spectra additionally the cu 2p 3 2 spectrum of the composite gpc membrane fig 2g shows reduction of the higher oxidation state of copper cu ii to lower oxidation state cu i due to reducing nature of pei 51 52 3 3 fesem analysis of csp composite nf membranes the cross sectional fesem analysis confirms the structure of the membranes that is asymmetric in nature fig 3 the porous ceramic support was modified with an intermediate layer to down tune the pore size having thickness 12 1 8 Î¼m 3b d however the boundary between the intermediate layer and the polymeric skin layer could not be differentiated clearly due to porous nature of the intermediate layer therefore the thickness of the top layer could not be measured properly but from distribution of carbon fig 2 it can be said that infiltration of the polymeric part inside the ceramic intermediate layer is upto a depth of 3 5 Î¼m the surface fesem images 3a c shows smooth nature which indicates the homogeneous distribution of polymer on top layer 3 4 characterization of membrane properties afm analyses were also performed to determine the surface roughness of the gp and gpc membranes fig s3 the afm images over a detection area of 5 Î¼m 5 Î¼m were plotted and the gp membrane s roughness results indicated relatively smoother surface rq and ra are 37 6 nm and 30 5 nm respectively than that of the gpc membrane rq and ra are 53 8 nm and 44 8 nm respectively due to absence of cu2 water contact angle wca of membranes depends on surface morphology and material properties 53 contact angle fig s4 of the copper ion modified membrane showed higher value 70 2 than the pristine membrane 62 2 and the membranes are moderately hydrophilic in nature copper ion modification in on membrane downtunes the hydrophilic nature of the membrane due to the formation of peicu2 polychelate complexes which simultaneously lowers the number of hydrophilic amine groups on the membrane active layer therefore the wca value of gpc membrane was slightly higher 29 a series of cu2 pei chelated membranes were prepared by varying the concentrations of copper and coating time table s1 prior to test the membrane performance the molecular weight cut offs mwcos of all the membranes were evaluated fig s5 using different molecular weights of peg 200 400 600 1000 1500 and 6000 as model solutes the peg rejection results implies that the corresponding molecular weight cut offs were 790 da for unmodified membrane gp and 370 da for best modified csp composite membrane gp0 05cu 1 5 as gpc respectively fig s5 inset the effective pore size of gp and gpc membranes were calculated as 1 39 nm and 0 98 nm respectively using eq 3 these results suggest that the fabricated membranes are in the nf range 3 5 performance analyses of csp composite nf membranes 3 5 1 pure water flux the flux value is directly proportional with the cu content on in composite membrane fig s6 various concentrations of cucl2 0 0 05 0 1 and 1 wt and coating times 60 90and 120 s were studied during the preparations of csp composite nf membranes table s1 pure water flux pwf was investigated at various applied pressures 2 10 bar with all the prepared membranes fig s6 the pwf increased with applied pressure which is a usual observation in addition copper ions also help to increase the pore size of the membrane due to chelation with amine groups of pei therefore greater pwf was obtained due to larger pore size in case of membranes having higher copper concentrations 54 55 3 5 2 inorganic salt removal the removal experiments were performed in a high pressure cross flow filtration unit mentioned in our earlier studies 14 21 3 5 2 1 effect of concentration on salt removal the effect of feed inorganic salt concentrations on the permeate flux was investigated for both the composite membranes mixed solution of mgso4 and caso4 was used for all the experiments the permeability fig s7a reduces with increase in individual ion concentration from 5 to 1000 mg l of the solution the effective pore radius of gp membrane 0 69 nm is large compared to hydrated ionic radii of divalent cations mg2 and ca2 and thus the rejection was low as only donnan exclusion was the aiding factor whereas gpc membrane showed improved ion rejection due to comparatively small 0 49 nm effective pore radius and therefore in addition to donnan exclusion size exclusion was also another aiding factor for removal the order of ion removal mg2 ca2 follows the same order of hydrated radius of two ions 0 428 nm and 0 412 nm for mg2 and ca2 respectively moreover higher hydration free energy for mg2 1828 kj mol 1 than ca2 1504 kj mol 1 also makes the difference in their rejection behavior and mg2 rejection was higher than ca2 56 3 5 2 2 effect of pressure on salt removal it was observed that with increasing pressure the permeate flux value increases continuously for both the membranes the rejection values were almost same for both the ions when the gp membrane was used fig 4a whereas with increasing pressure ion rejection increases significantly for gpc membrane and highest removal was observed at 10 bar for both the ions due to dilution effect 87 19 for mg2 and 74 41 for ca2 fig 4b however the rejection of mg2 is always higher than ca2 for all the experimental conditions due to the effect of size of the hydrated ions 3 5 3 effect of operating conditions on heavy metal removal by csp nf membranes the influence of operating conditions including ion concentration and pressure on heavy metal removal were systematically assessed 3 5 3 1 effect of feed concentration on heavy metal removal the rejections of cationic heavy metals ni2 zn2 and cd2 and corresponding permeate fluxes with different feed solution concentrations from 5 to 20 mg l for both membranes are given in fig 5 with increasing the ion concentration the rejection efficiency of all the investigated heavy metal ions show almost similar trend along with slight change in permeate flux for both gp and gpc membranes fig 5a b according to spiegler kedem model 57 solution permeability is inversely proportional to feed concentration among all the heavy metals cd2 shows lowest rejection efficiency for both the membranes fig 5a b due to smaller hydration radii lower hydration energy table 1 and presence of anionic species e g cdcl3 cdcl4 2 discussed in the later section the difference between gp and gpc membranes towards cationic heavy metal rejection was observed due to the presence of cu2 in on the functional layer of gpc membrane which contributed to a higher charge density that minimized the shield effect of counter ions e g cl and no3 thus stable rejections for all the heavy metals confirmed the excellent removal efficiency of positively charged gpc nf membranes at all feed concentrations 3 5 3 2 effect of operating pressure on heavy metal removal the rejection of ion and permeate flux with the change in operating pressure from 2 to 10 bar is presented in fig 6 it was observed that the permeate flux increased linearly with increase of operating pressure this linear relation between permeate flux and operating pressure can be explained by structural rigidity of nf membranes however the rejection of heavy metals shows different trends with the pressure the rejections of ni2 zn2 and cd2 by gp membrane were 70 73 83 38 and 65 65 fig 6a and for gpc membrane were 83 15 91 73 and 75 50 respectively at 10 bar pressure fig 6b when the transmembrane pressure increases the solvent flux becomes higher but the charge and steric effects prevent the solute transport across the membrane 58 therefore an increase in solute rejection was observed even though water permeation was greater at higher pressures additionally the dilution effect plays a significant role in ion rejection and thus the heavy metal removal by both the nf membranes increased slightly with increasing pressure similar observation was found by gherasim et al 59 where they observed enhancement in pb2 rejection with increasing operating pressure due to dilution effect highest rejections were observed at pressure 10 bar for both the nf membranes 3 5 3 3 effect of co existing salts and heavy metals on cadmium rejection usually effluents are contaminated with various types of heavy metals our previous reported results show that the rejection of cd is lower than ni and zn fig 6 in this context the effect of divalent cations such as zinc nickel calcium and magnesium on the rejection of the cadmium ion from cdcl2 was thoroughly investigated the concentration of cadmium was fixed to 5 mg l to evaluate the effect of interfering cations and co anions on removal efficiency fig 7 in case of both the membranes initially the rejection of cd in absence of other heavy metals and salts was high 83 4 and 95 for gp and gpc respectively at 2 bar but it decreases with increase in pressure upto 6 bar and remains almost constant due to relatively higher water flux compared to ion permeation on the other hand the removal of cd in presence of other heavy metals and inorganic salts e g calcium and magnesium decreases from 81 2 to 70 5 at 10 bar pressure due to change in the overall concentration of the feed fig 7a b therefore co existing cations play an important role to reduce the cd2 rejection 3 6 separation mechanism of divalent ions by nf membrane the variation in rejection efficiencies of divalent heavy metal ions by the fabricated positively charged membrane suggests that the removal does not solely depend on their charge as represented in table 1 the hydrated radii of the heavy metal ions follow the order zn2 cd2 ni2 and thereby ni2 was expected to have lowest rejection following size exclusion mechanism however the results show fig 6 differences in rejection that follows the order zn2 ni2 cd2 for all the experiments implying that the size exclusion is not the sole reason it is thus hypothesized that a combination of donnan exclusion and size exclusion plays important role for the rejection of divalent heavy metal ions by the composite membranes it was observed that the prepared composite membrane repels divalent heavy metal ions by the donnan exclusion mechanism due its positively charged surface furthermore the activation energy energy barrier and overall size exclusion dehydration phenomena also helps to explain the heavy metal rejection by the csp composite nf membrane fig s8 smaller cations with higher ionic charge density are largely influenced by positively charged nanoporous membranes resulting in increased hydration energy and higher rejection thus cd2 ion with higher ionic radius attracts fewer number of water molecules and possess lesser hydration energy compared to ni2 and zn2 ions table 1 and results in lower rejection than other two divalent heavy metal ions fig s8 60 activation energy on the other hand is also very significant for explaining the separation mechanism of comparable characteristics ions 62 higher rejection of cation can be observed if the activation energy of the respective ion is higher the activation energy for cation transport via membrane pores is significantly associated with the surface charge of the membrane 63 and the positive charge on the membrane surface results in a relatively higher activation energy for ni2 zn2 and cd2 transport via the nf membrane our prepared gpc nf membrane shows comparable performance permeability and ions rejection with various other reported nf membranes which are reported in table s2 3 7 antifouling study filtration of humic acid ha as a foulant with concentration of 300 mg l 1at 4 bar pressure was used to study the anti fouling property of the gpc nf membrane when a foulant solution was used as feed the normalized flux of the gpc nf membrane dropped drastically 0 72 although it recovered to a certain level 0 81 after cleaning the fouled membrane surface with di water three cycles of nanofiltration were carried out for flux reduction and antifouling study with 300 mg l ha aqueous solutions as shown in fig 8a the normalized flux of the hydrophilic gpc nf membrane decreased from 1 0 to 0 72 after the first operating cycle of 1 h the flux recovery ratio frr of the gpc nf membrane was 81 5 for the first cycle and 78 5 and 77 6 for the second and third cycles respectively fig 8b for the first and third cycles the total flux decline ratios fdrt were averaged as 28 2 and 33 respectively however the rejection of ha was above 99 fig 8a usually the hydrophilicity and surface roughness of a membrane are responsible for its antifouling property pei and copper ions both helped to improve the fouling resistance property since their presence enhances membrane wettability and thus reduces the chance of foulant adhesion 3 8 anti bacterial property of csp composite nf membranes antibacterial activity of csp composite nf membranes was evident with both gram positive and gram negative strains as shown in the fig 9 for both membranes s2 strain showed complete susceptibility period throughout the experimental duration i e 97 h whereas s1 showed varied pattern for gp and gpc for gp membrane the susceptibility was observed till 29 h of incubation afterwards 10 12 endurance was observed however for gpc membrane complete susceptibility was anticipated for the entire incubation time although susceptibility percentage was found to be quite low after 29 h of incubation period for gpc s1 was observed to be a slow growing strain with a lag phase of 7 9 h and visible antibacterial activity was observed only after 9 h of incubation therefore it can be concluded that the gram negative strain s2 showed more endurance to cu2 as compared with gram positive strain s1 this was due to thick peptidoglycan layer of gram positive bacteria that inhibits the absorption of cu2 cu1 ions into the bacterial cell and hence sustains the growth our results are in concurrence with the findings of jeon and lee 64 where they studied the antimicrobial properties of silver nano particles against both gram negative e coli and p aeruginosa and gram positive s aureus bacteria and concluded that e coli and p aeruginosa showed more antibacterial susceptibility as compared to gram positive ones similarly you et al 65 also observed high antibacterial activity of e coli in comparison to s aureus for both the tested strains gpc showed higher antibacterial activity as compared to gp i e 69 for s1 after 29 h of incubation and 39 2 for s2 after 97 h of incubation higher antibacterial activity of gpc membrane can be attributed to the presence of copper ions cu 2 or cu 1 chelated with polymers copper is a well known antibacterial agent and act by contact killing mechanism inducing cell death either cell enzymes or dna disruption 66 hence we can say that application of copper ions in on the active layer of the membrane increases its antibacterial activity which can be utilized as a tool for decontamination of microbial contaminated matrix 3 9 chemical stability of the membrane to study the chemical stability the gpc membrane was immersed in different ph solutions 4 5 to 11 fig 10 after each ph treatment peg400 rejection study was performed to check the mwco of the membrane the peg400 rejection of the gpc membrane was almost constant 90 throughout the studied ph range due to stable binding between the polymeric and ceramic support therefore gpc nf membrane can withstand both acidic and basic conditions without any significant damage of active layer implying strong adherence of cu pei over the crosslinked modified ceramic substrate therefore the prepared gpc composite nf membrane possesses strong chemical stability and has high potential for future applications 4 conclusion a series of ceramic supported polymeric composite nf membranes were fabricated during this study among them pristine gp and copper chelated gpc were applied for various cationic heavy metals separation from complex water system due to their acceptable mwco fesem analysis confirms that the membranes are asymmetric in nature and edx analysis verifies the presence of copper ions in on the membrane active layer the concentration of 2 wt pei and 0 05 wt cucl2was found to be optimal and the xps spectra verified their existence the clean water permeability and mwco studies revealed the higher rejection ability and acceptable permeability 8 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 of the gpc composite membrane with respect to various salts and heavy metals performances of both pristine gp and modified gpc membranes were studied in removal of salts and toxic heavy metals ni ii cd ii zn ii at different mixed feed concentrations and pressures and compared maximum salt rejection was 87 19 and 74 41 for mg2 and ca2 respectively at 10 bar pressure whereas heavy metals rejections followed the order zn2 91 73 ni2 83 15 cd2 75 50 at 10 bar pressure for all the experiments implying that steric hindrance and donnan exclusion played an important role in rejection additionally activation energy energy barrier and overall size exclusion dehydration phenomena also played a significant role for cationic heavy metal rejection the gpc nf membrane showed very good antifouling property with 99 humic acid rejection with 81 5 frr for the first cycle and 78 4 and 77 6 for the second and third cycles respectively in addition the prepared gpc membrane had excellent antibacterial property and high chemical stability therefore our investigation suggests that these high flux insitu copper modified ceramic supported polymeric composite nf

12784,nanofiltration nf membranes with positive charge are essential for efficient removal of heavy metals and salts from waste water in this work surface modified positively charged novel ceramic supported polymeric csp composite nf membranes were fabricated with the copper ions embedded crosslinked polyethyleneimine polymer matrix over tubular ceramic substrate using facile dipcoating method edx atr ftir xps fesem afm and contact angle analyses were performed to characterize the chemical structures and morphologies of the prepared membranes the composite nf membrane exhibited satisfactory pure water permeability pwp of 8 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and promising salt 87 19 and 74 41 for mg2 and ca2 respectively and heavy metal ion rejections 91 73 83 15 and 75 50 for zn2 ni2 and cd2 respectively activation energy and overall size exclusion dehydration phenomena along with steric hindrance and donnan electrostatic exclusion plays an important role for heavy metals and salts rejection in addition the membrane showed excellent antifouling properties 99 humic acid removal with high flux recovery ratio 77 6 and low flux decline ratio 33 for 5 h operations 3rd cycle together with outstanding antibiofouling ability towards brevibacillusagri and leclerciaadecarboxylata furthermore excellent chemical stability of the membrane suggests its potential application for waste water treatment under critical conditions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords composite membrane nanofiltration heavy metal antifouling antibacterial data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water pollution is one of the critical global issues nowadays due to fast industrial growth urban development and increase in population growth 1 2 the release of heavy metal from polluted waste water can have serious impact on the environment rapid development of industries such as metal plating battery manufacturing tanneries petroleum refining mining operations paint manufacturing pesticide and so on combined with lack of well defined protocols for the treatment of generated waste water leads to such challenging situation 3 5 association of hazardous heavy metals such as zinc zn nickel ni and cadmium cd together with high levels of acid or alkali in waste water often makes the treatment such water challenging 5 6 several conventional technologies such as precipitation coagulation flocculation and adsorption have been used to remove heavy metals from water 7 8 however high operational costs secondary pollutant generation sluggish operation and non reusability are the principal drawbacks which make these technologies relatively challenging 9 10 on the other hand membrane filtration is considered as an effective modern technology for wastewater treatment 7 11 12 due to low energy footprint and less solid waste production 13 nanofiltration nf has emerged as a potential membrane separation technique among all with numerous features including high rejection of multivalent ions and organic compounds low operating pressure simple but mature processing and lower costs 14 15 polymeric nf membranes exhibits good rejection towards various contaminants but are not very successful for longer run in extreme conditions due to the poor mechanical strength and high sensitivity towards acid and alkali 16 17 on the other hand inorganic nf membranes are very stable with respect to mechanical chemical and thermal resilience 18 19 however pore size fine tuning towards nf range is difficult and expensive 20 ceramic supported polymeric nf csp nf membranes have gained considerable attention recently due to their stability and high removal efficiency of contaminants 20 21 csp nf membranes combine the mechanical thermal and chemical stability of the ceramic support with the pore size tunability of the polymeric functional layer via various preparation procedures where the supports of polymeric membranes are replaced with ceramic substrate 20 moreover the polymeric functional layer on the ceramic substrate gives the requisite pore size and functionality to the composite membrane which allows improved rejection 14 20 the degree of adherence between the ceramic substrate and the polymeric functional layer essentially governs the stability of csp composite membranes the microstructure of the ceramic substrate and the functionality of the polymeric top layer as well as the technique used during membrane fabrication affect the adhesion and compatibility between the substrate and top layer commercially available nf membranes are mostly negatively charged and effectively remove polyvalent anions such as so4 2 co3 2 and po4 3 ions via donnan repulsion 22 23 however the poor separation of multivalent cations by commercial nf membranes triggers the demand for nf membranes with improved rejection efficiency for positively charged ions and heavy metals in this context polyethyleneimine pei is used to prepare positively charged nf membranes using different fabrication process such as interfacial polymerization chemical cross linking and layer by layer self assembly 24 pei has several benefits compared to the other polycations a it is a commercially accessible material with a significant number of chelate groups b it has large number of amino groups which strengthens coordination with metal ions and c it is a fairly weak polyelectrolyte that promotes the formation of an active layer with high selectivity however positive nf membranes are prone to fouling that cannot be neglected presence of negatively charged pollutants in aqueous solution enhances the membrane fouling due to the electrostatic attraction 25 therefore studies have been carried out on modification of the membrane active layer to increase the hydrophilicity charge functionality and reduce roughness in order to enhance the fouling resistivity as well as permeability and rejection 26 28 recently in situ ionization mineralization and metallization have been demonstrated as important factors for modifying the aforementioned membrane characteristics resulting in enhanced separation performance and antifouling property 29 30 various metals and metal ions such as silver copper iron zinc and gold immobilized on the top surface are used to provide anti fouling and antimicrobial properties to the membranes 31 33 copper has gained considerable interest among all the metals owing to its broad spectrum of bactericidal characteristics and low cost 34 35 researchers have also investigated the use of polymer supported copper nanoparticles complexes for catalytic reduction degradation and depletion of hazardous aqueous pollutants 36 it has also been shown that presence of chelated copper complex on the membrane active layer improves membrane permeability 20 37 however the influence of copper induced membrane ionization on separation behavior particularly the rejection of salts and cationic heavy metals its antifouling and antibacterial characteristics has not been thoroughly investigated in this work a new and facile technique of preparing antifouling csp composite nf membranes with polycation copper ii complex has been explored and their performances in salts and cationic heavy metals ni ii cd ii and zn ii removal from aqueous solution are examined a simple method of complexing copper ions with the cross linked pei polymer matrix on the membrane active layer via ionization has been studied the chelation ability of copper ions with the amino groups presents in pei and chemical stability of the prepared csp composite nf membrane have also been thoroughly evaluated in this study additionally the antifouling characteristic of the developed membrane with optimal properties has been studied using humic acid ha solution and the antibiofouling property of the membrane has been studied with both gram positive and gram negative strains to establish the stability of the membrane for application in complex waste water condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials tubular shaped clay alumina based substrate indigenously developed with pore size 1 6 Î¼m average

bacterial properties of the prepared membranes 2 2 pei cu ii complex formation pei contains primary secondary and tertiary amines and their theoretical distribution are 25 50 and 25 respectively therefore the amine groups concentration in pei solution and the moles ratio of cu2 with amine groups in pei can be determined by the concentration of pei in order to prepare pei cu ii complexes numbers of solutions with fixed pei concentration 2 wt and different cucl2 concentration 0 5 wt were prepared separately prepared homogenous solution of pei and cucl2 were mixed followed by stirring for 5 min at 300 rpm prior uv measurement carry50 australia at 630 nm 2 3 preparation of insitu copper complexed csp composite nf membranes the pristine macroporous supports were modified prior fabrication of polymeric functional layer for this purpose we incorporated an intermediate layer of alumina over the support tubes and the detailed procedure was described in our earlier study 21 in short finely powdered alumina and boehmite 4 1 were mixed with di water and binder pva to form slurry later the support tubes were coated with this aqueous slurry and sintered at 1200 c after incorporating the intermediate layer the substrates again were dip coated with 10 wt ga crosslinker solution for 1 min and to form the functional layer with copper ions by insitu ionization various pei cu ii complex solutions with different coating times table s1 were finally coated via dip coating method thereafter the coated membranes were dried for 1 h in air followed by placing in a hot air oven at 100 c for 5 min for adequate polymer cross linking 1 wt 0 1 wt and 0 05 wt copper chloride solutions were used to investigate its influence on active layer ionization of membrane and pore size

characterization of prepared csp nf membranes 2 4 1 characterization of chemical structure edx inca pentafet x3 oxford instrument uk and atr ftir analysis model alpha bruker usa were used to characterize the functionality and chemical composition of the prepared csp composite membranes furthermore xps analysis escalab xi thermo fisher scientific pvt ltd uk helps to determine the existence and nature of chelated copper ions on membrane surface 2 4 2 membrane morphology characterization the cross sectional and surface morphologies of the prepared csp composite membranes were analyzed by fesem carl zeiss smt ag germany the morphologies and surface roughness of each membrane were examined using afm nanonics israel the scanning area was selected as 5 Î¼m 5 Î¼m 2 4 3 contact angle determination the static contact angles of the prepared composite membranes were determined with the help of contact angle goniometer dsa25s kruss germany the value was taken as summation of consecutive three measurements the csp membranes were prepared on both sides of the tubular substrates using similar approach as stated earlier section 2 3 for ease of the analysis 2 4 4 pure water permeability and molecular weight cutoff study membranes with filtration area effective of 0 00267 m2 and length 150 mm were used for water flux and all the rejection study firstly compaction study was performed with the prepared csp composite membranes and later the water fluxes were measured from 2 to 10 bar inlet pressure the pure water permeability pwp was calculated by the following equation 1 permeability p v a t p where v is the permeate volume in l a is the effective membrane area in m2 t is the time interval in h and Î´p is the operating pressure in bar polyethylene glycol

firstly di water was circulated through the membrane for 30 min at 4 bar pressure and the average flux was denoted as the pure permeate flux j0 after that 0 3 g l 1 foulant ha solution was circulated through the same membrane at constant pressure 4 bar and the corresponding flux values were recorded average of these fluxes is denoted as j1 later the surface of the fouled membrane was cleaned in a cross flow filtration setup only with di water for 60 min without applying pressure then again average water flux j2 of the cleaned membrane at 4 bar pressure using di water was measured this study was done in triplicate to calculate the indexes of flux recovery ratio frr total fouling ratio rt irreversible fouling ratio rir and reversible fouling ratio rr for evaluating the anti fouling nature of the csp nf membrane using the following equations 4 frr j 2 j 0 100 5 rt j 0 j 1 j 0 100 6 rir j 0 j 2 j 0 100 1 frr 7 rr j 2 j 1 j 0 100 rt rir the concentration of ha was measured by the uv vis absorbance at a wavelength of 280 nm the rejection of ha was calculated using eq 2 2 7 anti bacterial study antibacterial activity of the cu2 coated membrane was tested against two indigenous microbes isolated from sanitary landfill leachate they were characterized as brevibacillusagri s1 mt186161 gram positive and leclerciaadecarboxylata s2 mt186162 gram negative antibacterial activity was assessed in the form of colony forming unit cfu at od600nm both the strains were overnight grown in minimal salt medium msm upto a cfu of 1 106 cells ml 1 for this 50 Î¼l of each overnight grown culture was inoculated into 125 ml fresh msm medium along with gp and gpc membranes and incubated in an orbital shaker at 100 rpm at 37 c for 5 days at different time interval samples were withdrawn to check the od600 the results were represented in the form of cfu for calculating antimicrobial activity of the membranes against nutrient medium as well as in culture control 3 results and discussion 3 1 confirmation of pei cu ii complex formation a pei branched with primary secondary and tertiary amine groups in the ratio of 25 50 25 is capable of forming stable complexes with metal ions the association constant kf of amines with copper 1 1 1013for cu nh3 4 2 is higher than most of the other metal ions such as cobalt kf of co nh3 6 2 5 0 104 silver kf of ag nh3 2 1 6 107 and zinc zn nh3 4 2 7 8 108 results in easy pei cu ii complex formation during functional layer coating on the membrane surface 40 therefore generated pei cu ii complex square planar geometric arrangement was selected for coating membrane active layer that also has very promising antifouling and antibacterial property the stability of the chelate complex was investigated by preparing a series of solutions using cucl2 and pei the uv vis absorbance intensity of the complex was measured at 630 nm fig s1 the color of the chelated complex shifted gradually from pale to dark blue with increasing the concentration of cucl2 fig s1b implying that the pei cu ii complex is stable below a threshold ratio of 0 33 m cu2 m amine group of pei or 2 3 wt cucl2 solution 40 additionally it was observed that with increasing the cu2 concentration over this threshold ratio value results in precipitation that tends to destabilize the complex fig s1a therefore the charge density of the pei cu ii complex plays a crucial role for stability of the complex as well as for formation of the active layers over the ga coated ceramic substrate the charge density of the complex decreases with increasing the concentration of cu2 at constant ph when higher number of amine groups in the pei chain coordinates with cu2 the difficulty in protonation of the remaining groups increases resulting in lesser number of available sites for bonding with ga coated ceramic substrate thus complexes with relatively higher concentrations of cu2 are not suitable for the membrane preparation fig s1b the coating solutions without ph adjustment were prepared using2 wt pei along with three concentrations of cucl2 including a reference as 0 0 05 0 1 and 1 wt respectively they were further used to form functional layers which are significantly different in color due to the stronger interaction between complex and substrate implying the stability of metal ligand coordination complexes in the solid state due to crystal field splitting the complex was prepared by mixing 4 wt aqueous pei and 0 1 wt aqueous cucl2 solutions followed by homogeneously stirring at 300 rpm and then the absorption spectrum of pei cu2 complexed solutions were measured by uv vis spectrophotometer 200 nm to 800 nm the peak at 215 nm appeared due to the n Ï transition for the ch2 nh2 bond 41 42 which indicates the presence of free amine groups fig s1c whereas a broad absorption peak at 261 nm appeared due to the red shift of cn bond implying that the amine groups of pei reacted with cu2 ion fig s1c the presence of 215 nm peak in peicu2 solution indicates the existence of excess pei that will later bind with ga of modified ceramic tubular substrate 3 2 determination of complexation of pei cu ii chelated csp composite nf membrane edx analysis was performed of the prepared pei cu ii chelated composite membrane to determine the surface structure chemical the edx mapping of copper on surface of the prepared gpc membrane with 0 05 wt cu fig 1 showed homogeneous distribution of copper ion all over the active layer indicating its uniformity in immobilization the cross sectional edx shows the nature of the membrane asymmetric and a steady increase in carbon peak indicates the presence of polymeric top active layer of the membrane the highest intensity of copper was found at the active layer and a very small amount of its presence was detected through the intermediate layer implying the partial infiltration of copper with the polymer through the porous substrate fig 1 atr ftir of the prepared gp and gpc composite membrane was done for identifying the available main functional groups present on the skin layer fig s2 two peaks at 1550 cm 1 and 1460 cm 1 were observed owing to nh bending 1 of amine and ch bond respectively 21 43 the peak of nh bond in the gpc spectrum shifted compare to gp membrane from 3383 cm 1to 3393 cm 1 due to the coordination between amine group of pei with cu2 44 the peak at 1685 cm 1 represents cn stretching and confirms the bond formation between ga and pei for both the membranes xps analysis was performed to understand the elemental composition on the membrane surface three most important peaks at binding energy of 284 74 ev 399 48 ev and 532 43 ev were found for gp and gpc membrane these peaks were related to the c1s n1s o1s spectrum fig 2a 45 46 additionally a new peak at binding energy of 932 34 ev corresponding to cu2p was observed in the composite gpc membrane fig 2a 47 and confirms the existence of cu2 on the membrane surface the c1s and n1s core peaks were further evaluated fig 2b c d e deconvulation of the c1s spectrum shows two peaks around 284 38 ev and 285 32 ev corresponding to c c c h and cn bonds respectively fig 2c 48 a small shift in the c1s core peaks in the composite membrane was observed due to the presence of cn bond in case of gpc membrane the fitted c1s spectra shows characteristics peaks of cn at 286 53 ev and cc ch at 284 76 ev fig 2b 49 the peaks at 398 58 ev represents nc nh bond and 400 36 ev represents protonated amine nh3 in the n1s core peaks of gp composite membrane fig 2e 50 nevertheless about 0 83 to 1 5 ev shift of nh bond was again observed for the composite gpc membrane compared to gp membrane the peak shift from 398 58 ev to 399 41 ev of nh bond for gpc membrane fig 2d occurs due to the coordination of cu2 with the lone pair electron of n in primary secondary amine thus the nh peak shifted towards higher binding energy due to higher oxidized state of amines primary secondary additionally peaks at 400 76 ev and 401 86 ev binding energy fig 2d confirms the i formation of chelate complexes between amine groups of pei and metal ion via coordination bonds and ii adherence of the complex with ga cross linked ceramic substrate via covalent bonding two characteristic asymmetric and broad peaks corresponding to cu2 were observed at 933 12 ev cu 2p 3 2 and 952 68 ev cu 2p 1 2 in the cu 2p spectrum fig 2f these findings imply that cu2 was embedded into the membrane active layer via coordination these results are in well agreement with atr ftir spectra additionally the cu 2p 3 2 spectrum of the composite gpc membrane fig 2g shows reduction of the higher oxidation state of copper cu ii to lower oxidation state cu i due to reducing nature of pei 51 52 3 3 fesem analysis of csp composite nf membranes the cross sectional fesem analysis confirms the structure of the membranes that is asymmetric in nature fig 3 the porous ceramic support was modified with an intermediate layer to down tune the pore size having thickness 12 1 8 Î¼m 3b d however the boundary between the intermediate layer and the polymeric skin layer could not be differentiated clearly due to porous nature of the intermediate layer therefore the thickness of the top layer could not be measured properly but from distribution of carbon fig 2 it can be said that infiltration of the polymeric part inside the ceramic intermediate layer is upto a depth of 3 5 Î¼m the surface fesem images 3a c shows smooth nature which indicates the homogeneous distribution of polymer on top layer 3 4 characterization of membrane properties afm analyses were also performed to determine the surface roughness of the gp and gpc membranes fig s3 the afm images over a detection area of 5 Î¼m 5 Î¼m were plotted and the gp membrane s roughness results indicated relatively smoother surface rq and ra are 37 6 nm and 30 5 nm respectively than that of the gpc membrane rq and ra are 53 8 nm and 44 8 nm respectively due to absence of cu2 water contact angle wca of membranes depends on surface morphology and material properties 53 contact angle fig s4 of the copper ion modified membrane showed higher value 70 2 than the pristine membrane 62 2 and the membranes are moderately hydrophilic in nature copper ion modification in on membrane downtunes the hydrophilic nature of the membrane due to the formation of peicu2 polychelate complexes which simultaneously lowers the number of hydrophilic amine groups on the membrane active layer therefore the wca value of gpc membrane was slightly higher 29 a series of cu2 pei chelated membranes were prepared by varying the concentrations of copper and coating time table s1 prior to test the membrane performance the molecular weight cut offs mwcos of all the membranes were evaluated fig s5 using different molecular weights of peg 200 400 600 1000 1500 and 6000 as model solutes the peg rejection results implies that the corresponding molecular weight cut offs were 790 da for unmodified membrane gp and 370 da for best modified csp composite membrane gp0 05cu 1 5 as gpc respectively fig s5 inset the effective pore size of gp and gpc membranes were calculated as 1 39 nm and 0 98 nm respectively using eq 3 these results suggest that the fabricated membranes are in the nf range 3 5 performance analyses of csp composite nf membranes 3 5 1 pure water flux the flux value is directly proportional with the cu content on in composite membrane fig s6 various concentrations of cucl2 0 0 05 0 1 and 1 wt and coating times 60 90and 120 s were studied during the preparations of csp composite nf membranes table s1 pure water flux pwf was investigated at various applied pressures 2 10 bar with all the prepared membranes fig s6 the pwf increased with applied pressure which is a usual observation in addition copper ions also help to increase the pore size of the membrane due to chelation with amine groups of pei therefore greater pwf was obtained due to larger pore size in case of membranes having higher copper concentrations 54 55 3 5 2 inorganic salt removal the removal experiments were performed in a high pressure cross flow filtration unit mentioned in our earlier studies 14 21 3 5 2 1 effect of concentration on salt removal the effect of feed inorganic salt concentrations on the permeate flux was investigated for both the composite membranes mixed solution of mgso4 and caso4 was used for all the experiments the permeability fig s7a reduces with increase in individual ion concentration from 5 to 1000 mg l of the solution the effective pore radius of gp membrane 0 69 nm is large compared to hydrated ionic radii of divalent cations mg2 and ca2 and thus the rejection was low as only donnan exclusion was the aiding factor whereas gpc membrane showed improved ion rejection due to comparatively small 0 49 nm effective pore radius and therefore in addition to donnan exclusion size exclusion was also another aiding factor for removal the order of ion removal mg2 ca2 follows the same order of hydrated radius of two ions 0 428 nm and 0 412 nm for mg2 and ca2 respectively moreover higher hydration free energy for mg2 1828 kj mol 1 than ca2 1504 kj mol 1 also makes the difference in their rejection behavior and mg2 rejection was higher than ca2 56 3 5 2 2 effect of pressure on salt removal it was observed that with increasing pressure the permeate flux value increases continuously for both the membranes the rejection values were almost same for both the ions when the gp membrane was used fig 4a whereas with increasing pressure ion rejection increases significantly for gpc membrane and highest removal was observed at 10 bar for both the ions due to dilution effect 87 19 for mg2 and 74 41 for ca2 fig 4b however the rejection of mg2 is always higher than ca2 for all the experimental conditions due to the effect of size of the hydrated ions 3 5 3 effect of operating conditions on heavy metal removal by csp nf membranes the influence of operating conditions including ion concentration and pressure on heavy metal removal were systematically assessed 3 5 3 1 effect of feed concentration on heavy metal removal the rejections of cationic heavy metals ni2 zn2 and cd2 and corresponding permeate fluxes with different feed solution concentrations from 5 to 20 mg l for both membranes are given in fig 5 with increasing the ion concentration the rejection efficiency of all the investigated heavy metal ions show almost similar trend along with slight change in permeate flux for both gp and gpc membranes fig 5a b according to spiegler kedem model 57 solution permeability is inversely proportional to feed concentration among all the heavy metals cd2 shows lowest rejection efficiency for both the membranes fig 5a b due to smaller hydration radii lower hydration energy table 1 and presence of anionic species e g cdcl3 cdcl4 2 discussed in the later section the difference between gp and gpc membranes towards cationic heavy metal rejection was observed due to the presence of cu2 in on the functional layer of gpc membrane which contributed to a higher charge density that minimized the shield effect of counter ions e g cl and no3 thus stable rejections for all the heavy metals confirmed the excellent removal efficiency of positively charged gpc nf membranes at all feed concentrations 3 5 3 2 effect of operating pressure on heavy metal removal the rejection of ion and permeate flux with the change in operating pressure from 2 to 10 bar is presented in fig 6 it was observed that the permeate flux increased linearly with increase of operating pressure this linear relation between permeate flux and operating pressure can be explained by structural rigidity of nf membranes however the rejection of heavy metals shows different trends with the pressure the rejections of ni2 zn2 and cd2 by gp membrane were 70 73 83 38 and 65 65 fig 6a and for gpc membrane were 83 15 91 73 and 75 50 respectively at 10 bar pressure fig 6b when the transmembrane pressure increases the solvent flux becomes higher but the charge and steric effects prevent the solute transport across the membrane 58 therefore an increase in solute rejection was observed even though water permeation was greater at higher pressures additionally the dilution effect plays a significant role in ion rejection and thus the heavy metal removal by both the nf membranes increased slightly with increasing pressure similar observation was found by gherasim et al 59 where they observed enhancement in pb2 rejection with increasing operating pressure due to dilution effect highest rejections were observed at pressure 10 bar for both the nf membranes 3 5 3 3 effect of co existing salts and heavy metals on cadmium rejection usually effluents are contaminated with various types of heavy metals our previous reported results show that the rejection of cd is lower than ni and zn fig 6 in this context the effect of divalent cations such as zinc nickel calcium and magnesium on the rejection of the cadmium ion from cdcl2 was thoroughly investigated the concentration of cadmium was fixed to 5 mg l to evaluate the effect of interfering cations and co anions on removal efficiency fig 7 in case of both the membranes initially the rejection of cd in absence of other heavy metals and salts was high 83 4 and 95 for gp and gpc respectively at 2 bar but it decreases with increase in pressure upto 6 bar and remains almost constant due to relatively higher water flux compared to ion permeation on the other hand the removal of cd in presence of other heavy metals and inorganic salts e g calcium and magnesium decreases from 81 2 to 70 5 at 10 bar pressure due to change in the overall concentration of the feed fig 7a b therefore co existing cations play an important role to reduce the cd2 rejection 3 6 separation mechanism of divalent ions by nf membrane the variation in rejection efficiencies of divalent heavy metal ions by the fabricated positively charged membrane suggests that the removal does not solely depend on their charge as represented in table 1 the hydrated radii of the heavy metal ions follow the order zn2 cd2 ni2 and thereby ni2 was expected to have lowest rejection following size exclusion mechanism however the results show fig 6 differences in rejection that follows the order zn2 ni2 cd2 for all the experiments implying that the size exclusion is not the sole reason it is thus hypothesized that a combination of donnan exclusion and size exclusion plays important role for the rejection of divalent heavy metal ions by the composite membranes it was observed that the prepared composite membrane repels divalent heavy metal ions by the donnan exclusion mechanism due its positively charged surface furthermore the activation energy energy barrier and overall size exclusion dehydration phenomena also helps to explain the heavy metal rejection by the csp composite nf membrane fig s8 smaller cations with higher ionic charge density are largely influenced by positively charged nanoporous membranes resulting in increased hydration energy and higher rejection thus cd2 ion with higher ionic radius attracts fewer number of water molecules and possess lesser hydration energy compared to ni2 and zn2 ions table 1 and results in lower rejection than other two divalent heavy metal ions fig s8 60 activation energy on the other hand is also very significant for explaining the separation mechanism of comparable characteristics ions 62 higher rejection of cation can be observed if the activation energy of the respective ion is higher the activation energy for cation transport via membrane pores is significantly associated with the surface charge of the membrane 63 and the positive charge on the membrane surface results in a relatively higher activation energy for ni2 zn2 and cd2 transport via the nf membrane our prepared gpc nf membrane shows comparable performance permeability and ions rejection with various other reported nf membranes which are reported in table s2 3 7 antifouling study filtration of humic acid ha as a foulant with concentration of 300 mg l 1at 4 bar pressure was used to study the anti fouling property of the gpc nf membrane when a foulant solution was used as feed the normalized flux of the gpc nf membrane dropped drastically 0 72 although it recovered to a certain level 0 81 after cleaning the fouled membrane surface with di water three cycles of nanofiltration were carried out for flux reduction and antifouling study with 300 mg l ha aqueous solutions as shown in fig 8a the normalized flux of the hydrophilic gpc nf membrane decreased from 1 0 to 0 72 after the first operating cycle of 1 h the flux recovery ratio frr of the gpc nf membrane was 81 5 for the first cycle and 78 5 and 77 6 for the second and third cycles respectively fig 8b for the first and third cycles the total flux decline ratios fdrt were averaged as 28 2 and 33 respectively however the rejection of ha was above 99 fig 8a usually the hydrophilicity and surface roughness of a membrane are responsible for its antifouling property pei and copper ions both helped to improve the fouling resistance property since their presence enhances membrane wettability and thus reduces the chance of foulant adhesion 3 8 anti bacterial property of csp composite nf membranes antibacterial activity of csp composite nf membranes was evident with both gram positive and gram negative strains as shown in the fig 9 for both membranes s2 strain showed complete susceptibility period throughout the experimental duration i e 97 h whereas s1 showed varied pattern for gp and gpc for gp membrane the susceptibility was observed till 29 h of incubation afterwards 10 12 endurance was observed however for gpc membrane complete susceptibility was anticipated for the entire incubation time although susceptibility percentage was found to be quite low after 29 h of incubation period for gpc s1 was observed to be a slow growing strain with a lag phase of 7 9 h and visible antibacterial activity was observed only after 9 h of incubation therefore it can be concluded that the gram negative strain s2 showed more endurance to cu2 as compared with gram positive strain s1 this was due to thick peptidoglycan layer of gram positive bacteria that inhibits the absorption of cu2 cu1 ions into the bacterial cell and hence sustains the growth our results are in concurrence with the findings of jeon and lee 64 where they studied the antimicrobial properties of silver nano particles against both gram negative e coli and p aeruginosa and gram positive s aureus bacteria and concluded that e coli and p aeruginosa showed more antibacterial susceptibility as compared to gram positive ones similarly you et al 65 also observed high antibacterial activity of e coli in comparison to s aureus for both the tested strains gpc showed higher antibacterial activity as compared to gp i e 69 for s1 after 29 h of incubation and 39 2 for s2 after 97 h of incubation higher antibacterial activity of gpc membrane can be attributed to the presence of copper ions cu 2 or cu 1 chelated with polymers copper is a well known antibacterial agent and act by contact killing mechanism inducing cell death either cell enzymes or dna disruption 66 hence we can say that application of copper ions in on the active layer of the membrane increases its antibacterial activity which can be utilized as a tool for decontamination of microbial contaminated matrix 3 9 chemical stability of the membrane to study the chemical stability the gpc membrane was immersed in different ph solutions 4 5 to 11 fig 10 after each ph treatment peg400 rejection study was performed to check the mwco of the membrane the peg400 rejection of the gpc membrane was almost constant 90 throughout the studied ph range due to stable binding between the polymeric and ceramic support therefore gpc nf membrane can withstand both acidic and basic conditions without any significant damage of active layer implying strong adherence of cu pei over the crosslinked modified ceramic substrate therefore the prepared gpc composite nf membrane possesses strong chemical stability and has high potential for future applications 4 conclusion a series of ceramic supported polymeric composite nf membranes were fabricated during this study among them pristine gp and copper chelated gpc were applied for various cationic heavy metals separation from complex water system due to their acceptable mwco fesem analysis confirms that the membranes are asymmetric in nature and edx analysis verifies the presence of copper ions in on the membrane active layer the concentration of 2 wt pei and 0 05 wt cucl2was found to be optimal and the xps spectra verified their existence the clean water permeability and mwco studies revealed the higher rejection ability and acceptable permeability 8 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 of the gpc composite membrane with respect to various salts and heavy metals performances of both pristine gp and modified gpc membranes were studied in removal of salts and toxic heavy metals ni ii cd ii zn ii at different mixed feed concentrations and pressures and compared maximum salt rejection was 87 19 and 74 41 for mg2 and ca2 respectively at 10 bar pressure whereas heavy metals rejections followed the order zn2 91 73 ni2 83 15 cd2 75 50 at 10 bar pressure for all the experiments implying that steric hindrance and donnan exclusion played an important role in rejection additionally activation energy energy barrier and overall size exclusion dehydration phenomena also played a significant role for cationic heavy metal rejection the gpc nf membrane showed very good antifouling property with 99 humic acid rejection with 81 5 frr for the first cycle and 78 4 and 77 6 for the second and third cycles respectively in addition the prepared gpc membrane had excellent antibacterial property and high chemical stability therefore our investigation suggests that these high flux insitu copper modified ceramic supported polymeric composite nf membrane is promising for critical waste water treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that
