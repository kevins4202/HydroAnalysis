groundwater depletion is a long term water level decline which is an expected outcome of the extraction of water from underground konikow and kendy 2005 the countries facing groundwater depletion worldwide include the major part of north africa the middle east north china north america and australia south and central asia and localised areas all over the world konikow and kendy 2005 a gradual deteriorating quality of surface river and reservoirs water caused by many anthropogenic factors including rapid urbanization unplanned industrialization domestic waste disposal and agricultural runoff have led to the scarcity of fresh water mukherjee et al 2008 singh et al 2011 yadav et al 2012 kumar et al 2017 furthermore the climate change scenario and unpredictable intensity and frequency of precipitation make it difficult for precise management and storage of water kumar et al 2011 these factors are responsible for heavy dependency on groundwater resulting in an imbalance between extraction and natural recharge samadder et al 2011 nowadays the developing countries particularly the south east asian region are facing challenges related to the quantity and quality of groundwater due to overexploitation raju et al 2009 scanlon et al 2010 kumar et al 2017 chakraborti et al 2017 precipitation is known as the primary source of groundwater recharge and strongly affects its quality before and after entering the aquifer the rainwater passes through the soil matrix and a number of course of actions like mixing and ion exchange mathhess 1982 along with these factors there are adsorption desorption rock soil water interactions in the soil zone evaporation rate and lateral inter mixing that control the level of dissolved ions in the groundwater singh et al 2006 2011 application of stable water isotopes is known as a strong tool to understand the subsurface hydrology in a better way soulsby et al 2000 saha et al 2011 in the alluvial plains of india various studies have been conducted to know the geochemical behaviour and recharge conditions basu et al 2002 sengupta and sarkar 2006 a study done by using stable isotopes in the western ganges plains revealed rainfall and or canal water as the main recharge sources to the alluvial plain aquifers samadder et al 2011 another study from the middle gangetic plain found the aquifer recharge source 55 km south of the area studied saha et al 2011 the prominent source of recharge is precipitation during monsoon season south west monsoon and surface water during the non monsoon season in aquifers of the capital city delhi india kumar et al 2011 it has been reported that 90 of the freshwater extracted from underground gets consumed in the irrigation practices hence the quality of water directly affects the health of the crops grown shiklomanov 2000 scanlon et al 2007 raju et al 2009 groundwater is of most importance with respect to the need of drinking as it forms a major source of potable water in most of the parts of india singh et al 2011 due to the rapid urbanization in recent years the scarcity of availability of water with respect to quantity and quality has arisen in the urban areas including the national capital region ncr of india depletion of groundwater levels locally in noida and greater noida area is attributed to over exploitation of groundwater joshi 2009 virtually there has not been much of systematic work in india to know the impact of industrial activities on groundwater the chhaprola industrial area is a suitable site for study located in the gautam buddha

characterization of groundwater the statistics of groundwater samples are presented in table 1 the detailed data set is also provided in table s1 of supplementary information most of the targeted tubewells were shallow in depth 15 55 m with a median depth of 36 6 m and a median age of 10 years the groundwater ph range 6 4 8 8 was observed within the world health organization who 2011 permissible limit and indicated neutral to slightly basic in nature the mean oxidation reduction potential orp value 46 range 147 to 23 7 mv and low dissolved oxygen do median value 1 32 mg l indicated reducing conditions in the aquifer environment the mean values of ec and tds of the groundwater were found to be 1143 734 μs cm and 627 371 mg l respectively that exceeded the who 2011 guideline limit recommended for drinking purpose the who 2011 guideline values for ec and tds are 750 µs cm and 500 mg l respectively bicarbonate hco3 was found dominant among the anions while calcium ca2 dominated among the major cations anions followed the trend as bicarbonate hco3 sulphate so4 2 chloride cl nitrate no3 fluoride f phosphate po4 3 while cations followed the pattern as calcium ca2 sodium na magnesium mg2 potassium k as detected in the groundwater the concentration of hco3 was observed as a predominant anion in the groundwater samples with the median value of 342 85 mg l in another study of the noida metropolitan city major anions found in the groundwater were hco3 and cl singh et al 2011 the so4 2 concentration was insignificant with a mean value of 64 47 and median value 52 mg l the no3 ranged from not detectable to 43 mg l with the median value 4 26 mg l in the groundwater samples the mineralization of soil organic matter that was amended by fertilizer additions may be the prominent source kim et al 2015 raju et al 2015 the f concentration ranged from not detectable to 2 6 mg l with the mean value of 0 71 0 6 mg l it exceeded the who 2011 guideline value and bureau of indian standards bis 2012 standards permissible limit of 1 5 mg l at two locations 17 and 26 although f is found as an innate component in the groundwater the high concentration may cause harmful effects further the po4 3 concentration was not detected in any of the samples the concentration of different cations has been presented in table s1 in supplementary information the ca2 concentration mean value 47 36 and median value 37 2 mg l was found to be dominant among all the detected cations in groundwater the concentration of na was also present in significant amount with the mean value 37 mg l followed by mg2 22 4 mg l silica 8 mg l and k 6 3 mg l in the previous studies the major cations present in the groundwater were na ca2 mg2 and k younger 2007 singh et al 2011 elevated concentration of the cations may be due to their mineralogical origin water sediment interactions due to over extraction of groundwater for agricultural activities naidu et al 1985 singh et al 2006 3 2 spatial distribution of total dissolved solids fluoride and nitrate in groundwater the spatial distribution pattern of tds f and no3 are represented in fig 2 the distribution pattern of tds indicating hot spots in the north west and central part of the study area it may be due to overexploitation of groundwater for the domestic and industrial purpose higher f was observed in sadopur and achheja which forms the south eastern part of the study area the occurrence of fluoride in groundwater is due to weathering and leaching of fluoride bearing minerals from rocks and sediments jha et al 2013 the spatial distribution pattern of no3 followed different trends and showed a hot spot in sadopur or the south eastern part of the study area another hot spot was observed in achheja and bisnuli although the concentration of no3 was below the who 2011 guideline value and bis 2012 standard value of 45 mg l still there were some anthropogenic contributions that may be from the sewage and agricultural runoff 3 3 isotopic composition in groundwater and recharge conditions the recharge source for the aquifers of the study area could be modern day rainfall monsoon source from bay of bengal or local moisture precipitation in an earlier climatic period and infiltration from surface water bodies mukherjee et al 2012 the nearest local meteoric water line lmwl to the study area is from new delhi gupta and deshpande 2005 the lmwl δ2h 7 2 δ18o 4 6 accomplished almost similar slope to the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 of craig 1961 the plot of δ18o versus δ2h fig 3 concerning the gmwl and lmwl for isotopic data was plotted for better understanding the nature and source of recharging water in this area the δ18o against vsmow for all samples varied from 8 7 to 3 3 with the mean value of 5 9 1 4 and δ2h against vsmow varied from 60 1 to 37 having a mean value of 47 4 7 1 the trend line equation between δ2h and δ18o exhibited lower slope δ2h 4 81 δ18o 19 2 compared to the gmwl and lmwl which is due to the evaporative loss of groundwater the intersection point of the isotopic record of this study with lmwl indicated an isotopic signature value of δ18o 8 7 and δ2h 60 1 in the precipitation of water kumar et al 2011 majority of the samples show highly enriched values which can be possible due to the i influence of groundwater from runoff waste water generated from the nearby heavy industrial setups ii intense evaporation of pond water which has linked with the groundwater recharge system and iii due to the return water from agricultural irrigation indeed irrigation water is subjected to evaporation and the fraction of water that returns in aquifer may be enriched in heavy isotopes the sample locations 21 22 23 27 28 29 in villages achheja bisnuli and dujana were collected from the vicinity of a surface reservoir i e pond which is probably linked to the groundwater recharge system groundwater recharge process depends on various factors i e aquifer types soil types topography relief and recharging source mukherjee et al 2012 with the increasing well depth enrichment was observed in δ18o and δ2h fig 4 a and b the hco3 shows no variation with well depth except for two locations whereas increasing trend with well depth was observed for ca2 fig 4 c and d a positive trend was observed in ec and δ18o and δ2h fig 4 e and f decrease enriched heavier isotopes δ18o and δ2h in the lighter isotope with the increasing well depth further explains the role of evaporation in the groundwater recharge system besides this increasing value of ec with enriched δ18o and δ2h value could be due to the carbonate co3 2 dissolution as a weathering process in the surveyed area detailed weathering process has been explained in section 3 4 in fig 4 g h δ2h and δ18o plotted against cl present in the groundwater to correlate enrichment in heavy isotopes with cl as a possible driving factor of salinity ingress the enrichment of δ2h and δ18o seems to be associated with the increase in cl concentration in the well locations 21 30 31 32 and 33 suggesting evaporation as the main active process involved in the increase of salinity of waters at these locations the spatial distribution maps of tubewell depth δ18o δ2h and d excess have been shown in fig 5 which further supports the explanation of isotopic enrichment in the surveyed area the d excess value varied from 10 5 to 9 5 with the mean value of 0 4 4 9 lower d excess observed in the sampled area is due to the high evaporation rate in order to check the connectivity among varying well depths in aquifers a bivariate plot of δ18o and δ2h was constructed fig 6 three different well depths were distinguished in the surveyed area namely shallow 11 20 m middle 20 40 m and deeper depth 50 m the slope of shallow 11 20 m depth and middle aquifer 20 40 m depth was very close 4 82 and 5 02 with the intercepts of 19 21 and 17 53 respectively the deeper aquifer 50 m was not included for this explanation due to the less number of samples the intercept of shallow depth tube well is more negative than the middle depth which is due to the higher evaporation rate as compared to middle depth however the closeness of slopes and its intercepts indicate tight interlinkage between shallow and middle tubewell depths in these aquifers 3 4 weathering processes and solute acquisition weathering and solute exchange processes control the chemical composition of groundwater by solute acquisition mechanism the ion exchange procedure of water can be described by chloroalkaline indices cai or schoeller index schoeller 1977 the cai shows dual properties can be positive or negative during the exchange of na and k by mg and ca in water the ratio will be positive which indicates the occurrence of base exchange if the ratio is found to be negative there will be chloroalkaline disequilibrium and the cation anion exchange reaction will occur results from the study revealed that 76 of the groundwater samples exhibit negative schoeller index demonstrating the cation anion exchange reactions while 24 of the samples showed positive values depicting the base exchange reactions fig s1 supplementary information on bivariate mixing diagrams fig 7 a and b of na normalized ca versus na normalized mg and hco3 indicated an equal contribution of silicate and carbonate type weathering on the global average weathering system in the ground water origin of suspended components can be estimated by the relative quantity of individual ions and inter elemental correlation the plot of ca mg versus total cations tz fig 8a demonstrates that plotted points come within the reach of 1 1 equiline suggesting significant input of ca and mg and hence the dominance of carbonate weathering over silicate weathering the average value of ratio ca mg versus na k 3 11 also supported the fact that carbonate weathering regulated the chemical composition primarily than the silicate weathering to estimate the significance of cations by silicate weathering na k tz plot can be employed stallard and edmond 1983 the plot of na k vs tz implies that plotted points fell beyond the reach of 1 1 equiline indicating a very little role of na and k to the suspended ions from the weathering of silicates fig 8b the calculated si values are given in table 2 it can be observed that groundwater ranged from virtual equilibrium to slightly supersaturated with respect to carbonate phases like aragonite caco3 calcite caco3 and dolomite camg co3 2 this led to the precipitation of carbonate phases in the aquifer whereas it is undersaturated with na and k containing minerals like albite naalsi3o8 and illite k0 6mg0 25al2 3si3 5o10 oh 2 3 5 groundwater classification and suitability for various purposes piper diagram fig 9 showed heterogeneous water type and sufficient recharge mixing of groundwater from different aquifers layer it was observed that 15 of the groundwater samples tend to fell into mg hco3 water type whereas 52 of the groundwater samples fell into ca hco3 water type and 33 of the groundwater samples fell in the na hco3 water type the source of na and k in the samples may be because of weathering of minerals containing na and k and industrial or agricultural activities guo and wang 2004 singh et al 2006 the lower left triangle shows that ca2 and mg2 formed equal contribution fig 9 few samples well locations 7 27 30 31 32 and 33 formed a separate group supporting the fact of that evaporation as the primary processes involved in enhancing the salinity of waters at these locations also see fig 4 g and h the tds level ranged from 232 to 1570 mg l results from the table 3 revealed that out of 33 samples 15 samples fell into the desirable category and 13 samples lie in the permissible range for drinking category while 5 samples are suitable only for agriculture use on the basis of tds level of analyzed water 85 of the samples fell into the category of fresh water and 15 of the samples well locations 7 30 31 32 and 33 fell into the brackish water category freeze and cherry 1979 the water hardness can be described as the concentration of multivalent cations i e ca2 and mg2 present in water according to sawyer and mccarty 1967 four classes were proposed as shown in table 3 the results depicted that 3 of the samples have total hardness values less than 75 mg l and can be classified under the soft category 39 of the samples are slightly hard water while 42 are moderately hard and 15 of the samples come under the category of very hard water the hardness of water can inhibit the formation of lather with soap and enhance the boiling point of water who 2011 increased concentration of cl in water may be due to the anthropogenic sources such as agricultural runoff domestic and industrial wastes appelo and postma 1993 a very low cl concentration was observed in few water samples on the basis of cl concentration stuyfzand 1989 has categorized the groundwater in six classes ranging from fresh to hyperhaline table 3 the results of the analyzed samples show that about 15 of the water samples were under extremely fresh 55 fell in the very fresh and 30 of the samples in the fresh category the water indices such as na ec rsc sar pi mh ki tds and total water hardness twh are important in the estimation of a suitability of groundwater for the agricultural use these indices were applied on the solute chemistry of groundwater from the surveyed area and are represented in table s2 in supplementary information estimation of the level of na is an essential parameter in the classification of water for irrigation practices due to the high reactivity of na with soil and alteration of its structure reduction in the permeability and aeration overall affecting the plant growth karanth 1987 the na level is normally described in terms of percentage of na the na of the samples were calculated and shown in table s2 in supplementary information the na ranged from 11 94 to 64 35 according to the bis 1991 standard only up to 60 na in groundwater is suggested for irrigation water the results revealed that out of 33 samples 94 of the samples were in good agreement to the bis 1991 standard value and was found to be safe for the irrigation purpose while only 6 of the samples were unsuitable the quality of groundwater samples was analyzed by employing the plot of investigative data on wilcox 1955 diagram relating na and ec wilcox plot has been represented in fig s2 in supplementary information the results from wilcox diagram depicted that 61 samples fell under excellent to good type 24 fell into good to permissible type 3 fit into the permissible to doubtful type 9 in the doubtful to unsuitable type and 3 in the unsuitable type for irrigation usage the higher ratio of the sum of hco3 and co3 2 over ca mg influence the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes the rsc has been calculated to observe the effects of co3 2 and hco3 and is represented in table s2 in supplementary information the calculated values of rsc for groundwater samples ranged from 7 84 to 5 2 results show that about 33 of the water samples were under the safe category 18 were marginally suitable and 49 of the samples were unsuitable for irrigation use high rsc value of groundwater may enhance the adsorption of na on soil eaton 1950 the relative activity of na or alkali hazard in the water for irrigation is determined by sar the sar values of irrigation water have a direct relationship with the extent to which na is adsorbed by the soil if the water utilized for irrigation purpose contains elevated na and low ca2 concentration in that case exchangeable ca2 complex can substitute na with base exchange reaction in water this process can lead to the damage of soil structure due to the dispersion of clay particles the calculated value of sar ranged from 0 13 to 1 06 in table s2 in supplementary information all the samples were found to be in good agreement with the sar value of 10 richards 1954 and are safe for irrigation practices the permeability index described by doneen 1964 denoted the suitability of groundwater and is used to classify the irrigation water into three classes such as class i class ii and class iii class i and class ii types of water with 75 or more of maximum permeability index while class iii types of water with 25 were of good quality for irrigation purposes fig s3 in supplementary information the mh values that were reported 50 were regarded as unsafe and inappropriate for irrigation use szabolcs and darab 1964 the results showed that 79 samples had mh below 50 which were found to be safe while 21 of the samples were unsafe for irrigation purpose 4 conclusions the results indicated neutral to moderately basic nature of groundwater and reducing environmental conditions of the aquifer in the study area an elevated level of tds was observed at few locations groundwater was found to be contaminated with f at two locations majority of the samples fell below the gmwl and lmwl indicating enrichment of heavier isotope δ18o in the aquifers due to the evaporation loss of water during aquifer recharge the lower slope of groundwater as compared to lmwl also indicated the evaporative loss of groundwater it was also supported by a bivariate plot of stable isotopes with ec and cl the closeness of slope and intercept of shallow and middle depth aquifer indicates tight interlinkage between them approximately 76 of the samples showed a cation anion exchange while 24 showed base exchange reactions are taking place in the groundwater both type of weathering silicate and carbonate controlling the groundwater compositions the groundwater was ca hco3 mg hco3 and na hco3 type different water quality indices viz residual sodium carbonate kelly index permeability index magnesium hazard and chloroalkaline indices showed

delhi indicating enrichment of heavier isotopes in the aquifers which explain that recharging water has undergone evaporation before recharging the aquifer monsoonal precipitation was observed as the major source of aquifer recharge in the surveyed area vertical hydraulic connectivity of the aquifer layers was traced with the help of isotopic record which exhibited a more negative intercept for shallow depth tube well than the middle depth tube well about 76 of the samples exhibited negative schoeller index thereby indicated cation anion exchange reactions while the remaining samples depicted the base exchange reactions sodium normalized ca versus na normalized mg and hco3 indicated an equal contribution of silicate and carbonate type weathering on global average weathering system

rainfall and or canal water as the main recharge sources to the alluvial plain aquifers samadder et al 2011 another study from the middle gangetic plain found the aquifer recharge source 55 km south of the area studied saha et al 2011 the prominent source of recharge is precipitation during monsoon season south west monsoon and surface water during the non monsoon season in aquifers of the capital city delhi india kumar et al 2011 it has been reported that 90 of the freshwater extracted from underground gets consumed in the irrigation practices hence the quality of water directly affects the health of the crops grown shiklomanov 2000 scanlon et al 2007 raju et al 2009 groundwater is of most importance with respect to the need of drinking as it forms a major source of potable water in most of the parts of india singh et al 2011 due to the rapid urbanization in recent years the scarcity of availability of water with respect to quantity and quality has arisen in the urban areas including the national capital region ncr of india depletion of groundwater levels locally in noida and greater noida area is attributed to over exploitation of groundwater joshi 2009 virtually there has not been much of systematic work in india to know the impact of industrial activities on groundwater the chhaprola industrial area is a suitable site for study located in the gautam buddha

characterization of groundwater the statistics of groundwater samples are presented in table 1 the detailed data set is also provided in table s1 of supplementary information most of the targeted tubewells were shallow in depth 15 55 m with a median depth of 36 6 m and a median age of 10 years the groundwater ph range 6 4 8 8 was observed within the world health organization who 2011 permissible limit and indicated neutral to slightly basic in nature the mean oxidation reduction potential orp value 46 range 147 to 23 7 mv and low dissolved oxygen do median value 1 32 mg l indicated reducing conditions in the aquifer environment the mean values of ec and tds of the groundwater were found to be 1143 734 μs cm and 627 371 mg l respectively that exceeded the who 2011 guideline limit recommended for drinking purpose the who 2011 guideline values for ec and tds are 750 µs cm and 500 mg l respectively bicarbonate hco3 was found dominant among the anions while calcium ca2 dominated among the major cations anions followed the trend as bicarbonate hco3 sulphate so4 2 chloride cl nitrate no3 fluoride f phosphate po4 3 while cations followed the pattern as calcium ca2 sodium na magnesium mg2 potassium k as detected in the groundwater the concentration of hco3 was observed as a predominant anion in the groundwater samples with the median value of 342 85 mg l in another study of the noida metropolitan city major anions found in the groundwater were hco3 and cl singh et al 2011 the so4 2 concentration was insignificant with a mean value of 64 47 and median value 52 mg l the no3 ranged from not detectable to 43 mg l with the median value 4 26 mg l in the groundwater samples the mineralization of soil organic matter that was amended by fertilizer additions may be the prominent source kim et al 2015 raju et al 2015 the f concentration ranged from not detectable to 2 6 mg l with the mean value of 0 71 0 6 mg l it exceeded the who 2011 guideline value and bureau of indian standards bis 2012 standards permissible limit of 1 5 mg l at two locations 17 and 26 although f is found as an innate component in the groundwater the high concentration may cause harmful effects further the po4 3 concentration was not detected in any of the samples the concentration of different cations has been presented in table s1 in supplementary information the ca2 concentration mean value 47 36 and median value 37 2 mg l was found to be dominant among all the detected cations in groundwater the concentration of na was also present in significant amount with the mean value 37 mg l followed by mg2 22 4 mg l silica 8 mg l and k 6 3 mg l in the previous studies the major cations present in the groundwater were na ca2 mg2 and k younger 2007 singh et al 2011 elevated concentration of the cations may be due to their mineralogical origin water sediment interactions due to over extraction of groundwater for agricultural activities naidu et al 1985 singh et al 2006 3 2 spatial distribution of total dissolved solids fluoride and nitrate in groundwater the spatial distribution pattern of tds f and no3 are represented in fig 2 the distribution pattern of tds indicating hot spots in the north west and central part of the study area it may be due to overexploitation of groundwater for the domestic and industrial purpose higher f was observed in sadopur and achheja which forms the south eastern part of the study area the occurrence of fluoride in groundwater is due to weathering and leaching of fluoride bearing minerals from rocks and sediments jha et al 2013 the spatial distribution pattern of no3 followed different trends and showed a hot spot in sadopur or the south eastern part of the study area another hot spot was observed in achheja and bisnuli although the concentration of no3 was below the who 2011 guideline value and bis 2012 standard value of 45 mg l still there were some anthropogenic contributions that may be from the sewage and agricultural runoff 3 3 isotopic composition in groundwater and recharge conditions the recharge source for the aquifers of the study area could be modern day rainfall monsoon source from bay of bengal or local moisture precipitation in an earlier climatic period and infiltration from surface water bodies mukherjee et al 2012 the nearest local meteoric water line lmwl to the study area is from new delhi gupta and deshpande 2005 the lmwl δ2h 7 2 δ18o 4 6 accomplished almost similar slope to the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 of craig 1961 the plot of δ18o versus δ2h fig 3 concerning the gmwl and lmwl for isotopic data was plotted for better understanding the nature and source of recharging water in this area the δ18o against vsmow for all samples varied from 8 7 to 3 3 with the mean value of 5 9 1 4 and δ2h against vsmow varied from 60 1 to 37 having a mean value of 47 4 7 1 the trend line equation between δ2h and δ18o exhibited lower slope δ2h 4 81 δ18o 19 2 compared to the gmwl and lmwl which is due to the evaporative loss of groundwater the intersection point of the isotopic record of this study with lmwl indicated an isotopic signature value of δ18o 8 7 and δ2h 60 1 in the precipitation of water kumar et al 2011 majority of the samples show highly enriched values which can be possible due to the i influence of groundwater from runoff waste water generated from the nearby heavy industrial setups ii intense evaporation of pond water which has linked with the groundwater recharge system and iii due to the return water from agricultural irrigation indeed irrigation water is subjected to evaporation and the fraction of water that returns in aquifer may be enriched in heavy isotopes the sample locations 21 22 23 27 28 29 in villages achheja bisnuli and dujana were collected from the vicinity of a surface reservoir i e pond which is probably linked to the groundwater recharge system groundwater recharge process depends on various factors i e aquifer types soil types topography relief and recharging source mukherjee et al 2012 with the increasing well depth enrichment was observed in δ18o and δ2h fig 4 a and b the hco3 shows no variation with well depth except for two locations whereas increasing trend with well depth was observed for ca2 fig 4 c and d a positive trend was observed in ec and δ18o and δ2h fig 4 e and f decrease enriched heavier isotopes δ18o and δ2h in the lighter isotope with the increasing well depth further explains the role of evaporation in the groundwater recharge system besides this increasing value of ec with enriched δ18o and δ2h value could be due to the carbonate co3 2 dissolution as a weathering process in the surveyed area detailed weathering process has been explained in section 3 4 in fig 4 g h δ2h and δ18o plotted against cl present in the groundwater to correlate enrichment in heavy isotopes with cl as a possible driving factor of salinity ingress the enrichment of δ2h and δ18o seems to be associated with the increase in cl concentration in the well locations 21 30 31 32 and 33 suggesting evaporation as the main active process involved in the increase of salinity of waters at these locations the spatial distribution maps of tubewell depth δ18o δ2h and d excess have been shown in fig 5 which further supports the explanation of isotopic enrichment in the surveyed area the d excess value varied from 10 5 to 9 5 with the mean value of 0 4 4 9 lower d excess observed in the sampled area is due to the high evaporation rate in order to check the connectivity among varying well depths in aquifers a bivariate plot of δ18o and δ2h was constructed fig 6 three different well depths were distinguished in the surveyed area namely shallow 11 20 m middle 20 40 m and deeper depth 50 m the slope of shallow 11 20 m depth and middle aquifer 20 40 m depth was very close 4 82 and 5 02 with the intercepts of 19 21 and 17 53 respectively the deeper aquifer 50 m was not included for this explanation due to the less number of samples the intercept of shallow depth tube well is more negative than the middle depth which is due to the higher evaporation rate as compared to middle depth however the closeness of slopes and its intercepts indicate tight interlinkage between shallow and middle tubewell depths in these aquifers 3 4 weathering processes and solute acquisition weathering and solute exchange processes control the chemical composition of groundwater by solute acquisition mechanism the ion exchange procedure of water can be described by chloroalkaline indices cai or schoeller index schoeller 1977 the cai shows dual properties can be positive or negative during the exchange of na and k by mg and ca in water the ratio will be positive which indicates the occurrence of base exchange if the ratio is found to be negative there will be chloroalkaline disequilibrium and the cation anion exchange reaction will occur results from the study revealed that 76 of the groundwater samples exhibit negative schoeller index demonstrating the cation anion exchange reactions while 24 of the samples showed positive values depicting the base exchange reactions fig s1 supplementary information on bivariate mixing diagrams fig 7 a and b of na normalized ca versus na normalized mg and hco3 indicated an equal contribution of silicate and carbonate type weathering on the global average weathering system in the ground water origin of suspended components can be estimated by the relative quantity of individual ions and inter elemental correlation the plot of ca mg versus total cations tz fig 8a demonstrates that plotted points come within the reach of 1 1 equiline suggesting significant input of ca and mg and hence the dominance of carbonate weathering over silicate weathering the average value of ratio ca mg versus na k 3 11 also supported the fact that carbonate weathering regulated the chemical composition primarily than the silicate weathering to estimate the significance of cations by silicate weathering na k tz plot can be employed stallard and edmond 1983 the plot of na k vs tz implies that plotted points fell beyond the reach of 1 1 equiline indicating a very little role of na and k to the suspended ions from the weathering of silicates fig 8b the calculated si values are given in table 2 it can be observed that groundwater ranged from virtual equilibrium to slightly supersaturated with respect to carbonate phases like aragonite caco3 calcite caco3 and dolomite camg co3 2 this led to the precipitation of carbonate phases in the aquifer whereas it is undersaturated with na and k containing minerals like albite naalsi3o8 and illite k0 6mg0 25al2 3si3 5o10 oh 2 3 5 groundwater classification and suitability for various purposes piper diagram fig 9 showed heterogeneous water type and sufficient recharge mixing of groundwater from different aquifers layer it was observed that 15 of the groundwater samples tend to fell into mg hco3 water type whereas 52 of the groundwater samples fell into ca hco3 water type and 33 of the groundwater samples fell in the na hco3 water type the source of na and k in the samples may be because of weathering of minerals containing na and k and industrial or agricultural activities guo and wang 2004 singh et al 2006 the lower left triangle shows that ca2 and mg2 formed equal contribution fig 9 few samples well locations 7 27 30 31 32 and 33 formed a separate group supporting the fact of that evaporation as the primary processes involved in enhancing the salinity of waters at these locations also see fig 4 g and h the tds level ranged from 232 to 1570 mg l results from the table 3 revealed that out of 33 samples 15 samples fell into the desirable category and 13 samples lie in the permissible range for drinking category while 5 samples are suitable only for agriculture use on the basis of tds level of analyzed water 85 of the samples fell into the category of fresh water and 15 of the samples well locations 7 30 31 32 and 33 fell into the brackish water category freeze and cherry 1979 the water hardness can be described as the concentration of multivalent cations i e ca2 and mg2 present in water according to sawyer and mccarty 1967 four classes were proposed as shown in table 3 the results depicted that 3 of the samples have total hardness values less than 75 mg l and can be classified under the soft category 39 of the samples are slightly hard water while 42 are moderately hard and 15 of the samples come under the category of very hard water the hardness of water can inhibit the formation of lather with soap and enhance the boiling point of water who 2011 increased concentration of cl in water may be due to the anthropogenic sources such as agricultural runoff domestic and industrial wastes appelo and postma 1993 a very low cl concentration was observed in few water samples on the basis of cl concentration stuyfzand 1989 has categorized the groundwater in six classes ranging from fresh to hyperhaline table 3 the results of the analyzed samples show that about 15 of the water samples were under extremely fresh 55 fell in the very fresh and 30 of the samples in the fresh category the water indices such as na ec rsc sar pi mh ki tds and total water hardness twh are important in the estimation of a suitability of groundwater for the agricultural use these indices were applied on the solute chemistry of groundwater from the surveyed area and are represented in table s2 in supplementary information estimation of the level of na is an essential parameter in the classification of water for irrigation practices due to the high reactivity of na with soil and alteration of its structure reduction in the permeability and aeration overall affecting the plant growth karanth 1987 the na level is normally described in terms of percentage of na the na of the samples were calculated and shown in table s2 in supplementary information the na ranged from 11 94 to 64 35 according to the bis 1991 standard only up to 60 na in groundwater is suggested for irrigation water the results revealed that out of 33 samples 94 of the samples were in good agreement to the bis 1991 standard value and was found to be safe for the irrigation purpose while only 6 of the samples were unsuitable the quality of groundwater samples was analyzed by employing the plot of investigative data on wilcox 1955 diagram relating na and ec wilcox plot has been represented in fig s2 in supplementary information the results from wilcox diagram depicted that 61 samples fell under excellent to good type 24 fell into good to permissible type 3 fit into the permissible to doubtful type 9 in the doubtful to unsuitable type and 3 in the unsuitable type for irrigation usage the higher ratio of the sum of hco3 and co3 2 over ca mg influence the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes the rsc has been calculated to observe the effects of co3 2 and hco3 and is represented in table s2 in supplementary information the calculated values of rsc for groundwater samples ranged from 7 84 to 5 2 results show that about 33 of the water samples were under the safe category 18 were marginally suitable and 49 of the samples were unsuitable for irrigation use high rsc value of groundwater may enhance the adsorption of na on soil eaton 1950 the relative activity of na or alkali hazard in the water for irrigation is determined by sar the sar values of irrigation water have a direct relationship with the extent to which na is adsorbed by the soil if the water utilized for irrigation purpose contains elevated na and low ca2 concentration in that case exchangeable ca2 complex can substitute na with base exchange reaction in water this process can lead to the damage of soil structure due to the dispersion of clay particles the calculated value of sar ranged from 0 13 to 1 06 in table s2 in supplementary information all the samples were found to be in good agreement with the sar value of 10 richards 1954 and are safe for irrigation practices the permeability index described by doneen 1964 denoted the suitability of groundwater and is used to classify the irrigation water into three classes such as class i class ii and class iii class i and class ii types of water with 75 or more of maximum permeability index while class iii types of water with 25 were of good quality for irrigation purposes fig s3 in supplementary information the mh values that were reported 50 were regarded as unsafe and inappropriate for irrigation use szabolcs and darab 1964 the results showed that 79 samples had mh below 50 which were found to be safe while 21 of the samples were unsafe for irrigation purpose 4 conclusions the results indicated neutral to moderately basic nature of groundwater and reducing environmental conditions of the aquifer in the study area an elevated level of tds was observed at few locations groundwater was found to be contaminated with f at two locations majority of the samples fell below the gmwl and lmwl indicating enrichment of heavier isotope δ18o in the aquifers due to the evaporation loss of water during aquifer recharge the lower slope of groundwater as compared to lmwl also indicated the evaporative loss of groundwater it was also supported by a bivariate plot of stable isotopes with ec and cl the closeness of slope and intercept of shallow and middle depth aquifer indicates tight interlinkage between them approximately 76 of the samples showed a cation anion exchange while 24 showed base exchange reactions are taking place in the groundwater both type of weathering silicate and carbonate controlling the groundwater compositions the groundwater was ca hco3 mg hco3 and na hco3 type different water quality indices viz residual sodium carbonate kelly index permeability index magnesium hazard and chloroalkaline indices showed

12326,re aeration is the natural phenomenon responsible for the generation of oxygen through the air water interface advection dispersion and transient storage reactions the rate of re aeration changes significantly when these reactions get coupled with the wastewater pollutants from domestic industrial and agricultural discharges re aeration coefficient k2 is the function of water quality and hydraulic parameters need to be evaluated to predict the water quality predictive equations available for the assessment of re aeration coefficient are based on only hydraulic parameters and are empirically evaluated using local conditions therefore a model is required that is capable of evaluating coefficient based on both the hydraulic and water quality parameters in this study multivariate linear regression mlr is used for the prediction of re aeration coefficient in the stretch of river yamuna the selected stretch of river extended from north to south in delhi india five models are designed using different combinations of parameters the developed models are trained tested and validated using experimental data of five years performance of models were evaluated using coefficient of determination r2 correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse results indicate that the mlr model developed using water quality and hydraulic parameters produces the most accurate correlation between the observed and predicted re aeration coefficient correlation coefficient obtained for the best fit model was 0 896 graphical abstract fx1 keywords re aeration coefficient mlr advection water quality 1 introduction urban hydrology becomes the complex process with the significant variation in flow and deterioration in water quality due to increasing anthropogenic activities schirmer et al 2013 abrupt variation occurs in flow with the release of domestic agricultural and industrial wastewater through drains tributaries during the low flow period parmar and keshari 2012 and abstraction of freshwater for the water supply to the adjoining areas low flow in rivers and discharge of untreated wastewater have been the major reasons behind the vanishing of the river s ecosystem parmar 2008 kisi et al 2013 with the discharge of untreated or partially treated wastewater from different sources that contains higher concentration of chemical and biological impurities also hampers the water quality at spatial and temporal scales cpcb 2006 majorly biological waste is from urban distributed sources which joins the river and undergoes biological and chemical changes using dissolved oxygen concentration of dissolved oxygen indicates the health of the ecosystem hanbay et al 2008 and biochemical oxygen demand bod indicates the concentration of organic matter present in water dogan et al 2009 however due to spatial and temporal variations in hydrochemical and biological properties continuous and regular monitoring programmes are required to have reliable information about the water quality singh et al 2004 to maintain the ecology of river re aeration is the most important process re aeration is defined as the rate of transfer of oxygen from the atmosphere to water at the air water interface grace and imberger 2006 re aeration process aids to minimize the oxygen deficit and leads to several changes in the metabolism of stream izagirre et al 2008 aristegi et al 2009 the process is described by the rate of constants k2 as first order processes that is proportional to do deficit re aeration process mainly depends upon the degree of turbulence that can be measured directly however it is highly variable in both the space and time this makes it difficult to measure re aeration from stream turbulence tsivoglou et al 1969 thackston and krenkel 1969 thackston and dawson 2001 another method of re aeration measurement is through the identification of oxygen balance of river which is an indirect method and poorly understood st john et al 1984 moog and jirka 1995 haider et al 2003 using the chemical biological and hydraulic properties of water several methods have been developed to measure the re aeration coefficient k2 of river such as tracer gases tsivoglou 1967 rathbun et al 1978 empirical equations using hydraulic parameters melching and flores 1999 oxygen balance and diurnal variation in oxygen concentration hornberger and kelly 1975 mcbride 2002 benson et al 2014 used gas tracer technique to measure the re aeration rate and conducted experiments at different creeks in the sierra nevada of california results obtained from the experiments were also compared with the established empirical formulas which show poor correlation between the data for the prediction of re aeration coefficient numerous studies have been performed using predictive equations to measure the re aeration coefficient moog and jirka 1995 jha et al 2001 2004 jain and jha 2005 ugbebor et al 2012 applicability of predictive equations has been evaluated by moog and jirka 1995 using mean multiplicative error and observed high errors for equation for low slopes most of these equations are based on the stream hydraulic parameters such as depth velocity discharge and slope cox 2003b raymond et al 2012 however none of the previously developed equations able to predict the accurate re aeration coefficient and indicates that some more additional parameters should be considered in order to improve the accuracy wilson and macleod 1974 moog and jirka 1995 melching and flores 1999 haider et al 2013 benson et al 2014 deterministic models are more realistic for accurate prediction but require large amount of input data to simulate the water quality vieira et al 2013 however tradition method of data analysis are rarely being used now a days due to the involvement of large number of parameters causing variation in the water quality xiang et al 2006 with the use of artificial computing techniques challenges of hydrodynamic and water quality models can be minimized which has wide application in water resource related problems multivariate linear regression mlr is the most commonly used and accepted machine learning method it has a wide application in water related research to identify the direct relation between the predictor and response variable as it generates minimum data set of indicators doran and parkin 1996 using mlr all the variables can be incorporated in to single model for the estimation of degree of interaction between the variables mustapha and aris 2012 used mlr model to predict the pollution load in the jakara getsi river system chenini and khemiri 2009 also used the mlr model to investigate the relation between parameters using the hydro chemical data to quantify the composition of groundwater samples in maknassy basin central tunisia chen and liu 2015 developed a model using mlr to simulate the water quality of reservoir arora and keshari 2016 developed a re aeration model using mlr and established predictive equation water quality index was designed by nasir et al 2011 to predict the water quality of klang river malaysia using mlr model kumar and padhy 2014 have compared the various multivariate tools and their application on classification monitoring and assessment of surface water quality parameters all these studies indicate that mlr model can be used as a suitable tool for water quality modelling yet the design of adequate formulation for assessment of the re aeration coefficient remains a problem therefore present study was carried out with the objective to develop set of models using mlr to estimate the re aeration coefficient k2 that could be applicable to a wide range of study areas and identification of best fit model on the basis of their applicability and performance analysis using rmse r2 and r the model obtained can be coupled with the water quality model to design the pollution control strategies for the urban water management 2 material and methods

12326,re aeration is the natural phenomenon responsible for the generation of oxygen through the air water interface advection dispersion and transient storage reactions the rate of re aeration changes significantly when these reactions get coupled with the wastewater pollutants from domestic industrial and agricultural discharges re aeration coefficient k2 is the function of water quality and hydraulic parameters need to be evaluated to predict the water quality predictive equations available for the assessment of re aeration coefficient are based on only hydraulic parameters and are empirically evaluated using local conditions therefore a model is required that is capable of evaluating coefficient based on both the hydraulic and water quality parameters in this study multivariate linear regression mlr is used for the prediction of re aeration coefficient in the stretch of river yamuna the selected stretch of river extended from north to south in delhi india five models are designed using different combinations of parameters the developed models are trained tested and validated using experimental data of five years performance of models were evaluated using coefficient

correlation between the observed and predicted re aeration coefficient correlation coefficient obtained for the best fit model was 0 896 graphical abstract fx1 keywords re aeration coefficient mlr advection water quality 1 introduction urban hydrology becomes the complex process with the significant variation in flow and deterioration in water quality due to increasing anthropogenic activities schirmer et al 2013 abrupt variation occurs in flow with the release of domestic agricultural and industrial wastewater through drains tributaries during the low flow period parmar and keshari 2012 and abstraction of freshwater for the water supply to the adjoining areas low flow in rivers and discharge of untreated wastewater have been the major reasons behind the vanishing of the river s ecosystem parmar 2008 kisi et al 2013 with the discharge of untreated or partially treated wastewater from different sources that contains higher concentration of chemical and biological impurities also hampers the water quality at spatial and temporal scales cpcb 2006 majorly biological waste is from urban distributed sources which joins the river and undergoes biological and chemical changes using dissolved oxygen concentration of dissolved oxygen indicates the health of the ecosystem hanbay et al 2008 and biochemical oxygen demand bod indicates the concentration of organic matter present in water dogan et al 2009 however due to spatial and temporal variations in hydrochemical and biological properties continuous and regular monitoring programmes are required to have reliable information about the water quality singh et al 2004 to maintain the ecology of river re aeration is the most important process re aeration is defined as the rate of transfer of oxygen from the atmosphere to water at the air water interface grace and imberger 2006 re aeration process aids to minimize the oxygen deficit and leads to several changes in the metabolism of stream izagirre et al 2008 aristegi et al 2009 the process is described by the rate of constants k2 as first order processes that is proportional to do deficit re aeration process mainly depends upon the degree of turbulence that can be measured directly however it is highly variable in both the space and time this makes it difficult to measure re aeration from stream turbulence tsivoglou et al 1969 thackston and krenkel 1969 thackston and dawson 2001 another method of re aeration measurement is through the identification of oxygen balance of river which is an indirect method and poorly understood st john et al 1984 moog and jirka 1995 haider et al 2003 using the chemical biological and hydraulic properties of water several methods have been developed to measure the re aeration coefficient k2 of river such as tracer gases tsivoglou 1967 rathbun et al 1978 empirical equations using hydraulic parameters melching and flores 1999 oxygen balance and diurnal variation in oxygen concentration hornberger and kelly 1975 mcbride 2002 benson et al 2014 used gas tracer technique to measure the re aeration rate and conducted experiments at different creeks in the sierra nevada of california results obtained from the experiments were also compared with the established empirical formulas which show poor correlation between the data for the prediction of re aeration coefficient numerous studies have been performed using predictive equations to measure the re aeration coefficient moog and jirka 1995 jha et al 2001 2004 jain and jha 2005 ugbebor et al 2012 applicability of predictive equations has been evaluated by moog and jirka 1995 using mean multiplicative error and observed high errors for equation for low slopes most of these equations are based on the stream hydraulic parameters such as depth velocity discharge and slope cox 2003b raymond et al 2012 however none of the previously developed equations able to predict the accurate re aeration coefficient and indicates that some more additional parameters should be considered in order to improve the accuracy wilson and macleod 1974 moog and jirka 1995 melching and flores 1999 haider et al 2013 benson et al 2014 deterministic models are more realistic for accurate prediction but require large amount of input data to simulate the water quality vieira et al 2013 however tradition method of data analysis are rarely being used now a days due to the involvement of large number of parameters causing variation in the water quality xiang et al 2006 with the use of artificial computing techniques challenges of hydrodynamic and water quality models can be minimized which has wide application in water resource related problems multivariate linear regression mlr is the most commonly used and accepted machine learning method it has a wide application in water related research to identify the direct relation between the predictor and response variable as it generates minimum data set of indicators doran and parkin 1996 using mlr all the variables can be incorporated in to single model for the estimation of degree of interaction between the variables mustapha and aris 2012 used mlr model to predict the pollution load in the jakara getsi river system chenini and khemiri 2009 also used the mlr model to investigate the relation between parameters using the hydro chemical data to quantify the composition of groundwater samples in maknassy basin central tunisia chen and liu 2015 developed a model using mlr to simulate the water quality of reservoir arora and keshari 2016 developed a re aeration model using mlr and established predictive equation water quality index was designed by nasir et al 2011 to predict the water quality of klang river malaysia using mlr model kumar and padhy 2014 have compared the various multivariate tools and their application on classification monitoring and assessment of surface water quality parameters all these studies indicate that mlr model can be used as a suitable tool for water quality modelling yet the design of adequate formulation for assessment of the re aeration coefficient remains a problem therefore present study was carried out with the objective to develop set of models using mlr to estimate the re aeration coefficient k2 that could be applicable to a wide range of study areas and identification of best fit model on the basis of their applicability and performance analysis using rmse r2 and r the model obtained can be coupled with the water quality model to design the pollution control strategies for the urban water management 2 material and methods

12327,an attempt has been made to develop artificial neural network ann model for prediction of nitrate concentration in groundwater of kadava river basin nashik district maharashtra the study area lies between longitude 73 55 74 15 e and latitude 19 55 20 25 n river kadava is one of the tributary of godavari which originates in sahyadri hills and flows towards nw to se direction forty 40 representative groundwater samples were collected from dug bore wells and analyzed for major cations and anions during pre and post monsoon seasons of 2012 physicochemical results confirm that 67 50 and 75 of groundwater samples having no3 concentration beyond the permissible limit of the bis 45mg l in both the seasons the spatiotemporal analysis inferred that nitrate prone areas located in north and central part of the study area may be due to intense agriculture and overuse of nitrogen rich fertilizers and natural processes viz dissolution percolation and leaching the consumption of high nitrate containing water is harmful to human health consequently it reduces the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood and in infant causes methemoglobinemia in view of this the assessment and prediction of groundwater quality is an essential to predict the nitrate content to avoid future consequences therefore there is need to develop a consistent precise and resilient predictive model the present study utilizes the algorithms viz levenberg marquardt three layer back propagation traditional back propagation algorithm resilient back propagation with and without weight algorithm smallest absolute derivative sag and smallest learning rate slr for nitrate prediction the levenberg marquardt three layer back propagation algorithm was found effective with 7 and 8 input neurons for pre and

preferred outputs the ann will be standardized the networks were usually balanced according to the differences and comparisons between the requested and network outputs simulation continued till the outputs match with goal in fact the training algorithm is trying to minimize the errors and the differences between output vectors in multilayer perceptron the error function is alternative to the weighting coefficients initially the error values are calculated in the outer layers and feedback to the previous layers to change the weighting coefficients and errors in the training process the network is being trained to identify the resemblance between input vectors and reach the classification the ann model requires exact technical components for design development and expansion generally to reach the goals of different ann structures usually tried to select and use the appropriate network with computed values of error during the training phase the knowledge of an environment is acquired from the observed data an iterative learning algorithm is applied to the number of input variables to find the optimal adjustment of the network sahoo et al 2005 generally entering the raw data directly reduces the accuracy and speed of ann model therefore to avoid such problems the input data should be standardized and optimized which prevent the excessive reduction in weights to design ann models it is essential to distribute the data into two parts 1 training data 2 testing data the training data have been used to find the relation between inputs and observed outputs the validation data are used to control and monitor the training procedure and the test data are used to evaluate the performance of the network the normalized data is used to increase the speed and accuracy of ann s performance actually anns are usually of network structure that is a prior set by the designer and their weights are automatically trained using an optimization algorithm like the very popular back propagation algorithm huang and huang 1990 and the levenberg marquardt optimization wang and huang 2008 in addition to this the resilient backpropagation neural network can be successfully employed for the prediction of parameters with confidence sharma et al 2008 finally to authenticate the appropriateness and optimization of model the coefficient of determination r2 residual mean squared error rmse and mean absolute relative error mare can be used many researchers have been used ann model to predict the hydrochemical results and to forecast the engineering and optimizing problems ehteshami et al 2016 wagh et al 2016b barzegar and moghaddam 2016 almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 the ann architecture for nitrate prediction was decided by the performance based on r2 rmse and mare values of respective networks the present study utilizes the algorithms viz levenberg marquardt three layer back propagation traditional back propagation algorithm resilient back propagation with and without weight algorithm smallest absolute derivative and smallest learning rate for nitrate prediction the proposed algorithms have been used to obtain optimal ann model for nitrate prediction by following steps step 3 1 1 initially correlation analysis is performed to select the significant input variables for the architecture of model step 3 1 2 the data has been splited in two sets training 70 and testing 30 step 3 1 3 multilayer perceptron mlp with back propagation bp algorithm has been adopted in designing of different structures of the neural network sreekanth et al 2009 in the multilayer neural network depending on the pattern of relation between the materials input is put in first layer and the output in the last layer by means of neurons weights bias and the activity algorithm in the middle layer s the explicit expression for an output value of a three layered mlp is given by nourani et al 2013 wagh et al 2016a eq 1 1 y k f 0 i 1 m n w kj f h i 1 n n w ji x i w j 0 w k 0 where w ji is a weight in the hidden layer connecting the i th neuron in the input layer and the j th neuron in the hidden layer w j0 is the bias for the j th hidden neuron w kj is a weight in the output layer connecting the j th neuron in the hidden layer and the k th neuron in the output layer w k0 is the bias for the k th output neuron f h is the activation function of the hidden neuron f o is the activation function for the output neuron x i is i th input variable for input layer n n and m n are the number of the neurons in the input and hidden layers y j is computed output variable step 3 1 4 the input data was standardized and normalized before subjecting to training and testing data set to increase the speed accuracy and performance of ann by eq 2 2 x ˆ x x min x max x min step 3 1 5 further the denormalization transforming into the actual value and computed by the following eq 3 3 x x ˆ x max x min x min where x original value x min and x max minimum and maximum values in the series x ˆ the normalized data step 3 1 6 r program has been executed to find the optimal ann model a vector is specified by number of hidden layers and hidden neurons in each layer by assuming 1 10 hidden neurons on trial and error basis the levenberg marquardt back propagation algorithm with weight backtracking algorithm and cross entropy differentiable error function with logistic function eq 4 is used as an activation function 4 f x 1 1 e x generally logistic function is used in ann to identify nonlinearity in the model it computes a linear combination of its input signals and applies a logistic function to the result this function satisfies a property between the derivative and itself hence it is easy to compute and perform alternatives to activation functions based on dot products are activation functions based on distance measures the weight vectors of neurons represent the data in the input space and i th neuron is calculated from the distance of the weight w i from the input x to determine the distance by applying different measures viz spatial maximum minimum manhattan euclidean distance etc in ann model there are numbers of activation functions such as linear logistic gaussian tangent or hyperbolic unit step or sign function are commonly used the role of the activation function in a neural network is to produce a non linear decision boundary via non linear combinations of the weighted inputs therefore in this study logistic function is preferred fausett and fausett 1994 the general ann structure is represented in fig 2 step 3 1 7 mathematically ann model is validated by r2 rmse and mare values the processes have been simulated to obtain least rmse and mare and r2 values 1 with least number of steps and errors to conclude the process these are calculated by the following eqs 5 7 5 r 2 i 1 n p i p o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 o i o 2 1 6 rmse n 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 0 5 7 mare 1 n i 1 n o i p i o i 100 where n is the number of observations p i is the predicted values o i is the observed data p and o are the average values for p i and o i further the ann model with the possible optimal hidden neuron layer is obtained through step 3 1 7 for levenberg marquardt back propagation algorithm traditional back propagation algorithm resilient back propagation with and without weight algorithm smallest absolute derivative and smallest learning rate modified globally convergent algorithms corner 2015 further to find the best optimal ann model through different algorithms were computed to identify most suitable algorithm 4 results and discussions the results were discussed in three sub sections viz groundwater quality exploratory statistical analysis and artificial neural network modelling 4 1 groundwater quality the physicochemical properties of groundwater samples n 40 are summarized in table 1 representing the minimum maximum and average concentration of different parameters for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons of 2012 physicochemical result corroborates that nitrate concentration varied from 12 94mg l to 69 76mg l avg 49 08mg l and 31 62 66 22mg l avg of 52 61mg l in pre post monsoon season respectively the 67 5 and 75 groundwater samples exceeding the bis permissible limit 45mg l of nitrate in both the seasons fig 3 the excessive nitrate may be contributed from agriculture and domestic waste percolating into the aquifer systems such high nitrate content in drinking water can cause methemoglobinemia the toxicity of nitrate increases when bacteria coverts the nitrate in more toxic form in the stomach of infants it also reduces the body s ability to carry oxygen to body tissue resulting shortness of breath and blueness of skin leads to coma and eventually death comly 1945 uhlman and artiola 2011 nitrate is the primary form of nitrogen in natural waters tutmez and hatipoglu 2010 the nitrate is groundwater contaminant of particular concern because of its solubility and mobility in addition to solubility it is very stable meaning it rarely combines with other compounds it has less affinity to soil particles like other contaminants consequently leached into soil with infiltrated rainfall or irrigated water almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 in case of the study area majority of the groundwater samples exceeded the permissible limit in northern and central part owing to intense agriculture and fast recharge of shallow aquifers with nitrate enriched water fig 4 a b 4 2 exploratory statistical analysis pearson s correlation coefficient gives an idea about the degree and direction of correlation which helps to recognize the associated water quality parameters the correlation matrix of the hydrochemical data has been represented in fig 5 a b for pre and post monsoon season of 2012 correlation coefficient 0 5 is considered weak 0 5 0 7 as moderate and 0 7 as strong correlation correlation analysis is used to identify the associated parameters which help to reduce the number of independent variables for the architecture of ann model the fig 5 a illustrates that ec has strong correlation with tds r 0 72 na r 0 72 cl r 0 77 and moderately correlated with th r 0 65 and mg r 0 68 tds shows strong affiliation with th mg na cl and so4 r 0 92 0 91 0 95 0 94 0 74 respectively total hardness is strongly correlated with magnesium r 0 97 sodium r 0 77 chloride r 0 89 and sulfate r 0 71 magnesium prove strong association with sodium r 0 78 and chloride r 0 92 while moderately correlated with sulfate r 0 66 sodium and chloride shows strong association r 0 92 and moderate link with sulfate r 0 64 in addition chloride has moderate correlation with sulfate r 0 58 the fig 5 b shows that ec has positive correlation with tds 0 76 th 0 65 mg 0 59 na 0 63 cl 0 72 hco3 0 50 and so4 0 57 the high positive correlation between ec and tds with na ca mg cl th and so4 identifies the salinity affecting parameters and dissolution of salts increases the electrical conductivity in the study area total dissolved solids tds are strongly correlated with th 0 84 mg 0 84 na 0 86 cl 0 95 hco3 0 55 and so4 0 81 revealing their contribution to tds total hardness is contributed by dissolved salts of calcium and magnesium supported by the positive correlation of th with magnesium 0 93 chloride 0 86 sulfate 0 72 and moderate correlation with bicarbonate 0 53 these ions are possibly derived from the geochemical processes like ion exchange and silicate weathering the moderate correlation of so4 with ec r 0 57 tds r 0 81 th r 0 72 mg r 0 69 na r 0 66 and cl r 0 68 indicates the agricultural activities are affecting the groundwater quality cl having strong correlation with ec r 0 72 tds r 0 95 th r 0 86 mg r 0 89 and with na r 0 83 is signifying the dissolution of evaporates the nitrate data reveals that samples are associated and hence not independent such type of data is known as paired data in such cases paired t test may applicable with the assumption of normality and equality of population variances fig 6 a h clearly shows that data lacks the symmetry in both the seasons which is a positively skewed and indicated through histogram density plot box plot and qq plot to check the normality of data shapiro wilk test is evaluated for pre p value 0 01591 and post p value 0 00243 monsoon seasons indicates that data comes from non normal population thereafter non parametric wilcoxon signed rank test alternative for paired t test is applied the obtained result shows that there is no significance difference in no3 concentration among pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons p value 0 2016 4 3 artificial neural network modelling the optimal ann models for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons of 2012 are illustrated in fig 7 a d represents the input variables hidden neuron and nitrate as output variable also it shows the auto generated weights on the arrows of the network and the blue line with 1 indicates the corresponding biased in the model the minimum amount of bias tends the model become more consistent and efficient the fig 7 a and b represents the 7 input variables and 6 hidden neurons and no3 as output variable in train and test data sets of pre monsoon season the fig 7 c and d represent the 8 input variables 6 hidden neurons and no3 as output variable in train and test data sets of post monsoon season these input layers of the respective seasons were identified based on step 3 1 1 the ec tds th mg na cl and so4 pre monsoon ec tds th mg na cl hco3 and so4 post monsoon parameters were selected as independent input variables and nitrate as a dependent output variable according to step 3 1 2 40 data points were divided in two sets training 70 28 samples and testing 30 12 samples through step 3 1 7 it is found that 6 neurons show the optimum r2 rmse and mare values of training and testing data sets for pre and post monsoon seasons further levenberg marquardt three layer back propagation traditional back propagation algorithm resilient back propagation with and without weight algorithm smallest absolute derivative sag and smallest learning rate slr algorithms were applied on the dataset and generated results are tabulated in table 2 on the basis of r2 rmse and mare values of training and testing data sets illustrates the optimality of the proposed model however the efficiency and precision level of model increases with reducing error values table 2 the efficiency and validation of the levenberg marquardt back propagation algorithm is identified more consistent precise and resilient based on the least error as compared with results obtained through the other algorithms 5 conclusions in kadava river basin 67 5 and 75 groundwater sample exceeds the bis permissible limit 45mg l of nitrate in both the seasons due to percolation of agriculture and domestic waste into the aquifer systems nitrate contamination in central and northern parts was mainly owed to nitrogen loadings from fertilizers and manures application and which exceeded the maximum permissible limit of the bis at many sampling locations in this study levenberg marquardt three layer back propagation traditional back propagation algorithm resilient back propagation with and without weight algorithm smallest absolute derivative and smallest learning rate algorithm were used to predict the nitrate concentration the developed ann model is capable of predicting nitrate concentration from the input variables such as ec tds th mg na cl hco3 and so4 the optimal ann model consists of 7 and 8 input neurons 6 hidden neurons and nitrate as output variable in pre and post monsoon seasons of 2012 the proposed levenberg marquardt three layers back propagation algorithm could be used as consistent precise and resilient against uncertainty as compared with other algorithms the model exhibits good generalization and performance based on r2 rmse and mare values the proposed model may helpful for similar studies in other areas to predict the water contamination problems the local authorities may utilize this model for better planning and management of groundwater resources in future to overcome nitrate contamination the comprehensive model with various inputs including agricultural climate land use or land cover data

representative groundwater samples were collected from dug bore wells and analyzed for major cations and anions during pre and post monsoon seasons of 2012 physicochemical results confirm that 67 50 and 75 of groundwater samples having no3 concentration beyond the permissible limit of the bis 45mg l in both the seasons the spatiotemporal analysis inferred that nitrate prone areas located in north and central part of the study area may be due to intense agriculture and overuse of nitrogen rich fertilizers and natural processes viz dissolution percolation and leaching the consumption of high nitrate containing water is harmful to human health consequently it reduces the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood and in infant causes methemoglobinemia in view of this the assessment and prediction of groundwater quality is an essential to predict the nitrate content to avoid future consequences therefore there is need to develop a consistent precise and resilient predictive model the

performance of ann by eq 2 2 x ˆ x x min x max x min step 3 1 5 further the denormalization transforming into the actual value and computed by the following eq 3 3 x x ˆ x max x min x min where x original value x min and x max minimum and maximum values in the series x ˆ the normalized data step 3 1 6 r program has been executed to find the optimal ann model a vector is specified by number of hidden layers and hidden neurons in each layer by assuming 1 10 hidden neurons on trial and error basis the levenberg marquardt back propagation algorithm with weight backtracking algorithm and cross entropy differentiable error function with logistic function eq 4 is used as an activation function 4 f x 1 1 e x generally logistic function is used in ann to identify nonlinearity in the model it computes a linear combination of its input signals and applies a logistic function to the result this function satisfies a property between the derivative and itself hence it is easy to compute and perform alternatives to activation functions based on dot products are activation functions based on distance measures the weight vectors of neurons represent the data in the input space and i th neuron is calculated from the distance of the weight w i from the input x to determine the distance by applying different measures viz spatial maximum minimum manhattan euclidean distance etc in ann model there are numbers of activation functions such as linear logistic gaussian tangent or hyperbolic unit step or sign function are commonly used the role of the activation function in a neural network is to produce a non linear decision boundary via non linear combinations of the weighted inputs therefore in this study logistic function is preferred fausett and fausett 1994 the general ann structure is represented in fig 2 step 3 1 7 mathematically ann model is validated by r2 rmse and mare values the processes have been simulated to obtain least rmse and mare and r2 values 1 with least

hidden neuron layer is obtained through step 3 1 7 for levenberg marquardt back propagation algorithm traditional back propagation algorithm resilient back propagation with and without weight algorithm smallest absolute derivative and smallest learning rate modified globally convergent algorithms corner 2015 further to find the best optimal ann model through different algorithms were computed to identify most suitable algorithm 4 results and discussions the results were discussed in three sub sections viz groundwater quality exploratory statistical analysis and artificial neural network modelling 4 1 groundwater quality the physicochemical properties of groundwater samples n 40 are summarized in table 1 representing the minimum maximum and average concentration of different parameters for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons of 2012 physicochemical result corroborates that nitrate concentration varied from 12 94mg l to 69 76mg l avg 49 08mg l and 31 62 66 22mg l avg of 52 61mg l in pre post monsoon season respectively the 67 5 and 75 groundwater samples exceeding the bis permissible limit 45mg l of nitrate in both the seasons fig 3 the excessive nitrate may be contributed from agriculture and domestic waste percolating into the aquifer systems such high nitrate content in drinking water can cause methemoglobinemia the toxicity of nitrate increases when bacteria coverts the nitrate in more toxic form in the stomach of infants it also reduces the body s ability to carry oxygen to body tissue resulting shortness of breath and blueness of skin leads to coma and eventually death comly 1945 uhlman and artiola 2011 nitrate is the primary form of nitrogen in natural waters tutmez and hatipoglu 2010 the nitrate is groundwater contaminant of particular concern because of its solubility and mobility in addition to solubility it is very stable meaning it rarely combines with other compounds it has less affinity to soil particles like other contaminants consequently leached into soil with infiltrated rainfall or irrigated water almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 in case of the study area majority of the groundwater samples exceeded the permissible limit in northern and central part owing to intense agriculture and fast recharge of shallow aquifers with nitrate enriched water fig 4 a b 4 2 exploratory statistical analysis pearson s correlation coefficient gives an idea about the degree and direction of correlation which helps to recognize the associated water quality parameters the correlation matrix of the hydrochemical data has been represented in fig 5 a b for pre and post monsoon season of 2012 correlation coefficient 0 5 is considered weak 0 5 0 7 as moderate and 0 7 as strong correlation correlation analysis is used to identify the associated parameters which help to reduce the number of independent variables for the architecture of ann model the fig 5 a illustrates that ec has strong correlation with tds r 0 72 na r 0 72 cl r 0 77 and moderately correlated with th r 0 65 and mg r 0 68 tds shows strong affiliation with th mg na cl and so4 r 0 92 0 91 0 95 0 94 0 74 respectively total hardness is strongly correlated with magnesium r 0 97 sodium r 0 77 chloride r 0 89 and sulfate r 0 71 magnesium prove strong association with sodium r 0 78 and chloride r 0 92 while moderately correlated with sulfate r 0 66 sodium and chloride shows strong association r 0 92 and moderate link with sulfate r 0 64 in addition chloride has moderate correlation with sulfate r 0 58 the fig 5 b shows that ec has positive correlation with tds 0 76 th 0 65 mg 0 59 na 0 63 cl 0 72 hco3 0 50 and so4 0 57 the high positive correlation between ec and tds with na ca mg cl th and so4 identifies the salinity affecting parameters and dissolution of salts increases the electrical conductivity in the study area total dissolved solids tds are strongly correlated with th 0 84 mg 0 84 na 0 86 cl 0 95 hco3 0 55 and so4 0 81 revealing their contribution to tds total hardness is contributed by dissolved salts of calcium and magnesium supported by the positive correlation of th with magnesium 0 93 chloride 0 86 sulfate 0 72 and moderate correlation with bicarbonate 0 53 these ions are possibly derived from the geochemical processes like ion exchange and silicate weathering the moderate correlation of so4 with ec r 0 57 tds r 0 81 th r 0 72 mg r 0 69 na r 0 66 and cl r 0 68 indicates the agricultural activities are affecting the groundwater quality cl having strong correlation with ec r 0 72 tds r 0 95 th r 0 86 mg r 0 89 and with na r 0 83 is signifying the dissolution of evaporates the nitrate data reveals that samples are associated and hence not independent such type of data is known as paired data in such cases paired t test may applicable with the assumption of normality and equality of population variances fig 6 a h clearly shows that data lacks the symmetry in both the seasons which is a positively skewed and indicated through histogram density plot box plot and qq plot to check the normality of data shapiro wilk test is evaluated for pre p value 0 01591 and post p value 0 00243 monsoon seasons indicates that data comes from non normal population thereafter non parametric wilcoxon signed rank test alternative for paired t test is applied the obtained result shows that there is no significance difference in no3 concentration among pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons p value 0 2016 4 3 artificial neural network modelling the optimal ann models for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons of 2012 are illustrated in fig 7 a d represents the input variables hidden neuron and nitrate as output variable also it shows the auto generated weights on the arrows of the network and the blue line with 1 indicates the corresponding biased in the model the minimum amount of bias tends the model become more consistent and efficient the fig 7 a and b represents the 7 input variables and 6 hidden neurons and no3 as output variable in train and test data sets of pre monsoon season the fig 7 c and d represent the 8 input variables 6 hidden neurons and no3 as output variable in train and test data sets of post monsoon season these input layers of the respective seasons were identified based on step 3 1 1 the ec tds th mg na cl and so4 pre monsoon ec tds th mg na cl hco3 and so4 post monsoon parameters were selected as independent input variables and nitrate as a dependent output variable according to step 3 1 2 40 data points were divided in two sets training 70 28 samples and testing 30 12 samples through step 3 1 7 it is found that 6 neurons show the optimum r2 rmse and mare values of training and testing data sets for pre and post monsoon seasons further levenberg marquardt three layer back propagation traditional back propagation algorithm resilient back propagation with and without weight algorithm smallest absolute derivative sag and smallest learning rate slr algorithms were applied on the dataset and generated results are tabulated in table 2 on the basis of r2 rmse and mare values of training and testing data sets illustrates the optimality of the proposed model however the efficiency and precision level of model increases with reducing error values table 2 the efficiency and validation of the levenberg marquardt back propagation algorithm is identified more consistent precise and resilient based on the least error as compared with results obtained through the other algorithms 5 conclusions in kadava river basin 67 5 and 75 groundwater sample exceeds the bis permissible limit 45mg l of nitrate in both the seasons due to percolation of agriculture and domestic waste into the aquifer systems nitrate contamination in central and northern parts was mainly owed to nitrogen loadings from fertilizers and manures application and which exceeded the maximum permissible limit of the bis at many sampling locations in this study levenberg marquardt three layer back propagation traditional back propagation algorithm resilient back propagation with and without weight algorithm smallest absolute derivative and smallest learning rate algorithm were used to predict the nitrate concentration the developed ann model is capable of predicting nitrate concentration from the input variables such as ec tds th mg na cl hco3 and so4 the optimal ann model consists of 7 and 8 input neurons 6 hidden neurons and nitrate as output variable in pre and post monsoon seasons of 2012 the proposed levenberg marquardt three layers back propagation algorithm could be used as consistent precise and resilient against uncertainty as compared with other algorithms the model exhibits good generalization and performance based on r2 rmse and mare values the proposed model may helpful for similar studies in other areas to predict the water contamination problems the local authorities may utilize this model for better planning and management of groundwater resources in future to overcome nitrate contamination the comprehensive model with various inputs including agricultural climate land use or land cover data physicochemical characteristics etc of the aquifer will assist to predict the nitrate content with more accuracy to ascertain the water quality in depth acknowledgements the authors are grateful to

12328,fluoride f is a geogenic contaminant which is reported to be hazardous for human health considering the present groundwater f contamination scenario particularly in india development of a technology for efficient f removal is an urgent need the present study assessed the suitability of nanosized rice husk biochar in removal of f from aqueous solution the nanoscale adsorbent prepared by a facile technique showed very high removal efficiency 90 removal using minimum adsorbent dose 1gl 1 and less contact time period 60min the sorption equilibrium data fitted well to both freundlich r2

adsorption capacity as compared to other biomass based adsorbents the sorption data showed better fit to the pseudo second order kinetics as compared to the pseudo first order kinetic model the novel nanomaterial derived from an agricultural waste product could remove f from aqueous solution in a promising and cost effective way indicating that it might be an excellent choice for the removal of f from contaminated groundwater graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater fluoride biochar nano removal rise husk removal 1 introduction pure water is scarce and is not easily available to the people in many parts of the world the water may be contaminated by natural or anthropogenic sources one such notorious yet common geogenic groundwater contaminant is fluoride f which is present in rock minerals or soil is substituted by hydroxyl ions oh under redox conditions resulting in the release of f ions to the groundwater maheshwari et al 2006 mohan et al 2007 fluoride has gained significance due to its dual influences on human beings in lower concentrations it is a vital nutrient which is essential for bone formation prevention of tooth decay etc whereas in higher concentrations it causes fluorosis and in extreme cases even death mondal et al 2015 in groundwater the natural f concentration depends largely on the physical and chemical characteristics of the aquifer temperature geological conditions the porosity and acidity of the soil and rocks the presence of other elements and the well depth due to the influence of a number of factors the f concentration in groundwater can range from 1mgl 1 to 35mgl 1 karthikeyan et al 2007 the acceptable f concentration range in drinking water is 0 5 1 5mgl 1 approximately 260 million people worldwide in 30 countries are drinking water with f 1 5mgl 1 mondal et al 2015 in india groundwater f contamination is a major problem in 17 states of 29 and endemic fluorosis is found to affect about one million people especially in andhra pradesh assam gujarat rajasthan tamil nadu and uttar pradesh mangla 1991 unicef 1999 defluoridation of drinking water is generally performed either by precipitation or adsorption adsorption is one of the widely used methods owing to its simplicity effectiveness as well as the availability of a wide range of sorbents abdel salam et al 2011 borah et al 2018 karthikeyan et al 2007 kumar et al 2016 ji et al 2007 meenakshi and viswanathan 2007 mohan et al 2014 mondal et al 2013 saikia et al 2017 sathish et al 2007 uddin 2017 the most commonly used adsorbent activated carbon has efficient defluoridation capacity karthikeyan et al 2007 but its main disadvantages are the high treatment cost and difficult regeneration increasing the cost of water treatment in large scale applications thus there is need for other sorbents which are of inexpensive material and does not require any expensive additional pretreatment stage a successful adsorption process depends not only on adsorption performance of the sorbents but also on the constant supply of the raw materials for the process therefore it is preferable to use low cost adsorbents such as an industrial waste natural ores and agricultural byproducts rice husk is one of the most widely available agricultural wastes in a number of rice producing countries around the world including india worldwide the annual rice husk yield is about 80 million tones and over 97 of the husk is generated in the developing countries wong et al 2003 rice husk has widely been used as an adsorbent for removing different cations including heavy metals ye et al 2010 akhtar et al 2006 and various dyes abdel salam et al 2011 biochar a co product from thermal degradation of organic materials such as forest crop manure residue wood and other materials is a carbon rich porous material with oxygen functional groups and aromatic surfaces ahmad et al 2012 goswami et al 2016 mohan et al 2014 owing to its high surface to volume ratio and strong affinity for non polar substances such as dioxins pahs and other compounds biochar can be a potential sorbent for various environmental contaminants ahmad et al 2012 cao et al 2009 gupta et al 2006 mohan et al 2014 however the application of rice husk biochar for removal of f is very limited moreover the nanoscale materials poses high surface to volume ratio and is no exception making a considerable impact on our everyday lives characteristics such as large surface area high reactivity and high specificity exert nanoparticles as excellent material for water remediation applications keeping in mind these aspects a removal study has been designed using a novel nanosized biochar derived from rice husk our preliminary investigations indicated that rice husk contains plentiful floristic fiber and some functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl and amidogen etc which makes adsorption feasible xiao et al 2001 therefore the present work is designed to study the f sorption characteristics of using nanosized rice husk biochar nrb with respect to various physicochemical parameters such as adsorbent dosage contact time and initial f concentration kinetics of the adsorption process has also been investigated 2 materials and methods all chemical reagents used in this study were of analytical grade ar purchased from sigma aldrich chemicals india 2 1 product preparation and characterization rice husk collected from a local mill was put in a piece of pyrolysis apparatus for heating at 600 c to produce biochar the biochar thus produced was termed as raw rice husk biochar rrb and this raw biochar was further put to high energy ball milling to reduce the particle size to nano level particle size reduction increases surface to volume ratios and gives new properties to particle surfaces which is very desirable for adsorption processes the nanosized adsorbent thus produced was studied by batch technique to obtain the equilibrium data and adsorption kinetics effects of various parameters such as adsorbent dose agitation time particle size and initial f concentration at constant temperature have been investigated total carbon c nitrogen n and hydrogen h content in the biochar obtained from rice husk was determined with a chn elemental analyzer perkin elmer 2400 series ii oxygen o was determined as the weight difference between the raw dried biochar and sum of c n h and other non volatile elements proximate analysis determination of moisture content ash content fixed carbon and volatile matter of the biochar was carried out as per astm standard astm 2013 the energy dispersive x ray edx microanalysis of the f treated and untreated biochar was performed to confirm f sorption on the biochar surface transmission electron microscopy tem study was carried out to demonstrate the particle size of the nanomaterial and its distribution 2 2 adsorption studies the adsorption experiments were conducted at room temperature with initial f concentrations in range of 3 10mgl 1 using batch method 0 1g adsorbent was added to 100ml of f solution of known initial f concentration 3 10mgl 1 the ph value of the f solution was adjusted to about 7 0 2 with by adding 1m hcl or 1m naoh the vessels with sorption mixtures were placed on a shaker and agitated at 200rpm until sampling for analysis after every 10min 10ml of aliquot was withdrawn by a micropipette and analyzed for residual f ions the comparative removal efficiency of raw biochar rrb and nanoscale biochar nrb at different contact times was investigated at initial f concentration of 5mgl 1 ph 7 and adsorbent dose of 1gl 1 2 3 fluoride measurements the concentrations of f in the supernatants were determined using the orion ion selective electrode thermo fisher star a214 the f electrode was calibrated for concentrations 1 10 100 mgl 1 f solutions using the total ionic strength adjustment buffer tisab the calibrated electrode was used for measuring f concentrations of all experimental water samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of nano rice husk biochar nrb the analysis results of the physicochemical properties of nrb are presented in table 1 from table 1 it is observed that the rice husk biochar has high volatile matter contents and low fixed carbon contents rice husk showed high c o and ash content and low n and h content compared to biochar of other materials demirbas 2004 syuhadah and rohasliney 2012 3 2 transmission electron microscope tem studies the surface morphology and size distribution of the nrb was observed by tem images as shown in fig 1a from fig 1a it is observed that the nrb particles are almost spherical in shape the average particle size obtained from fig 1a is 10nm also an important feature is that there is no aggregation of particles to form giant structures instead all particles are individual and are of almost uniform shape and size it is very interesting to observe that the nano particles exhibit a narrow size distribution varying with the range 10 20nm 3 3 energy dispersive x ray edx microanalysis the edx analysis of the nrb showed the dominance of c o ca and si ions in untreated and f treated sample fig 1b br was also detected but in less mass amount compared to c and ca from the analysis it was obvious that the intensity of the f signals was higher in f treated samples and was below the detection limit on the untreated samples it can undoubtedly be stated that the elemental oxygen concentration has been reduced as o peaks disappeared in the edx spectra after adsorption and simultaneously the concentration of f is increased in the adsorbent fig 1b suggesting that the f ion may replace the oxygen atom oh containing ion on the surface of adsorbent similarly after adsorption peaks of ca disappeared fig 1b most likely due to the formation of caf2 complex thus replacing ca with f 3 4 sorption studies the f sorption experiments were conducted at constant temperature and effect of various parameters viz adsorbent dosage contact time initial f ion concentration were studied the results of f sorption studies by nrb are shown in fig 2 3 4 1 effect of adsorbent dose the f removal rate by the nrb in terms of percentage removal r was studied by varying the adsorbent dosage ranging from 0 1 to 1 0gl 1 with a solution f concentration of 5mgl 1 shaking time of 60min at a fixed temperature 30 c 1 c and ph 7 the analysis results were plotted as r of the f ion versus adsorbent dose and are shown in fig 2a from the plot it can be inferred that the percentage removal of the f ion increases rapidly with increase in adsorbent dosage with 90 removal using dose of 1 0gl 1 3 4 2 effect of agitation time in adsorption method irrespective of the other experimental parameters contact time plays major role therefore the effect of agitation time was studied on kinetics of adsorption of the f ion for which adsorption experiments were conducted the extent of f removal was studied by varying the contact time from 10 to 60min with a solution f concentration of 5mgl 1 at a fixed ph 7 and temperature 30 c 1 c the values thus attained were plotted as percentage removal of the f ion vs contact time min as shown in fig 2b comparative removal efficiency of raw rice husk biochar rrb and nano biochar nrb has been shown in fig 2b it is observed that particle size reduction to nano level has significantly increased the adsorption capacity the nrb could remove 59 4 of f within 10min of contact time whereas in case of rrb the removal percentage was 27 under the same experimental condition fig 2b faster removal rate within minimum contact time by the nrb could be attributed to rapid occupation of multiple sorption sites with high surface areas goswami et al 2011 highest r was observed to be 77 2 and 90 by rrb and nrb respectively at equilibrium it was observed that with the increase of agitation time there was rapid increase of r of the f ion and after certain time the removal rate became almost constant indicating an attainment of equilibrium condition this might be due to the availability of more active sites on the surface of the sorbent resulting in the increase of r at initial stage while with the increase in the time of contact with f the availability of active sites on the surface of the sorbent decreased resulting in the decrease of the rate of removal decreased removal rate with increased time indicates the possibility of monolayer formation on the outer surface as well as pores within adsorbent leading to pore diffusion onto inner surface of the nano adsorbent 3 4 3 effect of initial concentration the effect of initial f ion concentration on f removal was studied by ranging the initial solution concentration from 3 to 10mgl 1 at fixed experimental conditions i e at a ph 7 temperature of 30 c 1 c contact times 60min with a dose of 1gl 1 values attained were plotted as percentage f removal against initial f concentration in test solution fig 2c from the results it was obvious that with increasing initial f concentration the removal rate of the f ion has been decreased due to inadequate number of active sites on the adsorbent surface to adsorb the f ions while at low solution concentration adequate numbers of active sites are available on the surface of the adsorbent and most of the f ions interact with the active sites on the nrb showing higher removal rate with the increase of initial f concentration from 3 to 10mgl 1 there found gradual decrease in the removal rate from 90 to 68 3 of the f ion fig 2c and increase in adsorption capacity qe from 4 2 to 17 3mgg 1 3 5 adsorption isotherms in the present study two well known models freundlich and langmuir adsorption isotherms were chosen for illustrating adsorption isotherms at a constant temperature linear form of freundlich isotherm equation is expressed as 1 log x m log k f 1 n log c e where x denotes the amount of solute adsorbed m is the mass of adsorbent used ce mgl 1 is the equilibrium solute concentration in solution and kf constant is a measure of adsorption capacity and n is the measure of adsorption intensity the values of the constants kf and n were derived from the slope and intercept of the plot between log x m against log ce the value of freundlich constant n between 1 and 10 shows favorable adsorption goswami et al 2011 gupta and rastogi 2008 thus in the present study n n 1 1 value showed good adsorption the value of freundlih constant kf was 12 6 significantly higher values of adsorption capacity kf obtained with nrb indicate that it can be effectively used for f removal from water linear form of langmuir isotherm equation is as follows 2 1 x 1 xm 1 ce 1 b xm x x m here x is the amount of solute adsorbed m is mass of adsorbent ce mgl 1 is the equilibrium f concentration xm is the amount of solute adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent required for monolayer coverage of the surface also called monolayer capacity b is the constant associated with the affinity between the adsorbent and adsorbate the plot of 1 x vs ce for adsorption of f gave a straight line the maximum adsorption capacity x m and the constant b obtained from the slope and intercept of the plot were 21 7mgg 1 and 0 064 respectively from the plot statistically significant linear relationships were observed as evidenced from the correlation coefficients r2 0 995 for freundlich isotherm and r2 0 991 for langmuir isotherm close to unity indicating the applicability of these two isotherms applicability of both these isotherms has been reported for f sorption process by using rice husk ash bibi et al 2017 deshmukh et al 2009 and surface modified rice husk ash ganvir and das 2011 this has confirmed the heterogeneous surface of the adsorbent as well as the monolayer coverage of the f ion on the nrb surface 3 6 kinetic study of adsorption two kinetic models i e pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were considered to study the rate and kinetics of f ion adsorption onto the nrb the sorption kinetics illustrates the rate of solute uptake and thereby governing the residence time of sorption reaction 3 6 1 the pseudo first order model the pseudo first order kinetic model has been applied widely to analyze sorption data by using the following equation 3 l o g q e q t l o g q e k 1 t 2 303 linear plots of log qe qt vs t at different contact times were applied to confirm the applicability of pseudo first order model it was found that the plot of log qe qt vs t should give a linear relationship from which values of the k1 and qe could be determined from the slope and intercept of the plot the values of qe and k1 were estimated and are given in table 2 the calculated qe values using pseudo first order kinetics model showed 38 3 58 2 deviation from the experimental qe values table 2 3 6 2 the pseudo second order model the linear form of the pseudo second order kinetic equation is written as 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e here qe and qt denotes the amounts of f adsorbed per unit of mass of adsorbent at equilibrium and at time t respectively and k2 is the pseudo second order kinetic rate constant linear plot of t qt vs t at different contact were applied to confirm the applicability of pseudo second order model the plot of t qt vs t gave a linear relationship from which the values of the k2 and qe were determined from the intercept and slope of the plot respectively table 2 fig 3 and table 2 showed a highly significant regression and the data were well fitted to the pseudo second order rate equation the calculated qe values using pseudo second order kinetics model showed more closeness to experimental qe values than the pseudo first order kinetics 4 6 3 deviation for second order kinetics and 38 3 58 2 deviation for first order kinetics parameters the higher regression coefficients obtained from the second order kinetics shows that the goodness of fit is better in the pseudo second order kinetics as compared to the pseudo first order kinetics model for the entire range of kinetics run table 2 thus the pseudo second order model assumes that the rate limiting step is a chemical sorption between the sorbent and sorbate 3 7 comparison with other biomass based adsorbents comparative f adsorption capacity of nano rice husk biochar with different biomass based adsorbents is shown in table 3 nanosized rice husk biochar showed better adsorption capacity as compared to other biomass based adsorbents in our earlier study we have reported co removal of arsenic and fluoride by using sacchrum ravannae biochar saikia et al 2018 where maximum f removal capacity was 12 5mgg 1 table 3 in the present study the maximum adsorption capacity of the nano rice husk biochar was found to be 17 3mgg 1 which is higher than rice husk ash bibi et al 2017 aluminium hydroxide coated rice husk ash ganvir and das 2011 and carbonized rice husk deshmukh et al 2009 and activated carbon derive from rice straw daifullah et al 2007 table 3 the freundlich adsorption capacity of nrb is found to be higher 12 6mgg 1 than other reported biomass carbons table 3 the value of langmuir adsorption capacity 21 7mgg 1 of the present adsorbent is significantly higher as compared to other adsorbents table 3 it is important to note that f is generally difficult to remove at higher ph conditions maheshwari and meenakshi 2006 in many of the f removal studies better removal efficiency was found at low ph table 3 thus the adsorbents are not likely to be efficient in f removal from natural groundwater ph 6 5 7 0 however in the present study efficient f removal with high uptake capacity has been obtained at normal drinking water ph 7 0 considering these characteristics there is future scope of using this novel adsorbent for removing other contaminants from natural groundwater including arsenic thus the comparison of adsorption capacities revealed that the nano rice husk biochar is an efficient biosorbent for the uptake of f from aqueous solution 4 conclusions the novel nanomaterial derived from rice husk used in the present study had shown its potential to be an adsorbent material in removing f from aqueous solution in a promising and cost effective way the uptake of f was possible at neutral ph which is generally difficult and f removal was found to be function of contact time and adsorbent dose at a given initial solute concentration the removal percentage increased with adsorbent dose time and decreased with higher initial solute concentration the sorption process was found to follow both freundlich and langmuir isotherms in kinetic studies of defluoridation the sorption data showed better fit to the pseudo second order kinetics in comparison to the pseudo first order kinetics model nano rice husk biochar might be an excellent choice for removal of f from contaminated groundwater thereby investing its efficiency in presence of other co existing ions can be scope of the future studies finally the usage of this low cost adsorbent might may further be tested and exploited for developing more robust water filtration techniques with high efficiency with natural water acknowledgement we

minerals or soil is substituted by hydroxyl ions oh under redox conditions resulting in the release of f ions to the groundwater maheshwari et al 2006 mohan et al 2007 fluoride has gained significance due to its dual influences on human beings in lower concentrations it is a vital nutrient which is essential for bone formation prevention of tooth decay etc whereas in higher concentrations it causes fluorosis and in extreme cases even death mondal et al 2015 in groundwater the natural f concentration depends largely on the physical and chemical characteristics of the aquifer temperature geological conditions the porosity and acidity of the soil and rocks the presence of other elements and the well depth due to the influence of a number of factors the f concentration in groundwater can range from 1mgl 1 to 35mgl 1 karthikeyan et al 2007 the acceptable f concentration range in drinking water is 0 5 1 5mgl 1 approximately 260 million people worldwide in 30 countries are drinking water with f 1 5mgl 1 mondal et al 2015 in india groundwater f contamination is a major problem in 17 states of 29 and endemic fluorosis is found to affect about one million people especially in andhra pradesh assam gujarat rajasthan tamil nadu and uttar pradesh mangla 1991 unicef 1999 defluoridation of drinking water is generally performed either by precipitation or adsorption adsorption is one of the widely used methods owing to its simplicity effectiveness as well as the availability of a wide range of sorbents abdel salam et al 2011 borah et al 2018 karthikeyan et al 2007 kumar et al 2016 ji et al 2007 meenakshi and viswanathan 2007 mohan et al 2014 mondal et al 2013 saikia et al 2017 sathish et al 2007 uddin 2017 the most commonly used adsorbent activated carbon has efficient defluoridation capacity karthikeyan et al 2007 but its main disadvantages are the high treatment cost and difficult regeneration increasing the cost of water treatment in large scale applications thus there is need for other sorbents which are of inexpensive material and does not require any expensive additional pretreatment stage a successful adsorption process depends not only on adsorption performance of the sorbents but also on the constant supply of the raw materials for the process therefore it is preferable to use low cost adsorbents such as an industrial waste natural ores and agricultural byproducts rice husk is one of the most widely available agricultural wastes in a number of rice producing countries around the world including india worldwide the annual rice husk yield is about 80 million tones and over 97 of the husk is generated in the developing countries wong et al 2003 rice husk has widely been used as an adsorbent for removing different cations including heavy metals ye et al 2010 akhtar et al 2006 and various dyes abdel salam et al 2011 biochar a co product from thermal degradation of organic materials such as forest crop manure residue wood and other materials is a carbon rich porous material with oxygen functional groups and aromatic surfaces ahmad et al 2012 goswami et al 2016 mohan et al 2014 owing to its high surface to volume ratio and strong affinity for non polar substances such as dioxins pahs and other compounds biochar can be a potential sorbent for various environmental contaminants ahmad et al 2012 cao et al 2009 gupta et al 2006 mohan et al 2014 however the application of rice husk biochar for removal of f is very limited moreover the nanoscale materials poses high surface to volume ratio and is no exception making a considerable impact on our everyday lives characteristics such as large surface area high reactivity and high specificity exert nanoparticles as excellent material for water remediation applications keeping in mind these aspects a removal study has been designed using a novel nanosized biochar derived from rice husk our preliminary investigations indicated that rice husk contains plentiful floristic fiber and some functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl and amidogen etc which makes adsorption feasible xiao et al 2001 therefore the present work is designed to study the f sorption characteristics of using nanosized rice husk biochar nrb with respect to various physicochemical parameters such as adsorbent dosage contact time and initial f concentration kinetics of the adsorption process has also been investigated 2 materials and methods all chemical reagents used in this study were of analytical grade ar purchased from sigma aldrich chemicals india 2 1 product preparation and characterization rice husk collected from a local mill was put in a piece of pyrolysis apparatus for heating at 600 c to produce biochar the biochar thus produced was termed as raw rice husk biochar rrb and this raw biochar was further put to high energy ball milling to reduce the particle size to nano level particle size reduction increases surface to volume ratios and gives new properties to particle surfaces which is very desirable for adsorption processes the nanosized adsorbent thus produced was studied by batch technique to obtain the equilibrium data and adsorption kinetics effects of various parameters such as adsorbent dose agitation time particle size and initial f concentration at constant temperature have been investigated total carbon c nitrogen n and hydrogen h content in the biochar obtained from rice husk was determined with a chn elemental analyzer perkin elmer 2400 series ii oxygen o was determined as the weight difference between the raw dried biochar and sum of c n h and other non volatile elements proximate analysis determination of moisture content ash content fixed carbon and volatile matter of the biochar was carried out as per astm standard astm 2013 the energy dispersive x ray edx microanalysis of the f treated and untreated biochar was performed to confirm f sorption on the biochar surface transmission electron microscopy tem study was carried out to demonstrate the particle size of the nanomaterial and its distribution 2 2 adsorption studies the adsorption experiments were conducted at room temperature with initial f concentrations in range of 3 10mgl 1 using batch method 0 1g adsorbent was added to 100ml of f solution of known initial f concentration 3 10mgl 1 the ph value of the f solution was adjusted to about 7 0 2 with by adding 1m hcl or 1m naoh the vessels with sorption mixtures were placed on a shaker and agitated at 200rpm until sampling for analysis after every 10min 10ml of aliquot was withdrawn by a micropipette and analyzed for residual f ions the comparative removal efficiency of raw biochar rrb and nanoscale biochar nrb at different contact times was investigated at initial f concentration of 5mgl 1 ph 7 and adsorbent dose of 1gl 1 2 3 fluoride measurements the concentrations of f in the supernatants were determined using the orion ion selective electrode thermo fisher star a214 the f electrode was calibrated for concentrations 1 10 100 mgl 1 f solutions using the total ionic strength adjustment buffer tisab the calibrated electrode was used for measuring f concentrations of all experimental water samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of nano rice husk biochar nrb the analysis results of the physicochemical properties of nrb are presented in table 1 from table 1 it is observed that the rice husk biochar has high volatile matter contents and low fixed carbon contents rice husk showed high c o and ash content and low n and h content compared to biochar of other materials demirbas 2004 syuhadah and rohasliney 2012 3 2 transmission electron microscope tem studies the surface morphology and size distribution of the nrb was observed by tem images as shown in fig 1a from fig 1a it is observed that the nrb particles are almost spherical in shape the average particle size obtained from fig 1a is 10nm also an important feature is that there is no aggregation of particles to form giant structures instead all particles are individual and are of almost uniform shape and size it is very interesting to observe that the nano particles exhibit a narrow size distribution varying with the range 10 20nm 3 3 energy dispersive x ray edx microanalysis the edx analysis of the nrb showed the dominance of c o ca and si ions in untreated and f treated sample fig 1b br was also detected but in less mass amount compared to c and ca from the analysis it was obvious that the intensity of the f signals was higher in f treated samples and was below the detection limit on the untreated samples it can undoubtedly be stated that the elemental oxygen concentration has been reduced as o peaks disappeared in the edx spectra after adsorption and simultaneously the concentration of f is increased in the adsorbent fig 1b suggesting that the f ion may replace the oxygen atom oh containing ion on the surface of adsorbent similarly after adsorption peaks of ca disappeared fig 1b most likely due to the formation of caf2 complex thus replacing ca with f 3 4 sorption studies the f sorption experiments were conducted at constant temperature and effect of various parameters viz adsorbent dosage contact time initial f ion concentration were studied the results of f sorption studies by nrb are shown in fig 2 3 4 1 effect of adsorbent dose the f removal rate by the nrb in terms of percentage removal r was studied by varying the adsorbent dosage ranging from 0 1 to 1 0gl 1 with a solution f concentration of 5mgl 1 shaking time of 60min at a fixed temperature 30 c 1 c and ph 7 the analysis results were plotted as r of the f ion versus adsorbent dose and are shown in fig 2a from the plot it can be inferred that the percentage removal of the f ion increases rapidly with increase in adsorbent dosage with 90 removal using dose of 1 0gl 1 3 4 2 effect of agitation time in adsorption method irrespective of the other experimental parameters contact time plays major role therefore the effect of agitation time was studied on kinetics of adsorption of the f ion for which adsorption experiments were conducted the extent of f removal was studied by varying the contact time from 10 to 60min with a solution f concentration of 5mgl 1 at a fixed ph 7 and temperature 30 c 1 c the values thus attained were plotted as percentage removal of the f ion vs contact time min as shown in fig 2b comparative removal efficiency of raw rice husk biochar rrb and nano biochar nrb has been shown in fig 2b it is observed that particle size reduction to nano level has significantly increased the adsorption capacity the nrb could remove 59 4 of f within 10min of contact time whereas in case of rrb the removal percentage was 27 under the same experimental condition fig 2b faster removal rate within minimum contact time by the nrb could be attributed to rapid occupation of multiple sorption sites with high surface areas goswami et al 2011 highest r was observed to be 77 2 and 90 by rrb and nrb respectively at equilibrium it was observed that with the increase of agitation time there was rapid increase of r of the f ion and after certain time the removal rate became almost constant indicating an attainment of equilibrium condition this might be due to the availability of more active sites on the surface of the sorbent resulting in the increase of r at initial stage while with the increase in the time of contact with f the availability of active sites on the surface of the sorbent decreased resulting in the decrease of the rate of removal decreased removal rate with increased time indicates the possibility of monolayer formation on the outer surface as well as pores within adsorbent leading to pore diffusion onto inner surface of the nano adsorbent 3 4 3 effect of initial concentration the effect of initial f ion concentration on f removal was studied by ranging the initial solution concentration from 3 to 10mgl 1 at fixed experimental conditions i e at a ph 7 temperature of 30 c 1 c contact times 60min with a dose of 1gl 1 values attained were plotted as percentage f removal against initial f concentration in test solution fig 2c from the results it was obvious that with increasing initial f concentration the removal rate of the f ion has been decreased due to inadequate number of active sites on the adsorbent surface to adsorb the f ions while at low solution concentration adequate numbers of active sites are available on the surface of the adsorbent and most of the f ions interact with the active sites on the nrb showing higher removal rate with the increase of initial f concentration from 3 to 10mgl 1 there found gradual decrease in the removal rate from 90 to 68 3 of the f ion fig 2c and increase in adsorption capacity qe from 4 2 to 17 3mgg 1 3 5 adsorption isotherms in the present study two well known models freundlich and langmuir adsorption isotherms were chosen for illustrating adsorption isotherms at a constant temperature linear form of freundlich isotherm equation is expressed as 1 log x m log k f 1 n log c e where x denotes the amount of solute adsorbed m is the mass of adsorbent used ce mgl 1 is the equilibrium solute concentration in solution and kf constant is a measure of adsorption capacity and n is the measure of adsorption intensity the values of the constants kf and n were derived from the slope and intercept of the plot between log x m against log ce the value of freundlich constant n between 1 and 10 shows favorable adsorption goswami et al 2011 gupta and rastogi 2008 thus in the present study n n 1 1 value showed good adsorption the value of freundlih constant kf was 12 6 significantly higher values of adsorption capacity kf obtained with nrb indicate that it can be effectively used for f removal from water linear form of langmuir isotherm equation is as follows 2 1 x 1 xm 1 ce 1 b xm x x m here x is the amount of solute adsorbed m is mass of adsorbent ce mgl 1 is the equilibrium f concentration xm is the amount of solute adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent required for monolayer coverage of the surface also called monolayer capacity b is the constant associated with the affinity between the adsorbent and adsorbate the plot of 1 x vs ce for adsorption of f gave a straight line the maximum adsorption capacity x m and the constant b obtained from the slope and intercept of the plot were 21 7mgg 1 and 0 064 respectively from the plot statistically significant linear relationships were observed as evidenced from the correlation coefficients r2 0 995 for freundlich isotherm and r2 0 991 for langmuir isotherm close to unity indicating the applicability of these two isotherms applicability of both these isotherms has been reported for f sorption process by using rice husk ash bibi et al 2017 deshmukh et al 2009 and surface modified rice husk ash ganvir and das 2011 this has confirmed the heterogeneous surface of the adsorbent as well as the monolayer coverage of the f ion on the nrb surface 3 6 kinetic study of adsorption two kinetic models i e pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were considered to study the rate and kinetics of f ion adsorption onto the nrb the sorption kinetics illustrates the rate of solute uptake and thereby governing the residence time of sorption reaction 3 6 1 the pseudo first order model the pseudo first order kinetic model has been applied widely to analyze sorption data by using the following equation 3 l o g q e q t l o g q e k 1 t 2 303 linear plots of log qe qt vs t at different contact times were applied to confirm the applicability of pseudo first order model it was found that the plot of log qe qt vs t should give a linear relationship from which values of the k1 and qe could be determined from the slope and intercept of the plot the values of qe and k1 were estimated and are given in table 2 the calculated qe values using pseudo first order kinetics model showed 38 3 58 2 deviation from the experimental qe values table 2 3 6 2 the pseudo second order model the linear form of the pseudo second order kinetic equation is written as 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e here qe and qt denotes the amounts of f adsorbed per unit of mass of adsorbent at equilibrium and at time t respectively and k2 is the pseudo second order kinetic rate constant linear plot of t qt vs t at different contact were applied to confirm the applicability of pseudo second order model the plot of t qt vs t gave a linear relationship from which the values of the k2 and qe were determined from the intercept and slope of the plot respectively table 2 fig 3 and table 2 showed a highly significant regression and the data were well fitted to the pseudo second order rate equation the calculated qe values using pseudo second order kinetics model showed more closeness to experimental qe values than the pseudo first order kinetics 4 6 3 deviation for second order kinetics and 38 3 58 2 deviation for first order kinetics parameters the higher regression coefficients obtained from the second order kinetics shows that the goodness of fit is better in the pseudo second order kinetics as compared to the pseudo first order kinetics model for the entire range of kinetics run table 2 thus the pseudo second order model assumes that the rate limiting step is a chemical sorption between the sorbent and sorbate 3 7 comparison with other biomass based adsorbents comparative f adsorption capacity of nano rice husk biochar with different biomass based adsorbents is shown in table 3 nanosized rice husk biochar showed better adsorption capacity as compared to other biomass based adsorbents in our earlier study we have reported co removal of arsenic and fluoride by using sacchrum ravannae biochar saikia et al 2018 where maximum f removal capacity was 12 5mgg 1 table 3 in the present study the maximum adsorption capacity of the nano rice husk biochar was found to be 17 3mgg 1 which is higher than rice husk ash bibi et al 2017 aluminium hydroxide coated rice husk ash ganvir and das 2011 and carbonized rice husk deshmukh et al 2009 and activated carbon derive from rice straw daifullah et al 2007 table 3 the freundlich adsorption capacity of nrb is found to be higher 12 6mgg 1 than other reported biomass carbons table 3 the value of langmuir adsorption capacity 21 7mgg 1 of the present adsorbent is significantly higher as compared to other adsorbents table 3 it is important to note that f is generally difficult to remove at higher ph conditions maheshwari and meenakshi 2006 in many of the f removal studies better removal efficiency was found at low ph table 3 thus the adsorbents are not likely to be efficient in f removal from natural groundwater ph 6 5 7 0 however in the present study efficient f removal with high uptake capacity has been obtained at normal drinking water ph 7 0 considering these characteristics there is future scope of using this novel adsorbent for removing other contaminants from natural groundwater including arsenic thus the comparison of adsorption capacities revealed that the nano rice husk biochar is an efficient biosorbent for the uptake of f from aqueous solution 4 conclusions the novel nanomaterial derived from rice husk used in the present study had shown its potential to be an adsorbent material in removing f from aqueous solution in a promising and cost effective way the uptake of f was possible at neutral ph which is generally difficult and f removal was found to be function of contact time and adsorbent dose at a given initial solute concentration the removal percentage increased with adsorbent dose time and decreased with higher initial solute concentration the sorption process was found to follow both freundlich and langmuir isotherms in kinetic studies of defluoridation the sorption data showed better fit to the pseudo second order kinetics in comparison to the pseudo first order kinetics model nano rice husk biochar might be an excellent choice for removal of f from contaminated groundwater thereby investing its efficiency in presence of other co existing ions can be scope of the future studies finally the usage of this low cost adsorbent might may further be tested and exploited for developing more robust water filtration techniques with high efficiency with natural water acknowledgement we

12329,for the present study three adsorbents namely activated alumina alum and brick powder has been studied and tested for its fluoride removal efficiency by kinetics and equilibrium models at varying dose and initial fluoride conc the experimental values were modeled for different adsorption isotherm and kinetic models equilibrium studies suggests that even though a high coefficients of correlation obtained using langmuir 1 and langmuir 5 expressions the model does not describe perfectly the equilibrium data because of the higher calculated error values elovich isotherm exhibited very poor coefficients of correlation lower than those obtained for langmuir and freundlich equation which nullifies the assumption of the exponential covering of adsorption sites that implies multilayer adsorption in the studied concentration range freundlich model suggests that activated alumina and alum are good adsorbent for fluoride adsorption 1 380 n 2 992 but brick powder can proved to be a good adsorbent only at lower fluoride conc as suggested by n 1 for f conc of 5 mg l error analysis suggests good agreement between the experimental and predicted values suggesting freundlich model for the experimental equilibrium data comparing pseudo first second and elovich models it was observed that fluoride adsorption was best represented by pseudo second order model liquid film diffusion model analysis suggests that as the straight lines did not pass through the origin resistance or film diffusion might not be the sole rate limiting step the adsorption kinetics might be controlled by both film diffusion as well as intra particle diffusion simultaneously graphical abstract fx1 keywords adsorption fluoride isotherm kinetics langmuir model freundlich model elovich model 1 introduction groundwater is the major source of domestic water for people living in rural and semi urban areas in most parts of the world presence of certain ions low or high concentration in groundwater makes it unsuitable for drinking purposes fluoride is one such ion that causes adverse health effects fluoride has a significant mitigating effect against dental caries if the concentration is approximately 1 mg l however continuing consumption of higher concentrations can cause dental fluorosis and in extreme cases even skeletal fluorosis consumption of water with fluoride concentration above 1 5 mg l results in acute to chronic dental fluorosis skeletal fluorosis which causes weakness and bending of the bones also results due to long term consumption of water containing high fluoride the permissible limit in drinking water is 1 mg l who 1993 whereas indian standards for drinking water recommended maximum permissible limit of 1 mg l and the maximum tolerance limit as 1 5 mg l for potable water in absence of any alternative source is 1991 natural sources of fluoride are connected to various types of rocks and to volcanic activity agricultural use of phosphatic fertilizers and industrial activities clays used in ceramic industries or burning of coals also contribute to high fluoride concentrations in groundwater defluoridation of drinking water is the only practicable option to overcome the problem of excessive fluoride in drinking water where alternate sources are not available during the years following discovery of fluoride as the cause of fluorosis extensive research has been carried out on various methods for removal of fluoride from water several methods have been developed since 1930 to carry out defluoridation of water treatment of water containing fluoride requires a suitable and effective method and most importantly the method should be acceptable to people among various methods membrane filtration ndiaye et al 2005 co precipitation parker and fong 1975 nanofiltration simons 1993 ion exchange ruixia et al 2002 electrocoagulation flotation hu et al 2005 and adsorption meenakshi and maheshwari 2006 have been used for fluoride removal among these methods adsorption is the most effective and widely used method because it is universal has a limited maintenance cost and is applicable for the removal of fluoride even at low concentrations in recent years considerable attention has been focused on the study of fluoride removal using natural synthetic and biomass materials such as activated alumina srimurali and karthikeyan 2008 brick powder asheesh et al 2006 natural materials jamode et al 2004 soil sorbents fan et al 2003 red mud yunus et al 2002 fishbone charcoal watanesk and watanesk 2000 and metal oxides kamble et al 2009 these adsorbents have shown a certain degree of fluoride adsorption capacity but with limitations some of them can only be used in a narrow ph range and some of them are too expensive to be considered for full scale water treatment many of the technologies give satisfactory results with synthetic water in laboratory but do not work satisfactorily for natural groundwater reliable cost effective and sustainable treatment technologies which are socially adaptable are yet to be identified and further developed all the technologies that have been developed so far have their strengths and weaknesses and are being refined to accommodate rural conditions the present study focused on evaluating the adsorption capacities of three adsorbents namely activated alumina aa alum and brick powder bp for the adsorption of fluoride from water activated alumina is one of the trusted adsorbent for fluoride removal on the other hand alum and brick powder can remove fluoride from water and are low cost materials therefore in the present work two low cost adsorbent alum and brick powder were selected and the performance of the same is compared to the known activated alumina batch study was conducted into using the adsorbent with optimization of various experimental conditions including ph different initial fluoride concentrations and adsorbent dosages the mechanism of fluoride removal by adsorbents is reasonably explained by adsorption isotherms various kinetic models were also used to describe the kinetics of adsorption process adsorption equilibria information is the most important piece of information in understanding an adsorption process the present work aims to study and model the isotherms of adsorption as well as the kinetics of fluoride from aqueous solutions onto aa alum and bp the goal is to apprehend the interactions fluoride aa alum bp through the validity of various isotherm and kinetic models 2 materials and method 2 1 adsorbents for the present study three adsorbents namely activated alumina aa alum and brick powder bp has been used the three adsorbent will be tested for its fluoride removal efficiency from water aa is the most commonly used adsorbent for fluoride removal however only constraint related to aa is its price which is on the higher side therefore feasibility of alum and bp low cost adsorbent is tested for its fluoride removal properties along with aa aa used in the present study was procured from m s merck ltd mumbai india the particle size of aa used in present study was in the range of 63 200 µm aa was used directly as procured alum is used as a coagulant in most of the water treatment plant and is very easily available alum for the present study has been brought from the water treatment plant situated inside the tezpur university campus the alum then dried in oven at a temperature of 105 c for approximately 24 h for removal of any kind of moisture present and is used for adsorption studies particle passing through 150 µm sieve and retained on 75 µm sieve is used for the adsorption studies bp for the present study has been obtained by crushing brick bats into finer size followed by sieving washing and then oven dried at a temperature of 105 c for approximately 24 h particle passing through 300 µm sieve and retained on 150 µm sieve is used for the adsorption studies 2 2 stock fluoride solution stock solution of fluoride f ion having concentration of 100 µg ml was prepared by dissolving required amount of analytical grade sodium fluoride naf in distilled water the working solutions of f in the range of 2 5 mg l were prepared by diluting the stock solution with distilled water the residual concentration of f was measured following spadns method apha 1998 using a digital spectrophotometer model 167 m s systronics india ltd india 2 3 adsorption isotherm studies for a fixed dose of adsorbent 0 02 0 1 g of aa and alum 1 4 g of bp the mixture was mounted on a shaker in a 100 ml specimen tube having 50 ml having desire initial f i e 4 or 5 mg l and thoroughly mixed for 120 min at room temperature 22 1 c samples were collected after 120 min one by one and two phases were separated immediately using a 0 40 µm whatman filter paper the residual fluoride concentration in the liquid portion was estimated all the experiments were conducted in duplicate 2 4 adsorption kinetic studies experiments were conducted at a fixed dose of adsorbent 1 and 2 g added in glass conical flask of 1000 ml capacity having initial f concentration of 5 mg l and mixed continuously for 120 min at room temp 22 c samples were collected at regular intervals of every 15 min and two phases were separated immediately using a 0 40 µm whatman filter paper thereafter the residual f concentration in the liquid portion was estimated the experimental data obtained were used for kinetic studies and were tested for pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intra particle diffusion models to elucidate the mechanism of adsorption all experiments are carried out in duplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption isotherm modeling the adsorption data was analyzed by isotherm models like langmuir elovich and freundlich the equilibrium experiments were carried out at room temperature 22 1 c with initial f concentration of 4 and 5 mg l at solution ph 6 0 and at varied adsorbent dosage 0 02 0 1 g of aa and alum 1 4 g of bp 3 1 1 modeling of adsorption isotherms several mathematical models can be used to describe experimental data of adsorption isotherms the equilibrium data were modeled with the langmuir five linearized expressions elovich and freundlich models this work aims to find the models that can best describe with precision the experimental results of adsorption isotherms specify the parameters that can be determined compare the behavior of fluoride adsorption and determine the theoretical adsorption isotherms the experimental values of q e and c e are initially treated with the linearized equations in order to determine the model parameters and the isotherms are reconstituted using the determined values further following three types of error analysis was carried out to find out the suitability of the model which fits best the experimental values chi square χ 2 test the chi square test is the sum of the squares of the differences between the experimental data and the data obtained using the models with each squared difference divided by the corresponding data obtained using the model costodes et al 2005 goel et al 2005 the equivalent mathematical statement of χ 2 test is represented as 1 χ 2 q t q t m 2 q t m where q tm and q t are adsorption capacities mg g obtained by using the model and the experimental data respectively if the data from the model are similar to the experimental data the value of χ 2 will be smaller while if they differ the value of χ 2 will be larger root mean squared error rmse test rmse test was carried out using the following expression shihabudheen et al 2008 2 r m s e 1 n i 1 n q t m i q t i 2 where n is the number of experimental data and q tm and q t represent the adsorption capacities mg g obtained by using the model and the experimental data respectively if the data from the model are similar to the experimental data the value of rmse will be smaller while if they differ the value of rmse will be larger average percentage errors ape linear correlation coefficients r showed the fit between experimental data and linearized forms of model equations while the average percentage errors ape calculated according to eq 3 indicated the fit between the experimental and predicted values of adsorption capacity hamdaoui and naffrechoux 2007 3 ape i 1 n q e experimental q e predicted q e experimental n 100 where n the number of experimental data 3 1 2 langmuir isotherm the langmuir 1918 model assumes uniform energies of adsorption onto the surface and no transmigration of adsorbate in the plane of the surface the model is valid for monolayer sorption onto a surface with finite number of identical sites is represented as 4 q e a b c e 1 b c e where q e is the amount of solute adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbent at equilibrium mg g c e the equilibrium concentration of the solute in the bulk solution mg l a the maximum adsorption capacity mg g and b is the constant related to the free energy of adsorption l mg eq 4 can be linearized to five different linear forms as shown in table 1 the adsorption data for f onto aa alum and bp were analyzed by a regression analysis to fit the five linearized expressions of langmuir isotherm model different linear forms of the same langmuir isotherm equations significantly affect calculations of the parameters these divergent outcome shows the real complexities and problems in estimating the isotherm parameters by the linearized method the different outcomes for different linearization form of langmuir isotherm equations were produced by the variation in the error structure that would get varied upon linearizing technique of the nonlinear equation the details of these different forms of linearized langmuir equations and the method to estimate the langmuir constants a and b from these plots were explained in table 1 out of the five different types of linearized langmuir isotherm equations langmuir 1 and langmuir 2 are the most frequently used by researchers because of the minimized deviations from the fitted equation resulting in the best error distribution capacity 20 values of the estimated langmuir constants are presented in table 2 for the adsorption of fluoride onto aa alum and bp at two initial f conc of 4 and 5 mg l respectively the values of the coefficient of correlation obtained from langmuir 1 and langmuir 5 expressions indicate that there is strong positive evidence that the adsorption of f on all the three adsorbent tested follows the langmuir isotherm from table 2 it was observed that the values of langmuir parameters obtained from the five linear expressions were different it is clear that transformations of non linear model to linear forms implicitly alter their error structure and may also violate the error variance and normality assumptions of standard least squares method ho and wang 2004 the values of maximum adsorption capacity determined using five different langmuir expressions are higher than the experimental adsorbed amounts and correspond to the adsorption isotherms plateaus for all the three adsorbent studied from table 2 it has been observed that maximum adsorption capacity of aa is more than the other two adsorbent studied i e alum and bp however maximum adsorption capacity of alum at an initial f conc of 5 mg l was the higher than the aa and bp the lower coefficient of correlation values for the other three langmuir linear expressions especially in the cases of initial f conc of 5 mg l for all the three adsorbents tested aa alum and bp suggests that it is not appropriate to use this type of linearization it seems that the isotherm obtained from langmuir 1 and langmuir 5 expressions provided a better fit to the experimental data the favorable nature of adsorption can be expressed in terms of dimensionless equilibrium parameter hall et al 1966 5 r l 1 1 b c o where b is the langmuir constant and c o is the initial concentration of the adsorbate in solution the values of r l indicates the type of isotherm to be irreversible r l 0 favorable 0 r l 1 linear r l 1 or unfavorable r l 1 the dimensionless separation factors calculated for both langmuir 1 and langmuir 5 for initial f conc of 4 and 5 mg l is presented in table 2 respectively r l values were less than 1 and greater than zero indicating favorable adsorption in order to check the validity of the langmuir model model parameters were recalculated using equilibrium concentration and langmuir parameters for the five linearized forms of the equation and the error analysis was carried out the calculated χ2 rmse and ape are presented in table 2 it is clear from the calculated χ 2 rmse value and ape that the langmuir expressions are unable to describe the equilibrium data for all the three studied adsorbent in spite of the high coefficients of correlation obtained using langmuir 1 and langmuir 5 expressions these model does not describe perfectly the equilibrium data because of the higher calculated error values thus it is not appropriate to use the coefficient of correlation of the linear regression method for comparing the best fitting isotherms 3 1 3 elovich isotherm the equation defining the elovich model hamdaoui and naffrechoux 2007 elovich and larinov 1962 is based on a kinetic principle assuming that the adsorption sites increase exponentially with adsorption which implies a multilayer adsorption it is expressed by the relation 6 q e q m k e c e exp q e q m and the linearized form presented as 7 ln q e q m ln k e q m q e q m where k e is the elovich equilibrium constant l mg and q m is the elovich maximum adsorption capacity mg g if the adsorption obeys elovich equation elovich maximum adsorption capacity and elovich constant can be calculated from the slopes and the intercepts of the plot ln q e c e versus q e the elovich isotherm constants k e and q m as well as the coefficient of correlation r for the f adsorption systems onto the studied adsorbents aa alum and bp are obtained using the linear form of the equation table 3 in all cases the elovich isotherm exhibited very poor coefficients of correlation lower than those obtained for langmuir and freundlich equation this means that the assumption of the exponential covering of adsorption sites that implies multilayer adsorption is not in agreement with the experiment in the studied concentration range therefore the elovich model is also unable to describe the adsorption isotherms of f onto aa alum and bp 3 1 4 freundlich isotherm the adsorption data were also fitted into the freundlich isotherm model an empirical relationship indicative of surface heterogeneity of the adsorbent which is represented freundlich 1926 as 8 q e k f c e 1 n and the linearized form presented as 9 log q e log k f log c e where k f and n are freundlich constants related to adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity respectively the equilibrium data were further analyzed using the linearized form of freundlich equation using the same set experimental data by plotting ln q e versus ln c e to determine the maximum adsorption capacity it is necessary to operate with constant initial concentration c o and variable weights of adsorbent thus ln q m is the extrapolated value of ln q for c c o according to halsey 1952 10 k f q m c o 1 n where c o is the initial concentration of the solute in the bulk solution mg l and q m is the freundlich maximum adsorption capacity mg g the calculated freundlich isotherm constants and the corresponding coefficient of correlation values were shown in table 3 the values of maximum adsorption capacity obtained using freundlich equation at an initial f conc of 4 and 5 mg l are 14 247 and 13 898 for aa 11 779 and 10 171 for bp and 0 265 and 0 226 for bp respectively the observed maximum uptake capacity shows the superiority of aa over alum and bp the coefficients of correlation are high showing a good linearity if the linear form of langmuir 1 and langmuir 5 which shows greater correlation values as compared to other langmuir expression is used for comparison table 2 with elovich and freundlich isotherm table 3 all the three models shows good correlation however freundlich model was more suitable for the experimental data as it has slightly higher values of correlation coefficient however when compared to elovich isotherm model correlation of coefficient is far better for freundlich model and suggests suitability of freundlich model over elovich model the magnitude of the exponent n gives an indication on the favorability of adsorption it is generally stated that values of n in the range 2 10 represent good 1 2 moderately difficult and less than 1 poor adsorption characteristics treybal 1981 from the observed n value table 3 it can be concluded that aa and alum are good adsorbent for fluoride adsorption 1 380 n 2 992 however bp can proved to be a good adsorbent only at lower f conc as it has been observed n 1 for f conc of 5 mg l it has been clear form the calculated error values of χ 2 rmse value and ape table there is a good agreement between the experimental and predicted values suggesting that the freundlich model is valid for the experimental equilibrium data the calculated values of χ 2 rmse value and ape are less than the langmuir and elovich isotherm model nevertheless freundlich isotherm slightly diverges with the experimental results for higher equilibrium concentrations 3 2 adsorption kinetic studies the kinetics of f adsorption on aa alum and bp was investigated at an initial f conc of 5 mg l and at a varied adsorbent dose of 1 and 2 gm respectively for aa alum and bp the kinetic data were modeled with the pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich models in order to find out the kinetic model which is fitting experimental data closely error analysis were carried out using the chi square χ 2 root mean squared error rmse tests and average percentage error ape test for experimental data as well as the data obtained using the models as explained in section 3 1 1 3 2 1 pseudo first order model the pseudo first order rate expression of lagergren 1898 one of the most widely used rate equations bhattacharjee et al 2003 with regard to adsorption on solid surface systems which is expressed in its linearized form as 11 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t where q e and q t are the amounts adsorbed on adsorbent mg g at equilibrium and at time t respectively and k 1 is the rate constant of first order adsorption min 1 the linearized form of rate equation had been used to only evaluate k 1 value graphically provided q e value had already been evaluated experimentally meenakshi and viswanathan 2007 however in the absence of experimentally determined q e value the evaluation of k 1 value graphically appeared to be difficult however the values of k 1 and q e might be determined simultaneously and independently using the experimental values of various q t obtained at different t by applying the method of least squares to eq 11 the experimental data obtained were fitted into pseudo first order model by using the values of q t and k 1 obtained by the method of least squares and the adsorption kinetic model parameters obtained are presented in table 4 the estimated r 2 value difference in the estimated and calculated values of experimental q e i e q experimental and model q e i e q em and the error analysis χ 2 rmse and ape carried out indicated that the pseudo first order model was not suitable for describing f adsorption onto the three adsorbent studied 3 2 2 pseudo second order model the kinetic data were also tested for the pseudo second order kinetic model ho and mckay 2000 which is expressed in its linearized form as 12 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q e and q t are the amounts of metal ions adsorbed on adsorbent mg g at equilibrium and at time t and k 2 is the rate constant of the second order adsorption g mg min the values of k 2 and q e estimated through the intercept and slope of plots between t q t and t plot not shown along with coefficient of correlation r2 are also presented in table 4 kinetic data appears to follow the second order rate as suggested by r 2 value and the error analysis carried out for all the three adsorbent studied 3 2 3 elovich model elovich equation is also used successfully to describe second order kinetic assuming that the actual solid surfaces are energetically heterogeneous but the equation does not propose any definite mechanism for adsorbate adsorbent it has extensively been accepted that the chemisorption process the elovich model equation is generally expressed as chien and clayton 1980 sparks 1986 13 d q t dt α exp β q t to simplify the elovich equation chien and clayton 1980 assumed α β t and by applying the boundary conditions q t 0 at t 0 and q t 0 at t 0 eq 13 become 14 q t 1 β ln α β 1 β ln t where α mg g min and β g mg are elovich coefficients that represent the initial adsorption rate and the desorption coefficient respectively β is also related to the extent of surface coverage and activation energy for chemisorptions the kinetic constants α and β were calculated from slope and intercept of plot q t vs ln t respectively and the values are given in table 4 higher value of α than β indicated higher adsorption rate than desorption which showed viability of adsorption process a huge value of error between the estimated and experimental values suggests that elovich model cannot be used to explain the kinetics of the present study comparing pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich models it was concluded that f adsorption from solution onto the 3 adsorbent studied aa alum and bp was best represented by pseudo second order model 3 2 4 adsorption diffusion models to understand the mechanism of f adsorption from aqueous solution onto aa alum and bp liquid film diffusion and intra particle diffusion models were applied liquid film diffusion model liquid film diffusion model boyd et al 1949 is applicable at slow process of adsorbate flow through the liquid film surrounding the adsorbent particles which determines kinetics of the process the mathematical form of liquid film diffusion model is given by 15 ln 1 f k fd t where f q t q e is the fractional attainment of equilibrium and k fd is the film diffusion rate constant a linear plot of ln 1 f vs t with zero intercept suggests that adsorption kinetics is controlled by diffusion through liquid film surrounding the solid adsorbents the k fd was calculated from the slope of the straight line plot plot not shown and the observed values along with r2 are presented in table 5 a higher value of correlation coefficient r 2 i e close to unity indicated good fitness of film diffusion model however if the straight lines did not pass through the origin it suggests that film diffusion is not only the rate limiting step intra particle diffusion is also taking place in case of bp the value of intercept is very close to zero 0 0118 and 0 207 for 1 and 2 g respectively suggesting adsorption kinetics of bp may be controlled by diffusion through liquid film surrounding the bp however as the intercept is not exactly zero further analysis with bp is carried out along with aa and alum for intra particle diffusion model intra particle diffusion model according to this model the adsorbate species diffuse into the pores of adsorbent which can be the rate determining step in such cases solute uptake by adsorbent varies proportionally with t 0 5 the intra particle diffusion model weber and morris 1963 is expressed as 16 q t k ipd t 0 5 c where k ipd μg g min0 5 is intra particle diffusion rate constant with c as intercept along q t axis if plot of q t vs t 0 5 gives a straight line passing through the origin the intra particle diffusion is considered as the rate determining step if straight line deviates from the origin it indicates the contribution from film diffusion process ho and mckay 1998 the slope of the intra particle diffusion plots gave the value of k ipd and the corresponding values are presented in table 5 the plots which not shown here for aa alum and bp has two types of linearity indicating two diffusion stages of fluoride adsorption onto aa alum and bp the first stage plot passed near the origin with slope k ipd1 and is controlled by film diffusion whereas the second part with slope k ipd2 showed that the process is controlled by both film and intraparticle diffusions the estimated values of k ipd k ipd2 are also presented in table 5 the k ipd k ipd2 was attributed to the faster rate of film diffusion than intraparticle diffusion it was concluded that the adsorption kinetics might be controlled by film diffusion and intra particle diffusion simultaneously for all the three adsorbent studied 4 conclusions the three adsorbent studied can able to remove f but extent of removal of aa is higher compared to other two i e alum and bp the values of maximum adsorption capacity determined using five different langmuir expressions are higher than the experimental adsorbed amounts and correspond to the adsorption isotherms plateaus for all the three adsorbent studied aa alum and bp even though a high coefficients of correlation obtained using langmuir 1 and langmuir 5 expressions but the model does not describe perfectly the equilibrium data because of the higher calculated error values of χ 2 rmse value and ape elovich isotherm exhibited very poor coefficients of correlation lower than those obtained for langmuir and freundlich equation this means that the assumption of the exponential covering of adsorption sites that implies multilayer adsorption is not in agreement with the experiment in the studied concentration range freundlich model suggests that aa and alum are good adsorbent for fluoride adsorption 1 380 n 2 992 however bp can proved to be a good adsorbent only at lower f conc n 1 for f conc of 5 mg l error analysis suggests that there is a good agreement between the experimental and predicted values suggesting freundlich model valid for the experimental equilibrium data comparing pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich models it was concluded that f adsorption from solution onto the adsorbents studied aa alum and bp was best represented by pseudo second order model liquid film diffusion model analysis suggests that as the straight lines did not pass through the origin resistance or film diffusion might not be the sole rate limiting step the adsorption kinetics might be controlled by both film diffusion as well as intra particle diffusion simultaneously 
12329,for the present study three adsorbents namely activated alumina alum and brick powder has been studied and tested for its fluoride removal efficiency by kinetics and equilibrium models at varying dose and initial fluoride conc the experimental values were modeled for different adsorption isotherm and kinetic models equilibrium studies suggests that even though a high coefficients of correlation obtained using langmuir 1 and langmuir 5 expressions the model does not describe perfectly the equilibrium data because of the higher calculated error values elovich isotherm exhibited very poor coefficients of correlation lower than those obtained for langmuir and freundlich equation which nullifies the assumption of the exponential covering of adsorption sites that implies multilayer adsorption in the studied concentration range freundlich model suggests that activated alumina and alum are good adsorbent for fluoride adsorption 1 380 n 2 992 but brick powder can proved to be a good adsorbent only at lower fluoride conc as suggested by n 1 for f conc of 5 mg l error analysis suggests good agreement between the experimental and predicted values suggesting freundlich model for the experimental equilibrium data comparing pseudo first second and elovich models it was observed that fluoride adsorption was best represented by pseudo second order model liquid film diffusion model analysis suggests that as the straight lines did not pass through the origin resistance or film diffusion might not be the sole rate limiting step the adsorption kinetics might be controlled by both film diffusion as well as intra particle diffusion simultaneously graphical abstract fx1 keywords adsorption fluoride isotherm kinetics langmuir model freundlich model elovich model 1 introduction groundwater is the major source of domestic water for people living in rural and semi urban areas in most parts of the world presence of certain ions low or high concentration in groundwater makes it unsuitable for drinking purposes fluoride is one such ion that causes adverse health effects fluoride has a significant mitigating effect against dental caries if the concentration is approximately 1 mg l however continuing consumption of higher concentrations can cause dental fluorosis and in extreme cases even skeletal fluorosis consumption of water with fluoride concentration above 1 5 mg l results in acute to chronic dental fluorosis skeletal fluorosis which causes weakness and bending of the bones also results due to long term consumption of water containing high fluoride the permissible limit in drinking water is 1 mg l who 1993 whereas indian standards for drinking water recommended maximum permissible limit of 1 mg l and the maximum tolerance limit as 1 5 mg l for potable water in absence of any alternative source is 1991 natural sources of fluoride are connected to various types of rocks and to volcanic activity agricultural use of phosphatic fertilizers and industrial activities clays used in ceramic industries or burning of coals also contribute to high fluoride concentrations in groundwater defluoridation of drinking water is the only practicable option to overcome the problem of excessive fluoride in drinking water where alternate sources are not available during the years following discovery of fluoride as the cause of fluorosis extensive research has been carried out on various methods for removal of fluoride from water several methods have been developed since 1930 to carry out defluoridation of water treatment of water containing fluoride requires a suitable and effective method and most importantly the method should be acceptable to people among various methods membrane filtration ndiaye et al 2005 co precipitation parker and fong 1975 nanofiltration simons 1993 ion exchange ruixia et al 2002 electrocoagulation flotation hu et al 2005 and adsorption meenakshi and maheshwari 2006 have been used for fluoride removal among these methods adsorption is the most effective and widely used method because it is universal has a limited maintenance cost and is applicable for the removal of fluoride even at low concentrations in recent years considerable attention has been focused on the study of fluoride removal using natural synthetic and biomass materials such as activated alumina srimurali and karthikeyan 2008 brick powder asheesh et al 2006 natural materials jamode et al 2004 soil sorbents fan et al 2003 red mud yunus et al 2002 fishbone charcoal watanesk and watanesk 2000 and metal oxides kamble et al 2009 these adsorbents have shown a certain degree of fluoride adsorption capacity but with limitations some of them can only be used in a narrow ph range and some of them are too expensive to be considered for full scale water treatment many of the technologies give satisfactory results with synthetic water in laboratory but do not work satisfactorily for natural groundwater reliable cost effective and sustainable treatment technologies which are socially adaptable are yet to be identified and further developed all the technologies that have been developed so far have their strengths and weaknesses and are being refined to accommodate rural conditions the present study focused on evaluating the adsorption capacities of three adsorbents namely activated alumina aa alum and brick powder bp for the adsorption of fluoride from water activated alumina is one of the trusted adsorbent for fluoride removal on the other hand alum and brick powder can remove fluoride from water and are low cost materials therefore in the present work two low cost adsorbent alum and brick powder were selected and the performance of the same is compared to the known activated alumina batch study was conducted into using the adsorbent with optimization of various experimental conditions including ph different initial fluoride concentrations and adsorbent dosages the mechanism of fluoride removal by adsorbents is reasonably explained by adsorption isotherms various kinetic models were also used to describe the kinetics of adsorption process adsorption equilibria information is the most important piece of information in understanding an adsorption process the present work aims to study and model the isotherms of adsorption as well as the kinetics of fluoride from aqueous solutions onto aa alum and bp the goal is to apprehend the interactions fluoride aa alum bp through the validity of various isotherm and kinetic models 2 materials and method 2 1 adsorbents for the present study three adsorbents namely activated alumina aa alum and brick powder bp has been used the three adsorbent will be tested for its fluoride removal efficiency from water aa is the most commonly used adsorbent for fluoride removal however only constraint related to aa is its price which is on the higher side therefore feasibility of alum and bp low cost adsorbent is tested for its fluoride removal properties along with aa aa used in the present study was procured from m s merck ltd mumbai india the particle size of aa used in present study was in the range of 63 200 µm aa was used directly as procured alum is used as a coagulant in most of the water treatment plant and is very easily available alum for the present study has been brought from the water treatment plant situated inside the tezpur university campus the alum then dried in oven at a temperature of 105 c for approximately 24 h for removal of any kind of moisture present and is used for adsorption studies particle passing through 150 µm sieve and retained on 75 µm sieve is used for the adsorption studies bp for the present study has been obtained by crushing brick bats into finer size followed by sieving washing and then oven dried at a temperature of 105 c for approximately 24 h particle passing through 300 µm sieve and retained on 150 µm sieve is used for the adsorption studies 2 2 stock fluoride solution stock solution of fluoride f ion having concentration of 100 µg ml was prepared by dissolving required amount of analytical grade sodium fluoride naf in distilled water the working solutions of f in the range of 2 5 mg l were prepared by diluting the stock solution with distilled water the residual concentration of f was measured following spadns method apha 1998 using a digital spectrophotometer model 167 m s systronics india ltd india 2 3 adsorption isotherm studies for a fixed dose of adsorbent 0 02 0 1 g of aa and alum 1 4 g of bp the mixture was mounted on a shaker in a 100 ml specimen tube having 50 ml having desire initial f i e 4 or 5 mg l and thoroughly mixed for 120 min at room temperature 22 1 c samples were collected after 120 min one by one and two phases were separated immediately using a 0 40 µm whatman filter paper the residual fluoride concentration in the liquid portion was estimated all the experiments were conducted in duplicate 2 4 adsorption kinetic studies experiments were conducted at a fixed dose of adsorbent 1 and 2 g added in glass conical flask of 1000 ml capacity having initial f concentration of 5 mg l and mixed continuously for 120 min at room temp 22 c samples were collected at regular intervals of every 15 min and two phases were separated immediately using a 0 40 µm whatman filter paper thereafter the residual f concentration in the liquid portion was estimated the experimental data obtained were used for kinetic studies and were tested for pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intra particle diffusion models to elucidate the mechanism of adsorption all experiments are carried out in duplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption isotherm modeling the adsorption data was analyzed by isotherm models like langmuir elovich and freundlich the equilibrium experiments were carried out at room temperature 22 1 c with initial f concentration of 4 and 5 mg l at solution ph 6 0 and at varied adsorbent dosage 0 02 0 1 g of aa and alum 1 4 g of bp 3 1 1 modeling of adsorption isotherms several mathematical models can be used to describe experimental data of adsorption isotherms the equilibrium data were modeled with the langmuir five linearized expressions elovich and freundlich models this work aims to find the models that can best describe with precision the experimental results of adsorption isotherms specify the parameters that can be determined compare the behavior of fluoride adsorption and determine the theoretical adsorption isotherms the experimental values of q e and c e are initially treated with the linearized equations in order to determine the model parameters and the isotherms are reconstituted using the determined values further following three types of error analysis was carried out to find out the suitability of the model which fits best the experimental values chi square χ 2 test the chi square test is the sum of the squares of the differences between the experimental data and the data obtained using the models with each squared difference divided by the corresponding data obtained using the model costodes et al 2005 goel et al 2005 the equivalent mathematical statement of χ 2 test is represented as 1 χ 2 q t q t m 2 q t m where q tm and q t are adsorption capacities mg g obtained by using the model and the experimental data respectively if the data from the model are similar to the experimental data the value of χ 2 will be smaller while if they differ the value of χ 2 will be larger root mean squared error rmse test rmse test was carried out using the following expression shihabudheen et al 2008 2 r m s e 1 n i 1 n q t m i q t i 2 where n is the number of experimental data and q tm and q t represent the adsorption capacities mg g obtained by using the model and the experimental data respectively if the data from the model are similar to the experimental data the value of rmse will be smaller while if they differ the value of rmse will be larger average percentage errors ape linear correlation coefficients r showed the fit between experimental data and linearized forms of model equations while the average percentage errors ape calculated according to eq 3 indicated the fit between the experimental and predicted values of adsorption capacity hamdaoui and naffrechoux 2007 3 ape i 1 n q e experimental q e predicted q e experimental n 100 where n the number of experimental data 3 1 2 langmuir isotherm the langmuir 1918 model assumes uniform energies of adsorption onto the surface and no transmigration of adsorbate in the plane of the surface the model is valid for monolayer sorption onto a surface with finite number of identical sites is represented as 4 q e a b c e 1 b c e where q e is the amount of solute adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbent at equilibrium mg g c e the equilibrium concentration of the solute in the bulk solution mg l a the maximum adsorption capacity mg g and b is the constant related to the free energy of adsorption l mg eq 4 can be linearized to five different linear forms as shown in table 1 the adsorption data for f onto aa alum and bp were analyzed by a regression analysis to fit the five linearized expressions of langmuir isotherm model different linear forms of the same langmuir isotherm equations significantly affect calculations of the parameters these divergent outcome shows the real complexities and problems in estimating the isotherm parameters by the linearized method the different outcomes for different linearization form of langmuir isotherm equations were produced by the variation in the error structure that would get varied upon linearizing technique of the nonlinear equation the details of these different forms of linearized langmuir equations and the method to estimate the langmuir constants a and b from these plots were explained in table 1 out of the five different types of linearized langmuir isotherm equations langmuir 1 and langmuir 2 are the most frequently used by researchers because of the minimized deviations from the fitted equation resulting in the best error distribution capacity 20 values of the estimated langmuir constants are presented in table 2 for the adsorption of fluoride onto aa alum and bp at two initial f conc of 4 and 5 mg l respectively the values of the coefficient of correlation obtained from langmuir 1 and langmuir 5 expressions indicate that there is strong positive evidence that the adsorption of f on all the three adsorbent tested follows the langmuir isotherm from table 2 it was observed that the values of langmuir parameters obtained from the five linear expressions were different it is clear that transformations of non linear model to linear forms implicitly alter their error structure and may also violate the error variance and normality assumptions of standard least squares method ho and wang 2004 the values of maximum adsorption capacity determined using five different langmuir expressions are higher than the experimental adsorbed amounts and correspond to the adsorption isotherms plateaus for all the three adsorbent studied from table 2 it has been observed that maximum adsorption capacity of aa is more than the other two adsorbent studied i e alum and bp however maximum adsorption capacity of alum at an initial f conc of 5 mg l was the higher than the aa and bp the lower coefficient of correlation values for the other three langmuir linear expressions especially in the cases of initial f conc of 5 mg l for all the three adsorbents tested aa alum and bp suggests that it is not appropriate to use this type of linearization it seems that the isotherm obtained from langmuir 1 and langmuir 5 expressions provided a better fit to the experimental data the favorable nature of adsorption can be expressed in terms of dimensionless equilibrium parameter hall et al 1966 5 r l 1 1 b c o where b is the langmuir constant and c o is the initial concentration of the adsorbate in solution the values of r l indicates the type of isotherm to be irreversible r l 0 favorable 0 r l 1 linear r l 1 or unfavorable r l 1 the dimensionless separation factors calculated for both langmuir 1 and langmuir 5 for initial f conc of 4 and 5 mg l is presented in table 2 respectively r l values were less than 1 and greater than zero indicating favorable adsorption in order to check the validity of the langmuir model model parameters were recalculated using equilibrium concentration and langmuir parameters for the five linearized forms of the equation and the error analysis was carried out the calculated χ2 rmse and ape are presented in table 2 it is clear from the calculated χ 2 rmse value and ape that the langmuir expressions are unable to describe the equilibrium data for all the three studied adsorbent in spite of the high coefficients of correlation obtained using langmuir 1 and langmuir 5 expressions these model does not describe perfectly the equilibrium data because of the higher calculated error values thus it is not appropriate to use the coefficient of correlation of the linear regression method for comparing the best fitting isotherms 3 1 3 elovich isotherm the equation defining the elovich model hamdaoui and naffrechoux 2007 elovich and larinov 1962 is based on a kinetic principle assuming that the adsorption sites increase exponentially with adsorption which implies a multilayer adsorption it is expressed by the relation 6 q e q m k e c e exp q e q m and the linearized form presented as 7 ln q e q m ln k e q m q e q m where k e is the elovich equilibrium constant l mg and q m is the elovich maximum adsorption capacity mg g if the adsorption obeys elovich equation elovich maximum adsorption capacity and elovich constant can be calculated from the slopes and the intercepts of the plot ln q e c e versus q e the elovich isotherm constants k e and q m as well as the coefficient of correlation r for the f adsorption systems onto the studied adsorbents aa alum and bp are obtained using the linear form of the equation table 3 in all cases the elovich isotherm exhibited very poor coefficients of correlation lower than those obtained for langmuir and freundlich equation this means that the assumption of the exponential covering of adsorption sites that implies multilayer adsorption is not in agreement with the experiment in the studied concentration range therefore the elovich model is also unable to describe the adsorption isotherms of f onto aa alum and bp 3 1 4 freundlich isotherm the adsorption data were also fitted into the freundlich isotherm model an empirical relationship indicative of surface heterogeneity of the adsorbent which is represented freundlich 1926 as 8 q e k f c e 1 n and the linearized form presented as 9 log q e log k f log c e where k f and n are freundlich constants related to adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity respectively the equilibrium data were further analyzed using the linearized form of freundlich equation using the same set experimental data by plotting ln q e versus ln c e to determine the maximum adsorption capacity it is necessary to operate with constant initial concentration c o and variable weights of adsorbent thus ln q m is the extrapolated value of ln q for c c o according to halsey 1952 10 k f q m c o 1 n where c o is the initial concentration of the solute in the bulk solution mg l and q m is the freundlich maximum adsorption capacity mg g the calculated freundlich isotherm constants and the corresponding coefficient of correlation values were shown in table 3 the values of maximum adsorption capacity obtained using freundlich equation at an initial f conc of 4 and 5 mg l are 14 247 and 13 898 for aa 11 779 and 10 171 for bp and 0 265 and 0 226 for bp respectively the observed maximum uptake capacity shows the superiority of aa over alum and bp the coefficients of correlation are high showing a good linearity if the linear form of langmuir 1 and langmuir 5 which shows greater correlation values as compared to other langmuir expression is used for comparison table 2 with elovich and freundlich isotherm table 3 all the three models shows good correlation however freundlich model was more suitable for the experimental data as it has slightly higher values of correlation coefficient however when compared to elovich isotherm model correlation of coefficient is far better for freundlich model and suggests suitability of freundlich model over elovich model the magnitude of the exponent n gives an indication on the favorability of adsorption it is generally stated that values of n in the range 2 10 represent good 1 2 moderately difficult and less than 1 poor adsorption characteristics treybal 1981 from the observed n value table 3 it can be concluded that aa and alum are good adsorbent for fluoride adsorption 1 380 n 2 992 however bp can proved to be a good adsorbent only at lower f conc as it has been observed n 1 for f conc of 5 mg l it has been clear form the calculated error values of χ 2 rmse value and ape table there is a good agreement between the experimental and predicted values suggesting that the freundlich model is valid for the experimental equilibrium data the calculated values of χ 2 rmse value and ape are less than the langmuir and elovich isotherm model nevertheless freundlich isotherm slightly diverges with the experimental results for higher equilibrium concentrations 3 2 adsorption kinetic studies the kinetics of f adsorption on aa alum and bp was investigated at an initial f conc of 5 mg l and at a varied adsorbent dose of 1 and 2 gm respectively for aa alum and bp the kinetic data were modeled with the pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich models in order to find out the kinetic model which is fitting experimental data closely error analysis were carried out using the chi square χ 2 root mean squared error rmse tests and average percentage error ape test for experimental data as well as the data obtained using the models as explained in section 3 1 1 3 2 1 pseudo first order model the pseudo first order rate expression of lagergren 1898 one of the most widely used rate equations bhattacharjee et al 2003 with regard to adsorption on solid surface systems which is expressed in its linearized form as 11 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t where q e and q t are the amounts adsorbed on adsorbent mg g at equilibrium and at time t respectively and k 1 is the rate constant of first order adsorption min 1 the linearized form of rate equation had been used to only evaluate k 1 value graphically provided q e value had already been evaluated experimentally meenakshi and viswanathan 2007 however in the absence of experimentally determined q e value the evaluation of k 1 value graphically appeared to be difficult however the values of k 1 and q e might be determined simultaneously and independently using the experimental values of various q t obtained at different t by applying the method of least squares to eq 11 the experimental data obtained were fitted into pseudo first order model by using the values of q t and k 1 obtained by the method of least squares and the adsorption kinetic model parameters obtained are presented in table 4 the estimated r 2 value difference in the estimated and calculated values of experimental q e i e q experimental and model q e i e q em and the error analysis χ 2 rmse and ape carried out indicated that the pseudo first order model was not suitable for describing f adsorption onto the three adsorbent studied 3 2 2 pseudo second order model the kinetic data were also tested for the pseudo second order kinetic model ho and mckay 2000 which is expressed in its linearized form as 12 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q e and q t are the amounts of metal ions adsorbed on adsorbent mg g at equilibrium and at time t and k 2 is the rate constant of the second order adsorption g mg min the values of k 2 and q e estimated through the intercept and slope of plots between t q t and t plot not shown along with coefficient of correlation r2 are also presented in table 4 kinetic data appears to follow the second order rate as suggested by r 2 value and the error analysis carried out for all the three adsorbent studied 3 2 3 elovich model elovich equation is also used successfully to describe second order kinetic assuming that the actual solid surfaces are energetically heterogeneous but the equation does not propose any definite mechanism for adsorbate adsorbent it has extensively been accepted that the chemisorption process the elovich model equation is generally expressed as chien and clayton 1980 sparks 1986 13 d q t dt α exp β q t to simplify the elovich equation chien and clayton 1980 assumed α β t and by applying the boundary conditions q t 0 at t 0 and q t 0 at t 0 eq 13 become 14 q t 1 β ln α β 1 β ln t where α mg g min and β g mg are elovich coefficients that represent the initial adsorption rate and the desorption coefficient respectively β is also related to the extent of surface coverage and activation energy for chemisorptions the kinetic constants α and β were calculated from slope and intercept of plot q t vs ln t respectively and the values are given in table 4 higher value of α than β indicated higher adsorption rate than desorption which showed viability of adsorption process a huge value of error between the estimated and experimental values suggests that elovich model cannot be used to explain the kinetics of the present study comparing pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich models it was concluded that f adsorption from solution onto the 3 adsorbent studied aa alum and bp was best represented by pseudo second order model 3 2 4 adsorption diffusion models to understand the mechanism of f adsorption from aqueous solution onto aa alum and bp liquid film diffusion and intra particle diffusion models were applied liquid film diffusion model liquid film diffusion model boyd et al 1949 is applicable at slow process of adsorbate flow through the liquid film surrounding the adsorbent particles which determines kinetics of the process the mathematical form of liquid film diffusion model is given by 15 ln 1 f k fd t where f q t q e is the fractional attainment of equilibrium and k fd is the film diffusion rate constant a linear plot of ln 1 f vs t with zero intercept suggests that adsorption kinetics is controlled by diffusion through liquid film surrounding the solid adsorbents the k fd was calculated from the slope of the straight line plot plot not shown and the observed values along with r2 are presented in table 5 a higher value of correlation coefficient r 2 i e close to unity indicated good fitness of film diffusion model however if the straight lines did not pass through the origin it suggests that film diffusion is not only the rate limiting step intra particle diffusion is also taking place in case of bp the value of intercept is very close to zero 0 0118 and 0 207 for 1 and 2 g respectively suggesting adsorption kinetics of bp may be controlled by diffusion through liquid film surrounding the bp however as the intercept is not exactly zero further analysis with bp is carried out along with aa and alum for intra particle diffusion model intra particle diffusion model according to this model the adsorbate species diffuse into the pores of adsorbent which can be the rate determining step in such cases solute uptake by adsorbent varies proportionally with t 0 5 the intra particle diffusion model weber and morris 1963 is expressed as 16 q t k ipd t 0 5 c where k ipd μg g min0 5 is intra particle diffusion rate constant with c as intercept along q t axis if plot of q t vs t 0 5 gives a straight line passing through the origin the intra particle diffusion is considered as the rate determining step if straight line deviates from the origin it indicates the contribution from film diffusion process ho and mckay 1998 the slope of the intra particle diffusion plots gave the value of k ipd and the corresponding values are presented in table 5 the plots which not shown here for aa alum and bp has two types of linearity indicating two diffusion stages of fluoride adsorption onto aa alum and bp the first stage plot passed near the origin with slope k ipd1 and is controlled by film diffusion whereas the second part with slope k ipd2 showed that the process is controlled by both film and intraparticle diffusions the estimated values of k ipd k ipd2 are also presented in table 5 the k ipd k ipd2 was attributed to the faster rate of film diffusion than intraparticle diffusion it was concluded that the adsorption kinetics might be controlled by film diffusion and intra particle diffusion simultaneously for all the three adsorbent studied 4 conclusions the three adsorbent studied can able to remove f but extent of removal of aa is higher compared to other two i e alum and bp the values of maximum adsorption capacity determined using five different langmuir expressions are higher than the experimental adsorbed amounts and correspond to the adsorption isotherms plateaus for all the three adsorbent studied aa alum and bp even though a high coefficients of correlation obtained using langmuir 1 and langmuir 5 expressions but the model does not describe perfectly the equilibrium data because of the higher calculated error values of χ 2 rmse value and ape elovich isotherm exhibited very poor coefficients of correlation lower than those obtained for langmuir and freundlich equation this means that the assumption of the exponential covering of adsorption sites that implies multilayer adsorption is not in agreement with the experiment in the studied concentration range freundlich model suggests that aa and alum are good adsorbent for fluoride adsorption 1 380 n 2 992 however bp can proved to be a good adsorbent only at lower f conc n 1 for f conc of 5 mg l error analysis suggests that there is a good agreement between the experimental and predicted values suggesting freundlich model valid for the experimental equilibrium data comparing pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich models it was concluded that f adsorption from solution onto the adsorbents studied aa alum and bp was best represented by pseudo second order model liquid film diffusion model analysis suggests that as the straight lines did not pass through the origin resistance or film diffusion might not be the sole rate limiting step the adsorption kinetics might be controlled by both film diffusion as well as intra particle diffusion simultaneously
