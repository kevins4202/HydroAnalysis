behavior geochemical reactions phreeqc 1 introduction thermodynamic modeling of gas water rock systems subjected to high temperature and pressure is essential for investigating the fluid rock interactions present in conditions found in underground environments long time scale modeling of earth history is of interest to understand fluid rock evolution short time scale modeling is valuable for research and engineering activities such as oil and gas exploration and production co2 geological storage to reduce carbon emissions or extraction of underground ore resources zhu et al 2021 gases like ch4 co2 and h2s are commonly found in the porous media of geological formations tooseh et al 2018 these gases are soluble in water and could trigger numerous chemical reactions with various minerals involved geochemical reactions that could alter the porous media in terms of rock composition mechanical properties porosity and permeability in natural gas bearing basins such as the sichuan basin in china h2s can be commonly found in some formations li et al 2014a li et al 2014b previous research reveals that at the gas water transition zone where sulfate minerals such as gypsum and or anhydrite exist as rock components dissolved methane could be oxidized by sulfate in the solutions resulting in the generation of negative bivalent sulfur li et al 2017 gaseous h2s could be generated once negative bivalent sulfur gets saturated in aqueous phase co2 capture and geological storage ccs is considered as a promising way for the reduction of carbon emission into atmosphere from fossil fuel combustion wang et al 2021 xie et al 2015 li and li 2015 when co2 is injected into an aqueous phase it is partly dissolved in the aqueous phase in both molecular form and in various ions simultaneously carbonate anions could also be combined with other cations and carbonate minerals could be precipitated the mineral carbonation is considered as a way of permanent co2 storage geochemical modeling and numerical simulation are effective ways to understand the procedure quantitatively and can play an important role in decision making of related human activities previous researchers have been working on numerical modeling of phase equilibria and speciation of gas water rock systems some of the authors focus on the modeling of gas water phase equilibrium according to springer et al 2012 the modeling methods fall into two categories fugacity fugacity methods and fugacity activity methods the first method is eos equation of state based the same type of eos is used for both gaseous phase and aqueous phase when polar molecules such as h2o are included in the systems the classic cubic models peng and robinson 1976 struggle to reproduce the fluid phase behavior søreide and whitson 1992 sw model built a phase equilibrium model for hydrocarbons co2 h2s n2 brine systems at surface pressure ranging from room temperature to temperatures over 100 c the model is based on a modified classic peng robinson model peng and robinson 1976 li et al 2015a extended the sw model to be able to deal with higher pressures battistelli and marcolini 2009 further developed the sw model and implemented it in the tough2 simulator pruess et al 1999 sun and dubessy 2010 improved saft models statistical associating fluid theory proposed by chapman et al 1990 and used the new model for gas water equilibrium calculations to overcome the inaccuracy of cubic type models for systems with water kontogeorgis et al 1996 developed the cubic plus association model cpa for short however these fugacity fugacity type models are all struggling with the balance between model accuracy and computation efficiency the second method fugacity activity uses eos to calculate gaseous phase fugacity and utilizes activity models to calculate aqueous phase activity coefficients rumpf and maurer 1993 developed a co2 solubility model based on the pitzer model pitzer 1973 for aqueous phase activity calculations spycher et al 2003 spycher and pruess 2005 carefully reviewed experimental data of co2 h2o nacl systems and developed the co2 brine mutual solubility model by making use of the soave redlich kwong model srk for short a cubic model proposed by soave 1972 for gaseous phase fugacity and pitzer model for aqueous phase activity duan and co workers developed a series of models of gas solubility in water and brine with a virial type of eos duan et al 1992 combined with the pitzer model duan and sun 2003 mao and duan 2006 duan and mao 2006 geng and duan 2010 li et al 2014a li et al 2014b compared the computation efficiency and model accuracy of a number of existing methods and concluded that the fugacity activity method is superior to the fugacity fugacity method for mutual solubility modeling of gas brine systems neural network and machine learning are alternative ways of predicting mutual solubilities and phase properties of fluids under various temperatures and pressures bemani et al 2020a bemani et al 2020b abdi khanghah et al 2018 keybondorian et al 2017a and keybondorian et al 2017b however these kinds of methods are data driven and require a huge amount of experimental data for systems with multi components the experimental data is usually limited thermodynamic modeling is therefore the most reliable way for complex fluid systems for geochemical modeling of water rock interactions there are three famous software packages phreeqc appelo et al 2014 toughreact xu et al 2011 and eq 3 6 wolery 2010 they have been widely used in reactive transport modeling of fluid flow in underground porous media zhu and anderson 2002 xu et al 2011 the thermodynamic databases are well setup and continue to mature with the ongoing addition of chemical reaction parameters found from water rock experiments in our previous work li et al 2014 li et al 2015b li et al 2018 we have built mutual solubility models for a series of gases and brine including co2 hydrocarbons h2s n2 and o2 by careful reviewing all the existing experimental data with the fugacity activity method these models have been proven to work accurately and reliably in this work we extend the models to full geochemical models of gas water mineral systems by coupling them with the open source code of phreeqc phreeqc itself can also model gas water mineral systems and gas phase calculations are included in the computation system there are some limitations however when gas components are introduced in the system the calculation will sometimes become unstable and crash when h2o is considered in gas phase computation instabilities could always be observed in our practical experience by only using the water mineral reaction part from phreeqc and combining it with gas water mutual solubility models gas water mineral systems can be modeled in a reliable and stable way with the proposed coupled model the following properties can be calculated in the same time 1 mutual solubilities of gas and water 2 speciation in aqueous phase including ion concentrations of each species and ph 3 mineral precipitation and dissolution on conditions of equilibrium states or kinetic procedure the layout of the paper is as follows section 2 presents the theoretical basis and introduces the numerical implementation method section 3 presents the model validation in terms of mutual solubilities of gas brine systems and various mineral solubilities by comparing results with existing experimental data section 4 discusses the applicability of the model in the numerical simulations of uranium in situ leaching co2 geological storage and natural gas souring and demonstrates the calculation stability and reliability in real world applications 2 basis and numerical implementation in our previous work models of gas brine equilibria were proposed based on the fugacity activity method li and duan 2011 li et al 2014a li et al 2014b li et al 2015a li et al 2015b the underlying theoretical basis is here that at equilibrium state the chemical potentials of gas phase and water phase for each component in a system are equal 1 μ i g μ i w i 1 2 c where μ is chemical potential g denotes gas phase and w denotes water phase c is the number of components in a given system in the fugacity activity method the non ideal property of gas phase is described by fugacity and calculated by eos equation of state models peng and robinson 1976 pr for short the activity coefficient is used to describe the non ideal property of water phase components and calculated by activity models such as pitzer model and pitzer 1973 and debye hückel model debye and hückel 1923 pitzer model form equations were used in the previous work li and duan 2011 2 1 gas water equilibrium model with a gas water equilibrium model at given temperature pressure feed mole fractions and water salinity the phase mole fractions and mole fractions of species in each phases can be calculated the chemical potential of gas and water phases from eq 1 can be expressed as follows 2 μ i g μ i g 0 t p rtln f i t p y i μ i g 0 t p rtln y i p rtln φ i t p y i 3 μ i w μ i w 0 t p rtln a i t p m salt μ i w 0 t p rtln nw x i rtln γ i t p m salt where μ i g 0 is the standard chemical potential of species i in gas phase i e ideal gas chemical potential at 1 bar μ i w 0 is the standard chemical potential of species i in an ideal aqueous solution with a hypothetical unit molality t is temperature in k and p is pressure in bar r is the gas constant 8 31446 j k mol y i is mole fraction of gas phase species i x i is mole fraction of water phase species i nw is mole number of h2o in 1 kg water 55 508 f i is the fugacity and φ i is the fugacity coefficient of species i in gas phase a i is the activity and γ i is the activity coefficient of species i in water phase m salt is the molality of salts dissolved in water combining eq 1 3 we can get the following equation 4 μ i w 0 μ i g 0 rt ln f i a i define ln k i μ i w 0 μ i g 0 rt then we have 5 y i p φ i nw k i x i γ i where k i equilibrium constant of component i as mentioned above the fugacity coefficients φ i are calculated by pr model peng and robinson 1976 the activity coefficients γ i are calculated by activity models pitzer 1973 debye and hückel 1923 the mutual solubility computation flow with the fugacity activity method is as follows 1 the feed mole fractions z i i 1 2 c of the fluid gas water system should be provided 2 initial estimation of the aqueous component mole fractions x i i 1 2 c and gas phase component mole fractions y i i 1 2 c for dissolved gas components 0 01 can be recommended and p h 2 o sat p can be recommended for h2o mole fraction in gas phase p h2o sat is pure water saturation pressure at the given temperature 3 update fugacity coefficients ϕ i of gas phase components with the calculated or estimated gas phase mole fractions y i 4 update activity coefficients γ i of aqueous components with the calculated or estimated aqueous phase mole fractions x i 5 calculate equilibrium constants k i with mole fractions of each phase fugacity coefficients and activity coefficients refer to li et al 2015b for the equations of equilibrium constants 6 solve rachford rice equation michelson and mollerup 2007 i 1 c z i k i 1 1 k i 1 β 0 and get gas phase mole fraction β 7 update x i and y i with z i k i and β x i z i 1 k i 1 β y i z i k i 1 k i 1 β 8 estimate the change of k i with k i k i old k i old if it is small enough stop the calculation if not go to step 3 2 2 coupling scheme in this work we couple the phreeqc chemical reaction module appelo et al 2014 with the mutual solubility models the activities of dissolved gas and mineral species can be calculated by the phreeqc module with phreeqc various thermodynamic database files can be used that contain hundreds of the chemical reactions involved and multiple activity models with the coupled models we can not only calculate the mutual gas water solubility but also assess the effects of dissolved gas on water mineral reactions with given fluid feed composition at a certain temperature and a pressure gas water mutual solubilities are calculated following the above computation flow in each iteration of x i i 1 2 c the water properties are calculated by phreeqc with for the dissolved gas species and mineral species and activity coefficients will be passed to mutual solubility calculations after the mutual solubility computation converges an additional water mineral equilibrium kinetics calculation is carried out to determine the final water phase concentrations and properties the whole computation procedure will stop when there are no redox reactions if redox reactions are involved in the system the dissolved gas components could be consumed significantly by redox reactions the above procedure should be repeated until the dissolved gas concentrations do not change anymore with subsequent iterations the calculation procedure is illustrated in fig 1 2 3 parameter updates the proposed computation method should be able to calculate 1 gas solubilities in aqueous phase equilibrium with minerals 2 mineral solubilities in aqueous phase dissolved saturated with gases 3 water properties including ph concentrations of various dissolved species and species distribution of dissolved components in order to successfully achieve these objectives and ensure reliable results the related model parameters should be validated with the available experimental data as well the scope of the gas water mineral system considered in this work is as follows 1 gas components co2 ch4 h2s n2 h2o and o2 2 salt mineral phases halite calcite gypsum anhydrite and uranium minerals more details in section 4 nevertheless the numerical framework is general and more gas or mineral components can be included in the calculations if all the related thermodynamic parameters are provided in the database file the parameters that need to be determined for the current work include the gas equation of state eos for fugacity coefficient calculations equilibrium constants and pitzer model parameters more details about these parameters will be introduced in the following sections the equations and parameters related to the equilibrium constants of the gas components are all discussed in our previous work and will not be repeated here 2 3 1 eos model parameters the peng robinson model pr model in short peng and robinson 1976 is used in this work for the eos the pr model parameters for the aforementioned gas components can all be found from our previous work li et al 2014a li et al 2014b li et al 2015a 2015b li et al 2017 li et al 2018 table 1 lists all the parameters used in the model 2 3 2 pitzer parameters as discussed in earlier sections the activity coefficients are calculated by the phreeqc module the activity model can be the b dot model the debye hückel model or the pitzer model the specific model used will be determined by the selection in the phreeqc database file the pitzer model pitzer 1973 has been proven to be able to accurately reproduce aqueous species activities up to high levels of solution salinity by many others in earlier works harvie and weare 1980 harvie et al 1984 greenberg and møller 1989 christov and moller 2004 li and duan 2007a li and duan 2007b duan and li 2008 li and duan 2011 pitzer parameters mainly include binary interaction parameters of cation anion β c a 0 β c a 1 and c c a φ cation cation θ c c anion anion θ a a and neutral ion λ c n and λ a n and triple particle interaction parameters ψ c c a ψ c a a and ζ n a c for gas solubility predictions the neutral ion binary interaction parameters are the most important ones in the model the relationship between dissolved gas component activity coefficients and pitzer parameters is expressed in the following equation 6 ln γ i c 2 m c λ i c a 2 m a λ i a c a m a m c ζ i a c where γ i is the activity coefficient of dissolved gas component i a denotes an anion c denotes a cation m c is the cation molality in aqueous phase m a is the anion molality in aqueous phase the pitzer parameters are usually functions of temperature but many different kind of equation formulations are used in earlier research in phreeqc the pitzer parameters λ i c λ i a and ζ i a c are determined by the fixed temperature dependency equation as follows 7 f b 0 b 1 1 t 1 t r b 2 ln t t r b 3 t t r b 4 t 2 t r 2 b 5 1 t 2 1 t r 2 where tr 298 15 k and bi i 0 1 5 are the coefficients some of the related pitzer parameters can be found from our previous work li et al 2018 table 2 lists the newly updated parameters used in this work 3 model validation to validate the proposed model the currently available experimental data is compared with the calculated results of the model proposed in this work the experimental data includes 1 mutual solubilities of gas brine systems in various kinds of aqueous solutions 2 mineral solubilities in aqueous solutions dissolved with gases 3 1 mutual solubilities of gas brine systems the gas solubilities in aqueous solution dissolved with different kinds of salts and h2o solubility in gaseous phase are calculated with the model and compared with the current available experimental data for gas solubility in pure water phase the phreeqc module does not need to be called as all calculations can be done by the mutual solubility models from our previous work so in this section gas solubility in pure water will not further be discussed 3 1 1 co2 solubility the available experimental data of mutual solubility of co2 brine systems has a sufficient number of datapoints for the parameter regression the temperature pressure ranges from surface conditions to more than 200 c and more than 1000 bar the dissolved salts included in the experiments are nacl and nh4 2so4 to validate the model reliability we compared the mutual solubility of co2 brine systems with experimental measurements among this model and the previous models duan and sun 2003 søreide and whitson 1992 duan and sun 2003 proposed an accurate model ds model for short of co2 solubility in water and brine in a wide range of temperature pressure and salinity the ds model is usually thought to be the most accurate co2 solubility model so far fig 2 shows the comparisons between the calculated results of the models sw is short for soride whitson model søreide and whitson 1992 and the experimental data different levels of dissolved salt molality are investigated up to a relatively high value of over 4 m to quantitively assess the model accuracy the average absolute deviation aad is defined as follows aad 1 n x model x exp x exp 100 where n denotes the number of experimental data x model denotes the result calculated by the model x exp denotes the experimental measurement in the meantime the maximum of absolute deviation mad is defined to show the stability of the model table 3 presents the values of aad and mad of different models from table 3 this model shows the smallest aad and mad the ds model can accurately reproduce the co2 solubility in brine to high temperature pressure and salinity but its accuracy for h2o solubility in co2 rich phase is not good enough the accuracy of sw model gets worse with the increase of salinity 3 1 2 ch4 solubility blount and price 1982 conducted experiments of ch4 solubility in nacl solutions with the nacl molality ranging from 1 95 to 5 85 m and pressures ranging from 100 bar to 900 bar stoessell and byrne 1982 measured ch4 solubility in aqueous solutions dissolved with various salts including cacl2 kcl and k2so4 at 298 15 k with pressures below 60 bar duan and mao 2006 proposed an accurate model of ch4 solubility in brine in a wide temperature pressure and salinity dm model for short fig 3 a and b present ch4 solubilities in nacl solutions and kcl solutions calculated by this model dm model and sw model compared with the experimental measurements fig 3 c shows the calculated h2o solubilities in ch4 rich phase by the model compared with the experimental measurements table 4 lists the aad and mad values of different models showing that this model always gives minimum deviations 3 1 3 h2s solubility h2s solubility experiments are difficult to conduct due to the toxicity and the corrosivity of the solutions the currently available experimental results of h2s solubility in aqueous phase are usually within substantial limited temperature and pressure ranges xia et al 2000 conducted a series of measurements of h2s solubility in nacl solutions and na2so4 solutions with pressures up to 100 bar and temperatures up to 120 c gillesp and wilson 1982 measured h2o solubility in h2s rich phase to 200 bar at different temperatures duan et al 2007 proposed a model of h2s solubility in brine with temperature to 500 k and pressure to 200 bar duan model fig 4 a and b shows the comparisons of the experimental h2s solubility in brine and the calculated results by this model duan model and sw model fig 4 c shows the h2o solubility in h2s rich phase calculated by this model duan model and sw model compared with experimental data table 5 lists the aad and mad values for different models from the comparisons this model shows the minimum deviations for h2s solubility in brine the sw model shows the minimum deviation for h2o solubility in h2s rich phase the aad value of this model is under 6 which is also small enough 3 1 4 n2 and o2 solubility o sullivan and smith 1970 measured n2 solubility in nacl solutions from 0 to 4 m within wide pressure and temperature ranges mao and duan 2006 proposed a model to predict n2 solubility model in a wide range of temperature pressure and salinity dm model for short fig 5 a shows the accurate predictions of the proposed model compared to the experimental data and other models sw model and dm model the existing experimental data of o2 solubility in aqueous solutions is not sufficient to make a proper comparison some limited measurements can be found at low temperatures and pressures geng and duan 2010 proposed a model of o2 solubility in brine with temperature to 200 c and pressure to 260 bar dg model fig 5 b shows the o2 solubility in nacl solutions measured by yasunishi 1978 and the calculated results by this model and the dm model on the same conditions pressure 1 bar temperature 273 k and 298 k nacl molality from 0 to 2 5 m fig 5 c shows the measurements in kcl solutions by yasunishi 1978 and the calculated results by this model and the dg model o2 brine mutual solubility calculation is out of the scope of the sw model the trends of o2 solubility in kcl solutions can be predicted by the model however at 308 k and 298 k the calculated results are underestimated table 6 gives the aad and mad values for n2 solubilities calculated by different models this model shows the minimum deviations 3 2 mineral solubilities dissolved with gases the solubility of minerals dissolved in aqueous phase is affected by temperature pressure and salinities if the aqueous phase is in equilibrium with the gaseous phase the dissolved gaseous species will also affect the mineral solubility to correctly reproduce the mineral solubilities the equilibrium constant of the mineral is an important parameter to address in this section the goal is not to check the accuracy of different kinds of mineral solubility in water or aqueous solutions systematically but instead to check if the new proposed coupled method can correctly reproduce the mineral solubilities in solutions equilibrium with gases co2 is an active gas component that will significantly influence the carbonate minerals or other related minerals li et al 2018 li and li 2019 some experimental data can be found for mineral co2 h2o systems in this section we will discuss the solubilities of calcite magnesite and gypsum in aqueous solutions with the presence of co2 comparisons with available experimental data are made to check the model validity the equilibrium constants of minerals are calculated with expressions from 8 and 9 in phreeqc 8 k i k h t p ref exp v m i p p ref rt and 9 log k h t p ref a 0 a 1 t a 2 t a 3 log t a 4 t 2 a 5 t 2 table 7 gives the parameters in eq 8 and 9 and the literature sources for different minerals ellis 1963 systematically measured the calcite solubility in pure water and nacl solutions at 12 bar at temperatures ranging from about 400 k to 550 k with the coupled computation framework the experimental results can be well reproduced compared with the experimental work fig 6 additionally the calculations are carried out by phreeqc v3 0 under same conditions to show the improvements of the coupled model proposed by this work from fig 6 it can be clearly seen that in the presence of co2 calcite solubilities are underestimated especially at low temperature regions at various nacl concentrations the presence of co2 in gaseous phase equilibrium with aqueous phase can significantly influence the solubility of carbonate minerals when co2 is dissolved in aqueous phase the concentrations of carbonate species will increase while ph levels will decrease additionally the dissolution of carbonate minerals should be enhanced there is some experimental work of magnesite solubility in water which is in equilibrium with co2 at various pressures wells 1915 bar 1932 halla et al 1962 berg and borisova 1960 christ and hostetler 1970 using the same experimental conditions we calculated the magnesite solubility with the proposed model and phreeqc v3 0 both of the calculated results are compared to the experimental results fig 7 as can be seen in the figure the proposed model matches the experimental measurements significantly better than using phreeqc directly phreeqc v3 0 underestimates the magnesite solubilities at presence of co2 at lower temperatures at co2 partial pressure 0 95 atm the average absolute deviation aad of this model is 8 7 and that of phreeqc is 43 8 at co2 partial pressure 0 31 atm the aad of this model is 13 6 and phreeqc gives 30 1 aad at co2 partial pressure 0 0003 atm the magnesite solubility is very small high accuracy prediction is hard for models both of models underestimate the magnesite solubility the aad of this model is 57 2 and the aad of phrreqc is 64 9 rendel et al 2016 measured gypsum solubility at 70 bar and 25 c with different initial solutions and various dissolved co2 concentrations one measurement was conducted of a supersaturated gypsum solution solution 1 in table 8 while another of an undersaturated gypsum solution solution 2 in table 8 we calculate gypsum solubility using the proposed model looking at the same two types of initial solutions and various dissolved co2 solutions from 0 to 0 8 mol kg fig 8 presents the comparisons of the calculated by this model and phreeqc and experimental results and shows a good agreement between this model and experimental measurements phreeqc shows the unsatisfactory calculations 4 applications in this section three case studies are provided to show 1 the computation stability 2 reasonability of the model results as well as 3 the potential applicability of the proposed model in different scientific research areas 4 1 uranium in situ leaching in situ leaching isl is one of the ways to extract uranium from the host rock and is especially necessary for low grad mines liu et al 2021 the basic idea of isl is to inject acid or alkaline fluids to enhance the dissolution of uranium minerals and extract uranium from the solution in underground environments natural uranium has several chemical valence states 3 u 3 4 u 4 5 u 5 and 6 u 6 in host rocks uranium minerals are usually under u 4 state similar to uraninite with chemical formula uo2 usually it is difficult for uranium to dissolve in underground water found in natural environments however when an oxidizing agent is injected u 4 ions in water will be oxidized to u 6 ions and a larger amount of u 4 minerals will be able to dissolve increasing the solubility of uranium the co2 o2 leaching method is one of the common isl technologies in both research and real project implementation shen et al 2020 xu et al 2011 in this method o2 plays the role of oxidizing agent and the presence of co2 will efficiently promote the dissolution of uranium minerals to investigate how o2 and co2 injection can help the uranium dissolution in aqueous phase a numerical model can be designed and the simulation can be carried out by the proposed coupled numerical framework the environmental and geochemical conditions of the model are presented in table 9 the thermodynamic parameters for the co2 o2 water uranium systems have been discussed in details in previous work shen et al 2020 and the results are adopted here in the updated geochemical database various kinds of aqueous species of uranium systems are considered including hydroxide carbonate and bicarbonate complexes in the simulation model the initial water and uranium minerals are set to be in equilibrium with the co2 o2 mixtures different scenarios of co2 mole fraction in the gas phase are considered ranging from 0 to 1 0 the simulation results show that uranium is mainly in 6 valence state when in equilibrium and dissolved in water and other ion state concentrations are negligible fig 9 presents the u 6 molality and the mole number of uranium mineral dissolution and precipitation in aqueous phase varying with co2 mole fraction in gas the following conclusions can be drawn adding co2 in gas phase will dramatically increase the u 6 molality in aqueous phase when pure o2 in the gas phase is dissolved in aqueous phase uraninite will be dissolved and u 4 will convert to u 6 uo3 0 9h2o alpha will precipitate with co2 is dissolved in aqueous phase the amount of uraninite dissolution and uo3 0 9h2o alpha precipitation that can be found decreases more uo2co3 will precipitate with more co2 dissolution overall u 6 concentration in aqueous phase increases with co2 mole fraction increase with pure co2 in gas phase uranium concentration in aqueous phase decreases dramatically since u 4 is not able to be oxidized to u 6 and uraninite solubility is extremely low the geochemical simulations give a clear insight in the mechanism of co2 o2 leaching the thermodynamic parameters of a specific system are highly dependent on temperature and pressure with the increase of depth both temperature and pressure will increase according to the thermal gradient and pressure gradient the gas water mineral equilibrium changes accordingly with depth to investigate the behavior of co2 o2 leaching at different depths simulations were run at depths from 0 to 3000 m assuming a thermal gradient of 25 c km and a pressure gradient of 100 bar km the mole ratio of co2 and o2 in gas phase is fixed at 1 1 for the simulations other model settings are unchanged and listed in table 9 the simulation results are shown in fig 10 u 6 molality in aqueous phase increases with depth at first up to 300 m but decreases with depths over 300 m fig 10 a with the depth increase the dissolution of both co2 and o2 increases fig 10 b the ph of the solution decreases with depth dramatically at depths below 300 m but stabilizes at the deeper part the simulation results show that co2 o2 leaching is most efficient for shallower mines with the current model settings especially at a depth around 300 m the current simulation case can shed some light on how temperature and pressure effect the efficiency of co2 o2 leaching method but more systematic research should be done to achieve more general and conclusive results 4 2 co2 geological storage the first full chain co2 capture and storage project was conducted by shenhua group in ordos basin more than 300 000 t of co2 was injected into the formations at a depth of over 1500 m in this section the co2 water rock interactions are simulated using water and rock samples from the shiqianfeng formation table 10 yang et al 2017 the local pressure is about 189 bar and temperature is about 62 c the porosity of the reservoir is assumed to be 0 2 the simulations are carried out with the proposed method with a time span of 100 000 years initially the aquifer is of low salinity and close to neutral condition slightly acidic and in equilibrium with the minerals in table 10 the reactions of minerals and water are considered as a kinetic procedure after the co2 injection the reaction rate equation used here follows palandri and kharaka 2004 eq 10 10 r ka 1 q k where r is the reaction rate k is the rate constant a is the reactive surface area of the mineral q is the ionic activity product k is the equilibrium constant the rate constant k is expressed as follows 11 k k 25 a e e aa r t 298 15 a h n a k 25 n e e an r t 298 15 k 25 b e e ab r t 298 15 a h n b where k 25a k 25n and k 25b are rate constant at 25 c for acid mechanism neutral mechanism and base mechanism respectively e aa e an and e ab are arrhenius activation energy n a and n b are reaction orders for acid and base mechanisms r is the gas constant 8 314 j k mol the parameters for each related mineral can be found from table 11 xu et al 2011 the simulation results can be found from fig 11 fig 11 a shows the calculation results based on the assumptions that water is in equilibrium with the minerals listed in table 10 a at the start of the process in this case the potassium concentration in the water is in equilibrium with illite at 2 0e 4 m after co2 injection there is dissolution of dolomite and precipitation of calcite and anhydrite the chemical reactions of the mineral dissolution or precipitation start out at a constant but significant rate and only slightly slow down after a long time period the changes are hardly noticeable within the first 1000 years after co2 injection the transition of illite to smectite and kaolinite can be observed clearly after 1000 years however the results are quite sensitive to the potassium concentration in the water at initial conditions if we set the potassium concentration in water to 1 82e 03 m rich potassium case the chemical reactions of the clay minerals will be completely different this case is shown in fig 11 b after hundreds of years smectite and kaolinite are now dissolved and illite precipitates 4 3 natural gas souring in the sichuan basin h2s can be found in deep gas reservoirs li et al 2014a li et al 2014b li et al 2017 an important reason for the presence of h2s could be the gas water mineral interactions in the gas water transition zones li et al 2014a li et al 2014b methane water and sulfate minerals anhydrite or gypsum exist both methane and sulfate minerals will be dissolved in water the redox geochemical reactions are triggered with bacteria mediated ch4 in water as c 4 is oxidized to c 4 and so4 2 in water as s 6 is reduced to s 2 once s 2 gets saturated h2s will be released s 2 concentration is restricted by h2s solubility in water the key geochemical reaction is expressed in the following equation eq 12 12 so 4 2 ch 4 co 3 2 s 2 2h h 2 o the numerical experiments have been conducted in our previous work li et al 2017 in that work the calculation of gas water mineral equilibrium is split into two parts gas solubility in aqueous phase by an independent gas solubility model code and water mineral equilibrium by phreeqc when calculating gas solubility in aqueous phase the water compositions have to be estimated roughly by salinity with this model the full gas water mineral equilibrium can be calculated at the same time and a more stable and reliable results can be achieved to simulate the gas souring procedure we setup a gas water mineral system the gas components are ch4 initial mole fraction 100 and h2s initial mole fraction 0 the initial water is of low salinity with 0 1 m nacl dissolved the system is assumed to consist of 1 kg of water the minerals of anhydrite initial mole number 1 0 gypsum initial mole number 0 0 and calcite initial mole number 0 0 are included in the system we consider the temperature and pressure conditions from surface conditions to deep underground 5000 m the temperature and pressure gradients are the same as the ones used in section 4 1 fig 12 shows the simulation results for ph levels ion concentrations in water and mineral changes varying with depth from the results we can clearly find that 1 in the entire depth interval sulfate is dissolved to the solution and oxidizes the dissolved ch4 to carbonates in the water 2 gypsum is stable in the shallower reservoir less than 1500 m and converted to anhydrite in deeper parts 3 with the increase in the depth the redox geochemical reaction is enhanced and higher s 2 concentration in water can be found 4 in the deeper reservoir more calcite is precipitated 5 conclusions in this work we propose a new computation framework that couples the gas solubility models li et al 2014a li et al 2014b li et al 2015a 2015b with the water mineral interaction computation package phreeqc in the coupling scheme a gas water mutual solubility computation module and a water mineral interaction computation module are included in the gas water mutual solubility calculations the activities of dissolved gas components are calculated by the phreeqc water property calculation module after convergence is achieved for gas water mutual solubility calculations the dissolved gas concentrations are used for the water mineral interaction calculations in the previous work the pitzer model is used for gas component activity calculations to achieve high accuracy of gas solubility in high salinity solutions in this work the phreeqc pitzer database is used with updated gas component related pitzer parameters for gas solubility calculations with this newly proposed computation framework gas water mineral interaction calculations can be carried out stably and accurately to validate the proposed computation framework comparisons are made between the current available experimental data and the calculations by the proposed model in terms of various gas including co2 ch4 h2s n2 and o2 and mineral including calcite magnesite and gypsum solubilities in aqueous solution the calculations by other previous models are also checked the model accuracies are assessed with average absolute deviation from the experimental data this model always has least deviations the comparison shows that the measured data of both gas solubility and mineral solubility can be reliably reproduced by the model calculations in broad temperature pressure and composition ranges the proposed computation framework can be extended to include solubility calculations of other minerals as well however the reliability of the thermodynamic parameter database is important for the computation accuracy one may need to update the parameters in the thermodynamic database with relevant available experimental data the model calculation comparisons from section 3 have demonstrated that the coupling framework can improve the accuracy of simulations of phase equilibrium systems with coexisting gas water minerals the computation framework has the potential to be applied in various fields related to gas water mineral interactions to illustrate the practical applicability of the model computation examples are provided of uranium in situ leaching co2 geological storage and natural gas souring 1 in the example of uranium in situ leaching co2 o2 is injected into a uraninite bearing aquifer the dissolved o2 in the solution helps the oxidization of u 4 to u 6 which has a higher solubility co2 further enhances the solubility of u 6 minerals the co2 o2 method can enhance the recovery of uranium in situ leaching the effects are more profound with depth 2 the application of co2 geological storage is modeled based on the shenhua ccs project the models of co2 water minerals systems are run with kinetic reactions from long time scale simulations the transformations of clay minerals after co2 injection can be clearly observed 3 a ch4 h2s water sulfate mineral system model is designed to simulate the gas souring procedure with both ch4 and sulfate dissolved in the gas water transition zone of natural gas reservoirs dissolved ch4 can be oxidized to carbonates at the same time sulfate is reduced to s 2 h2s will be released after the solution becomes saturated with s 2 with the increase in reservoir depth the effects are enhanced the three application cases show that the proposed coupled computation scheme is well implemented and can simulate gas water mineral systems stably declaration of

storage and natural gas souring are provided in the paper the application cases have additionally proven the stability and reliability of the proposed model keywords gas solubility models phase behavior geochemical reactions phreeqc 1 introduction thermodynamic modeling of gas water rock systems subjected to high temperature and pressure is essential for investigating the fluid rock interactions present in conditions found in underground environments long time scale modeling of earth history is of interest to understand fluid rock evolution short time scale modeling is valuable for research and engineering activities such as oil and gas exploration and production co2 geological storage to reduce carbon emissions or extraction of underground ore resources zhu et al 2021 gases like ch4 co2 and h2s are commonly found in the porous media of geological formations tooseh et al 2018 these gases are soluble in water and could trigger numerous chemical reactions with various minerals involved geochemical reactions that could alter the porous media in terms of rock composition mechanical properties porosity and permeability in natural gas bearing basins such as the sichuan basin in china h2s can be commonly found in some formations li et al 2014a li et al 2014b previous research reveals that at the gas water transition zone where sulfate minerals such as gypsum and or anhydrite exist as rock components dissolved methane could be oxidized by sulfate in the solutions resulting in the generation of negative bivalent sulfur li et al 2017 gaseous h2s could be generated once negative bivalent sulfur gets saturated in aqueous phase co2 capture and geological storage ccs is considered as a promising way for the reduction of carbon emission into atmosphere from fossil fuel combustion wang et al 2021 xie et al 2015 li and li 2015 when co2 is injected into an aqueous phase it is partly dissolved in the aqueous phase in both molecular form and in various ions simultaneously carbonate anions could also be combined with other cations and carbonate minerals could be precipitated the mineral carbonation is considered as a way of permanent co2 storage geochemical modeling and numerical simulation are effective ways to understand the procedure quantitatively and can play an important role in decision making of related human activities previous researchers have been working on numerical modeling of phase equilibria and speciation of gas water rock systems some of the authors focus on the modeling of gas water phase equilibrium according to springer et al 2012 the modeling methods fall into two categories fugacity fugacity methods and fugacity activity methods the first method is eos equation of state based the same type of eos is used for both gaseous phase and aqueous phase when polar molecules such as h2o are included in the systems the classic cubic models peng and robinson 1976 struggle to reproduce the fluid phase behavior søreide and whitson 1992 sw model built a phase equilibrium model for hydrocarbons co2 h2s n2 brine systems at surface pressure ranging from room temperature to temperatures over 100 c the model is based on a modified classic peng robinson model peng and robinson 1976 li et al 2015a extended the sw model to be able to deal with higher pressures battistelli and marcolini 2009 further developed the sw model and implemented it in the tough2 simulator pruess et al 1999 sun and dubessy 2010 improved saft models statistical associating fluid theory proposed by chapman et al 1990 and used the new model for gas water equilibrium calculations to overcome the inaccuracy of cubic type models for systems with water kontogeorgis et al 1996 developed the cubic plus association model cpa for short however these fugacity fugacity type models are all struggling with the balance between model accuracy and computation efficiency the second method fugacity activity uses eos to calculate gaseous phase fugacity and utilizes activity models to calculate aqueous phase activity coefficients rumpf and maurer 1993 developed a co2 solubility model based on the pitzer model pitzer 1973 for aqueous phase activity calculations spycher et al 2003 spycher and pruess 2005 carefully reviewed experimental data of co2 h2o nacl systems and developed the co2 brine mutual solubility model by making use of the soave redlich kwong model srk for short a cubic model proposed by soave 1972 for gaseous phase fugacity and pitzer model for aqueous phase activity duan and co workers developed a series of models of gas solubility in water and brine with a virial type of eos duan et al 1992 combined with the pitzer model duan and sun 2003 mao and duan 2006 duan and mao 2006 geng and duan 2010 li et al 2014a li et al 2014b compared the computation efficiency and model accuracy of a number of existing methods and concluded that the fugacity activity method is superior to the fugacity fugacity method for mutual solubility modeling of gas brine systems neural network and machine learning are alternative ways of predicting mutual solubilities and phase properties of fluids under various temperatures and pressures bemani et al 2020a bemani et al 2020b abdi khanghah et al 2018 keybondorian et al 2017a and keybondorian et al 2017b however these kinds of methods are data driven and require a huge amount of experimental data for systems with multi components the experimental data is usually limited thermodynamic modeling is therefore the most reliable way for complex fluid systems for geochemical modeling of water rock interactions there are three famous software packages phreeqc appelo et al 2014 toughreact xu et al 2011 and eq 3 6 wolery 2010 they have been widely used in reactive transport modeling of fluid flow in underground porous media zhu and anderson 2002 xu et al 2011 the thermodynamic databases are well setup and continue to mature with the ongoing addition of chemical reaction parameters found from water rock experiments in our previous work li et al 2014 li et al 2015b li et al 2018 we have built mutual solubility models for a series of gases and brine including co2 hydrocarbons h2s n2 and o2 by careful reviewing all the existing experimental data with the fugacity activity method these models have been proven to work accurately and reliably in this work we extend the models to full geochemical models of gas water mineral systems by coupling them with the open source code of phreeqc phreeqc itself can also model gas water mineral systems and gas phase calculations are included in the computation system there are some limitations however when gas components are introduced in the system the calculation will sometimes become unstable and crash when h2o is considered in gas phase computation instabilities could always be observed in our practical experience by only using the water mineral reaction part from phreeqc and combining it with gas water mutual solubility models gas water mineral systems can be modeled in a reliable and stable way with the proposed coupled model the following properties can be calculated in the same time 1 mutual solubilities of gas and water 2 speciation in aqueous phase including ion concentrations of each species and ph 3 mineral precipitation and dissolution on conditions of equilibrium states or kinetic procedure the layout of the paper is as follows section 2 presents the theoretical basis and introduces the numerical implementation method section 3 presents the model validation in terms of mutual solubilities of gas brine systems and various mineral solubilities by comparing results with existing experimental data section 4 discusses the applicability of the model in the numerical simulations of uranium in situ leaching co2 geological storage and natural gas souring and demonstrates the calculation stability and reliability in real world applications 2 basis and numerical implementation in our previous work models of gas brine equilibria were proposed based on the fugacity activity method li and duan 2011 li et al 2014a li et al 2014b li et al 2015a li et al 2015b the underlying theoretical basis is here that at equilibrium state the chemical potentials of gas phase and water phase for each component in a system are equal 1 μ i g μ i w i 1 2 c where μ is chemical potential g denotes gas phase and w denotes water phase c is the number of components in a given system in the fugacity activity method the non ideal property of gas phase is described by fugacity and calculated by eos equation of state models peng and robinson 1976 pr for short the activity coefficient is used to describe the non ideal property of water phase components and calculated by activity models such as pitzer model and pitzer 1973 and debye hückel model debye and hückel 1923 pitzer model form equations were used in the previous work li and duan 2011 2 1 gas water equilibrium model with a gas water equilibrium model at given temperature pressure feed mole fractions and water salinity the phase mole fractions and mole fractions of species in each phases can be calculated the chemical potential of gas and water phases from eq 1 can be expressed as follows 2 μ i g μ i g 0 t p rtln f i t p y i μ i g 0 t p rtln y i p rtln φ i t p y i 3 μ i w μ i w 0 t p rtln a i t p m salt μ i w 0 t p

species i in an ideal aqueous solution with a hypothetical unit molality t is temperature in k and p is pressure in bar r is the gas constant 8 31446 j k mol y i is mole fraction of gas phase species i x i is mole fraction of water phase species i nw is mole number of h2o in 1 kg water 55 508 f i is the fugacity and φ i is the fugacity coefficient of species i in gas phase a i is the activity and γ i is the activity coefficient of species i in water phase m salt is the molality of salts dissolved in water combining eq 1 3 we can get the following equation 4 μ i w 0 μ i g 0 rt ln f i a i define ln k i μ i w 0 μ i g 0 rt then we have 5 y i p φ i nw k i x i γ i where k i equilibrium constant of component i as mentioned above the fugacity coefficients φ i are calculated by pr model peng and robinson 1976 the activity coefficients γ i are calculated by activity models pitzer 1973 debye and hückel 1923 the mutual solubility computation flow with the fugacity activity method is as follows 1 the feed mole fractions z i i 1 2 c of the fluid gas water system should be provided 2 initial estimation of the aqueous component mole fractions x i i 1 2 c and gas phase component mole fractions y i i 1 2 c for dissolved gas components 0 01 can be recommended and p h 2 o sat p can be recommended for h2o mole fraction in gas phase p h2o sat is pure water saturation pressure at the given temperature 3 update fugacity coefficients ϕ i of gas phase components with the calculated or estimated gas phase mole fractions y i 4 update activity coefficients γ i of aqueous components with the calculated or estimated aqueous phase mole fractions x i 5 calculate equilibrium constants k i with mole fractions of each phase fugacity coefficients and activity coefficients refer to li et al 2015b for the equations of equilibrium constants 6 solve rachford rice equation michelson and mollerup 2007 i 1 c z i k i 1 1 k i 1 β 0 and get gas phase mole fraction β 7 update x i and y i with z i k i and β x i z i 1 k i 1 β y i z i k i 1 k i 1 β 8 estimate the change of k i with k i k i old k i old if it is small enough stop the calculation if not go to step 3 2 2 coupling scheme in this work we couple the phreeqc chemical reaction module appelo et al 2014 with the mutual solubility models the activities of dissolved gas and mineral species can be calculated by the phreeqc module with phreeqc various thermodynamic database files can be used that contain hundreds of the chemical reactions involved and multiple activity models with the coupled models we can not only calculate the mutual gas water solubility but also assess the effects of dissolved gas on water mineral reactions with given fluid feed composition at a certain temperature and a pressure gas water mutual solubilities are calculated following the above computation flow in each iteration of x i i 1 2 c the water properties are calculated by phreeqc with for the dissolved gas species and mineral species and activity coefficients will be passed to mutual solubility calculations after the mutual solubility computation converges an additional water mineral equilibrium kinetics calculation is carried out to determine the final water phase concentrations and properties the whole computation procedure will stop when there are no redox reactions if redox reactions are involved in the system the dissolved gas components could be consumed significantly by redox reactions the above procedure should be repeated until the dissolved gas concentrations do not change anymore with subsequent iterations the calculation procedure is illustrated in fig 1 2 3 parameter updates the proposed computation method should be able to calculate 1 gas solubilities in aqueous phase equilibrium with minerals 2 mineral solubilities in aqueous phase dissolved saturated with gases 3 water properties including ph concentrations of various dissolved species and species distribution of dissolved components in order to successfully achieve these objectives and ensure reliable results the related model parameters should be validated with the available experimental data as well the scope of the gas water mineral system considered in this work is as follows 1 gas components co2 ch4 h2s n2 h2o and o2 2 salt mineral phases halite calcite gypsum anhydrite and uranium minerals more details in section 4 nevertheless the numerical framework is general and more gas or mineral components can be included in the calculations if all the related thermodynamic parameters are provided in the database file the parameters that need to be determined for the current work include the gas equation of state eos for fugacity coefficient calculations equilibrium constants and pitzer model parameters more details about these parameters will be introduced in the following sections the equations and parameters related to the equilibrium constants of the gas components are all discussed in our previous work and will not be repeated here 2 3 1 eos model parameters the peng robinson model pr model in short peng and robinson 1976 is used in this work for the eos the pr model parameters for the aforementioned gas components can all be found from our previous work li et al 2014a li et al 2014b li et al 2015a 2015b li et al 2017 li et al 2018 table 1 lists all the parameters used in the model 2 3 2 pitzer parameters as discussed in earlier sections the activity coefficients are calculated by the phreeqc module the activity model can be the b dot model the debye hückel model or the pitzer model the specific model used will be determined by the selection in the phreeqc database file the pitzer model pitzer 1973 has been proven to be able to accurately reproduce aqueous species activities up to high levels of solution salinity by many others in earlier works harvie and weare 1980 harvie et al 1984 greenberg and møller 1989 christov and moller 2004 li and duan 2007a li and duan 2007b duan and li 2008 li and duan 2011 pitzer parameters mainly include binary interaction parameters of cation anion β c a 0 β c a 1 and c c a φ cation cation θ c c anion anion θ a a and neutral ion λ c n and λ a n and triple particle interaction parameters ψ c c a ψ c a a and ζ n a c for gas solubility predictions the neutral ion binary interaction parameters are the most important ones in the model the relationship between dissolved gas component activity coefficients and pitzer parameters is expressed in the following equation 6 ln γ i c 2 m c λ i c a 2 m a λ i a c a m a m c ζ i a c where γ i is the activity coefficient of dissolved gas component i a denotes an anion c denotes a cation m c is the cation molality in aqueous phase m a is the anion molality in aqueous phase the pitzer parameters are usually functions of temperature but many different kind of equation formulations are used in earlier research in phreeqc the pitzer parameters λ i c λ i a and ζ i a c are determined by the fixed temperature dependency equation as follows 7 f b 0 b 1 1 t 1 t r b 2 ln t t r b 3 t t r b 4 t 2 t r 2 b 5 1 t 2 1 t r 2 where tr 298 15 k and bi i 0 1 5 are the coefficients some of the related pitzer parameters can be found from our previous work li et al 2018 table 2 lists the newly updated parameters used in this work 3 model validation to validate the proposed model the currently available experimental data is compared with the calculated results of the model proposed in this work the experimental data includes 1 mutual solubilities of gas brine systems in various kinds of aqueous solutions 2 mineral solubilities in aqueous solutions dissolved with gases 3 1 mutual solubilities of gas brine systems the gas solubilities in aqueous solution dissolved with different kinds of salts and h2o solubility in gaseous phase are calculated with the model and compared with the current available experimental data for gas solubility in pure water phase the phreeqc module does not need to be called as all calculations can be done by the mutual solubility models from our previous work so in this section gas solubility in pure water will not further be discussed 3 1 1 co2 solubility the available experimental data of mutual solubility of co2 brine systems has a sufficient number of datapoints for the parameter regression the temperature pressure ranges from surface conditions to more than 200 c and more than 1000 bar the dissolved salts included in the experiments are nacl and nh4 2so4 to validate the model reliability we compared the mutual solubility of co2 brine systems with experimental measurements among this model and the previous models duan and sun 2003 søreide and whitson 1992 duan and sun 2003 proposed an accurate model ds model for short of co2 solubility in water and brine in a wide range of temperature pressure and salinity the ds model is usually thought to be the most accurate co2 solubility model so far fig 2 shows the comparisons between the calculated results of the models sw is short for soride whitson model søreide and whitson 1992 and the experimental data different levels of dissolved salt molality are investigated up to a relatively high value of over 4 m to quantitively assess the model accuracy the average absolute deviation aad is defined as follows aad 1 n x model x exp x exp 100 where n denotes the number of experimental data x model denotes the result calculated by the model x exp denotes the experimental measurement in the meantime the maximum of absolute deviation mad is defined to show the stability of the model table 3 presents the values of aad and mad of different models from table 3 this model shows the smallest aad and mad the ds model can accurately reproduce the co2 solubility in brine to high temperature pressure and salinity but its accuracy for h2o solubility in co2 rich phase is not good enough the accuracy of sw model gets worse with the increase of salinity 3 1 2 ch4 solubility blount and price 1982 conducted experiments of ch4 solubility in nacl solutions with the nacl molality ranging from 1 95 to 5 85 m and pressures ranging from 100 bar to 900 bar stoessell and byrne 1982 measured ch4 solubility in aqueous solutions dissolved with various salts including cacl2 kcl and k2so4 at 298 15 k with pressures below 60 bar duan and mao 2006 proposed an accurate model of ch4 solubility in brine in a wide temperature pressure and salinity dm model for short fig 3 a and b present ch4 solubilities in nacl solutions and kcl solutions calculated by this model dm model and sw model compared with the experimental measurements fig 3 c shows the calculated h2o solubilities in ch4 rich phase by the model compared with the experimental measurements table 4 lists the aad and mad values of different models showing that this model always gives minimum deviations 3 1 3 h2s solubility h2s solubility experiments are difficult to conduct due to the toxicity and the corrosivity of the solutions the currently available experimental results of h2s solubility in aqueous phase are usually within substantial limited temperature and pressure ranges xia et al 2000 conducted a series of measurements of h2s solubility in nacl solutions and na2so4 solutions with pressures up to 100 bar and temperatures up to 120 c gillesp and wilson 1982 measured h2o solubility in h2s rich phase to 200 bar at different temperatures duan et al 2007 proposed a model of h2s solubility in brine with temperature to 500 k and pressure to 200 bar duan model fig 4 a and b shows the comparisons of the experimental h2s solubility in brine and the calculated results by this model duan model and sw model fig 4 c shows the h2o solubility in h2s rich phase calculated by this model duan model and sw model compared with experimental data table 5 lists the aad and mad values for different models from the comparisons this model shows the minimum deviations for h2s solubility in brine the sw model shows the minimum deviation for h2o solubility in h2s rich phase the aad value of this model is under 6 which is also small enough 3 1 4 n2 and o2 solubility o sullivan and smith 1970 measured n2 solubility in nacl solutions from 0 to 4 m within wide pressure and temperature ranges mao and duan 2006 proposed a model to predict n2 solubility model in a wide range of temperature pressure and salinity dm model for short fig 5 a shows the accurate predictions of the proposed model compared to the experimental data and other models sw model and dm model the existing experimental data of o2 solubility in aqueous solutions is not sufficient to make a proper comparison some limited measurements can be found at low temperatures and pressures geng and duan 2010 proposed a model of o2 solubility in brine with temperature to 200 c and pressure to 260 bar dg model fig 5 b shows the o2 solubility in nacl solutions measured by yasunishi 1978 and the calculated results by this model and the dm model on the same conditions pressure 1 bar temperature 273 k and 298 k nacl molality from 0 to 2 5 m fig 5 c shows the measurements in kcl solutions by yasunishi 1978 and the calculated results by this model and the dg model o2 brine mutual solubility calculation is out of the scope of the sw model the trends of o2 solubility in kcl solutions can be predicted by the model however at 308 k and 298 k the calculated results are underestimated table 6 gives the aad and mad values for n2 solubilities calculated by different models this model shows the minimum deviations 3 2 mineral solubilities dissolved with gases the solubility of minerals dissolved in aqueous phase is affected by temperature pressure and salinities if the aqueous phase is in equilibrium with the gaseous phase the dissolved gaseous species will also affect the mineral solubility to correctly reproduce the mineral solubilities the equilibrium constant of the mineral is an important parameter to address in this section the goal is not to check the accuracy of different kinds of mineral solubility in water or aqueous solutions systematically but instead to check if the new proposed coupled method can correctly reproduce the mineral solubilities in solutions equilibrium with gases co2 is an active gas component that will significantly influence the carbonate minerals or other related minerals li et al 2018 li and li 2019 some experimental data can be found for mineral co2 h2o systems in this section we will discuss the solubilities of calcite magnesite and gypsum in aqueous solutions with the presence of co2 comparisons with available experimental data are made to check the model validity the equilibrium constants of minerals are calculated with expressions from 8 and 9 in phreeqc 8 k i k h t p ref exp v m i p p ref rt and 9 log k h t p ref a 0 a 1 t a 2 t a 3 log t a 4 t 2 a 5 t 2 table 7 gives the parameters in eq 8 and 9 and the literature sources for different minerals ellis 1963 systematically measured the calcite solubility in pure water and nacl solutions at 12 bar at temperatures ranging from about 400 k to 550 k with the coupled computation framework the experimental results can be well reproduced compared with the experimental work fig 6 additionally the calculations are carried out by phreeqc v3 0 under same conditions to show the improvements of the coupled model proposed by this work from fig 6 it can be clearly seen that in the presence of co2 calcite solubilities are underestimated especially at low temperature regions at various nacl concentrations the presence of co2 in gaseous phase equilibrium with aqueous phase can significantly influence the solubility of carbonate minerals when co2 is dissolved in aqueous phase the concentrations of carbonate species will increase while ph levels will decrease additionally the dissolution of carbonate minerals should be enhanced there is some experimental work of magnesite solubility in water which is in equilibrium with co2 at various pressures wells 1915 bar 1932 halla et al 1962 berg and borisova 1960 christ and hostetler 1970 using the same experimental conditions we calculated the magnesite solubility with the proposed model and phreeqc v3 0 both of the calculated results are compared to the experimental results fig 7 as can be seen in the figure the proposed model matches the experimental measurements significantly better than using phreeqc directly phreeqc v3 0 underestimates the magnesite solubilities at presence of co2 at lower temperatures at co2 partial pressure 0 95 atm the average absolute deviation aad of this model is 8 7 and that of phreeqc is 43 8 at co2 partial pressure 0 31 atm the aad of this model is 13 6 and phreeqc gives 30 1 aad at co2 partial pressure 0 0003 atm the magnesite solubility is very small high accuracy prediction is hard for models both of models underestimate the magnesite solubility the aad of this model is 57 2 and the aad of phrreqc is 64 9 rendel et al 2016 measured gypsum solubility at 70 bar and 25 c with different initial solutions and various dissolved co2 concentrations one measurement was conducted of a supersaturated gypsum solution solution 1 in table 8 while another of an undersaturated gypsum solution solution 2 in table 8 we calculate gypsum solubility using the proposed model looking at the same two types of initial solutions and various dissolved co2 solutions from 0 to 0 8 mol kg fig 8 presents the comparisons of the calculated by this model and phreeqc and experimental results and shows a good agreement between this model and experimental measurements phreeqc shows the unsatisfactory calculations 4 applications in this section three case studies are provided to show 1 the computation stability 2 reasonability of the model results as well as 3 the potential applicability of the proposed model in different scientific research areas 4 1 uranium in situ leaching in situ leaching isl is one of the ways to extract uranium from the host rock and is especially necessary for low grad mines liu et al 2021 the basic idea of isl is to inject acid or alkaline fluids to enhance the dissolution of uranium minerals and extract uranium from the solution in underground environments natural uranium has several chemical valence states 3 u 3 4 u 4 5 u 5 and 6 u 6 in host rocks uranium minerals are usually under u 4 state similar to uraninite with chemical formula uo2 usually it is difficult for uranium to dissolve in underground water found in natural environments however when an oxidizing agent is injected u 4 ions in water will be oxidized to u 6 ions and a larger amount of u 4 minerals will be able to dissolve increasing the solubility of uranium the co2 o2 leaching method is one of the common isl technologies in both research and real project implementation shen et al 2020 xu et al 2011 in this method o2 plays the role of oxidizing agent and the presence of co2 will efficiently promote the dissolution of uranium minerals to investigate how o2 and co2 injection can help the uranium dissolution in aqueous phase a numerical model can be designed and the simulation can be carried out by the proposed coupled numerical framework the environmental and geochemical conditions of the model are presented in table 9 the thermodynamic parameters for the co2 o2 water uranium systems have been discussed in details in previous work shen et al 2020 and the results are adopted here in the updated geochemical database various kinds of aqueous species of uranium systems are considered including hydroxide carbonate and bicarbonate complexes in the simulation model the initial water and uranium minerals are set to be in equilibrium with the co2 o2 mixtures different scenarios of co2 mole fraction in the gas phase are considered ranging from 0 to 1 0 the simulation results show that uranium is mainly in 6 valence state when in equilibrium and dissolved in water and other ion state concentrations are negligible fig 9 presents the u 6 molality and the mole number of uranium mineral dissolution and precipitation in aqueous phase varying with co2 mole fraction in gas the following conclusions can be drawn adding co2 in gas phase will dramatically increase the u 6 molality in aqueous phase when pure o2 in the gas phase is dissolved in aqueous phase uraninite will be dissolved and u 4 will convert to u 6 uo3 0 9h2o alpha will precipitate with co2 is dissolved in aqueous phase the amount of uraninite dissolution and uo3 0 9h2o alpha precipitation that can be found decreases more uo2co3 will precipitate with more co2 dissolution overall u 6 concentration in aqueous phase increases with co2 mole fraction increase with pure co2 in gas phase uranium concentration in aqueous phase decreases dramatically since u 4 is not able to be oxidized to u 6 and uraninite solubility is extremely low the geochemical simulations give a clear insight in the mechanism of co2 o2 leaching the thermodynamic parameters of a specific system are highly dependent on temperature and pressure with the increase of depth both temperature and pressure will increase according to the thermal gradient and pressure gradient the gas water mineral equilibrium changes accordingly with depth to investigate the behavior of co2 o2 leaching at different depths simulations were run at depths from 0 to 3000 m assuming a thermal gradient of 25 c km and a pressure gradient of 100 bar km the mole ratio of co2 and o2 in gas phase is fixed at 1 1 for the simulations other model settings are unchanged and listed in table 9 the simulation results are shown in fig 10 u 6 molality in aqueous phase increases with depth at first up to 300 m but decreases with depths over 300 m fig 10 a with the depth increase the dissolution of both co2 and o2 increases fig 10 b the ph of the solution decreases with depth dramatically at depths below 300 m but stabilizes at the deeper part the simulation results show that co2 o2 leaching is most efficient for shallower mines with the current model settings especially at a depth around 300 m the current simulation case can shed some light on how temperature and pressure effect the efficiency of co2 o2 leaching method but more systematic research should be done to achieve more general and conclusive results 4 2 co2 geological storage the first full chain co2 capture and storage project was conducted by shenhua group in ordos basin more than 300 000 t of co2 was injected into the formations at a depth of over 1500 m in this section the co2 water rock interactions are simulated using water and rock samples from the shiqianfeng formation table 10 yang et al 2017 the local pressure is about 189 bar and temperature is about 62 c the porosity of the reservoir is assumed to be 0 2 the simulations are carried out with the proposed method with a time span of 100 000 years initially the aquifer is of low salinity and close to neutral condition slightly acidic and in equilibrium with the minerals in table 10 the reactions of minerals and water are considered as a kinetic procedure after the co2 injection the reaction rate equation used here follows palandri and kharaka 2004 eq 10 10 r ka 1 q k where r is the reaction rate k is the rate constant a is the reactive surface area of the mineral q is the ionic activity product k is the equilibrium constant the rate constant k is expressed as follows 11 k k 25 a e e aa r t 298 15 a h n a k 25 n e e an r t 298 15 k 25 b e e ab r t 298 15 a h n b where k 25a k 25n and k 25b are rate constant at 25 c for acid mechanism neutral mechanism and base mechanism respectively e aa e an and e ab are arrhenius activation energy n a and n b are reaction orders for acid and base mechanisms r is the gas constant 8 314 j k mol the parameters for each related mineral can be found from table 11 xu et al 2011 the simulation results can be found from fig 11 fig 11 a shows the calculation results based on the assumptions that water is in equilibrium with the minerals listed in table 10 a at the start of the process in this case the potassium concentration in the water is in equilibrium with illite at 2 0e 4 m after co2 injection there is dissolution of dolomite and precipitation of calcite and anhydrite the chemical reactions of the mineral dissolution or precipitation start out at a constant but significant rate and only slightly slow down after a long time period the changes are hardly noticeable within the first 1000 years after co2 injection the transition of illite to smectite and kaolinite can be observed clearly after 1000 years however the results are quite sensitive to the potassium concentration in the water at initial conditions if we set the potassium concentration in water to 1 82e 03 m rich potassium case the chemical reactions of the clay minerals will be completely different this case is shown in fig 11 b after hundreds of years smectite and kaolinite are now dissolved and illite precipitates 4 3 natural gas souring in the sichuan basin h2s can be found in deep gas reservoirs li et al 2014a li et al 2014b li et al 2017 an important reason for the presence of h2s could be the gas water mineral interactions in the gas water transition zones li et al 2014a li et al 2014b methane water and sulfate minerals anhydrite or gypsum exist both methane and sulfate minerals will be dissolved in water the redox geochemical reactions are triggered with bacteria mediated ch4 in water as c 4 is oxidized to c 4 and so4 2 in water as s 6 is reduced to s 2 once s 2 gets saturated h2s will be released s 2 concentration is restricted by h2s solubility in water the key geochemical reaction is expressed in the following equation eq 12 12 so 4 2 ch 4 co 3 2 s 2 2h h 2 o the numerical experiments have been conducted in our previous work li et al 2017 in that work the calculation of gas water mineral equilibrium is split into two parts gas solubility in aqueous phase by an independent gas solubility model code and water mineral equilibrium by phreeqc when calculating gas solubility in aqueous phase the water compositions have to be estimated roughly by salinity with this model the full gas water mineral equilibrium can be calculated at the same time and a more stable and reliable results can be achieved to simulate the gas souring procedure we setup a gas water mineral system the gas components are ch4 initial mole fraction 100 and h2s initial mole fraction 0 the initial water is of low salinity with 0 1 m nacl dissolved the system is assumed to consist of 1 kg of water the minerals of anhydrite initial mole number 1 0 gypsum initial mole number 0 0 and calcite initial mole number 0 0 are included in the system we consider the temperature and pressure conditions from surface conditions to deep underground 5000 m the temperature and pressure gradients are the same as the ones used in section 4 1 fig 12 shows the simulation results for ph levels ion concentrations in water and mineral changes varying with depth from the results we can clearly find that 1 in the entire depth interval sulfate is dissolved to the solution and oxidizes the dissolved ch4 to carbonates in the water 2 gypsum is stable in the shallower reservoir less than 1500 m and converted to anhydrite in deeper parts 3 with the increase in the depth the redox geochemical reaction is enhanced and higher s 2 concentration in water can be found 4 in the deeper reservoir more calcite is precipitated 5 conclusions in this work we propose a new computation framework that couples the gas solubility models li et al 2014a li et al 2014b li et al 2015a 2015b with the water mineral interaction computation package phreeqc in the coupling scheme a gas water mutual solubility computation module and a water mineral interaction computation module are included in the gas water mutual solubility calculations the activities of dissolved gas components are calculated by the phreeqc water property calculation module after convergence is achieved for gas water mutual solubility calculations the dissolved gas concentrations are used for the water mineral interaction calculations in the previous work the pitzer model is used for gas component activity calculations to achieve high accuracy of gas solubility in high salinity solutions in this work the phreeqc pitzer database is used with updated gas component related pitzer parameters for gas solubility calculations with this newly proposed computation framework gas water mineral interaction calculations can be carried out stably and accurately to validate the proposed computation framework comparisons are made between the current available experimental data and the calculations by the proposed model in terms of various gas including co2 ch4 h2s n2 and o2 and mineral including calcite magnesite and gypsum solubilities in aqueous solution the calculations by other previous models are also checked the model accuracies are assessed with average absolute deviation from the experimental data this model always has least deviations the comparison shows that the measured data of both gas solubility and mineral solubility can be reliably reproduced by the model calculations in broad temperature pressure and composition ranges the proposed computation framework can be extended to include solubility calculations of other minerals as well however the reliability of the thermodynamic parameter database is important for the computation accuracy one may need to update the parameters in the thermodynamic database with relevant available experimental data the model calculation comparisons from section 3 have demonstrated that the coupling framework can improve the accuracy of simulations of phase equilibrium systems with coexisting gas water minerals the computation framework has the potential to be applied in various fields related to gas water mineral interactions to illustrate the practical applicability of the model computation examples are provided of uranium in situ leaching co2 geological storage and natural gas souring 1 in the example of uranium in situ leaching co2 o2 is injected into a uraninite bearing aquifer the dissolved o2 in the solution helps the oxidization of u 4 to u 6 which has a higher solubility co2 further enhances the solubility of u 6 minerals the co2 o2 method can enhance the recovery of uranium in situ leaching the effects are more profound with depth 2 the application of co2 geological storage is modeled based on the shenhua ccs project the models of co2 water minerals systems are run with kinetic reactions from long time scale simulations the transformations of clay minerals after co2 injection can be clearly observed 3 a ch4 h2s water sulfate mineral system model is designed to simulate the gas souring procedure with both ch4 and sulfate dissolved in the gas water transition zone of natural gas reservoirs dissolved ch4 can be oxidized to carbonates at the same time sulfate is reduced to s 2 h2s will be released after the solution becomes saturated with s 2 with the increase in reservoir depth the effects are enhanced the three application cases show that the proposed coupled computation scheme is well implemented and can simulate gas water mineral systems stably declaration of

1286,crude oil products are among the most common pollutants of soils which can drastically affect the engineering properties of soils in the current study a series of laboratory tests were conducted to investigate the interaction between crude oil and sandy soil with clay and the effect of crude oil crude oil residence time absorbent additives type and content microwave power specimen weight maximum grain size and fine grain fraction on the removal efficiency of pollution through microwave radiation to extract optimum values for potential and high efficiency in hydrocarbon removal the present study also investigated geotechnical properties including cohesion internal friction angle shear strength in three conditions before and during pollution and after cleanup utilizing direct shear and static triaxial tests the results showed that the presence of clay particles oil content and saturation effect in the soil could significantly control the engineering soil behavior in the presence of 4 crude oil in direct shear tests the whole oil content is accumulated on clay particles due to the high specific area of clay particles reducing the cohesion and the internal friction angle by contrast beyond the 4 of crude oil sand particle in the soil was the controlling factor of the whole behavior of the mixture in triaxial tests the trend of soil parameters is almost similar to direct shear tests by increasing crude oil except that with an increase of 4 of oil the friction angle of the soil increases due to the presence of a large number of flocculated clay particles keywords contaminated soil crude oil remediation microwave heating soil strength 1 introduction nowadays soil and groundwater contamination with toxic pollutants is a worldwide environmental problem miles et al 1990 spills of about 5 734 000 tons of oil were recorded worldwide between 1970 and 2016 sivagami et al 2021 among various mineral pollutants the crude oil and petroleum products are considered as the main sources of environmental contamination the major concern about petroleum products is their harmful effects on the public health and the ecology of soil during all stages of refining transportation and consumption rajasekhar et al 2020 vega et al 2011 moreover due to physico chemical interactions between the pollutant compositions and the soil matrix the geotechnical properties of the polluted soil may decline significantly such as permeability moisture value and bearing capacity rajabi and sharifipour 2019 safehian et al 2018 so far several methods have been used to eliminate the soil contaminations ding et al 2019 at field scale thermal methods may be considered as the most suitable techniques for cleaning organic compounds from soils caniani et al 2018 there are various methods for clearing contaminated soils that use a technique that is dependent on several factors such as the existence of strict laws cost type of pollution the concentration of pollution type of soil saturation degree geological condition dimensions of pollution spread groundwater conditions climatic conditions etc therefore clearing any contamination cannot be limited to just one particular way because each technique has its own advantages soil washing is one of the effective methods of soil purification to remove volatile organic compounds vocs and metals from sandy and gravelly soils sharma and reddy 2004 in this technology contaminated soil is cleaned with water and a mechanical stirrer to remove hazardous pollutants or reduce their volume one of the advantages of this method is that it can be used for various compounds however this method is not very common due to the high use of water and subsequently high volume of effluent and the cost of disposing of it sharma and reddy 2004 villa et al 2010 oxidation is a common effective purification technology for soils contaminated by organic and chemical substances of toxins and cyanides the technique may not always be cost effective due to the amount of chemicals required moreover chemical reagents are likely to be wasted when excessive temperatures and pressure are utilized rivas 2006 the bioremediation method is less costly than physical chemical and thermal methods and is done naturally however microorganisms require suitable conditions for their growth and viability including proper ph temperature oxygen salinity and nutrients although biological methods such as phytoremediation and bioremediation have paid much attention to soil pollution in recent years their application in places where the concentration of pollutants is high is inefficient although using other methods physical chemical and thermal has a positive effect on overcoming these limitations and increasing the efficiency of improvement using these methods requires a long time cioni and petarca 2011 among the existing methods for extraction and removal of organic pollutants heat methods have been proposed as rapid and high efficiency methods for removing organic contaminants in aquatic and dry environments one of which is the use of microwave radiation the efficiency of using thermal methods in some cases is 99 compared to competing methods such as bioremediation and solvent extraction they require less time and confer greater efficiency in different environments appleton et al 2005 shang et al 2007 the cost of using microwave radiation is lower than traditional thermal methods which makes it attractive for use on large scale shang et al 2006 the price of using the microwave method for cleaning oil wastes can be 20 times lower than traditional thermal methods jones et al 2002 shang et al 2007 moreover this recently developed approach to provide required energy for increasing the soil temperature is the usage of microwaves radiation which causes the breakdown of hydrocarbon compounds de oliveira et al 2018 microwave remediation heating performance is based on the electric field generated by electromagnetic radiation and molecular dipoles in environmental specimens this mechanism leads to heat production at the molecular level nascimento and azevedo 2013 although this mechanism helps remove pollution reports have shown that in the presence of an electromagnetic field wave power is dispersed throughout the material hence adding a susceptor for better absorption of microwaves in contaminated soil is needed mokhtar et al 2011 activated carbon as a carbon based susceptor increases the heat generated owing to friction between dipoles and subsequently facilitates the volatilization of hydrocarbon compounds sivagami et al 2021 liu and yu 2006 utilized granulated activated carbon to absorb microwaves and increase temperatures the results showed that the temperatures were about 500 c at 700 w of power other susceptors were used to raise the temperature and absorb microwaves such as water iron powder sodium hypophospite moisture spent graphite powder falciglia et al 2016 liu et al 2008 robinson et al 2014 sivagami et al 2019 several advantages may be involved with this method including high rate of soil refinement easy combination with groundwater extraction technology rapid and integrated generation of heat energy indirect contact with the source maintaining the apparent characteristics of target body having better control over the heating process high removal efficiency ability to treat an extensive limit of contaminants and being economically compatible with other technologies for large soil volumes such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs total petroleum hydrocarbons tphs and pesticides falciglia et al 2016 jones et al 2002 miao et al 2020 sivagami et al 2019 li et al 2008 have used microwaves 2 45 ghz with granular activated carbon for clearing soils contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons diesels the microwave irradiation caused to elimination of 99 of oil pollutants within 10 min chien 2012 mounted 4 m special antennas deep into an oil contaminated soil and connected them to a microwave generator the results showed that the soil contamination removal through microwave radiation is a cost effective and time saving method falciglia and vagliasindi 2015 investigated the clearing of silty sands and clayey soils contaminated by diesel with microwaves radiation the results showed that the removal rate of contamination for sandy soils was 90 while the efficiency was much lower for clayey soils cho et al 2020 used microwave heating to examine the removal of tph from contaminated soil and identify the desorption behavior of five carbon number based tph components the results showed that the coarse soil had a removal efficiency of 91 1 after 15 min whereas the fine soil had a poor removal efficiency another perspective of microwave application is the rehabilitation of contaminated soils using microwave treatment several research studies have reported the effects of hydrocarbon pollutants on the geotechnical properties of soils ahmadi et al 2021 ding et al 2019 ostovar et al 2021 puri 2000 rajabi and sharifipour 2019 there was mostly some decrease in soil friction angle with increasing the contamination content khamehchiyan et al 2007 conducted an extensive research on the oil polluted soils from the persian gulf coasts it was found that oil contamination reduces the permeability and strength in all specimens abousnina et al 2015 suggested the use of oil contaminated sand as a road construction material which seems to be a cost effective solution to minimize adverse impacts on environment the research results showed that with an increase in contamination up to 1 the soil shear strength increases while some reduction at greater percentages of contamination is observed ahmadi et al 2021 investigated the interaction between crude oil clay and sand particles in contaminated soil the results indicated that the addition of crude oil lowered the internal friction angle in sandy specimens with low clay content but increased the angle of friction in specimens with high clay content the available literature on soils contaminated with oil products has for the most part been limited to techniques for reducing or eliminating soil pollution although the geotechnical properties of the polluted soils have also been evaluated in several studies the engineering properties of improved soil have rarely been investigated in the current study first the polluted soil was decontaminated and also the effects of crude oil crude oil residence time absorbent additives type and content microwave power specimen weight maximum grain size and fine grain fraction on removal efficiency were investigated and optimum values of parameters were determined to reach the high removal efficiency second geotechnical properties such as cohesion internal friction angle shear strength were evaluated by obtaining optimum levels finally the results were compared in three conditions without contamination with contamination and after decontamination 2 experimental materials 2 1 characterization of soil oil and activated carbon the current study soil were collected from the isfahan refinery site at depths that ranging from 0 to 3 m the soil used in current study is from the polluted soil in this area iraji asiabadi et al 2016 the soil particle size distribution was determined according to astm d422 63 as presented in fig 1 it should be noted that the soil fine fraction is about 10 both plastic properties and gradation coefficients are required for the soil classification the soil specifications are presented in table 1 since the soil of the study area is considered one of the problematic soils several authors have examined the ground of this region based on the results of x ray powder diffraction xrd patterns they reported the dominant minerals of kaolinite illite chlorite and quartz they also noted the magnetite hematite and goethite minerals in contaminated soils this region lacks smectite minerals this may be attributed to low rainfall in this region ayoubi et al 2002 ayoubi et al 2020 also the origin of the dominant minerals of the creature was hereditary despite the presence of these minerals the current method as a potential method showed high efficiency in the removal of pollutants in this region the hydrocarbon material used in this study is crude oil consumed in isfahan oil refinery some characteristics of the crude oil are listed in table 2 in the current study two absorbents of activated carbon granular gac and powder pac type were used to absorb more waves and increase the temperature in the soil mass in order to eliminate the dust activated carbon was heated in boiling water for 30 min before use and then washed with distilled water then activated carbon was dried at 105 c for 24 h and stored for use the main characteristics of gac and pac are listed in table 3 3 experimental methods 3 1 microwave energy microwave energy is produced by a magnetron the source of microwave radiation and the created waves are transmitted to the intended target heat is produced by friction of bipolar components in an oscillating electric field microwave radiation is part of the electromagnetic spectrum which has a frequency range of 0 3 to 300 ghz and a wavelength of 1 mm to 1 m menéndez et al 2010 substances that absorb micro waves are called dielectrics and are specified by dielectric constant and loss parameters the dielectric constant indicates the ability of a substance to be polarized in the presence of an external electric field while dielectric loss or the energy loss factor indicates the ability of a substance to convert electromagnetic energy to heat the device used to generate microwave radiation is a nn st7575w panasonic domestic oven with a maximum output power of 1100 watts and a 2 45 ghz frequency an overall view of the microwave radiation device is illustrated in fig 2 the continuous usage of the oven at required time intervals could cause an increase in the device circuits temperature resulting in damage to the capacitors and magnetron to avoid this problem an auxiliary fan was used to prevent the temperature elevation in addition the main capacitors of the device were replaced with types resistant to high temperature to allow for the better circuitry of device another problem during the microwave radiation of contaminated samples was sparking due to the evaporated crude oil and more importantly represented a safety concern therefore appropriate measures were employed to release these vapours this was made by creating a ventilation hole in the top of the microwave also a special valve was made at the oven door for removing the vapour from the microwave using a vacuum pump see fig 2 a special st48 laser thermometer was also used to measure the specimen temperature at the end of radiation process tph index is used to explain a large group of chemical compounds that all originate from crude oil therefore this index has been used to measure the amount of crude oil consumed in the soil the percentage of oil removal or clean up efficiency of the radiated specimens is determined based on eq 1 1 r e tph i tph f tph i 100 where r is clean up efficiency tphi is the initial weight of hydrocarbons in the soil sample and tphf is the final weight of hydrocarbons in the treated specimen 3 2 direct shear strength direct shear tests are among the oldest and easiest tests for determining strength parameters in order to investigate the effect of crude oil on soil strength parameters the direct shear tests were conducted based on the astm d3080 90 standard the shear force was applied to the sample through a displacement control system at a speed of 1 mm min for each set of direct shear tests three similar samples were sheared separately under normal stress level of 1 kg cm2 the test supplies are composed of a metal shear box where soil samples are placed in this study a circular mold with a diameter of 6 3 cm and a height of 2 cm was used vertical force is applied from the top of the shear box by weight load on the sample by applying a constant rate shear shift to the bottom of the half box and recording the shear force recorded by the dynamometer attached to the upper half box the extended shear stress in the shear section of the sample can be determined the relationship between vertical and shear stress on the failure plate is defined by the eq 2 2 τ c σtanφ where τ is shear stress c is cohesion coefficient σ is vertical stress and φ is internal friction angle 3 3 static triaxial test in order to investigate the effect of crude oil on contaminated soil under saturation conditions a series of consolidated undrained cu tests were carried out based on the astm d4767 95 standard the specimens were prepared in cylindrical moulds with a diameter of 33 mm and a height of 75 mm the sample was then put in a triaxial container and saturated with distilled water b 95 the samples were then consolidated and the sample was loaded at a continuous strain of 1 mm per minute the loading was sustained until the sample could no longer withstand the strain and ruptured entirely 3 4 specimen preparation according to the field reports the range of crude oil pollution at the isfahan refinery site is estimated to be between 4 and 8 for having more control on the soil conditions clean soil from the refinery protected site were contaminated with crude oil by 4 and 8 of the soil dry weight it is worth noting that at least 2 days should elapse to allow soil particles to absorb the added oil in other words transition from free flow to absorbed phase evgin and das 1992 in order to perform this oil contaminated soil was placed in two layers of thick plastic to allow a natural reaction between hydrocarbon materials and soil particles it should be added that to prevent unwanted entry of any organic matter into containers or traces of crude oil from previous experiments after performing each test the containers were washed with detergent urban water hexane n solution and finally with distilled water and dried in an air exposed laboratory 3 5 test procedures in the current study a series of cleanup direct shear strength and triaxial tests were conducted the effects of crude oil content crude oil residence time absorbent additives type and content microwave power specimen weight maximum grain size and fine grain fraction on removal efficiency re were investigated moreover geotechnical properties including cohesion internal friction angle shear strength in three conditions before and during pollution and after cleanup were evaluated utilizing direct shear and static triaxial tests experiments program is summarized in table 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of crude oil content on removal efficiency in order to investigate the effect of crude oil on removal efficiency soil specimens with a moisture content of 10 were contaminated by different percentages of crude oil and were subjected to 800 watts radiation for 10 min as maximum safe radiation duration the results are presented in fig 3 as can be seen by increasing the crude oil up to 4 the slope of the re parameter increased slightly and beyond that steeply two mechanisms can describe this process 1 by increasing hydrocarbons content more microwave energy is absorbed up to 12 and subsequently the temperature increases also the soil is transparent to the microwave so microwave energy is absorbed into moisture and hydrocarbon molecules chien 2012 on the other hand it seems that the amount of light hydrocarbons in crude oil is higher than other sources of pollutants because of high a p i value in table 2 also at the created temperature heavy hydrocarbons are broken down and turn into light hydrocarbons therefore the amount of these hydrocarbons in the soil increases and is eliminated through evaporation 2 the studied soil is well grained sand with clay sw sc the sandy part experiences more temperature due to microwave radiation compared to the clay section of the soil this can be attributed to the dielectric constant and thermodynamic properties of soils falciglia et al 2017 these two parameters are mainly dependent on soil grain size and soil specific surface area since the specific surface of clays is higher than sand more hydrocarbons accumulate on them moreover clay can enclose oil due to its high porosity and inter crystalline properties and limit the emission removal process cho et al 2020 therefore it can be said that adding crude oil up to 4 due to the accumulation of pollution on the clay section of soil slows the process of decontamination beyond this level excess oil is placed on sand particles due to saturation of clay surfaces leading to an increase in the removal efficiency rate see conceptual fig 4 it should be noted that the low slope of increasing the decontamination up to 4 can be attributed to the constant conditions of the test 10 moisture and 800 watts of radiation this could mean that susceptors or more time radiation and radiation power should be used to accelerate and increase the efficiency of the cleanup process at 4 of oil although the pollution rate at the isfahan oil refinery site was reported to be 4 to 8 almost 7 the range of crude oil contamination was extended to 12 to account for worse likely pollution conditions nevertheless the amount of 8 pollution was selected as the major case of the field soil contamination in all subsequent experiments to obtain the optimal efficiency of pollution elimination through microwave radiation 4 2 effect of crude oil residence time in the soil on the removal efficiency fig 5 shows the effect of oil residence time 2 days one week two weeks and three weeks in the soil on cleanup efficiency at the moisture content of 10 contaminated with 8 crude oil and 800 watts of microwaves radiation the specimens were exposed to irradiation for 10 min as can be clearly seen the removal efficiency decreases by increasing the residence time of crude oil in the soil this can be attributed to chemical reactions between soil and oil in the long run tanee and albert 2015 reported the detrimental effects of the long term residue of crude oil on soil chemical properties long term residue crude oil reduces nutrient availability phosphorus and nitrogen germination vegetation and leads to wildlife deaths or even extinction of species due to the inhibitory and hydrophobic properties of crude oil in other words if the soil is not decontaminated in the short period after contamination in addition to reducing the removal efficiency it increases soil toxicity and will have negative effects on the chemical properties and vegetation of the soil hence it seems more productive for treatment operations to be continued as soon as possible after the pollution occurrence 4 3 effect of susceptor on removal efficiency of hydrocarbons regarding the low removal efficiency for previous specimens microwave absorbent additives were employed to enhance the cleanup efficiency fig 6 shows the effects of three types of microwave absorbent i e granular activated carbon gac powdered activated carbon pac and moisture on the removal efficiency for this purpose 8 contaminated specimens mixed with 5 susceptors were subjected to microwave radiation for 10 min removal efficiency increased in the presence of moisture this can be attributed to the bipolar properties of water which is an important factor for the microwave reaction however moisture removal efficiency has lower efficiency than activated carbon these results are consistent with the findings of previous studies sivagami et al 2021 in addition the upper moisture limit is 15 beyond this amount prevents the absorption of microwaves in other words 15 moisture causes the total energy of microwaves to be spent steaming water and moisture 5 in this study could not be tested according to previous experiences because in this case the absorption of waves is very low therefore the waves radiated by magnetron due to lack of absorption by the soil hit the oven frame and reflect the magnetron the result of this phenomenon causes it to spark the addition of activated carbon to the soil effectively increases the ability to absorb microwave energy and reach high temperatures and high removal efficiency as can be noticed the highest temperature and subsequently removal efficiency were associated with pac and the lowest value was related to moisture the observed difference between pac and gac removal efficiency values was negligible the reason for the pac s better performance can be attributed to particle size the mass transfer benefit of smaller particles is that the diffusion route is shorter therefore molecules reach accessible adsorption sites more quickly in other words it can be said that powdered activated carbon has better efficiency for the removal of liquid pollutants in contrast granular activated carbon is better for gases consequently the powder activated carbon was selected as the most effective susceptor and was used to carry out the rest of experiments the dosage effect of the pac was also investigated for the specimens contaminated with 8 crude oil as shown in fig 7 by increasing the amount of pac from 5 to 10 the removal efficiency rose from 67 to 78 such results may be justified by the basic theoretical relation on microwaves energy loss within dielectric materials li et al 2008 this is because the temperature increment within materials under the microwaves is directly related to their relative energy loss factor both soil and crude oil have low capacity to convert the electromagnetic radiation energy to heat while the activated carbon particularly in powder form has a considerable potential to increase the soil temperature therefore using pac for oil polluted soils may significantly increase the removal efficiency the ratio of the relative energy loss factor ε to the dielectric constant ε0 is the relative amount of energy intensity of microwaves transmitted to the target materials since the relative energy loss factor is related to the internal loss mechanisms a material with a high relative energy loss factor produces higher heating under microwaves based the following relation 3 t t 2 πf ε 0 ε eff e 2 ρ c p where t is the temperature increment t is the irradiation time f is the microwave frequency ε0 is the permittivity of free space e is the magnitude of the internal electric field ρ is the density cp is the heat capacity and ε eff is the effective dielectric loss factor 4 4 effect of microwave power mw power on removal efficiency the removal efficiency can also be improved by increasing the microwave source power tph is made up of compounds with complicated structures and huge molecular weights this might be due to the creation of extra heat which causes fast molecular mobility buttress et al 2016 fig 8 presents three levels of microwave source power including 600 800 and 1000 watts to investigate the mw power on re as can be seen the highest crude oil removal efficiency of 81 was achieved at the power of 1000 watts this enhancement of removal efficiency is also justified based on the eq 2 as the rate of microwave absorption and change to heat depends strongly on the magnitude of the electric field which is a function of the microwave device power based on the obtained results a 1000 w power microwave device was used to optimize the other parameters in the soil remediation test the choice of 1000 watts radiation power is to ensure the removal of tph from the clay part of the soil because the hydrocarbons are mostly accumulated in clay particles due to the larger specific surface area increasing the power of radiation increases soil temperature and subsequently increases the removal efficiency these results are in agreement with previous studies cho et al 2020 sivagami et al 2019 4 5 effect of specimens weight on the removal efficiency the effect of various weights of 200 g to 350 g at the moisture content of 10 10 of pac 10 min of radiation 1000 watts power radiation and contamination with 8 of crude oil on re was investigated the results have been shown in fig 9 these conditions were selected based on the results from previous sections since the limitation running of the microwave device is approximately 10 min a higher duration can cause damage to the device magnetron therefore the removal procedures of the relatively heavy specimens were carried out based on multi stages for this purpose specimen irradiation was first carried out for 10 min duration and the microwave device was turned off to allow the device temperature to return to nearly the ambient temperature finally the irradiation and rest cycles were repeated six times including 10 min of microwave radiation at each cycle the experiments showed that by increasing the weight of polluted soil specimen more microwaves irradiation time is needed to reach high removal efficiency increasing the weight of the specimen has a direct relation to clay content in other words the clay part increases as the weight increases therefore more hydrocarbons are accumulated on the clay and subsequently removed from the soil with greater difficulty as shown in fig 9 the removal efficiency for all soil specimens tends to reach a constant level after 40 to 60 min of radiation therefore it may be concluded that beyond 40 min the major part of the hydrocarbons chains is likely eliminated from the soil specimens and the rest of them are not removed with increasing radiation time anymore this can be attributed to the dependence of hydrocarbon removal efficiency on various factors such as mw power susceptor type susceptor dosage and other test conditions in other words it is necessary to change the test conditions such as increasing mw power or pac dosage to achieve complete removal efficiency in these conditions these results showed that 40 min of radiation could be considered as the optimum radiation time since the amount of soil required to perform a complete set of direct shear tests was estimated at 350 g these specimens were adopted to determine soil shear strength it should be added that the removal efficiency of this type of soil specimen was about 78 after 50 min of microwaves irradiation 4 6 effect of maximum grain size and fine grain fraction on removal efficiency all of the investigations as mentioned earlier were carried out on the soil fraction finer than 2 mm consisting of about 97 of the selected field soil this was also necessary to meet the specimen size requirements for conducting direct shear tests the results of these experiments for the three maximum particle sizes of the polluted soil specimens i e finer than 2 mm sieve number 10 finer than 0 425 mm sieve number 40 and finer than 0 25 mm sieve no 60 are presented in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 the removal efficiency was higher in specimens with greater grain size such results may be justified as microwaves penetrate more quickly into the samples with higher coarse grain due to the presence of larger pores falciglia et al 2017 on the other hand the evaporation rate of coarse particles is higher than fine particles the effect of fine fraction finer than 0 075 mm of the polluted soil specimens on removal efficiency was also investigated it should be noted that although for the selected soil samples the fine fraction was determined to be about 10 some variations may be observed regarding the amount fine fraction at different locations of the isfahan refinery site the fine fraction was estimated to be in the range of 5 15 therefore experiments were carried out on the soil specimens with the fine fraction of 5 10 and 15 the results of the experiments are presented in fig 11 as can be seen the removal efficiency of the treated specimens decreased with the fine fraction increment altogether the removal efficiency for coarse grain specimens was 12 higher than that of fine grain specimens such results may be justified due to the fact that the fine fraction of the soil could absorb more crude oil pollution due to the high specific surface area cho et al 2020 in other words since the fine fractions usually involve a high unbalanced electric charge and ion exchange capacity the contaminants adhere more tightly to the soil particles surface resulting in lower removal efficiency similar results have already been reported by falciglia and vagliasindi 2015 who found that the removal rate of contamination for sandy soils was as great as 90 while the efficiency was much lower for clayey soils 4 7 direct shear test results fig 12 shows the soil strength parameters results for various soil specimens and after removal pollution as can be clearly seen by increasing the crude oil concentration up to 4 the cohesion decreases and beyond 4 leads to an increase in cohesion since the studied soil type is sw sc most of the soil is sand and a little is clay hence changing the trend of matrix behavior is justified by increasing oil content with an increase of 4 of oil clay has a higher power in oil absorption than sand due to its higher specific surface area amellal et al 2001 sánchez martín et al 2011 in other words the clay section is responsible for controlling the behavior of the soil matrix by entering 4 of oil into the soil matrix the clay section absorbed a large part of this amount when clay particles are coated by oil the soil s specific surface area is reduced ur rehman et al 2007 moreover studies have shown that increasing oil significantly reduces cation exchange capacity ur rehman et al 2007 this decrease leads to a decrease in the absorption of water molecules with clay particles and a reduction in the contact of clay particles thereby reducing cohesion with the increase of oil beyond 4 likely the oil will first go to the filling of clay surfaces and after creating a cumulative mass and saturation of oil the process of oil absorption by clay particles is stopped and the excess amount of oil in the soil matrix is spread on the sandy surface the specific surface area of sand particles is low and the oil on the surface of the particles is not massed but is dispersed between the whole sand particles in other words there is a soil matrix consisting of sand and clay in such conditions which is oil between all its particles oil on clay surfaces reduces cohesion by contrast oil between sand particles leads to increased cohesion since a large part of the soil is sand oil impregnated sand particles determine the behavior of the soil it should be noted that the behavior of coarse grain soils during contamination is subject to mechanical factors while the behavior of clay soils is justified based on physicochemical reactions between oil and clay minerals zhao 1996 accordingly the oil between sand particles due to its intrinsic cohesion and higher viscosity than water soltani jigheh et al 2018 optimum moisture increases the apparent cohesion between sand particles and subsequently soil matrix in order to explore the effect of crude oil on internal friction angle the results were provided in fig 13 by investigating the effect of crude oil on the internal friction angle it was observed that with increasing crude oil up to 4 the internal friction angle of the soil decreased this can be attributed to the effect of lubricant and the high viscosity of the oil puri 2000 soltani jigheh et al 2018 in other words with the increase of oil up to 4 the emulsified and inexcusable phase of oil and moisture in the soil increases leading to a decrease in shear strength see fig 14 in contrast with the increase of crude oil beyond 4 the behavior of the soil is determined by the sandy part due to the sand section overcoming the clay section in such a situation the oil on the sandy surfaces is covered with oil and the interaction between soil particles soil friction angle and subsequently soil shear strength is reduced it is worth noting that in high amounts of oil the chances and probabilities of sand particles slipping increase due to the film with thicker coatings because the oil completely covers the sand particles abousnina et al 2015 in such a situation the changes in the angle of soil friction are insignificant figs 12 and 13 also presents the effect of microwave remediation on shear strength parameters microwave remediation was performed on all specimens of the direct shear test under optimum conditions obtained from previous sections all optimum values obtained from previous sections have been provided in table 5 the results showed that despite the cleanup process in the presence of 4 crude oil the cohesion changes were negligible since crude oil has a physicochemical effect due to the reduction of dielectric constant on clay particles it is likely that the thermal conditions in the sample will continue to interact between oil and clay particles and cause a slight reduction in soil cohesion ratnaweera and meegoda 2006 on the other hand according to section 4 1 due to the constant dielectric properties and thermodynamic properties of clays and the high specific surface area of clay particles the final temperature of clay particles is lower than sand thus slowing down the process of decontamination the superposition of these two mechanisms will lead to a negligible increase in the effect of removal efficiency and subsequently a negligible increase in cohesion in contrast with oil rising beyond 4 the cleanup process on the sandy part of the soil has only a physical effect during the microwave remediation process oil evaporation reduces viscosity and returns the boundaries and shape of particles to their own initial state ostovar et al 2021 moreover the final temperature of the sand particles is higher and the removal process is faster than clay particles in such a situation the bonding and friction between the particles increases and the cohesion decreases finally the shear strength changes trend can be obtained by inserting the cohesion and internal friction angle to eq 2 as can be clearly seen in fig 14 the observed trend in shear strength after the cleanup was similar to the internal friction angle changes trend it means a slight increase in shear strength up to 4 of crude oil and a considerable increase beyond 4 of crude oil 4 8 static triaxial test in order to better understand the behavior of soils contaminated with crude oil and in different percentages of pollution consolidated undrained cu triaxial tests were performed on non contaminated and contaminated specimens with different percentages of contamination of 4 8 and 12 under full saturation conditions an important determinant of strength behavior and soil parameters in triaxial experiments is saturation conditions and water presence in order to perform static triaxial tests the sample was first contaminated with crude oil and then placed in a triaxial cell and saturated fig 15 illustrates the effect of crude oil on cohesion of specimens as can be seen by increasing the pollution rate up to 4 all contamination is accumulated on clay particle surfaces due to the larger clay surface area hence the effect of saturation conditions should be investigated for two conditions 1 saturation effect on clay particles coated with oil 2 saturation effect on sand particles in the first case oil coated clay reduces the absorption of water molecules by clay particles due to the reduction of soil specific surface area and subsequently reduces contact between clay particles this mechanism reduces cohesion it is important to note that some clay particles may be oil free and want to absorb water molecules in such situations due to the complete saturation of the sample and the high amount of water molecules in the mixture some water molecules will likely absorb the surfaces of pollution free clay particles see fig 4 leading to increased cohesion in the second case saturation conditions cause a negligible apparent cohesion among sand particles which does not significantly impact the overall behavior of the soil because the cohesion of sand particles is always close to zero therefore with the increase of oil up to 4 cohesion decreases but the rate decreases compared to cohesion in the direct shear test in addition it was observed that the internal friction angle increased by 4 oil this can be attributed to the presence of a large number of flocculated clay particles ahmadi et al 2021 this mechanism leads to increasing the connection between soil particles see fig 16 in contrast with the increase of oil beyond 4 three probable states should be investigated 1 the saturation effect on clay particles coated with oil 2 the saturation effect on sand particles and 3 the saturation effect on oil coated sand particles the third case leads to increasing cohesion this is a type of apparent cohesion partly due to the surface tension of water and oil in addition due to the intrinsic cohesion of oil and the high dynamic viscosity of oil compared to water khosravi et al 2013 an increase in cohesion is created in the sandy part and subsequently the entire soil matrix because a large part of the soil is sand particles the superposition of the above three states leads to the dominance of the second and third states over the first state and increases the cohesion of the mixture on the other hand increasing crude oil beyond 4 due to increasing the lubricant effect between sand particles increases the slip between the particles on each other and consequently reduces the internal friction angle of the matrix fig 16 figs 15 and 16 also presents the effect of microwave remediation on shear strength parameters as can be seen the rate of increased removal efficiency in triaxial tests is less than direct shear tests this can be attributed to the presence of water in the triaxial experiment as reported in section 4 3 the presence of water beyond 15 in the sample reduces the rate of removal efficiency because much of the microwave thermal energy is spent on evaporating the water it is worth noting that in high percentages of oil the removal efficiency rate increases slightly due to the increase of oil amount in the specimen 5 conclusion the present study investigated the effect of crude oil on removal efficiency and geotechnical parameters of well graded sand with clay by a series of thermal and geotechnical tests including direct shear and static triaxial tests the effect of crude oil crude oil residence time absorbent additives type and content microwave power specimen weight maximum grain size and fine grain fraction were investigated on removal efficiency and their optimum values were extracted to carry out the geotechnical tests the key findings of current research can be highlighted as follows the main strength of this study is the presence of clay particles in the soil which is a key determining factor to understand the whole behavior of soil matrix the removal efficiency increased by increasing the crude oil content this trend showed a slight increase of up to 4 and a considerable increase beyond 4 crude oil this was attributed to the lower removal potential of clay than sand particles the findings obtained from the removal efficiency results show that the optimum values of mw power absorbent additives type and dosage were 1000 watt pac and 10 respectively shear strength results show that by increasing the crude oil up to 4 cohesion reduces due to lower specific area of clay particles than sand particles reducing the exchange cation capacity by contrast cohesion increases by increasing the crude oil beyond 4 this is attributed to a series of mechanical factors between crude oil and sand particles intrinsic adhesion and higher viscosity of oil than water optimum moisture by increasing the crude oil up to 4 internal friction angle decreases this can be attributed to the effect of lubricant and the high viscosity of the oil in the clay section a similar trend occurred for high amount of crude oil due to lubricant effect of oil between sand particles in the triaxial test the saturation condition is a controlling factor for determining the soil strength parameters the results show that cohesion decreases by 4 crude oil and beyond that the trend reversed moreover internal friction angle increases up to 4 crude oil due to a large number of flocculated clay particles and beyond 4 the trend reversed because of the lubricant properties of crude oil declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

1286,crude oil products are among the most common pollutants of soils which can drastically affect the engineering properties of soils in the current study a series of laboratory tests were conducted to investigate the interaction between crude oil and sandy soil with clay and the effect of crude oil crude oil residence time absorbent additives type and content microwave power specimen weight maximum grain size and fine grain fraction on the removal efficiency of pollution through microwave radiation to extract optimum values for potential and high efficiency in hydrocarbon removal the present study also investigated geotechnical properties including cohesion internal friction angle shear strength in three conditions before and during pollution and after cleanup utilizing direct shear and static triaxial tests the results showed that the presence of clay particles oil content and saturation effect in the soil could significantly control the engineering soil behavior in the presence of 4 crude oil in direct shear tests the whole oil content is accumulated on clay particles due to the high specific area of clay particles reducing the cohesion and the internal friction angle by contrast beyond the 4 of crude oil sand particle in the soil was the controlling factor of the whole behavior of the mixture in triaxial tests the trend of soil parameters is almost similar to direct shear tests by increasing crude oil except that with an increase of 4 of oil the friction angle of the soil increases due to the presence of a large number of flocculated clay particles keywords contaminated soil crude oil remediation microwave heating soil strength 1 introduction nowadays soil and groundwater contamination with toxic pollutants is a worldwide environmental problem miles et al 1990 spills of about 5 734 000 tons of oil were recorded worldwide between 1970 and 2016 sivagami et al 2021 among various mineral pollutants the crude oil and petroleum products are considered as the main sources of environmental contamination the major concern about petroleum products is their harmful effects on the public health and the ecology of soil during all stages of refining transportation and consumption rajasekhar et al 2020 vega et al 2011 moreover due to physico chemical interactions between the pollutant compositions and the soil matrix the geotechnical properties of the polluted soil may decline significantly such as permeability moisture value and bearing capacity rajabi and sharifipour 2019 safehian et al 2018 so far several methods have been used to eliminate the soil contaminations ding et al 2019 at field scale thermal methods may be considered as the most suitable techniques for cleaning organic compounds from soils caniani et al 2018 there are various methods for clearing contaminated soils that use a technique that is dependent on several factors such as the existence of strict laws cost type of pollution the concentration of pollution type of soil saturation degree geological condition dimensions of pollution spread groundwater conditions climatic conditions etc therefore clearing any contamination cannot be limited to just one particular way because each technique has its own advantages soil washing is one of the effective methods of soil purification to remove volatile organic compounds vocs and metals from sandy and gravelly soils sharma and reddy 2004 in this technology contaminated soil is cleaned with water and a mechanical stirrer to remove hazardous pollutants or reduce their volume one of the advantages of this method is that it can be used for various compounds however this method is not very common due to the high use of water and subsequently high volume of effluent and the cost of disposing of it sharma and reddy 2004 villa et al 2010 oxidation is a common effective purification technology for soils contaminated by organic and chemical substances of toxins and cyanides the technique may not always be cost effective due to the amount of chemicals required moreover chemical reagents are likely to be wasted when excessive temperatures and pressure are utilized rivas 2006 the bioremediation method is less costly than physical chemical and thermal methods and is done naturally however microorganisms require suitable conditions for their growth and viability including proper ph temperature oxygen salinity and nutrients although biological methods such as phytoremediation and bioremediation have paid much attention to soil pollution in recent years their application in places where the concentration of pollutants is high is inefficient although using other methods physical chemical and thermal has a positive effect on overcoming these limitations and increasing the efficiency of improvement using these methods requires a long time cioni and petarca 2011 among the existing methods for extraction and removal of organic pollutants heat methods have been proposed as rapid and high efficiency methods for removing organic contaminants in aquatic and dry environments one of which is the use of microwave radiation the efficiency of using thermal methods in some cases is 99 compared to competing methods such as bioremediation and solvent extraction they require less time and confer greater efficiency in different environments appleton et al 2005 shang et al 2007 the cost of using microwave radiation is lower than traditional thermal methods which makes it attractive for use on large scale shang et al 2006 the price of using the microwave method for cleaning oil wastes can be 20 times lower than traditional thermal methods jones et al 2002 shang et al 2007 moreover this recently developed approach to provide required energy for increasing the soil temperature is the usage of microwaves radiation which causes the breakdown of hydrocarbon compounds de oliveira et al 2018 microwave remediation heating performance is based on the electric field generated by electromagnetic radiation and molecular dipoles in environmental specimens this mechanism leads to heat production at the molecular level nascimento and azevedo 2013 although this mechanism helps remove pollution reports have shown that in the presence of an electromagnetic field wave power is dispersed throughout the material hence adding a susceptor for better absorption of microwaves in contaminated soil is needed mokhtar et al 2011 activated carbon as a carbon based susceptor increases the heat generated owing to friction between dipoles and subsequently facilitates the volatilization of hydrocarbon compounds sivagami et al 2021 liu and yu 2006 utilized granulated activated carbon to absorb microwaves and increase temperatures the results showed that the temperatures were about 500 c at 700 w of power other susceptors were used to raise the temperature and absorb microwaves such as water iron powder sodium hypophospite moisture spent graphite powder falciglia et al 2016 liu et al 2008 robinson et al 2014 sivagami et al 2019 several advantages may be involved with this method including high rate of soil refinement easy combination with groundwater extraction technology rapid and integrated generation of heat energy indirect contact with the source maintaining the apparent characteristics of target body having better control over the heating process high removal efficiency ability to treat an extensive limit of contaminants and being economically compatible with other technologies for large soil volumes such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs total petroleum hydrocarbons tphs and pesticides falciglia et al 2016 jones et al 2002 miao et al 2020 sivagami et al 2019 li et al 2008 have used microwaves 2 45 ghz with granular activated carbon for clearing soils contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons diesels the microwave irradiation caused to elimination of 99 of oil pollutants within 10 min chien 2012 mounted 4 m special antennas deep into an oil contaminated soil and connected them to a microwave generator the results showed that the soil contamination removal through microwave radiation is a cost effective and time saving method falciglia and vagliasindi 2015 investigated the clearing of silty sands and clayey soils contaminated by diesel with microwaves radiation the results showed that the removal rate of contamination for sandy soils was 90 while the efficiency was much lower for clayey soils cho et al 2020 used microwave heating to examine the removal of tph from contaminated soil and identify the desorption behavior of five carbon number based tph components the results showed that the coarse soil had a removal efficiency of 91 1 after 15 min whereas the fine soil had a poor removal efficiency another perspective of microwave application is the rehabilitation of contaminated soils using microwave treatment several research studies have reported the effects of hydrocarbon pollutants on the geotechnical properties of soils ahmadi et al 2021 ding et al 2019 ostovar et al 2021 puri 2000 rajabi and sharifipour 2019 there was mostly some decrease in soil friction angle with increasing the contamination content khamehchiyan et al 2007 conducted an extensive research on the oil polluted soils from the persian gulf coasts it was found that oil contamination reduces the permeability and strength in all specimens abousnina et al 2015 suggested the use of oil contaminated sand as a road construction material which seems to be a cost effective solution to minimize adverse impacts on environment the research results showed that with an increase in contamination up to 1 the soil shear strength increases while some reduction at greater percentages of contamination is observed ahmadi et al 2021 investigated the interaction between crude oil clay and sand particles in contaminated soil the results indicated that the addition of crude oil lowered the internal friction angle in sandy specimens with low clay content but increased the angle of friction in specimens with high clay content the available literature on soils contaminated with oil products has for the most part been limited to techniques for reducing or eliminating soil pollution although the geotechnical properties of the polluted soils have also been evaluated in several studies the engineering properties of improved soil have rarely been investigated in the current study first the polluted soil was decontaminated and also the effects of crude oil crude oil residence time absorbent additives type and content microwave power specimen weight maximum grain size and fine grain fraction on removal efficiency were investigated and optimum values of parameters were determined to reach the high removal efficiency second geotechnical properties such as cohesion internal friction angle shear strength were evaluated by obtaining optimum levels finally the results were compared in three conditions without contamination with contamination and after decontamination 2 experimental materials 2 1 characterization of soil oil and activated carbon the current study soil were collected from the isfahan refinery site at depths that ranging from 0 to 3 m the soil used in current study is from the polluted soil in this area iraji asiabadi et al 2016 the soil particle size distribution was determined according to astm d422 63 as presented in fig 1 it should be noted that the soil fine fraction is about 10 both plastic properties and gradation coefficients are required for the soil classification the soil specifications are presented in table 1 since the soil of the study area is considered one of the problematic soils several authors have examined the ground of this region based on the results of x ray powder diffraction xrd patterns they reported the dominant minerals of kaolinite illite chlorite and quartz they also noted the magnetite hematite and goethite minerals in contaminated soils this region lacks smectite minerals this may be attributed to low rainfall in this region ayoubi et al 2002 ayoubi et al 2020 also the origin of the dominant minerals of the creature was hereditary despite the presence of these minerals the current method as a potential method showed high efficiency in the removal of pollutants in this region the hydrocarbon material used in this study is crude oil consumed in isfahan oil refinery some characteristics of the crude oil are listed in table 2 in the current study two absorbents of activated carbon granular gac and powder pac type were used to absorb more waves and increase the temperature in the soil mass in order to eliminate the dust activated carbon was heated in boiling water for 30 min before use and then washed with distilled water then activated carbon was dried at 105 c for 24 h and stored for use the main characteristics of gac and pac are listed in table 3 3 experimental methods 3 1 microwave energy microwave energy is produced by a magnetron the source of microwave radiation and the created waves are transmitted to the intended target heat is produced by friction of bipolar components in an oscillating electric field microwave radiation is part of the electromagnetic spectrum which has a frequency range of 0 3 to 300 ghz and a wavelength of 1 mm to 1 m menéndez et al 2010 substances that absorb micro waves are called dielectrics and are specified by dielectric constant and loss parameters the dielectric constant indicates the ability of a substance to be polarized in the presence of an external electric field while dielectric loss or the energy loss factor indicates the ability of a substance to convert electromagnetic energy to heat the device used to generate microwave radiation is a nn st7575w panasonic domestic oven with a maximum output power of 1100 watts and a 2 45 ghz frequency an overall view of the microwave radiation device is illustrated in fig 2 the continuous usage of the oven at required time intervals could cause an increase in the device circuits temperature resulting in damage to the capacitors and magnetron to avoid this problem an auxiliary fan was used to prevent the temperature elevation in addition the main capacitors of the device were replaced with types resistant to high temperature to allow for the better circuitry of device another problem during the microwave radiation of contaminated samples was sparking due to the evaporated crude oil and more importantly represented a safety concern therefore appropriate measures were employed to release these vapours this was made by creating a ventilation hole in the top of the microwave also a special valve was made at the oven door for removing the vapour from the microwave using a vacuum pump see fig 2 a special st48 laser thermometer was also used to measure the specimen temperature at the end of radiation process tph index is used to explain a large group of chemical compounds that all originate from crude oil therefore this index has been used to measure the amount of crude oil consumed in the soil the percentage of oil removal or clean up efficiency of the radiated specimens is determined based on eq 1 1 r e tph i tph f tph i 100 where r is clean up efficiency tphi is the initial weight of hydrocarbons in the soil sample and tphf is the final weight of hydrocarbons in the treated specimen 3 2 direct shear strength direct shear tests are among the oldest and easiest tests for determining strength parameters in order to investigate the effect of crude oil on soil strength parameters the direct shear tests were conducted based on the astm d3080 90 standard the shear force was applied to the sample through a displacement control system at a speed of 1 mm min for each set of direct shear tests three similar samples were sheared separately under normal stress level of 1 kg cm2 the test supplies are composed of a metal shear box where soil samples are placed in this study a circular mold with a diameter of 6 3 cm and a height of 2 cm was used vertical force is applied from the top of the shear box by weight load on the sample by applying a constant rate shear shift to the bottom of the half box and recording the shear force recorded by the dynamometer attached to the upper half box the extended shear stress in the shear section of the sample can be determined the relationship between vertical and shear stress on the failure plate is defined by the eq 2 2 τ c σtanφ where τ is shear stress c is cohesion coefficient σ is vertical stress and φ is internal friction angle 3 3 static triaxial test in order to investigate the effect of crude oil on contaminated soil under saturation conditions a series of consolidated undrained cu tests were carried out based on the astm d4767 95 standard the specimens were prepared in cylindrical moulds with a diameter of 33 mm and a height of 75 mm the sample was then put in a triaxial container and saturated with distilled water b 95 the samples were then consolidated and the sample was loaded at a continuous strain of 1 mm per minute the loading was sustained until the sample could no longer withstand the strain and ruptured entirely 3 4 specimen preparation according to the field reports the range of crude oil pollution at the isfahan refinery site is estimated to be between 4 and 8 for having more control on the soil conditions clean soil from the refinery protected site were contaminated with crude oil by 4 and 8 of the soil dry weight it is worth noting that at least 2 days should elapse to allow soil particles to absorb the added oil in other words transition from free flow to absorbed phase evgin and das 1992 in order to perform this oil contaminated soil was placed in two layers of thick plastic to allow a natural reaction between hydrocarbon materials and soil particles it should be added that to prevent unwanted entry of any organic matter into containers or traces of crude oil from previous experiments after performing each test the containers were washed with detergent urban water hexane n solution and finally with distilled water and dried in an air exposed laboratory 3 5 test procedures in the current study a series of cleanup direct shear strength and triaxial tests were conducted the effects of crude oil content crude oil residence time absorbent additives type and content microwave power specimen weight maximum grain size and fine grain fraction on removal efficiency re were investigated moreover geotechnical properties including cohesion internal friction angle shear strength in three conditions before and during pollution and after cleanup were evaluated utilizing direct shear and static triaxial tests experiments program is summarized in table 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of crude oil content on removal efficiency in order to investigate the effect of crude oil on removal efficiency soil specimens with a moisture content of 10 were contaminated by different percentages of crude oil and were subjected to 800 watts radiation for 10 min as maximum safe radiation duration the results are presented in fig 3 as can be seen by increasing the crude oil up to 4 the slope of the re parameter increased slightly and beyond that steeply two mechanisms can describe this process 1 by increasing hydrocarbons content more microwave energy is absorbed up to 12 and subsequently the temperature increases also the soil is transparent to the microwave so microwave energy is absorbed into moisture and hydrocarbon molecules chien 2012 on the other hand it seems that the amount of light hydrocarbons in crude oil is higher than other sources of pollutants because of high a p i value in table 2 also at the created temperature heavy hydrocarbons are broken down and turn into light hydrocarbons therefore the amount of these hydrocarbons in the soil increases and is eliminated through evaporation 2 the studied soil is well grained sand with clay sw sc the sandy part experiences more temperature due to microwave radiation compared to the clay section of the soil this can be attributed to the dielectric constant and thermodynamic properties of soils falciglia et al 2017 these two parameters are mainly dependent on soil grain size and soil specific surface area since the specific surface of clays is higher than sand more hydrocarbons accumulate on them moreover clay can enclose oil due to its high porosity and inter crystalline properties and limit the emission removal process cho et al 2020 therefore it can be said that adding crude oil up to 4 due to the accumulation of pollution on the clay section of soil slows the process of decontamination beyond this level excess oil is placed on sand particles due to saturation of clay surfaces leading to an increase in the removal efficiency rate see conceptual fig 4 it should be noted that the low slope of increasing the decontamination up to 4 can be attributed to the constant conditions of the test 10 moisture and 800 watts of radiation this could mean that susceptors or more time radiation and radiation power should be used to accelerate and increase the efficiency of the cleanup process at 4 of oil although the pollution rate at the isfahan oil refinery site was reported to be 4 to 8 almost 7 the range of crude oil contamination was extended to 12 to account for worse likely pollution conditions nevertheless the amount of 8 pollution was selected as the major case of the field soil contamination in all subsequent experiments to obtain the optimal efficiency of pollution elimination through microwave radiation 4 2 effect of crude oil residence time in the soil on the removal efficiency fig 5 shows the effect of oil residence time 2 days one week two weeks and three weeks in the soil on cleanup efficiency at the moisture content of 10 contaminated with 8 crude oil and 800 watts of microwaves radiation the specimens were exposed to irradiation for 10 min as can be clearly seen the removal efficiency decreases by increasing the residence time of crude oil in the soil this can be attributed to chemical reactions between soil and oil in the long run tanee and albert 2015 reported the detrimental effects of the long term residue of crude oil on soil chemical properties long term residue crude oil reduces nutrient availability phosphorus and nitrogen germination vegetation and leads to wildlife deaths or even extinction of species due to the inhibitory and hydrophobic properties of crude oil in other words if the soil is not decontaminated in the short period after contamination in addition to reducing the removal efficiency it increases soil toxicity and will have negative effects on the chemical properties and vegetation of the soil hence it seems more productive for treatment operations to be continued as soon as possible after the pollution occurrence 4 3 effect of susceptor on removal efficiency of hydrocarbons regarding the low removal efficiency for previous specimens microwave absorbent additives were employed to enhance the cleanup efficiency fig 6 shows the effects of three types of microwave absorbent i e granular activated carbon gac powdered activated carbon pac and moisture on the removal efficiency for this purpose 8 contaminated specimens mixed with 5 susceptors were subjected to microwave radiation for 10 min removal efficiency increased in the presence of moisture this can be attributed to the bipolar properties of water which is an important factor for the microwave reaction however moisture removal efficiency has lower efficiency than activated carbon these results are consistent with the findings of previous studies sivagami et al 2021 in addition the upper moisture limit is 15 beyond this amount prevents the absorption of microwaves in other words 15 moisture causes the total energy of microwaves to be spent steaming water and moisture 5 in this study could not be tested according to previous experiences because in this case the absorption of waves is very low therefore the waves radiated by magnetron due to lack of absorption by the soil hit the oven frame and reflect the magnetron the result of this phenomenon causes it to spark the addition of activated carbon to the soil effectively increases the ability to absorb microwave energy and reach high temperatures and high removal efficiency as can be noticed the highest temperature and subsequently removal efficiency were associated with pac and the lowest value was related to moisture the observed difference between pac and gac removal efficiency values was negligible the reason for the pac s better performance can be attributed to particle size the mass transfer benefit of smaller particles is that the diffusion route is shorter therefore molecules reach accessible adsorption sites more quickly in other words it can be said that powdered activated carbon has better efficiency for the removal of liquid pollutants in contrast granular activated carbon is better for gases consequently the powder activated carbon was selected as the most effective susceptor and was used to carry out the rest of experiments the dosage effect of the pac was also investigated for the specimens contaminated with 8 crude oil as shown in fig 7 by increasing the amount of pac from 5 to 10 the removal efficiency rose from 67 to 78 such results may be justified by the basic theoretical relation on microwaves energy loss within dielectric materials li et al 2008 this is because the temperature increment within materials under the microwaves is directly related to their relative energy loss factor both soil and crude oil have low capacity to convert the electromagnetic radiation energy to heat while the activated carbon particularly in powder form has a considerable potential to increase the soil temperature therefore using pac for oil polluted soils may significantly increase the removal efficiency the ratio of the relative energy loss factor ε to the dielectric constant ε0 is the relative amount of energy intensity of microwaves transmitted to the target materials since the relative energy loss factor is related to the internal loss mechanisms a material with a high relative energy loss factor produces higher heating under microwaves based the following relation 3 t t 2 πf ε 0 ε eff e 2 ρ c p where t is the temperature increment t is the irradiation time f is the microwave frequency ε0 is the permittivity of free space e is the magnitude of the internal electric field ρ is the density cp is the heat capacity and ε eff is the effective dielectric loss factor 4 4 effect of microwave power mw power on removal efficiency the removal efficiency can also be improved by increasing the microwave source power tph is made up of compounds with complicated structures and huge molecular weights this might be due to the creation of extra heat which causes fast molecular mobility buttress et al 2016 fig 8 presents three levels of microwave source power including 600 800 and 1000 watts to investigate the mw power on re as can be seen the highest crude oil removal efficiency of 81 was achieved at the power of 1000 watts this enhancement of removal efficiency is also justified based on the eq 2 as the rate of microwave absorption and change to heat depends strongly on the magnitude of the electric field which is a function of the microwave device power based on the obtained results a 1000 w power microwave device was used to optimize the other parameters in the soil remediation test the choice of 1000 watts radiation power is to ensure the removal of tph from the clay part of the soil because the hydrocarbons are mostly accumulated in clay particles due to the larger specific surface area increasing the power of radiation increases soil temperature and subsequently increases the removal efficiency these results are in agreement with previous studies cho et al 2020 sivagami et al 2019 4 5 effect of specimens weight on the removal efficiency the effect of various weights of 200 g to 350 g at the moisture content of 10 10 of pac 10 min of radiation 1000 watts power radiation and contamination with 8 of crude oil on re was investigated the results have been shown in fig 9 these conditions were selected based on the results from previous sections since the limitation running of the microwave device is approximately 10 min a higher duration can cause damage to the device magnetron therefore the removal procedures of the relatively heavy specimens were carried out based on multi stages for this purpose specimen irradiation was first carried out for 10 min duration and the microwave device was turned off to allow the device temperature to return to nearly the ambient temperature finally the irradiation and rest cycles were repeated six times including 10 min of microwave radiation at each cycle the experiments showed that by increasing the weight of polluted soil specimen more microwaves irradiation time is needed to reach high removal efficiency increasing the weight of the specimen has a direct relation to clay content in other words the clay part increases as the weight increases therefore more hydrocarbons are accumulated on the clay and subsequently removed from the soil with greater difficulty as shown in fig 9 the removal efficiency for all soil specimens tends to reach a constant level after 40 to 60 min of radiation therefore it may be concluded that beyond 40 min the major part of the hydrocarbons chains is likely eliminated from the soil specimens and the rest of them are not removed with increasing radiation time anymore this can be attributed to the dependence of hydrocarbon removal efficiency on various factors such as mw power susceptor type susceptor dosage and other test conditions in other words it is necessary to change the test conditions such as increasing mw power or pac dosage to achieve complete removal efficiency in these conditions these results showed that 40 min of radiation could be considered as the optimum radiation time since the amount of soil required to perform a complete set of direct shear tests was estimated at 350 g these specimens were adopted to determine soil shear strength it should be added that the removal efficiency of this type of soil specimen was about 78 after 50 min of microwaves irradiation 4 6 effect of maximum grain size and fine grain fraction on removal efficiency all of the investigations as mentioned earlier were carried out on the soil fraction finer than 2 mm consisting of about 97 of the selected field soil this was also necessary to meet the specimen size requirements for conducting direct shear tests the results of these experiments for the three maximum particle sizes of the polluted soil specimens i e finer than 2 mm sieve number 10 finer than 0 425 mm sieve number 40 and finer than 0 25 mm sieve no 60 are presented in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 the removal efficiency was higher in specimens with greater grain size such results may be justified as microwaves penetrate more quickly into the samples with higher coarse grain due to the presence of larger pores falciglia et al 2017 on the other hand the evaporation rate of coarse particles is higher than fine particles the effect of fine fraction finer than 0 075 mm of the polluted soil specimens on removal efficiency was also investigated it should be noted that although for the selected soil samples the fine fraction was determined to be about 10 some variations may be observed regarding the amount fine fraction at different locations of the isfahan refinery site the fine fraction was estimated to be in the range of 5 15 therefore experiments were carried out on the soil specimens with the fine fraction of 5 10 and 15 the results of the experiments are presented in fig 11 as can be seen the removal efficiency of the treated specimens decreased with the fine fraction increment altogether the removal efficiency for coarse grain specimens was 12 higher than that of fine grain specimens such results may be justified due to the fact that the fine fraction of the soil could absorb more crude oil pollution due to the high specific surface area cho et al 2020 in other words since the fine fractions usually involve a high unbalanced electric charge and ion exchange capacity the contaminants adhere more tightly to the soil particles surface resulting in lower removal efficiency similar results have already been reported by falciglia and vagliasindi 2015 who found that the removal rate of contamination for sandy soils was as great as 90 while the efficiency was much lower for clayey soils 4 7 direct shear test results fig 12 shows the soil strength parameters results for various soil specimens and after removal pollution as can be clearly seen by increasing the crude oil concentration up to 4 the cohesion decreases and beyond 4 leads to an increase in cohesion since the studied soil type is sw sc most of the soil is sand and a little is clay hence changing the trend of matrix behavior is justified by increasing oil content with an increase of 4 of oil clay has a higher power in oil absorption than sand due to its higher specific surface area amellal et al 2001 sánchez martín et al 2011 in other words the clay section is responsible for controlling the behavior of the soil matrix by entering 4 of oil into the soil matrix the clay section absorbed a large part of this amount when clay particles are coated by oil the soil s specific surface area is reduced ur rehman et al 2007 moreover studies have shown that increasing oil significantly reduces cation exchange capacity ur rehman et al 2007 this decrease leads to a decrease in the absorption of water molecules with clay particles and a reduction in the contact of clay particles thereby reducing cohesion with the increase of oil beyond 4 likely the oil will first go to the filling of clay surfaces and after creating a cumulative mass and saturation of oil the process of oil absorption by clay particles is stopped and the excess amount of oil in the soil matrix is spread on the sandy surface the specific surface area of sand particles is low and the oil on the surface of the particles is not massed but is dispersed between the whole sand particles in other words there is a soil matrix consisting of sand and clay in such conditions which is oil between all its particles oil on clay surfaces reduces cohesion by contrast oil between sand particles leads to increased cohesion since a large part of the soil is sand oil impregnated sand particles determine the behavior of the soil it should be noted that the behavior of coarse grain soils during contamination is subject to mechanical factors while the behavior of clay soils is justified based on physicochemical reactions between oil and clay minerals zhao 1996 accordingly the oil between sand particles due to its intrinsic cohesion and higher viscosity than water soltani jigheh et al 2018 optimum moisture increases the apparent cohesion between sand particles and subsequently soil matrix in order to explore the effect of crude oil on internal friction angle the results were provided in fig 13 by investigating the effect of crude oil on the internal friction angle it was observed that with increasing crude oil up to 4 the internal friction angle of the soil decreased this can be attributed to the effect of lubricant and the high viscosity of the oil puri 2000 soltani jigheh et al 2018 in other words with the increase of oil up to 4 the emulsified and inexcusable phase of oil and moisture in the soil increases leading to a decrease in shear strength see fig 14 in contrast with the increase of crude oil beyond 4 the behavior of the soil is determined by the sandy part due to the sand section overcoming the clay section in such a situation the oil on the sandy surfaces is covered with oil and the interaction between soil particles soil friction angle and subsequently soil shear strength is reduced it is worth noting that in high amounts of oil the chances and probabilities of sand particles slipping increase due to the film with thicker coatings because the oil completely covers the sand particles abousnina et al 2015 in such a situation the changes in the angle of soil friction are insignificant figs 12 and 13 also presents the effect of microwave remediation on shear strength parameters microwave remediation was performed on all specimens of the direct shear test under optimum conditions obtained from previous sections all optimum values obtained from previous sections have been provided in table 5 the results showed that despite the cleanup process in the presence of 4 crude oil the cohesion changes were negligible since crude oil has a physicochemical effect due to the reduction of dielectric constant on clay particles it is likely that the thermal conditions in the sample will continue to interact between oil and clay particles and cause a slight reduction in soil cohesion ratnaweera and meegoda 2006 on the other hand according to section 4 1 due to the constant dielectric properties and thermodynamic properties of clays and the high specific surface area of clay particles the final temperature of clay particles is lower than sand thus slowing down the process of decontamination the superposition of these two mechanisms will lead to a negligible increase in the effect of removal efficiency and subsequently a negligible increase in cohesion in contrast with oil rising beyond 4 the cleanup process on the sandy part of the soil has only a physical effect during the microwave remediation process oil evaporation reduces viscosity and returns the boundaries and shape of particles to their own initial state ostovar et al 2021 moreover the final temperature of the sand particles is higher and the removal process is faster than clay particles in such a situation the bonding and friction between the particles increases and the cohesion decreases finally the shear strength changes trend can be obtained by inserting the cohesion and internal friction angle to eq 2 as can be clearly seen in fig 14 the observed trend in shear strength after the cleanup was similar to the internal friction angle changes trend it means a slight increase in shear strength up to 4 of crude oil and a considerable increase beyond 4 of crude oil 4 8 static triaxial test in order to better understand the behavior of soils contaminated with crude oil and in different percentages of pollution consolidated undrained cu triaxial tests were performed on non contaminated and contaminated specimens with different percentages of contamination of 4 8 and 12 under full saturation conditions an important determinant of strength behavior and soil parameters in triaxial experiments is saturation conditions and water presence in order to perform static triaxial tests the sample was first contaminated with crude oil and then placed in a triaxial cell and saturated fig 15 illustrates the effect of crude oil on cohesion of specimens as can be seen by increasing the pollution rate up to 4 all contamination is accumulated on clay particle surfaces due to the larger clay surface area hence the effect of saturation conditions should be investigated for two conditions 1 saturation effect on clay particles coated with oil 2 saturation effect on sand particles in the first case oil coated clay reduces the absorption of water molecules by clay particles due to the reduction of soil specific surface area and subsequently reduces contact between clay particles this mechanism reduces cohesion it is important to note that some clay particles may be oil free and want to absorb water molecules in such situations due to the complete saturation of the sample and the high amount of water molecules in the mixture some water molecules will likely absorb the surfaces of pollution free clay particles see fig 4 leading to increased cohesion in the second case saturation conditions cause a negligible apparent cohesion among sand particles which does not significantly impact the overall behavior of the soil because the cohesion of sand particles is always close to zero therefore with the increase of oil up to 4 cohesion decreases but the rate decreases compared to cohesion in the direct shear test in addition it was observed that the internal friction angle increased by 4 oil this can be attributed to the presence of a large number of flocculated clay particles ahmadi et al 2021 this mechanism leads to increasing the connection between soil particles see fig 16 in contrast with the increase of oil beyond 4 three probable states should be investigated 1 the saturation effect on clay particles coated with oil 2 the saturation effect on sand particles and 3 the saturation effect on oil coated sand particles the third case leads to increasing cohesion this is a type of apparent cohesion partly due to the surface tension of water and oil in addition due to the intrinsic cohesion of oil and the high dynamic viscosity of oil compared to water khosravi et al 2013 an increase in cohesion is created in the sandy part and subsequently the entire soil matrix because a large part of the soil is sand particles the superposition of the above three states leads to the dominance of the second and third states over the first state and increases the cohesion of the mixture on the other hand increasing crude oil beyond 4 due to increasing the lubricant effect between sand particles increases the slip between the particles on each other and consequently reduces the internal friction angle of the matrix fig 16 figs 15 and 16 also presents the effect of microwave remediation on shear strength parameters as can be seen the rate of increased removal efficiency in triaxial tests is less than direct shear tests this can be attributed to the presence of water in the triaxial experiment as reported in section 4 3 the presence of water beyond 15 in the sample reduces the rate of removal efficiency because much of the microwave thermal energy is spent on evaporating the water it is worth noting that in high percentages of oil the removal efficiency rate increases slightly due to the increase of oil amount in the specimen 5 conclusion the present study investigated the effect of crude oil on removal efficiency and geotechnical parameters of well graded sand with clay by a series of thermal and geotechnical tests including direct shear and static triaxial tests the effect of crude oil crude oil residence time absorbent additives type and content microwave power specimen weight maximum grain size and fine grain fraction were investigated on removal efficiency and their optimum values were extracted to carry out the geotechnical tests the key findings of current research can be highlighted as follows the main strength of this study is the presence of clay particles in the soil which is a key determining factor to understand the whole behavior of soil matrix the removal efficiency increased by increasing the crude oil content this trend showed a slight increase of up to 4 and a considerable increase beyond 4 crude oil this was attributed to the lower removal potential of clay than sand particles the findings obtained from the removal efficiency results show that the optimum values of mw power absorbent additives type and dosage were 1000 watt pac and 10 respectively shear strength results show that by increasing the crude oil up to 4 cohesion reduces due to lower specific area of clay particles than sand particles reducing the exchange cation capacity by contrast cohesion increases by increasing the crude oil beyond 4 this is attributed to a series of mechanical factors between crude oil and sand particles intrinsic adhesion and higher viscosity of oil than water optimum moisture by increasing the crude oil up to 4 internal friction angle decreases this can be attributed to the effect of lubricant and the high viscosity of the oil in the clay section a similar trend occurred for high amount of crude oil due to lubricant effect of oil between sand particles in the triaxial test the saturation condition is a controlling factor for determining the soil strength parameters the results show that cohesion decreases by 4 crude oil and beyond that the trend reversed moreover internal friction angle increases up to 4 crude oil due to a large number of flocculated clay particles and beyond 4 the trend reversed because of the lubricant properties of crude oil declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

1287,clay liners are widely used as porous membrane barriers to control solute transport and to prevent the leakage of leachate both in horizontal and vertical flow scenarios such as the isolated base and ramps of sanitary landfills despite the primary importance of saturated hydraulic conductivity in a reliable simulation of fluid flow through clay barriers there is no model to predict hydraulic conductivity of clayey soils permeated with saline aqueous solutions because most of the current models were developed for pure water therefore the main motivation behind this study is to derive semi empirical models for simulating the hydraulic conductivity of clayey soils in the presence of arbitrary solute concentrations in addition to deionized water in order to achieve this goal a relatively comprehensive dataset of 842 measured hydraulic conductivities was retrieved from the experimental literature where almost 44 of them are related to certain solute concentrations afterwards two modelling approaches were introduced the first one is a modified form of mbonimpa et al s 2002 model in which the constants are adjusted to take into consideration the variations in liquid limit due to a change in solute concentration a modification term was added to the model for the sake of accuracy in the second approach a new form of solute concentration dependent hydraulic conductivity function was proposed where special attention was given to void ratio and adaptive liquid limit as effective parameters the results revealed that hydraulic conductivity predictions could be erroneous if the influence of solute concentrations in permeating fluid is ignored an error analysis was conducted to examine the models applicability and deviations a blind independent set of data including 132 data points was also used to verify models on the other hand both newly proposed models could predict the hydraulic conductivity for a variety of soils salt species and concentrations well therefore the proposed modelling approaches are somehow unique by considering the salinity of the pore fluid in addition to deionized water more importantly both models are comprised of easy to measure parameters with clear physics based implications keywords hydraulic conductivity pore fluid salinity bentonite analytical modelling liquid limit validation 1 introduction clayey soils are extensively used in landfills as isolation liners because their low hydraulic conductivity leads to a low flux of leachate and less contamination of ground water arch 1998 bezzar et al 2010 haug and wong 1992 park et al 2006 bentonite is one of the most prominent commercial clays which is abundant in montmorillonite or smectite type of clay mineral therefore it is used to improve the restriction ability of isolation liners against solute transport previous studies have revealed that if the bentonite fraction ratio increases the hydraulic conductivity is suppressed and hence the restriction ability is significantly improved mishra et al 2006 mishra et al 2009 park et al 2006 sivapullaiah et al 2000 zhang and wang 2019 high exchange cation capacity large surface area small particle size and high liquid and plastic limits are reasons for better performance of montmorillonite minerals in bentonite based isolation liners in landfills gleason et al 1997 mesri and olson 1971 petrov and rowe 1997 montmorillonite is a chemically weathered clay mineral that is formed from the alteration and deposition of volcanic ashes mitchell and soga 2005 bentonite is mostly composed of montmorillonite minerals which experience extreme swelling when interacting with surrounding water due to the formation of a thick diffuse double layer therefore the percentage of bentonite fraction in a soil not only reduces the flow network for free water and hydraulic conductivity but also considerably affects the conductivity as a function of the void ratio upon first saturation madsen and müller vonmoos 1989 sadeghi and alipanahi 2020 kolahdooz et al 2020 sivapullaiah et al 2000 the swelling capacity of clay minerals depends on their physico chemico origins and it controls the hydraulic conductivity as well mitchell and soga 2005 however exposure to saline environments results in the diffusion of salt to the clay particle surface and the shrinkage of the diffuse double layer di maio 1996 accordingly a significant microstructural evolution occurs and is reflected in the enlargement of macroporosity which mainly governs the flow characteristics sadeghi and nasiri 2021 consequently a rise in the hydraulic conductivity of such active soils is expected because of the presence of soluble species in saline environments such as leachate of landfills it should be noted that the formulation derived in this study is purely based on two monovalent inorganic nacl and kcl solutions therefore it may not be comprehensive enough to take into account all the solute soil interactions landfill leachate for example comprises a variety of soluble contaminations including other salt species as well as more complex organic contaminations however the proposed models can be refined in the future once sufficient experimental data for more realistic soluble contaminations are available other factors such as the type of salt species and cation charge can also alter the diffuse double layer thickness and flow properties madsen and müller vonmoos 1989 quirk and schofield 1955 recent studies confirm the impact of environmental pollution on increasing salinity in fresh water taghipour et al 2021 additionally there is evidence of high levels of solute concentrations in the pore fluid of naturally occurring soil strata as in the case of soil deposits in the vicinity of the gulf of oman see e g sadeghi et al 2019 although a considerable number of studies have focused on the experimental evaluation of saturated hydraulic conductivity of clayey soils subjected to various saline solutions much less attention has been given to the analytical modelling of this phenomenon there are almost no models in the literature that were specifically developed to consider the solute dependency of saturated hydraulic conductivity for a relatively wide range of soil types salt species and concentration levels because both the darcyian and chemico osmosis flow types are directly influenced by the hydraulic conductivity bazargan et al 2015 it is inevitable that a flexible conductivity model that can be readily adapted to certain solute concentrations for more reliable modelling of contamination transport through clay liners will be developed hedayati azar and sadeghi 2021 therefore this study aims to develop semi empirical models for predicting the salinity dependent saturated hydraulic conductivity of active clays based on the existing experimental results for the two monovalent inorganic salts of nacl and kcl 2 advancement in analytical modelling of hydraulic conductivity before introducing the framework of the new models a brief literature survey presents the historical advances in the analytical modelling of saturated hydraulic conductivity various empirical models have been developed for saturated hydraulic conductivity based on experimental test results it is well understood that hydraulic conductivity is a function of grain size distribution porosity specific surface temperature pore fluid density and viscosity consistency limits defined for plastic soils and specific gravity of solid particles moreover results can be significantly influenced by laboratory testing procedures such as rigid or flexible wall types of permeameter saturation methods as well as in situ evaluation of the hydraulic conductivity function liu et al 2015 considering the fact that different parameters of soils have been taken into account for the analytical modelling of hydraulic conductivity all the proposed models can be divided into two broad groups for plastic and non plastic soils chapuis 2012 the first category of hydraulic conductivity models is related to non plastic or coarse grained soils one of the pioneering efforts in this regard was made independently by kozeny kozeny 1927 and carman carman 1937 carman 1939 several forms of this modelling framework have been presented one of the most common forms was proposed by wyllie and gardner 1958a wyllie and gardner 1958b 1 k sat m s c g μ w ρ w e 3 s s 2 g s 2 1 e where k sat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity m s c is the porous space geometry constant g is the gravitational constant m s2 μ w is the dynamic viscosity of water pa s ρ w is the density of water kg m3 s s is the specific surface of the soil m2 kg g s ρ s ρ w is the specific gravity of solid particles ρ s is the density of solid particles kg m3 and e represents the void ratio mbonimpa et al 2002 this model primarily proposed for sandy soils lambe and whitman 1991 taylor 1948 correlates k sat with the e 3 1 e function the kozeny carman model formed the basis of several hydraulic conductivity models such as the model developed by chapuis and aubertin 2003 for both plastic and non plastic soils according to eq 1 the specific surface also needs to be known although it is not commonly reported in the laboratory results as special experiments are required consequently alternative models were developed based on other parameters that can be determined much easier shahabi et al 1984 and mbonimpa et al 2002 proposed a model based on c u uniformity coefficient and d 10 diameter of 10 of the particles finer than this size nevertheless chapuis 2004 considered just d 10 as the effective component alternatively other forms of predictive models have been developed for plastic soils these models incorporate the most influential parameters of natural plastic soils into the modelling framework these parameters include liquid limit plastic limit plasticity index the void ratio at the liquid limit and the portion of clay minerals dolinar 2009 nagaraj et al 1993 nishida and nakagawa 1969 prakash and sridharan 2002 sivapullaiah et al 2000 sridharan and nagaraj 2005 furthermore the specific surface was indirectly embedded in some of these models through empirical correlations to cope with the limitations of its direct measurement of chapuis and aubertin 2003 dolinar 2009 one of the promising models of the second category is a modified form of the kozeny carman model proposed by mbonimpa et al 2002 for natural plastic soils according to this model the saturated hydraulic conductivity of plastic soils is correlated with the e 3 x 1 e function where x is dependent on w l as follows 2 k sat cm s c p γ w μ w e 3 x 1 e 1 ρ s 2 w l 2 χ 3 x 7 7 w l 0 15 3 where c p 5 6 g2 m4 is the porous space geometry constant for plastic soils and χ 1 5 and w l are the liquid limit mbonimpa et al 2002 a comprehensive study was conducted by chapuis 2012 to compare the performance of several models in predicting the saturated hydraulic conductivity of plastic soils the results revealed that the most accurate predictions were made by the mbonimpa et al s 2002 model it was shown that the values of log k predicted k measured for the predictions made by this model lie within the lower and upper bounds of 1 to 1 respectively 3 new semi empirical models considering the pore fluid solute concentration according to the brief survey conducted in the previous section most of the current modelling frameworks simply ignore the existence of pore fluid salinity both from a natural agent or an artificially induced one consequently the main goal of this study is to address this shortcoming through the introduction of two empirical models the first model is a modified form of the mbonimpa et al 2002 model for active soils while the second is a genuinely new solute dependent hydraulic conductivity model that takes into account both the liquid limit and the void ratio as the most significant variables governing flow processes meanwhile a relatively comprehensive database from the current literature comprised of laboratory results for deionized water and saline solutions as pore fluid permeating through active clays was adopted for this study details of the selected database including the types of soils solutes and the number of data points from each research article are presented in table 1 according to these data a total of 842 data points from 9 research articles were used it was found that 374 points of this database are relevant to saline pore fluid and the rest of the data were measured in exposure to deionized water the 95 of void ratios in this database range from 0 55 to 4 45 and the 95 of liquid limits range from 35 to 560 furthermore a complementary set of data was required to capture the dependency of the liquid limit on solute concentration for reliable modelling of hydraulic conductivity as a result 92 laboratory measured data points were retrieved from 9 related research articles details of the complementary dataset are summarized in table 2 3 1 model 1 the original model of mbonimpa et al 2002 was employed for the development of the first solute dependent model because this model was proven to be in better agreement with the experimental results of deionized water compared to other hydraulic conductivity models for plastic soils chapuis 2012 mbonimpa et al 2002 the modifications were incorporated via a stepwise procedure first the value of x in eq 2 should be specified for soils containing bentonite as it is the most active and sensitive commercial clay to the pore fluid chemistry and is also used in this study second as far as the influence of salinity on the hydraulic conductivity is concerned the liquid limit w l should be adjusted to consider the effect of solute concentration it also needs to be mentioned that the influence of solute concentration on water density and viscosity is ignored in this study third the c p and χ variables of eq 2 should be modified based on the existing experimental results table 1 finally a modification term will be introduced to improve the model accuracy in the final step all constants will be modified to reach the best coefficient of determination the four modification steps are explained in more detail below 3 1 1 first step finding x it can be inferred from eq 2 that relative hydraulic conductivity values are proportional to the relative void ratio functions at corresponding states according to eq 4 if the liquid limit and solid density are constant for a single type of soil mbonimpa et al 2002 4 k 1 k 2 e 1 3 x e 2 3 x 1 e 2 1 e 1 according to eq 4 the x value can be found if e 1 e 2 and k 1 k 2 are known for a data set on the other hand it seems certain that the liquid limit of soils containing bentonite changes with solute concentration as a result data points of saline pore fluid cannot be used to find the best representative value of x if eq 4 is used hence the measured hydraulic conductivity values of active soils exposed to deionized water are only used in regression analysis in order to find the x values e 0 and k 0 are chosen as the reference void ratio and hydraulic conductivity for each set of data with a constant liquid limit and solid density the corresponding x value can be determined by correlating the k 1 e k 0 1 e 0 function with the e e 0 ratio these results are depicted in fig 1 against the liquid limit mbonimpa et al 2002 suggested that a power law in the form of eq 3 best represents the variations in 3 x with w l as expressed in eq 5 for the database in this study the best fit curve and best constant value line are shown in fig 1 as well the suggested best fit curve for the data points is expressed as follows 5 3 x 9346 w l 2 365 3 894 r 2 0 033 despite the suggestion of mbonimpa et al 2002 the results in fig 1 may not strongly support this trend of variations for active clayey soils due to the very low coefficient of determination obtained consequently an alternative constant function was suggested for the sake of simplicity in this study fig 1 in order to find the best constant value of x the k 1 e k 0 1 e 0 function is correlated with the e e 0 ratio as shown in fig 2 the best fit trend for all the data points of deionized water according to the results of fig 2 gives a constant value of 3 358 for the x 3 function therefore eq 4 can be expressed as follows 6 k 1 k 2 e 1 e 2 3 385 1 e 2 1 e 1 r 2 0 673 3 1 2 second step correlating liquid limit with solute concentration as can be inferred from the literature reviewed in the first two sections the liquid limit is one of the key parameters for predicting the hydraulic conductivity of active soils the liquid limit is also strongly influenced by the chemistry of the interactive fluid with the clay minerals since a shrinkage in the thickness of the diffuse double layer occurs as a consequence of the enhancement in pore fluid salinity sadeghi and nasiri 2021 the macroscopic outcome is a reduction in the liquid limit for elevated salinity levels compared with deionized water due to a reduction in inter particle repulsive forces arising from the shrinkage of the diffuse double layer arasan and yetimoglu 2008 mishra et al 2009 park et al 2006 warkentin 1961 previous experimental studies have also confirmed that the rate of reduction in the liquid limit with pore fluid salinity is higher at lower solute concentrations and the rate decreases significantly at higher concentrations gleason et al 1997 mishra et al 2009 petrov and rowe 1997 rout and singh 2020 taking all these experimentally proven facts into consideration one may suggest eq 7 expresses the dependency of the liquid limit on solute concentration 7 w lc w l c w l 0 r ln 1 c where c is the solute concentration mol m3 w l c or w lc is the liquid limit of soil if the solute concentration of pore fluid is equal to c w l0 is the reference liquid limit for deionized water and r is the reduction rate of the liquid limit the database of the liquid limit presented in table 2 is used to find the reduction rate r in eq 7 the results are shown in fig 3 where an ascending trend describes the variations in r with a rise in the reference liquid limit corresponding to deionized water as it can be seen the reduction rate is not a constant value based on obtained data points the sigmoid function is suggested therefore a multivariate correlation between the reference liquid limit desired solute concentration and the corresponding liquid limit is adopted to modify the hydraulic conductivity model in terms of adaptive plastic characteristics the final form of correlation can be expressed according to eq 8 8 w lc w l c w l 0 a c 1 exp a w w l 0 a 0 a r ln 1 c where a c a w a r and a 0 are constant regression parameters the model parameters can be determined for the laboratory dataset through a multivariate regression analysis therefore the calibrated form of eq 8 is expressed as 9 w lc w l c w l 0 89 460 1 exp 2 595 0 007 w l 0 7 152 ln 1 c r 2 0 973 the high coefficient of determination obtained confirms an excellent agreement between the proposed form of multivariate correlation and the laboratory data points 3 1 3 third step finding χ and c p in order to find c p and χ all data points including deionized and saline water are used the corresponding values of the c p w l 2χ function can be determined according to eq 10 which is derived from eq 2 10 k sat μ w ρ s 2 1 e e 3 385 γ w c p w lc 2 χ the left hand side of eq 10 is calculated for all the experimental results and the calculated data points are plotted for both deionized water and the solution as a function of the liquid limit in fig 4 separately eventually the unknown parameters of c p and 2χ can be found through correlating the calculated values of k sat μ w ρ s 2 1 e e 3 385 γ w with the corresponding values of w l based on eq 10 it can be inferred from the results of fig 4 that a power function may represent the observed trends accordingly the outcome of the regression analysis can be expressed as 11 c p w lc 2 χ 1 711 w lc 2 679 r 2 0 383 3 1 4 forth step introducing a modification term fig 5 shows the comparison between k predicted and k measured where there is a deviation between the measured values and predicted values according to the results the amounts of predicted hydraulic conductivity are lower for the higher measured values and vice versa for the lower range of measured values compared to the ideal identity line it is known that when the void ratio is high or the liquid limit is low the hydraulic conductivity generally tends to be higher and vice versa therefore the effects of the void ratio and the liquid limit are considered independently in the present model in addition another term is needed to make the predictions more accurate and it should be dependent on both the void ratio and liquid limit mbonimpa et al s 2002 original model suggested that the power of the void ratio should be a function of liquid limit but in this study and for this database it did not work very well see section 3 1 1 accordingly the term 2χ could instead be a linear function of the void ratio to consider the interdependency of the liquid limit and the void ratio by using a three variable non linear regression analysis of the log k measured ρ s 2 μ w γ w and log c p e 3 x 1 e w lc a b e results in the following equation 12 k sat cm s 6 992 γ w μ w 1 ρ s 2 e 0 625 1 e 1 w lc 2 039 0 947 e r 2 0 611 the reason for using logarithmic values for the regression analysis is that the error will be uniform over the whole range of hydraulic conductivity the error analysis for this model is presented in section 4 1 3 2 model 2 model 1 was developed based on the existing model from mbonimpa et al 2002 for active clays to take into account the influence of solute concentration on saturated hydraulic conductivity in this section another genuinely new solute dependent hydraulic conductivity model is developed and presented based on the fact that the liquid limit and void ratio are the most important parameters affecting saturated hydraulic conductivity of active soils the new model simply considers them as effective factors the strong dependency of saturated hydraulic conductivity on the void ratio and liquid limit is illustrated in the three dimensional plot of measured data in fig 6 some previous models such as the one proposed by sivapullaiah et al 2000 have used log k sat in preference to k sat a similar approach is also employed in the development of model 2 as expressed in eq 13 13 log k sat c t w lc c ww w lc c we e e c ew w lc c ee e where c t is a constant correlating log k sat to w lc c w w lc c e e e c ew w lc c ee e c ww and c ew are the constants considering the effect of liquid limit and c ee and c we are the constants considering the effect of void ratio as far as log k sat is a negative value c t must be negative as well in addition saturated hydraulic conductivity is reduced by increasing the liquid limit however the reduction of hydraulic conductivity with increasing liquid limit occurs at a reduced rate as confirmed by the data points in fig 6 and this trend eventually reaches a plateau this material behavior in terms of hydraulic conductivity is captured by introducing the term w lc c ww w lc in eq 13 on the other hand by increasing the void ratio the hydraulic conductivity also increases and approaches a plateau as well which is quantified by the term e c ee e a significant trend is revealed in the three dimensional representation of the data in fig 6 the influence of the void ratio on hydraulic conductivity is intercorrelated with the liquid limit and vice versa as a result the terms w lc c we e and e c ew w lc are defined to consider the mutual effects of the void ratio and its dependency on the liquid limit and vice versa afterward the best fit three dimensional surface is found by employing multivariate correlations it should be noted that the dependency of hydraulic conductivity on the solute concentration is implicitly considered in the newly derived correlation for the liquid limit expressed by eq 9 consequently the final mathematical form of model 2 is expressed as follows 14 log k sat m s 10 220 w lc 0 031 e 2 778 w lc e 4 964 w lc 0 008 e r 2 0 632 the dependent terms of w lc c we e and e c ew w lc can be justified physically as well macropores are responsible for the permeability of soils and are influenced by the thickness of the diffuse double layer musso et al 2013 by increasing the plastic behavior in active clays the effect of the diffuse double layer also intensifies which leads to the reduction of macropores this means that by considering the void ratio and liquid limit in two interactive terms the effect of macropores can be considered as well thus increasing the liquid limit lowers the portion of the porous medium that participates in the fluid conduction and vice versa which is shown by the two terms w lc c we e and e c ew w lc 4 discussion two new models were proposed for predicting the saturated hydraulic conductivity of active clays in both the presence and absence of a solute in the pore fluid model 1 was developed based on mbonimpa et al s 2002 original model for deionized water model 2 on the other hand is a novel predictive model that was benchmarked against a relatively large database with the aim to provide a straightforward approach for engineering design the applicability and verification of these models will be examined in the following sections 4 1 error analysis due to the low coefficients of determination it is necessary to conduct an error analysis to identify the sources of error and their distribution to analyze errors k predicted is examined against k measured for both models fig 7 a b and c results for deionized water saline pore fluid and all data for model 1 respectively show a deviation for the predicted values compared with the measured ones nevertheless the deviation is less than the results of fig 5 considering fig 7 a and b there is a greater deviation for the data points of saline pore fluid this deviation suggests that the predicted hydraulic conductivity based on model 1 is less than the measured one when hydraulic conductivity is relatively high fig 8 a b and c also show the deviation for deionized water saline pore fluid and all data for model 2 respectively are similar to model 1 in general it can be concluded that predicted hydraulic conductivities match better with measurements in the lower range of hydraulic conductivity in other words both models cannot predict realistic values when measured values are higher than 10 9m s this discrepancy is a shortcoming of the model and is elaborated and discussed accordingly first of all the effect of liquid limit concentration void ratio solid density and pore fluid properties have been considered in the modelling framework assuming that no variation occurs in the pore fluid and solid density of the system the main focus is put on the void ratio and adjusted liquid limit corresponding to the solute concentration according to the experimental literature an increase of the void ratio or a decrease of the liquid limit results in a rise in hydraulic conductivity but at different rates therefore the model accuracy is assumed to be enhanced by considering some further modifications regarding the void ratio and liquid limit functions fig 9 a and b show log k predicted k measured against the void ratio for models 1 and 2 respectively fig 10 a and b show the variations in log k predicted k measured against the adjusted liquid limit for models 1 and 2 respectively according to the results although a deviation is observed in figs 7 and 8 there is no such deviation for errors in figs 9 and 10 therefore models 1 and 2 are not biased against a specific set of measurements and no systematic deviation can be pointed out by varying the amount of void ratio and liquid limit in other words no further improvement is expected by extra modification of the liquid limit and void ratio functions therefore we should search for other sources of the error responsible for the observed deviations there are several reasons for relatively low coefficients of determination caused by the deviation from measurements for example many unknown parameters affect the hydraulic conductivity of porous media such as pore connectivity the chemical history of the soils katsumi et al 2008 natural fissures heterogeneity grain size distribution disturbance exact mineralogy the type of bentonite mishra et al 2009 measurement methods sadeghi and alipanahi 2020 elapsed time chen et al 2021 surface area chapuis and aubertin 2003 boundary conditions the thickness of the soil sample operational errors effects of coupled phenomena hedayati azar and sadeghi 2021 microstructural characteristics and compaction methodology sadeghi 2016 however it is difficult to consider their effects on the model because there are not enough experimental results for these parameters some of them are extremely difficult to quantify such as pore connectivity and tortuosity furthermore most of these parameters have not been reported in the published experimental reports as a result modelling of hydraulic conductivity becomes very challenging and this is believed to form the fundamental reason behind the deviation after examining the selected database it is recognized that the most extreme errors are related to the data of musso et al 2013 and this could be the result of a specific experimental condition in their study therefore it is expected that less deviation should be observed by eliminating this set of 53 data points fig 11 confirms the enhancement of predictions when the data points from musso et al 2013 are eliminated comparing figs 11 a and 7 and also figs 11 b and 8 shows that eliminating just one data set can significantly improve the prediction ability as the coefficients of determination for models 1 and 2 increase from 0 611 and 0 632 to 0 686 and 0 701 respectively moreover mbonimpa et al s 2002 model also reported a low coefficient of determinations even for deionized water fig 12 shows the comparison between the measured hydraulic conductivities values and the predicted values as can be seen even the widely accepted model of mbonimpa et al 2002 for deionized water shows a deviation for unknown reasons this emphasizes that the error comes from the dataset characteristics and not from the proposed models in particular the deviation is limited for the verification data set reported in table 3 see section 4 3 4 2 evaluations of error ranges fig 13 compares errors considering the frequency of different ranges of log k predicted k measured using eq 2 eq 12 and eq 14 for all 842 data points according to the results of fig 13 a which is related to the case of deionized water an excellent match is observed between the predictions made by the three models therefore none of the models are preferable over the other two if the permeating fluid is specified as deionized the results of fig 13 a also reveal that the values of log k predicted k measured are less than 1 for almost 95 of the data points fig 13 b shows the comparison between these three models for saline pore fluid according to the results model 1 and model 2 made better predictions than the original model of mbonimpa et al 2002 as a result a confident prediction of hydraulic conductivity of clayey soils exposed to saline environments could not be made if the model was not developed to account for the effect of solutions results of fig 13 b show that almost 80 of the predictions made by the mbonimpa et al 2002 model are less than the measured values this is because salt diffusion into clay particles not only reduces the thickness of the diffuse double layer and hence the absorbed pore fluid but also increases the conductivity of soils to free pore fluid on the other hand 61 and 57 of predicted values were less than the measured values for models 1 and 2 respectively implying the relatively better performance of the two new models model 1 predicts that hydraulic conductivities of 61 of data points are less than the measured value and 39 of predicted values are higher than the measured ones this means that the errors are not completely uniform for this model however this difference is less for model 2 importantly the results confirm that for 57 87 and 88 of predictions made by mbonimpa et al s 2002 model model 1 and model 2 respectively the values of log k predicted k measured are between 1 and 1 fig 13 c compares the performance of these three models for all cases including deionized water and saline solutions on the one hand looking into the overall performance of mbonimpa et al s 2002 model reveals that the values of log k predicted k measured are between 1 to 1 for almost 78 of predictions on the other hand the values of log k predicted k measured are between 1 and 1 for 93 of predictions made by model 1 and model 2 these results suggest that in general the most accurate predictions can be made by using models 1 and 2 for the hydraulic conductivity of active soils exposed to both saline and deionized aqueous environments these two models have almost the same performance therefore both models incorporate the influence of pore fluid solute concentrations in the modelling 4 3 verification for the development of the new models in this study 842 data points were used the error analysis and discussion of the models were done using the same data points however verification against a new set of data can prove the applicability of the models much more reliably the models will be verified if the range of error is limited in this regard additional data points from other sources were extracted to examine the performance of models details of an extra 132 data points are presented in table 3 both models ability to predict hydraulic conductivity was examined based on the new set of data points results of k predicted against k measured are reported in fig 14 according to the results the predicted values are pretty close to the measured ones in particular the values of k predicted k measured for model 1 are less than 1 59 and for model 2 are less than 1 47 for the database in table 3 model 1 predicts a saturated hydraulic conductivity of 89 for data points in the ranges of 0 1 to 10 times k measured while 92 of the data points are in this range when using model 2 based on this dataset model 2 produced a better prediction than model 1 moreover this dataset shows much fewer deviations compared with the original database these results show the significance of dataset selection for error analysis consequently it can be concluded that these models are reliable and can present a suitable estimation of the hydraulic conductivity of active clays in a saline environment 5 conclusions saturated hydraulic conductivity of clay liners plays a prominent role in analyzing and designing landfill liners and other types of barriers exposed to solute infiltration due to the fact that a rise in the concentration of solute increases of hydraulic conductivity of active clayey soils therefore the existence of soluble contaminates in leachate results in a higher amount of solute flux and fluid flow in comparison with the case of deionized water as a permeating fluid however none of the current modelling approaches take into consideration this influence on the evolved hydraulic conductivity consequently it is essential to develop new solute dependent modelling frameworks for a more reliable prediction of hydraulic conductivity the proposed modelling approaches were based on a relatively thorough experimental database consisting of 468 data points for deionized water and 374 data points for monovalent inorganic solutes in addition 92 measurements were collected to find the empirical correlation between the liquid limit and concentration next two approaches were employed to develop the permeability functions in the first approach first a procedure was developed to modify the void ratio function second the dependency of the liquid limit on pore fluid chemistry was determined third the related coefficients were modified and finally an interactive term that depends both on the liquid limit and void ratio was added all regression based constants were also modified to reach a higher coefficient of determination the second approach was a newly developed function containing five regression based constants determined for the adopted experimental benchmark the new formulation also takes into account both the void ratio and adjusted liquid limit as key parameters governing the hydraulic conductivity of clayey soils permeated with deionized water or saline aqueous solutions for both models 1 and 2 the void ratio and liquid limit were the main determinants of hydraulic conductivity almost all hydraulic conductivity predictive models including this study use the void ratio as a key parameter because it describes the porosity of soils generally chapuis 2012 furthermore the liquid limit of active clays plays a significant role because it shows the effect of solute concentration and bentonite content on active clays it has been experimentally proven that adding more bentonite and reducing the solute concentration decreases the hydraulic conductivity and increases the liquid limit mishra et al 2009 sivapullaiah et al 2000 the plastic behavior is also enhanced by increasing the thickness of the diffuse double layer which results in the reduction of macropores and hydraulic conductivity consequently fewer portions of the overall porosity participate in the conduction of fluid this remarkable effect is considered by adding the interactive and dependent terms of the void ratio and liquid limit in both models other coefficients and powers were determined by non linear regression analyses the results of comparisons revealed that the mbonimpa et al 2002 model originally developed for deionized water underestimated the hydraulic conductivity of soils exposed to saline environments conversely the other two modelling approaches were able to better capture the trends of hydraulic conductivity for both deionized water and saline solution results also confirmed that the newly introduced solute dependent models are robust in a more reliable simulation of hydraulic conductivity where impure saline solutions or deionized water permeated through the pore structure of active clayey soils it is also noted that the models were benchmarked against a dataset including various types of soils salt species and solute concentrations more importantly all model parameters can be readily obtained through conventional laboratory tests with clear physical meaning it was also revealed that there is a minor deviation from the measured hydraulic conductivities the source of these deviations could be attributed to the many unknown aspects of hydraulic conductivity especially for contaminated soils that still need to be studied and improved however the prediction ability of both models is stronger when the hydraulic conductivity is lower than 10 9 m s nevertheless the predictions are good enough regarding the void ratio liquid limit and solute concentration this was further proven with a blind set of a new database of 132 data points in order to be consistent with the database used for modelling it is proposed to use these models in a bentonite based soil with a void ratio ranging from 0 55 to 4 45 and a liquid limit ranging from 35 to 560 however it should be noted that hydraulic conductivity measurement results are scattered due to many factors including experimental setups and measuring procedures therefore readers should pay attention to the range of variables and the deviation in the data sets used in this paper a list of novel aspects of this study two hydraulic conductivity models considering pore fluid salinity are proposed an empirical formula correlating liquid limit with solute concentration is derived new models are benchmarked against a dataset including 842 laboratory measurements 3d surface correlating conductivity with void ratio and liquid limit is generated all parameters have physical meaning and can be determined by conventional methods verification of models using a blind set of data including 132 data points credit authorship contribution statement aysa hedayati azar

1287,clay liners are widely used as porous membrane barriers to control solute transport and to prevent the leakage of leachate both in horizontal and vertical flow scenarios such as the isolated base and ramps of sanitary landfills despite the primary importance of saturated hydraulic conductivity in a reliable simulation of fluid flow through clay barriers there is no model to predict hydraulic conductivity of clayey soils permeated with saline aqueous solutions because most of the current models were developed for pure water therefore the main motivation behind this study is to derive semi empirical models for simulating the hydraulic conductivity of clayey soils in the presence of arbitrary solute concentrations in addition to deionized water in order to achieve this goal a relatively comprehensive dataset of 842 measured hydraulic conductivities was retrieved from the experimental literature where almost 44 of them are related to certain solute concentrations afterwards two modelling approaches were introduced the first one is a modified form of mbonimpa et al s 2002 model in which the constants are adjusted to take into consideration the variations in liquid limit due to a change in solute concentration a modification term was added to the model for the sake of accuracy in the second approach a new form of solute concentration dependent hydraulic conductivity function was proposed where special attention was given to void ratio and adaptive liquid limit as effective parameters the results revealed that hydraulic conductivity predictions could be erroneous if the influence of solute concentrations in permeating fluid is ignored an error analysis was conducted to examine the models applicability and deviations a blind independent set of data including 132 data points was also used to verify models on the other hand both newly proposed models could predict the hydraulic conductivity for a variety of soils salt species and concentrations well therefore the proposed modelling approaches are somehow unique by considering the salinity of the pore fluid in addition to deionized water more importantly both models are comprised of easy to measure parameters with clear physics based implications keywords hydraulic conductivity pore fluid salinity bentonite analytical modelling liquid limit validation 1 introduction clayey soils are extensively used in landfills as isolation liners because their low hydraulic conductivity leads to a low flux of leachate and less contamination of ground water arch 1998 bezzar et al 2010 haug and wong 1992 park et al 2006 bentonite is one of the most prominent commercial clays which is abundant in montmorillonite or smectite type of clay mineral therefore it is used to improve the restriction ability of isolation liners against solute transport previous studies have revealed that if the bentonite fraction ratio increases the hydraulic conductivity is suppressed and hence the restriction ability is significantly improved mishra et al 2006 mishra et al 2009 park et al 2006 sivapullaiah et al 2000 zhang and wang 2019 high exchange cation capacity large surface area small particle size and high liquid and plastic limits are reasons for better performance of montmorillonite minerals in bentonite based isolation liners in landfills gleason et al 1997 mesri and olson 1971 petrov and rowe 1997 montmorillonite is a chemically weathered clay mineral that is formed from the alteration and deposition of volcanic ashes mitchell and soga 2005 bentonite is mostly composed of montmorillonite minerals which experience extreme swelling when interacting with surrounding water due to the formation of a thick diffuse double layer therefore the percentage of bentonite fraction in a soil not only reduces the flow network for free water and hydraulic conductivity but also considerably affects the conductivity as a function of the void ratio upon first saturation madsen and müller vonmoos 1989 sadeghi and alipanahi 2020 kolahdooz et al 2020 sivapullaiah et al 2000 the swelling capacity of clay minerals depends on their physico chemico origins and it controls the hydraulic conductivity as well mitchell and soga 2005 however exposure to saline environments results in the diffusion of salt to the clay particle surface and the shrinkage of the diffuse double layer di maio 1996 accordingly a significant microstructural evolution occurs and is reflected in the enlargement of macroporosity which mainly governs the flow characteristics sadeghi and nasiri 2021 consequently a rise in the hydraulic conductivity of such active soils is expected because of the presence of soluble species in saline environments such as leachate of landfills it should be noted that the formulation derived in this study is purely based on two monovalent inorganic nacl and kcl solutions therefore it may not be comprehensive enough to take into account all the solute soil interactions landfill leachate for example comprises a variety of soluble contaminations including other salt species as well as more complex organic contaminations however the proposed models can be refined in the future once sufficient experimental data for more realistic soluble contaminations are available other factors such as the type of salt species and cation charge can also alter the diffuse double layer thickness and flow properties madsen and müller vonmoos 1989 quirk and schofield 1955 recent studies confirm the impact of environmental pollution on increasing salinity in fresh water taghipour et al 2021 additionally there is evidence of high levels of solute concentrations in the pore fluid of naturally occurring soil strata as in the case of soil deposits in the vicinity of the gulf of oman see e g sadeghi et al 2019 although a considerable number of studies have focused on the experimental evaluation of saturated hydraulic conductivity of clayey soils subjected to various saline solutions much less attention has been given to the analytical modelling of this phenomenon there are almost no models in the literature that were specifically developed to consider the solute dependency of saturated hydraulic conductivity for a relatively wide range of soil types salt species and concentration levels because both the darcyian and chemico osmosis flow types are directly influenced by the hydraulic conductivity bazargan et al 2015 it is inevitable that a flexible conductivity model that can be readily adapted to certain solute concentrations for more reliable modelling of contamination transport through clay liners will be developed hedayati azar and sadeghi 2021 therefore this study aims to develop semi empirical models for predicting the salinity dependent saturated hydraulic conductivity of active clays based on the existing experimental results for the two monovalent inorganic salts of nacl and kcl 2 advancement in analytical modelling of hydraulic conductivity before introducing the framework of the new models a brief literature survey presents the historical advances in the analytical modelling of saturated hydraulic conductivity various empirical models have been developed for saturated hydraulic conductivity based on experimental test results it is well understood that hydraulic conductivity is a function of grain size distribution porosity specific surface temperature pore fluid density and viscosity consistency limits defined for plastic soils and specific gravity of solid particles moreover results can be significantly influenced by laboratory testing procedures such as rigid or flexible wall types of permeameter saturation methods as well as in situ evaluation of the hydraulic conductivity function liu et al 2015 considering the fact that different parameters of soils have been taken into account for the analytical modelling of hydraulic conductivity all the proposed models can be divided into two broad groups for plastic and non plastic soils chapuis 2012 the first category of hydraulic conductivity models is related to non plastic or coarse grained soils one of the pioneering efforts in this regard was made independently by kozeny kozeny 1927 and carman carman 1937 carman 1939 several forms of this modelling framework have been presented one of the most common forms was proposed by wyllie and gardner 1958a wyllie and gardner 1958b 1 k sat m s c g μ w ρ w e 3 s s 2 g s 2 1 e where k sat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity m s c is the porous space geometry constant g is the gravitational constant m s2 μ w is the dynamic viscosity of water pa s ρ w is the density of water kg m3 s s is the specific surface of the soil m2 kg g s ρ s ρ w is the specific gravity of solid particles ρ s is the density of solid particles kg m3 and e represents the void ratio mbonimpa et al 2002 this model primarily proposed for sandy soils lambe and whitman 1991 taylor 1948 correlates k sat with the e 3 1 e function the kozeny carman model formed the basis of several hydraulic conductivity models such as the model developed by chapuis and aubertin 2003 for both plastic and non plastic soils according to eq 1 the specific surface also needs to be known although it is not commonly reported in the laboratory results as special experiments are required consequently alternative models were developed based on other parameters that can be determined much easier shahabi et al 1984 and mbonimpa et al 2002 proposed a model based on c u uniformity coefficient and d 10 diameter of 10 of the particles finer than this size nevertheless chapuis 2004 considered just d 10 as the effective component alternatively other forms of predictive models have been developed for plastic soils these models incorporate the most influential parameters of natural plastic soils into the modelling framework these parameters include liquid limit plastic limit plasticity index the void ratio at the liquid limit and the portion of clay minerals dolinar 2009 nagaraj et al 1993 nishida and nakagawa 1969 prakash and sridharan 2002 sivapullaiah et al 2000 sridharan and nagaraj 2005 furthermore the specific surface was indirectly embedded in some of these models through empirical correlations to cope with the limitations of its direct measurement of chapuis and aubertin 2003 dolinar 2009 one of the promising models of the second category is a modified form of the kozeny carman model proposed by mbonimpa et al 2002 for natural plastic soils according to this model the saturated hydraulic conductivity of plastic soils is correlated with the e 3 x 1 e function where x is dependent on w l as follows 2 k sat cm s c p γ w μ w e 3 x 1 e 1 ρ s 2 w l 2 χ 3 x 7 7 w l 0 15 3 where c p 5 6 g2 m4 is the porous space geometry constant for plastic soils and χ 1 5 and w l are the liquid limit mbonimpa et al 2002 a comprehensive study was conducted by chapuis 2012 to compare the performance of several models in predicting the saturated hydraulic conductivity of plastic soils the results revealed that the most accurate predictions were made by the mbonimpa et al s 2002 model it was shown that the values of log k predicted k measured for the predictions made by this model lie within the lower and upper bounds of 1 to 1 respectively 3 new semi empirical models considering the pore fluid solute concentration according to the brief survey conducted in the previous section most of the current modelling frameworks simply ignore the existence of pore fluid salinity both from a natural agent or an artificially induced one consequently the main goal of this study is to address this shortcoming through the introduction of two empirical models the first model is a modified form of the mbonimpa et al 2002 model for active soils while the second is a genuinely new solute dependent hydraulic conductivity model that takes into account both the liquid limit and the void ratio as the most significant variables governing flow processes meanwhile a relatively comprehensive database from the current literature comprised of laboratory results for deionized water and saline solutions as pore fluid permeating through active clays was adopted for this study details of the selected database including the types of soils solutes and the number of data points from each research article are presented in table 1 according to these data a total of 842 data points from 9 research articles were used it was found that 374 points of this database are relevant to saline pore fluid and the rest of the data were measured in exposure to deionized water the 95 of void ratios in this database range from 0 55 to 4 45 and the 95 of liquid limits range from 35 to 560 furthermore a complementary set of data was required to capture the dependency of the liquid limit on solute concentration for reliable modelling of hydraulic conductivity as a result 92 laboratory measured data points were retrieved from 9 related research articles details of the complementary dataset are summarized in table 2 3 1 model 1 the original model of mbonimpa et al 2002 was employed for the development of the first solute dependent model because this model was proven to be in better agreement with the experimental results of deionized water compared to other hydraulic conductivity models for plastic soils chapuis 2012 mbonimpa et al 2002 the modifications were incorporated via a stepwise procedure first the value of x in eq 2 should be specified for soils containing bentonite as it is the most active and sensitive commercial clay to the pore fluid chemistry and is also used in this study second as far as the influence of salinity on the hydraulic conductivity is concerned the liquid limit w l should be adjusted to consider the effect of solute concentration it also needs to be mentioned that the influence of solute concentration on water density and viscosity is ignored in this study third the c p and χ variables of eq 2 should be modified based on the existing experimental results table 1 finally a modification term will be introduced to improve the model accuracy in the final step all constants will be modified to reach the best coefficient of determination the four modification steps are explained in more detail below 3 1 1 first step finding x it can be inferred from eq 2 that relative hydraulic conductivity values are proportional to the relative void ratio functions at corresponding states according to eq 4 if the liquid limit and solid density are constant for a single type of soil mbonimpa et al 2002 4 k 1 k 2 e 1 3 x e 2 3 x 1 e 2 1 e 1 according to eq 4 the x value can be found if e 1 e 2 and k 1 k 2 are known for a data set on the other hand it seems certain that the liquid limit of soils containing bentonite changes with solute concentration as a result data points of saline pore fluid cannot be used to find the best representative value of x if eq 4 is used hence the measured hydraulic conductivity values of active soils exposed to deionized water are only used in regression analysis in order to find the x values e 0 and k 0 are chosen as the reference void ratio and hydraulic conductivity for each set of data with a constant liquid limit and solid density the corresponding x value can be determined by correlating the k 1 e k 0 1 e 0 function with the e e 0 ratio these results are depicted in fig 1 against the liquid limit mbonimpa et al 2002 suggested that a power law in the form of eq 3 best represents the variations in 3 x with w l as expressed in eq 5 for the database in this study the best fit curve and best constant value line are shown in fig 1 as well the suggested best fit curve for the data points is expressed as follows 5 3 x 9346 w l 2 365 3 894 r 2 0 033 despite the suggestion of mbonimpa et al 2002 the results in fig 1 may not strongly support this trend of variations for active clayey soils due to the very low coefficient of determination obtained consequently an alternative constant function was suggested for the sake of simplicity in this study fig 1 in order to find the best constant value of x the k 1 e k 0 1 e 0 function is correlated with the e e 0 ratio as shown in fig 2 the best fit trend for all the data points of deionized water according to the results of fig 2 gives a constant value of 3 358 for the x 3 function therefore eq 4 can be expressed as follows 6 k 1 k 2 e 1 e 2 3 385 1 e 2 1 e 1 r 2 0 673 3 1 2 second step correlating liquid limit with solute concentration as can be inferred from the literature reviewed in the first two sections the liquid limit is one of the key parameters for predicting the hydraulic conductivity of active soils the liquid limit is also strongly influenced by the chemistry of the interactive fluid with the clay minerals since a shrinkage in the thickness of the diffuse double layer occurs as a consequence of the enhancement in pore fluid salinity sadeghi and nasiri 2021 the macroscopic outcome is a reduction in the liquid limit for elevated salinity levels compared with deionized water due to a reduction in inter particle repulsive forces arising from the shrinkage of the diffuse double layer arasan and yetimoglu 2008 mishra et al 2009 park et al 2006 warkentin 1961 previous experimental studies have also confirmed that the rate of reduction in the liquid limit with pore fluid salinity is higher at lower solute concentrations and the rate decreases significantly at higher concentrations gleason et al 1997 mishra et al 2009 petrov and rowe 1997 rout and singh 2020 taking all these experimentally proven facts into consideration one may suggest eq 7 expresses the dependency of the liquid limit on solute concentration 7 w lc w l c w l 0 r ln 1 c where c is the solute concentration mol m3 w l c or w lc is the liquid limit of soil if the solute concentration of pore fluid is equal to c w l0 is the reference liquid limit for deionized water and r is the reduction rate of the liquid limit the database of the liquid limit presented in table 2 is used to find the reduction rate r in eq 7 the results are shown in fig 3 where an ascending trend describes the variations in r with a rise in the reference liquid limit corresponding to deionized water as it can be seen the reduction rate is not a constant value based on obtained data points the sigmoid function is suggested therefore a multivariate correlation between the reference liquid limit desired solute concentration and the corresponding liquid limit is adopted to modify the hydraulic conductivity model in terms of adaptive plastic characteristics the final form of correlation can be expressed according to eq 8 8 w lc w l c w l 0 a c 1 exp a w w l 0 a 0 a r ln 1 c where a c a w a r and a 0 are constant regression parameters the model parameters can be determined for the laboratory dataset through a multivariate regression analysis therefore the calibrated form of eq 8 is expressed as 9 w lc w l c w l 0 89 460 1 exp 2 595 0 007 w l 0 7 152 ln 1 c r 2 0 973 the high coefficient of determination obtained confirms an excellent agreement between the proposed form of multivariate correlation and the laboratory data points 3 1 3 third step finding χ and c p in order to find c p and χ all data points including deionized and saline water are used the corresponding values of the c p w l 2χ function can be determined according to eq 10 which is derived from eq 2 10 k sat μ w ρ s 2 1 e e 3 385 γ w c p w lc 2 χ the left hand side of eq 10 is calculated for all the experimental results and the calculated data points are plotted for both deionized water and the solution as a function of the liquid limit in fig 4 separately eventually the unknown parameters of c p and 2χ can be found through correlating the calculated values of k sat μ w ρ s 2 1 e e 3 385 γ w with the corresponding values of w l based on eq 10 it can be inferred from the results of fig 4 that a power function may represent the observed trends accordingly the outcome of the regression analysis can be expressed as 11 c p w lc 2 χ 1 711 w lc 2 679 r 2 0 383 3 1 4 forth step introducing a modification term fig 5 shows the comparison between k predicted and k measured where there is a deviation between the measured values and predicted values according to the results the amounts of predicted hydraulic conductivity are lower for the higher measured values and vice versa for the lower range of measured values compared to the ideal identity line it is known that when the void ratio is high or the liquid limit is low the hydraulic conductivity generally tends to be higher and vice versa therefore the effects of the void ratio and the liquid limit are considered independently in the present model in addition another term is needed to make the predictions more accurate and it should be dependent on both the void ratio and liquid limit mbonimpa et al s 2002 original model suggested that the power of the void ratio should be a function of liquid limit but in this study and for this database it did not work very well see section 3 1 1 accordingly the term 2χ could instead be a linear function of the void ratio to consider the interdependency of the liquid limit and the void ratio by using a three variable non linear regression analysis of the log k measured ρ s 2 μ w γ w and log c p e 3 x 1 e w lc a b e results in the following equation 12 k sat cm s 6 992 γ w μ w 1 ρ s 2 e 0 625 1 e 1 w lc 2 039 0 947 e r 2 0 611 the reason for using logarithmic values for the regression analysis is that the error will be uniform over the whole range of hydraulic conductivity the error analysis for this model is presented in section 4 1 3 2 model 2 model 1 was developed based on the existing model from mbonimpa et al 2002 for active clays to take into account the influence of solute concentration on saturated hydraulic conductivity in this section another genuinely new solute dependent hydraulic conductivity model is developed and presented based on the fact that the liquid limit and void ratio are the most important parameters affecting saturated hydraulic conductivity of active soils the new model simply considers them as effective factors the strong dependency of saturated hydraulic conductivity on the void ratio and liquid limit is illustrated in the three dimensional plot of measured data in fig 6 some previous models such as the one proposed by sivapullaiah et al 2000 have used log k sat in preference to k sat a similar approach is also employed in the development of model 2 as expressed in eq 13 13 log k sat c t w lc c ww w lc c we e e c ew w lc c ee e where c t is a constant correlating log k sat to w lc c w w lc c e e e c ew w lc c ee e c ww and c ew are the constants considering the effect of liquid limit and c ee and c we are the constants considering the effect of void ratio as far as log k sat is a negative value c t must be negative as well in addition saturated hydraulic conductivity is reduced by increasing the liquid limit however the reduction of hydraulic conductivity with increasing liquid limit occurs at a reduced rate as confirmed by the data points in fig 6 and this trend eventually reaches a plateau this material behavior in terms of hydraulic conductivity is captured by introducing the term w lc c ww w lc in eq 13 on the other hand by increasing the void ratio the hydraulic conductivity also increases and approaches a plateau as well which is quantified by the term e c ee e a significant trend is revealed in the three dimensional representation of the data in fig 6 the influence of the void ratio on hydraulic conductivity is intercorrelated with the liquid limit and vice versa as a result the terms w lc c we e and e c ew w lc are defined to consider the mutual effects of the void ratio and its dependency on the liquid limit and vice versa afterward the best fit three dimensional surface is found by employing multivariate correlations it should be noted that the dependency of hydraulic conductivity on the solute concentration is implicitly considered in the newly derived correlation for the liquid limit expressed by eq 9 consequently the final mathematical form of model 2 is expressed as follows 14 log k sat m s 10 220 w lc 0 031 e 2 778 w lc e 4 964 w lc 0 008 e r 2 0 632 the dependent terms of w lc c we e and e c ew w lc can be justified physically as well macropores are responsible for the permeability of soils and are influenced by the thickness of the diffuse double layer musso et al 2013 by increasing the plastic behavior in active clays the effect of the diffuse double layer also intensifies which leads to the reduction of macropores this means that by considering the void ratio and liquid limit in two interactive terms the effect of macropores can be considered as well thus increasing the liquid limit lowers the portion of the porous medium that participates in the fluid conduction and vice versa which is shown by the two terms w lc c we e and e c ew w lc 4 discussion two new models were proposed for predicting the saturated hydraulic conductivity of active clays in both the presence and absence of a solute in the pore fluid model 1 was developed based on mbonimpa et al s 2002 original model for deionized water model 2 on the other hand is a novel predictive model that was benchmarked against a relatively large database with the aim to provide a straightforward approach for engineering design the applicability and verification of these models will be examined in the following sections 4 1 error analysis due to the low coefficients of determination it is necessary to conduct an error analysis to identify the sources of error and their distribution to analyze errors k predicted is examined against k measured for both models fig 7 a b and c results for deionized water saline pore fluid and all data for model 1 respectively show a deviation for the predicted values compared with the measured ones nevertheless the deviation is less than the results of fig 5 considering fig 7 a and b there is a greater deviation for the data points of saline pore fluid this deviation suggests that the predicted hydraulic conductivity based on model 1 is less than the measured one when hydraulic conductivity is relatively high fig 8 a b and c also show the deviation for deionized water saline pore fluid and all data for model 2 respectively are similar to model 1 in general it can be concluded that predicted hydraulic conductivities match better with measurements in the lower range of hydraulic conductivity in other words both models cannot predict realistic values when measured values are higher than 10 9m s this discrepancy is a shortcoming of the model and is elaborated and discussed accordingly first of all the effect of liquid limit concentration void ratio solid density and pore fluid properties have been considered in the modelling framework assuming that no variation occurs in the pore fluid and solid density of the system the main focus is put on the void ratio and adjusted liquid limit corresponding to the solute concentration according to the experimental literature an increase of the void ratio or a decrease of the liquid limit results in a rise in hydraulic conductivity but at different rates therefore the model accuracy is assumed to be enhanced by considering some further modifications regarding the void ratio and liquid limit functions fig 9 a and b show log k predicted k measured against the void ratio for models 1 and 2 respectively fig 10 a and b show the variations in log k predicted k measured against the adjusted liquid limit for models 1 and 2 respectively according to the results although a deviation is observed in figs 7 and 8 there is no such deviation for errors in figs 9 and 10 therefore models 1 and 2 are not biased against a specific set of measurements and no systematic deviation can be pointed out by varying the amount of void ratio and liquid limit in other words no further improvement is expected by extra modification of the liquid limit and void ratio functions therefore we should search for other sources of the error responsible for the observed deviations there are several reasons for relatively low coefficients of determination caused by the deviation from measurements for example many unknown parameters affect the hydraulic conductivity of porous media such as pore connectivity the chemical history of the soils katsumi et al 2008 natural fissures heterogeneity grain size distribution disturbance exact mineralogy the type of bentonite mishra et al 2009 measurement methods sadeghi and alipanahi 2020 elapsed time chen et al 2021 surface area chapuis and aubertin 2003 boundary conditions the thickness of the soil sample operational errors effects of coupled phenomena hedayati azar and sadeghi 2021 microstructural characteristics and compaction methodology sadeghi 2016 however it is difficult to consider their effects on the model because there are not enough experimental results for these parameters some of them are extremely difficult to quantify such as pore connectivity and tortuosity furthermore most of these parameters have not been reported in the published experimental reports as a result modelling of hydraulic conductivity becomes very challenging and this is believed to form the fundamental reason behind the deviation after examining the selected database it is recognized that the most extreme errors are related to the data of musso et al 2013 and this could be the result of a specific experimental condition in their study therefore it is expected that less deviation should be observed by eliminating this set of 53 data points fig 11 confirms the enhancement of predictions when the data points from musso et al 2013 are eliminated comparing figs 11 a and 7 and also figs 11 b and 8 shows that eliminating just one data set can significantly improve the prediction ability as the coefficients of determination for models 1 and 2 increase from 0 611 and 0 632 to 0 686 and 0 701 respectively moreover mbonimpa et al s 2002 model also reported a low coefficient of determinations even for deionized water fig 12 shows the comparison between the measured hydraulic conductivities values and the predicted values as can be seen even the widely accepted model of mbonimpa et al 2002 for deionized water shows a deviation for unknown reasons this emphasizes that the error comes from the dataset characteristics and not from the proposed models in particular the deviation is limited for the verification data set reported in table 3 see section 4 3 4 2 evaluations of error ranges fig 13 compares errors considering the frequency of different ranges of log k predicted k measured using eq 2 eq 12 and eq 14 for all 842 data points according to the results of fig 13 a which is related to the case of deionized water an excellent match is observed between the predictions made by the three models therefore none of the models are preferable over the other two if the permeating fluid is specified as deionized the results of fig 13 a also reveal that the values of log k predicted k measured are less than 1 for almost 95 of the data points fig 13 b shows the comparison between these three models for saline pore fluid according to the results model 1 and model 2 made better predictions than the original model of mbonimpa et al 2002 as a result a confident prediction of hydraulic conductivity of clayey soils exposed to saline environments could not be made if the model was not developed to account for the effect of solutions results of fig 13 b show that almost 80 of the predictions made by the mbonimpa et al 2002 model are less than the measured values this is because salt diffusion into clay particles not only reduces the thickness of the diffuse double layer and hence the absorbed pore fluid but also increases the conductivity of soils to free pore fluid on the other hand 61 and 57 of predicted values were less than the measured values for models 1 and 2 respectively implying the relatively better performance of the two new models model 1 predicts that hydraulic conductivities of 61 of data points are less than the measured value and 39 of predicted values are higher than the measured ones this means that the errors are not completely uniform for this model however this difference is less for model 2 importantly the results confirm that for 57 87 and 88 of predictions made by mbonimpa et al s 2002 model model 1 and model 2 respectively the values of log k predicted k measured are between 1 and 1 fig 13 c compares the performance of these three models for all cases including deionized water and saline solutions on the one hand looking into the overall performance of mbonimpa et al s 2002 model reveals that the values of log k predicted k measured are between 1 to 1 for almost 78 of predictions on the other hand the values of log k predicted k measured are between 1 and 1 for 93 of predictions made by model 1 and model 2 these results suggest that in general the most accurate predictions can be made by using models 1 and 2 for the hydraulic conductivity of active soils exposed to both saline and deionized aqueous environments these two models have almost the same performance therefore both models incorporate the influence of pore fluid solute concentrations in the modelling 4 3 verification for the development of the new models in this study 842 data points were used the error analysis and discussion of the models were done using the same data points however verification against a new set of data can prove the applicability of the models much more reliably the models will be verified if the range of error is limited in this regard additional data points from other sources were extracted to examine the performance of models details of an extra 132 data points are presented in table 3 both models ability to predict hydraulic conductivity was examined based on the new set of data points results of k predicted against k measured are reported in fig 14 according to the results the predicted values are pretty close to the measured ones in particular the values of k predicted k measured for model 1 are less than 1 59 and for model 2 are less than 1 47 for the database in table 3 model 1 predicts a saturated hydraulic conductivity of 89 for data points in the ranges of 0 1 to 10 times k measured while 92 of the data points are in this range when using model 2 based on this dataset model 2 produced a better prediction than model 1 moreover this dataset shows much fewer deviations compared with the original database these results show the significance of dataset selection for error analysis consequently it can be concluded that these models are reliable and can present a suitable estimation of the hydraulic conductivity of active clays in a saline environment 5 conclusions saturated hydraulic conductivity of clay liners plays a prominent role in analyzing and designing landfill liners and other types of barriers exposed to solute infiltration due to the fact that a rise in the concentration of solute increases of hydraulic conductivity of active clayey soils therefore the existence of soluble contaminates in leachate results in a higher amount of solute flux and fluid flow in comparison with the case of deionized water as a permeating fluid however none of the current modelling approaches take into consideration this influence on the evolved hydraulic conductivity consequently it is essential to develop new solute dependent modelling frameworks for a more reliable prediction of hydraulic conductivity the proposed modelling approaches were based on a relatively thorough experimental database consisting of 468 data points for deionized water and 374 data points for monovalent inorganic solutes in addition 92 measurements were collected to find the empirical correlation between the liquid limit and concentration next two approaches were employed to develop the permeability functions in the first approach first a procedure was developed to modify the void ratio function second the dependency of the liquid limit on pore fluid chemistry was determined third the related coefficients were modified and finally an interactive term that depends both on the liquid limit and void ratio was added all regression based constants were also modified to reach a higher coefficient of determination the second approach was a newly developed function containing five regression based constants determined for the adopted experimental benchmark the new formulation also takes into account both the void ratio and adjusted liquid limit as key parameters governing the hydraulic conductivity of clayey soils permeated with deionized water or saline aqueous solutions for both models 1 and 2 the void ratio and liquid limit were the main determinants of hydraulic conductivity almost all hydraulic conductivity predictive models including this study use the void ratio as a key parameter because it describes the porosity of soils generally chapuis 2012 furthermore the liquid limit of active clays plays a significant role because it shows the effect of solute concentration and bentonite content on active clays it has been experimentally proven that adding more bentonite and reducing the solute concentration decreases the hydraulic conductivity and increases the liquid limit mishra et al 2009 sivapullaiah et al 2000 the plastic behavior is also enhanced by increasing the thickness of the diffuse double layer which results in the reduction of macropores and hydraulic conductivity consequently fewer portions of the overall porosity participate in the conduction of fluid this remarkable effect is considered by adding the interactive and dependent terms of the void ratio and liquid limit in both models other coefficients and powers were determined by non linear regression analyses the results of comparisons revealed that the mbonimpa et al 2002 model originally developed for deionized water underestimated the hydraulic conductivity of soils exposed to saline environments conversely the other two modelling approaches were able to better capture the trends of hydraulic conductivity for both deionized water and saline solution results also confirmed that the newly introduced solute dependent models are robust in a more reliable simulation of hydraulic conductivity where impure saline solutions or deionized water permeated through the pore structure of active clayey soils it is also noted that the models were benchmarked against a dataset including various types of soils salt species and solute concentrations more importantly all model parameters can be readily obtained through conventional laboratory tests with clear physical meaning it was also revealed that there is a minor deviation from the measured hydraulic conductivities the source of these deviations could be attributed to the many unknown aspects of hydraulic conductivity especially for contaminated soils that still need to be studied and improved however the prediction ability of both models is stronger when the hydraulic conductivity is lower than 10 9 m s nevertheless the predictions are good enough regarding the void ratio liquid limit and solute concentration this was further proven with a blind set of a new database of 132 data points in order to be consistent with the database used for modelling it is proposed to use these models in a bentonite based soil with a void ratio ranging from 0 55 to 4 45 and a liquid limit ranging from 35 to 560 however it should be noted that hydraulic conductivity measurement results are scattered due to many factors including experimental setups and measuring procedures therefore readers should pay attention to the range of variables and the deviation in the data sets used in this paper a list of novel aspects of this study two hydraulic conductivity models considering pore fluid salinity are proposed an empirical formula correlating liquid limit with solute concentration is derived new models are benchmarked against a dataset including 842 laboratory measurements 3d surface correlating conductivity with void ratio and liquid limit is generated all parameters have physical meaning and can be determined by conventional methods verification of models using a blind set of data including 132 data points credit authorship contribution statement aysa hedayati azar

1288,we investigate denitrification in a ferric iron containing fractured micritic limestone aquifer triassic upper muschelkalk in south west germany by numerical simulations low porosity values average value of 1 partly small pore sizes of the rock matrix 0 1 μm and thus potential absence of microbial activity in the rock matrix suggest that denitrification is taking place solely in the fracture a key question is whether the nitrate reduction derived from groundwater observations at 25 locations in the study area can be explained by a model that restricts microbial denitrification to the fractures a travel time based reactive transport model is developed to efficiently simulate long term nitrate reduction on the catchment scale the model employs a 2 d numerical reaction model describing the fracture rock matrix system and parametric travel time distributions the role of i biotic and abiotic iron oxidation ii the type and amount of iron bearing minerals and iii mass transfer between matrix and fracture are investigated the simulations show that pyrite and siderite used as surrogate for iron carbonates together as a source of electron donors provide enough reduction potential to decrease the nitrate concentrations as observed in the field this confirms the hypothesis that diffusion controlled mass transfer of electron donors from the matrix to the fracture is sufficient to establish considerable denitrification in the fracture uncertainty in modelled concentrations is demonstrated as a result of both the geochemical aquifer properties and the unknown shape of travel time distributions keywords diffusion nitrate reduction travel time fractured rock aquifer reactive transport modelling 1 introduction about 25 of the global population depends on groundwater supply from fractured carbonate aquifers in some countries such aquifers provide 50 of the drinking water chen et al 2017 carbonate rocks occupy about 12 of the surface worldwide and 35 in europe bakalowicz 2005 vías et al 2006 the substantial increase of fertilizer use and manure produced in agriculture which started about 100 years ago puckett et al 2011 strebel et al 1989 has led

2011 refsgaard et al 2014 nitrate reduction includes redox reactions and is strongly affected by fracture matrix interactions rivett et al 2008 nitrate and other solutes diffuse from the fractures into the rock matrix and vice versa e g neretnieks 1980 neuman 2005 if the size of the pores in the rock matrix does not permit microbial growth as suggested for some jurassic and carboniferous limestones and cretaceous chalk deposits johnson et al 1998 whitelaw and edwards 1980 redox reactions are limited to the rock surface of the fractures in this case nitrate reduction is controlled by diffusive flux of the electron donor towards the fracture pyrite and other fe ii bearing minerals are known to be important electron donors in redox processes leading to oxygen reduction and denitrification the importance of the abiotic oxidation of iron bearing minerals for redox evolution in fractured crystalline rocks was elucidated by sidborn and neretnieks 2007 however abiotic oxidation of such minerals by no3 alone is considered insufficient appelo and postma 2005 other iron bearing minerals such as siderite ankerite or fe2 containing saddle dolomites can also act as an electron donor source and thus often mixtures of fe2 bearing minerals must be considered reactive transport of pollutants through the fractured media has been studied by help of models since the 1980s when analytical solutions were developed to quantify the effect of the matrix diffusion during advective transport of radionuclides in single fractures for potential nuclear waste repositories grisak and pickens 1981 neretnieks 1980 tang et al 1981 later such solutions were expanded to include systems of fractures and first order decay sudicky and frind 1982 1984 sidborn and neretnieks 2004 2007

analytical solutions for transport in fractured shales was derived by huang and goltz 2015 numerical models allow to account for complex multi component reaction systems spatial or temporal changes in parameters and boundary conditions and multiple reactions pathways taking place instantaneously three major concepts have been developed for the description of fractured systems in numerical models

studies discrete fracture network models may also account for fracture properties frampton et al 2019 fracture matrix mass transfer and heterogeneity of hydraulic properties cvetkovic et al 2016 different algorithms were applied in order to overcome the uncertainty in topology connectivity and other statistical parameters of fractures e g lavoine et al 2020 a review on the discrete fracture networks was presented in lei et al 2017 multi dimensional spatially distributed models though offering intuitively an explicit idea of the modelled area face several limitations which are mainly caused by tremendous computational cost and difficulties in parameter identification in particular at larger scales which often prevent a reliable description of spatial heterogeneity of aquifer properties due to the lack of available data there are only a few studies in which such models are used to predict the water quality in a fractured aquifer at catchment scale blessent et al 2011 orban et al 2010 refsgaard et al 2014 blessent et al 2011 pointed out the uncertainty associated to the fracture network connectivity and geometry stochastic modelling may consider this uncertainty but requires very long computing time days if not weeks on multiple processors refsgaard et al 2014 travel time based models were proposed to overcome these limitations in these models in contrast to the spatially explicit eulerian models the travel time replaces spatial coordinates as independent variables conceptually this leads to quasi one dimensional solute transport under the assumption that reaction fronts coincide with groundwater isochrones i e lines of equal travel time reactive transport is solved as a function of travel time which is defined as the time that a water particle resides in the domain of interest from the entry point at the domain inlet to the point of observation the effect of geochemical reactions on the solutes of interest is quantified in the travel time domain using an appropriate analytical or numerical model to provide a reaction function this is done apart from the modelling of the hydraulic system which is represented by the distribution of travel time in the model domain this distribution is interpreted as the result of many non interacting stream tubes being mixed upon the observation rather than within the domain reactive species concentrations in groundwater are then quantified through convolution of reaction function and travel time distribution travel time based solute transport models reduce the required computational effort dramatically and have been frequently applied in the past e g assteerawatt 2008 bellin et al 1993 cirpka and kitanidis 2000 cvetkovic and frampton 2010 cvetkovic and dagan 1994 dagan and nguyen 1989 dagan and

malmström et al 2008 sanz prat et al 2015 sanz prat et al 2016 in this study we develop a travel time based model to simulate nitrate transport in fractured aquifers relevant geochemical reactions both within fracture and rock matrix as well as mass transfer processes are described by means of a 2 d numerical model the geochemical modelling results are used to provide the reaction function that quantifies the change in nitrate concentration within the fracture as a function of travel time by convolution with parametric probability density functions of groundwater travel time nitrate concentrations in groundwater are calculated the travel time based model is applied to quantify denitrification in a carbonate aquifer upper muschelkalk in the catchment of the river ammer close to the city of tübingen germany grathwohl et al 2013 thanks to the intense use of the aquifer for water supply the monitoring of quarrying activities and intense research activities a comprehensive field data set is available for the catchment the data shows considerable nitrate reduction in groundwater by means of an inverse correlation between measured nitrate concentration and derived groundwater age for a variety of measurement locations in the catchment a key question is whether these observations can be explained by microbial denitrification being restricted to the fractures given the low porosity and small pore sizes of the upper muschelkalk rock matrix it can be expected that a relevant microbial population may not develop in the matrix pore space and microbial activity is restricted to the fracture in this case nitrate reduction is controlled by the diffusive transfer of electron donors which are released within the rock matrix due to pyrite oxidation and siderite dissolution to the fracture although the available field data and knowledge from previous work may be rated as exceptional and some idea of the carbonate aquifer s geometry structure and heterogeneity could be developed the aquifer properties can be determined only approximately we first consider a reference scenario that reflects the current knowledge of the conditions in the case study area by a set of best guess effective values for the input parameters of the geochemical model the model simulation includes a preconditioning phase to take into account the redox evolution during about 10000 years of oxic recharge since the end of glaciation followed by a 100 years period of nitrate input the role of individual parameters is studied in a sensitivity analysis parameter uncertainty is also taken into account in the comparison of modelled and measured nitrate concentrations versus travel time finally the model is applied to roughly predict the further propagation of the nitrate front in the long term 2 case study area the study area is located in the catchment of the ammer river close to the city of tübingen germany fig 1 we consider the upper muschelkalk aquifer which has a total thickness of up to 80 m fig 2 see d affonseca et al 2020 for a 3 d high resolution geological model of the study area the upper muschelkalk consists of numerous meter scale cyclic limestone layers aigner and bachmann 1992 koehrer et al 2010 warnecke and aigner 2019 cycles consist of alternating limestone and thin clay marlstone horizons koehrer et al 2010 the main fracture network is connected to the bedding planes between limestones and clay layers in this study we focus on the micritic limestone facies which covers up to 90 of the thickness of upper muschelkalk in the ammer catchment visual observations have been performed in the quarries across the catchment and in the core samples to obtain fracture characteristics in the upper muschelkalk fractures vary by origin orientation and spacing the typical spacing that has been detected ranges between a few decimeters to several meters osenbrück et al 2021 the porosity of micritic limestone is low and varies in the range between about 0 1 and 2 adams and diamond 2017 palermo et al 2010 with pore sizes less than 0 1 μm rügner et al 1999 the limestones are comprised of calcite dolomite siderite pyrite and some minor contents of clay minerals and other iron carbonates saddle dolomite pyrite is commonly present in the rocks its concentration is up to 4 vol adams and diamond 2017 aigner and bachmann 1992 koehrer et al 2010 osenbrück et al 2021 warnecke and aigner 2019 scanning electron microscopy indicates the presence of siderite and saddle dolomites with contents of up to 1 vol kortunov 2018 comparable to the findings for limestones in other sedimentary basins ellwood et al 1988 the mutual presence of siderite and pyrite has been observed previously in various limestones ellwood et al 1988 haese et al 1997 koehrer et al 2010 while pyrite is formed during different stages of diagenesis siderite tends to form during the second phase of diagenesis as a result of pyrite oxidation and re precipitation the typical redox sequence appelo and postma 2005 is formed both in fracture and matrix provided that microbial denitrification is occuring in the rock matrix nitrate does not migrate much further than dissolved oxygen relatively high no3 concentrations observed in the limestone aquifer in the anoxic zone table 1 indicate that denitrification in the study area is rather slow the source of nitrate in the study area is the fertilizer applied to the agricultural areas visser et al 2021 which cover large parts of the catchment liu et al 2018 by stochastic modelling of nitrate leaching through a series of soil columns representing the variety of soil forms in the study area weber et al 2021 estimated an effective average nitrate concentration in groundwater recharge of 31 mg l 0 5 mmol l within the catchment of the ammer river routine sampling campaigns in the ammer catchment conducted in 2011 2014 and 2018 give an overview on groundwater chemistry a detailed description of sampling strategy measurement methodology and data analysis is given in visser et al 2021 the results of these campaigns include nitrate concentrations as well as estimates of the apparent groundwater age derived from tritium helium ratios equating the terms apparent groundwater age and apparent tracer age see suckow 2014 for a detailed discussion at 25 groundwater wells and springs in the catchment table 1 and fig 3 locations are shown in fig 1 measured nitrate concentrations in groundwater range from very low values below the detection limit e g at the production well tbbrhz to a maximum of 0 79 mmol l at the monitoring well has5 the pattern of measured data largely depends on the type of measurement location fig 3 while the data from monitoring wells show an irregular pattern the data measured at springs and production wells incl the artesian monitoring well reveal the expected trend of decreasing nitrate concentrations with increasing apparent groundwater age which we denote below as mean travel time τ most likely this is due to differences in the size of associated capture zones and the variation in relevant characteristics samples taken at monitoring wells have originated from small capture zones due to small flow rates at sampling see table 1 where nitrate input and subsurface properties are supposed to vary considerably from capture zone to capture zone this is particularly obvious in the large variation of measurements even among locally clustered monitoring wells at the three quarry sites see coloured symbols in fig 3 for has mötz and sulz samples from production wells or springs stem from rather large capture zones large flow rates with to a certain extent averaged characteristics which therefore are expected to be described much better by the model than the samples from the monitoring wells assuming a spatially rather constant nitrate input from agricultural land measured nitrate concentration can be directly attributed to different total denitrification stage the degree of nitrate reduction correlates with corresponding values of mean travel time τ 3 modelling approach 3 1 travel time based model concept we consider the fractured aquifer to consist of two domains fractures and rock matrix due to the small permeability of the micritic limestone water flow in the matrix is assumed to be very low and is therefore neglected the flow is assumed to pass through the connected system of fractures providing continuous exposure of water parcels to the surface of the limestone rock matrix the geochemical properties of both domains are assumed to be spatially constant within the model domain under this assumption of a geochemically homogeneous system the travel time based model approach consists of two tasks that can be conducted separately i the evaluation of the distribution of travel times of groundwater through the model domain towards the well or spring of interest in terms of a probability density function pdf and ii the simulation of reactive transport to provide the reaction function the reaction model represents any of the flow paths of the water parcels through the fractured aquifer in terms of travel time groundwater flow is assumed to be at steady state under fully water saturated conditions the spatial extent of the reactive transport model the initial conditions within the model domain as well as the chemistry of the water that enters the model at the upgradient boundary are set according to the specific conditions given at the site mineral composition and other model parameters are considered as effective values representing the properties of the rock formation in the model domain in average as there is no spatial differentiation with respect to geochemical properties it is not relevant in which area of the catchment and in which particular fracture the solute propagates through the subsurface the groundwater captured by an individual well spring or through sampling at any other measurement location is a mixture of different water fractions that travelled to the location along individual flow paths with different residence or travel time through the aquifer domain of interest see fig 3 for an exemplary illustration the distribution of travel time characterizes the ensemble of heterogeneous pathways in the domain differences in travel time result from and describe heterogeneity on all scales including density connectivity orientation and width of fractures channeling within fractures e g guiheneuf et al 2017 as well as travel distance being associated with a particular sub domain i e capture zone each sampling location is characterized by its specific pdf of travel time the shape of these travel time distributions is not known in natural aquifer systems and can be estimated only with considerable uncertainty for the estimation numerical multi dimensional flow models together with particle tracking routines may be used or parametric distributions that meet certain statistical characteristics the validity of either form of estimation largely depends on the level of knowledge about the aquifer system in this work we use a gamma distribution as probability distribution which has been applied previously for fractured systems kirchner et al 2000 hrachowitz et al 2010 1 f i τ α i β i τ α i 1 β i α i г α i e τ β i where г α i is the gamma function 2 г α i 0 e τ τ α i 1 dτ the unknown shape parameter α i and the scale parameter β i of the gamma distribution are related to each other via the distribution s mean value f i τ i α i β i if we assume to know the mean travel time τ i at the considered location i to be equal to the apparent groundwater age estimated using tritium helium measurements the scale parameter can be substituted β i τ i α i this leads to a formulation for the location specific pdf of travel time f i τ τ i α i having only one unknown parameter the shape parameter α i 3 f i τ τ i α i τ α i 1 τ i α i α i г α i e τ α i τ i this shape parameter is determined by calibration as will be explained further below given the results of the reactive transport simulation in terms of the nitrate concentration as a function of real time t and travel time τ c r t τ the nitrate concentration in groundwater c gw i t at some sampling location i is calculated by convolution e g cirpka and kitanidis 2000 4 c gw i t c gw t τ i α 0 c r t τ f τ α τ i dτ where f τ α τ i is the pdf of travel time at the measurement location i described by a gamma distribution for a given mean travel time τ i and shape parameter α the model calibration consists of two steps i the appropriate parameterization of the reactive model and ii the measurement point wise fitting of the gamma distribution s shape parameter see section 4 3 for further details 3 2 reaction model the reaction model describes a single fracture and the adjacent part of the rock matrix transport of solutes in the fracture is convective transport in the matrix is purely diffusive due to the symmetry it is sufficient to model only one half of the fracture matrix system fig 4 for the simulations we chose the multi component reactive transport code min3p thcm mayer et al 2002 su et al 2021 in flow direction the model is discretized into 100 columns of uniform length δx 0 1 m following the travel time based approach any location x in the model is interpreted in terms of travel time τ with τ x v where v is the average flow velocity in the fracture 0 2 m year a specified flux neumann boundary condition is applied to the upgradient boundary x 0 of the fracture such that the length of the model in terms of travel time is 50 years which is well above the largest value of measured apparent groundwater age 38 years see table 1 downgradient at the fracture outlet x lx 10 m a dirichlet boundary is employed with a fixed hydraulic head to maintain free drainage perpendicular to the fracture the matrix is discretized using a variable grid size with δz ranging from 0 1 mm near the fracture to 40 mm comprising a total number of 67 layers resulting in a total model thickness of lz 0 5 m fig 4 the conductivity of the matrix compartment was set to a very low value 10 14 m s leading to negligible flow in the matrix the diffusion coefficient in water daq is set to 1 5 10 9 m2 s 1 for all aqueous species initial water chemistry in the fracture and the matrix is assumed to be in equilibrium with the rock minerals the model is preconditioned to simulate the evolution of redox conditions in the aquifer due to oxic recharge with o2 pressure of 0 209 atm since the last ice age following spiessl et al 2008 for biotite oxidation in granites subsequently nitrate input is considered for a period of 100 years model parameter settings have been defined in relation to a reference scenario hereafter also denoted as the base case this base case is considered a best guess parameter setting based on the given knowledge and data in the case study area see section 2 nitrate input concentration is assumed to 31 mg l 0 5 mmol l pyrite and siderite contents in the rock matrix are set to 0 25 vol each corresponding to 0 44 and 0 35 mass calcite content is 99 5 99 21 the oxidation preconditioning period is 10 000 years fracture aperture is 0 2 mm and matrix porosity is set to 1 3 3 geochemical system following the assumption that the limited pore size of the rock matrix does not allow for the development of any relevant microbial mass in the matrix pore space microbial activity in terms of microbial denitrification in the fracture and the release of the required electron donor fe2 in the matrix are spatially separated in the model furthermore we do not consider any filling of the fracture that may otherwise contribute in terms of a direct provision of electron donors therefore diffusive mass transfer between matrix and fracture strongly controls denitrification the hydrogeochemical model considers redox sensitive species most relevant for denitrification in the aquifer such as dissolved oxygen of atmospheric origin agriculturally produced nitrate visser et al 2021 sulphate and ferrous iron fe2 is produced by siderite dissolution and pyrite oxidation rock matrix composition is defined by primary carbonate calcite and secondary siderite pyrite minerals of the sedimentary basin the main geochemical components and reactions considered in the model are described in table 2 and appendix 1 fig 4 shows a conceptual scheme of the redox zonation within the fracture matrix system and considered exchange processes such as diffusion mineral dissolution and microbial denitrification the latter has been proved by cultivation experiments with groundwater samples jakus et al 2021a jakus et al 2021b for dissolution precipitation of calcite siderite ferrihydrite and goethite constant reaction rates were assumed equilibrium constants for these components are based on previously published values ball and nordstrom 1991 to improve convergence fe2 oxidation to fe3 is combined with iron hydroxide precipitation and therefore fe3 is not present in the aqueous phase ferrihydrite and goethite are produced by oxygen reduction and denitrification respectively in order to distinguish between oxidation and nitrate biotic reduction of fe2 these processes are implemented in the reaction model as goethite and ferrihydrite precipitation other sources of goethite and ferrihydrite formation are not considered for the oxidation of pyrite the shrinking core model was used for sulphur with the same parameters as were published in previous studies langman et al 2014 bao et al 2017 followed by iron reduction by nitrate or oxygen table 2 denitrification takes place exclusively in anoxic conditions appelo and postma 2005 which is controlled in the model by an inhibition term note that pyrite is depleted only abiotically via oxygen reduction and does not directly contribute to the nitrate reduction because biotic reactions do not take place in the matrix but are limited to the fracture as mineral forms and concentrations are not known exactly we consider siderite as the iron carbonate phase which can dissolve and provide additional fe2 to the system siderite serves as representative for other minerals such as ankerite or saddle dolomites cax fe mg mn 1 x co3 2 which might also occur as potential sources of fe2 the reaction model also accounts for porosity changes due to precipitation of the secondary minerals and dissolution of carbonates and pyrite 4 results and discussion 4 1 reactive transport modelling base case the water chemistry in the fracture as modelled for the base case at the end of the simulation period is shown in fig 5 see sm4 for a video showing the development during the entire simulation period oxygen vanishes due to pyrite oxidation within a travel time of about 2 year after 10 000 years of preconditioning as described in section 3 2 as long as oxygen is present nitrate does not react the slight decrease in the concentration is caused by diffusion into the rock matrix when the oxygen is gone nitrate reduction starts at this stage fe2 is present in the fracture and nitrate decreases rapidly denitrification is followed by goethite and ferrihydrite precipitation this and pyrite oxidation produces h in the fracture table 1 which lowers ph from 9 1 in equilibrium with carbonate rocks to 6 9 7 1 neutral values as the ph decreases more siderite dissolves and more fe2 is released fig 5 downstream of the nitrate reduction front in the fracture the ph is slightly increasing again concentrations of goethite in the fracture are comparable to ferrihydrite goethite as a product of denitrification precipitates conjointly with the nitrate decrease after a travel time of about another 4 5 years in the anoxic zone the groundwater is free of nitrate an increasing amount of n2 appears in the fracture as a product of denitrification further downstream of the reaction front of nitrate n2 behaves as a conservative tracer diffusing into the rock matrix sulphate concentration in the fracture equilibrated with the matrix during the 10 000 years long preconditioning period and is not significantly affected during anthropogenic nitrate input within the last 100 years correspondingly the concentration of so4 2 stays almost at a constant level downstream of the oxygen front during the first 10 000 years oxygen is spreading in the first 2 mm of the rock matrix dissolving 0 54 mol of pyrite the subsequent 100 years of nitrate input result in consumption of additional 0 19 mol of siderite fig 6 secondary siderite precipitates in the rock matrix as a result of diffusive redistribution of fe2 see sm 1 fe2 oxidation leads to ferrihydrite and goethite precipitation in amounts of 0 45 and 0 21 mol accordingly which means that 32 of produced fe2 is consumed in denitrification 4 2 sensitivity analysis to understand the model behaviour in relation and response to parameter changes a series of model simulations with different parameter settings were performed these settings were generated by a systematic variation of individual parameters one at a time method of the base case model we considered a number of fractured aquifer properties namely fracture aperture rock matrix porosity and total mineral concentration which all are expected to vary across the catchment further we investigate the role of nitrate input concentration and the relevance of the duration of the preconditioning period the parameter ranges were set in accordance to field observations in the case study area and literature research about muschelkalk properties with hydraulic conductivity values ranging between 2 6 10 6 to 1 10 4 m s depending on the degree of karstification d affonseca et al 2020 and observed fracture spacings osenbrück et al 2021 from a few decimeters to several meters the range of reasonable values of fracture apertures in the case study area was estimated using the cubic law snow 1965 to be between 0 1 and 1 mm the variation of nitrate input concentrations in the case study area is not known measurements in the monitoring wells show concentrations of up to 0 79 mmol l table 1 depending on agricultural practices growing season recharge intensity and soil characteristics values might be considerably higher matrix porosity in the micritic upper muschelkalk limestone was determined to range from 0 1 to 2 and total content of fe ii bearing minerals to be up to 4 vol section 2 the duration of oxygen input being linked to the end of the last glacial period has been varied between 30 000 years assumed latest time of start of melting and 3000 years to confirm the hypothesis that preconditioning is sufficiently established even after much shorter periods of oxygen input minimum and maximum values of the parameters considered in this sensitivity analysis are summarized in table 3 in comparison to the base case settings for some parameters we extend the range of variation beyond the bounds described above to see the model response relative parameter change is defined as p p i p 0 where p 0 and p i denote the reference base case value of the parameter and its variation respectively model sensitivity in response to individual parameter changes is evaluated by means of the difference in travel time required to reduce the nitrate input concentration entering the fracture across the upgradient model boundary by 60 which is hereafter denoted as τ 60 the results are displayed in fig 7 note that nitrate degradation in the fracture starts only after oxygen is completely depleted thus the location of the oxygen front in terms of travel time represents a lower limit for τ 60 for the base case the oxygen free zone in the fracture starts at approx τ 2 years nitrate reduction by 60 is achieved within approx 4 5 years and complete denitrification within 5 5 years see fig 5 changes of the oxygen input duration cause only a slight variation of τ 60 values obviously the preconditioning of the redox system in the model domain is nearly completed after 3000 years such that any longer oxygen input does not remarkably change the initial conditions relevant for the nitrate transport through the system the decrease of the nitrate input load either due to a lower input concentration or a lower fracture aperture obviously leads to a faster nitrate reduction fig 7 vice versa τ 60 increases with nitrate input concentration and fracture aperture a decrease of the fracture aperture is raising the surface area to volume ratio of the fracture matrix system prompting quasi parabolic dependency similar to existing analytical solutions for the fractured systems e g rahman et al 2004 sidborn and neretnieks 2007 a change in mineral content has only a minor effect on the value of τ 60 as long as a sufficient amount of minerals is available a limitation is observed for values below approx 30 of the base case content i e 0 15 vol matrix porosity controls the diffusive mass transfer between matrix and fracture with larger porosity values of τ 60 are reduced considerably this is due to a faster reduction of both oxygen and nitrate please note that in all modelled scenarios porosity changes due to precipitation and diagenesis of the rock matrix are insignificant the denitrification potential has been found to be at maximum if pyrite and an iron carbonate here siderite are present in the rock matrix in comparable concentrations the dominance of one mineral fraction leads to significantly lower denitrification please see sm 2 for the scenario where only pyrite is present and sm 3 where only siderite is present fig 8 shows how variations of individual parameter values do change the reaction curve and modelled groundwater concentrations moderate variations p 2 p0 and p 0 5 p0 as well as maximum variations p pmin and p pmax are considered settings that favour the reduction of nitrate in the aquifer cause a steepening of the reactive curve and a shift to lower travel times while less favourable conditions compared to the base case are indicated by smoother curves shifted to larger travel times the profile of modelled nitrate concentrations does change in accordance with the change in the reactive curve note that for this illustration the shape parameter of the travel time distribution is set to α 5 see the following sections for its specific role obviously a variation of more than one parameter may lead to larger changes in model results than the variation of a single parameter qualitatively this can be easily read from the results of the sensitivity analysis as parameter changes that favour nitrate degradation will sum up to an even higher degradation to give an example fig 8 shows the effect of a simultaneous change of three parameters mineral content fracture aperture and matrix porosity 4 3 calibration of travel time distribution s shape to calculate nitrate concentration in groundwater the modelled nitrate concentration in groundwater c gw i t at some particular location i for a given time t depends on the outcome of the reactive transport simulation reaction function and on the specific pdf of travel time at the considered location see eqns 1 to 4 with this approach the modelled concentration of nitrate in groundwater depends on the parameter setting of the geochemical model and the shape parameter α i in f i τ τ i α i for a given reaction curve representing the result of the geochemical model with a particular parameter setting for the time of interest here t 100 a the concentration value c gw i t τ i α i is a function of the shape parameter α i of the pdf of travel time by comparison with the measured concentration the optimal α i value providing the best model fit can be determined however uncertainty in geochemical model parameters leads to a non uniqueness of the model calibration consequently any pair of measured values of nitrate concentration in groundwater and mean travel time may be explained through the model by different parameter combinations this is illustrated for the example of a single concentration measurement at location tbbrhz c gw tbbrhz 9 68 10 3 mmol l τ sul 1 37 7 years against which the model namely the travel time distribution s shape parameter α bbrhz has been fitted fig 9 for clarification the fitting is shown for two different parameter settings of the geochemical model here different total mineral concentration 0 05 vol and 0 5 vol respectively 4 4 comparison with field data in order to prove the feasibility of the model approach for the particular conditions of microbial denitrification being limited to the fractures due to small pore sizes of the rock matrix we compare modelled nitrate concentration with the data τ c gw i measured in monitoring and production wells as well as springs table 1 to reflect in an exemplary way the uncertainty demonstrated in the sensitivity analysis two different parameter settings are considered here i the reference scenario base case as has been discussed above and ii a scenario with limited availability of minerals total mineral content mc 0 05 vol modelling with these two settings provide the reaction curves that correspond to the bounds of this parameter range recall that model results are largely insensitive to an increase in mineral content compared to the base case as depicted in fig 7 in the context of this exemplary analysis we may claim these two reaction curves are forming the envelope of plausible reactive model results see fig 9a and grey shaded areas in right column of fig 10 by convolution with the pdf of travel time f τ τ α we obtain a plausibility area in which the model can explain the measured data pairs τ c c0 i the shape of this area varies with the shape parameter α see green shaded areas in right column of fig 10 for all data pairs located within this plausibility area it is possible to exactly fit the model by different model parameter settings model fits can be achieved for all production wells and springs and most of the monitoring wells all data points above the plausibility area indicate either a mismatch with the assumed initial nitrate concentration this is obviously the case where measured nitrate concentration is above the average concentration used as model input concentration or less favourable conditions for denitrification as could be represented in the model by deviating other parameters values from the base case setting as shown in fig 8 except for a few monitoring wells where rather low nitrate concentrations have been measured at very young apparent groundwater age see table 1 and fig 2 the model sufficiently explains the field observations the numerical simulation results give a clear indication that observed nitrate concentrations can indeed be explained by microbial denitrification in the fracture alone 4 5 long term propagation of nitrate front due to ongoing agricultural practices in the study area we expect a continuous input of nitrate also in the future consequently the nitrate reduction front will propagate further downgradient fig 11 shows how the reaction curve for denitrification will develop during the next centuries according to the reference scenario model fig 11 left the nitrate reduction front is retarded but does not move linear with time this is in accordance with analytical solutions for specific simplified cases describing a similar setting which show that the retardation factor increases with the square root of time a current reduction of fertilization would considerably slow down the front propagation see fig 11 right for the example of a 50 reduction 5 conclusion and outlook the travel time based hydrogeochemical model developed in the study is a comparably simple but computationally efficient tool to simulate solute transport in a fractured aquifer on the catchment scale simulation results for the muschelkalk aquifer in the catchment of the river ammer show that the model is able to realistically describe measured nitrate concentrations in groundwater for the special properties of the aquifer considered in this work namely for low porosity and small size of the pores of the rock matrix which restricts bacterial activity to the fracture though being diffusion limited mass transfer of electron donors from the matrix to the fracture obviously is sufficient to establish nitrate reduction in the fracture large enough to achieve the nitrate decrease over the travel time observed in the catchment denitrification is driven by redox reactions involving pyrite and iron carbonate together and causes a decrease in ph which further enhances release of fe2 from siderite dissolving in the rock matrix which may be considered as a self enhancing process if pyrite and siderite are present simultaneously then an optimum in no3 degradation is observed diffusive flux of the electron donor from the rock matrix to the fracture and the location of the oxygen front are the major factors controlling the nitrate reduction the model response on parameter variations has shown that fracture aperture input concentration and porosity are of a high importance for the location and propagation of the nitrate reduction front whereas the duration of system preconditioning assumed time since the last glaciation is of minor importance all physical and geochemical parameters required to describe nitrate transport in fractured aquifers vary in space and can be evaluated in nature only to some limited extent and detail data obtained from a number of drill cores and outcrops unavoidably provide an incomplete picture with respect to the geometry of relevant karstic features as well as to the range and spatial variation of parameter values given this situation the applied model makes use of effective parameter values in the sense of the average properties of the rock formation in the model domain we believe that this approach if encompassing an uncertainty analysis is reasonable available field data do also not allow the reliable estimation of the distribution of travel time through the aquifer to the measurement locations the unknown shape of these travel time distributions adds even more uncertainty with the simplified model approach proposed in this work this uncertainty can be addressed by stochastic simulations these will extend the findings on the role of individual geochemical parameters presented herein further work will include also the additional consideration of solutes that are subject to other processes such as sorption and radioactive decay the following are the supplementary data related to this article overview of supplementary materials supplementary

1288,we investigate denitrification in a ferric iron containing fractured micritic limestone aquifer triassic upper muschelkalk in south west germany by numerical simulations low porosity values average value of 1 partly small pore sizes of the rock matrix 0 1 μm and thus potential absence of microbial activity in the rock matrix suggest that denitrification is taking place solely in the fracture a key question is whether the nitrate reduction derived from groundwater observations at 25 locations in the study area can be explained by a model that restricts microbial denitrification to the fractures a travel time based reactive transport model is developed to efficiently simulate long term nitrate reduction on the catchment scale the model employs a 2 d numerical reaction model describing the fracture rock matrix system and parametric travel time distributions the role of i biotic and abiotic iron oxidation ii the type and amount of iron bearing minerals and iii mass transfer between matrix and fracture are investigated the simulations show that pyrite and siderite used as surrogate for iron carbonates together as a source of electron donors provide enough reduction potential to decrease the nitrate concentrations as observed in the field this confirms the hypothesis that diffusion controlled mass transfer of electron donors from the matrix to the fracture is sufficient to establish considerable denitrification in the fracture uncertainty in modelled concentrations is demonstrated as a result of both the geochemical aquifer properties and the unknown shape of travel time distributions keywords diffusion nitrate reduction travel time fractured rock aquifer reactive transport modelling 1 introduction about 25 of the global population depends

2011 refsgaard et al 2014 nitrate reduction includes redox reactions and is strongly affected by fracture matrix interactions rivett et al 2008 nitrate and other solutes diffuse from the fractures into the rock matrix and vice versa e g neretnieks 1980 neuman 2005 if the size of the pores in the rock matrix does not permit microbial growth as suggested for some jurassic and carboniferous limestones and cretaceous chalk deposits johnson et al 1998 whitelaw and edwards 1980 redox reactions are limited to the rock surface of the fractures in this case nitrate reduction is controlled by diffusive flux of the electron donor towards the fracture pyrite and other fe ii bearing minerals are known to be important electron donors in redox processes leading to oxygen reduction and denitrification the importance of the abiotic oxidation of iron bearing minerals for redox evolution in fractured crystalline rocks was elucidated by sidborn and neretnieks 2007 however abiotic oxidation of such minerals by no3 alone is considered insufficient appelo and postma 2005 other iron bearing minerals such as siderite ankerite or fe2 containing saddle dolomites can also act as an electron donor source and thus often mixtures of fe2 bearing minerals must be considered reactive transport of pollutants through the fractured media has been studied by help of models since the 1980s when analytical solutions were developed to quantify the effect of the matrix diffusion during advective transport of radionuclides in single fractures for potential nuclear waste repositories grisak and pickens 1981 neretnieks 1980 tang et al 1981 later such solutions were expanded to include systems of fractures and first order decay sudicky and frind 1982 1984 sidborn and neretnieks 2004 2007 2008 simulated oxygen transport and redox evolution in granites using various numerical models and developed simplified analytical solutions a variety of further analytical and semi analytical models were developed that focus on different specific features stagnant flow zones and layered systems mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 multiple radioactive decay products mahmoudzadeh et al 2016 shahkarami et al 2015 and chemical reactions andersen and evje 2016 including different reaction rates in fractures and in the matrix zhu et al 2016 source decay and sorption west et al 2004 a series of semi analytical solutions for transport in fractured shales was derived by huang and goltz 2015 numerical models allow to account for complex multi component reaction systems spatial or temporal changes in parameters and boundary conditions and multiple reactions pathways taking place instantaneously three major concepts have been developed for the description of fractured systems in numerical models deng and spycher 2019 single or multiple continuum porous medium models discrete fracture network models and travel time based models equivalent single continuum models replace the fractured system with a porous one which has properties corrected for the effect of fractures berkowitz et al 1988 liu et al 2016 dual continuum models warren and root 1963 lichtner 2000 differentiate between fractures and matrix that are coupled to allow interaction various concepts of the fracture matrix interactions and interconnection have been proposed lichtner 2000 tecklenburg et al 2016 triple and

studies discrete fracture network models may also account for fracture properties frampton et al 2019 fracture matrix mass transfer and heterogeneity of hydraulic properties cvetkovic et al 2016 different algorithms were applied in order to overcome the uncertainty in topology connectivity and other statistical parameters of fractures e g lavoine et al 2020 a review on the discrete fracture networks was presented in lei et al 2017 multi dimensional spatially distributed models though offering intuitively an explicit idea of the modelled area face several limitations which are mainly caused by tremendous computational cost and difficulties in parameter identification in particular at larger scales which often prevent a reliable description of spatial heterogeneity of aquifer properties due to the lack of available data there are only a few studies in which such models are used to predict the water quality in a fractured aquifer at catchment scale blessent et al 2011 orban et al 2010 refsgaard et al 2014 blessent et al 2011 pointed out the uncertainty associated to the fracture network connectivity and geometry stochastic modelling may consider this uncertainty but requires very long computing time days if not weeks on multiple processors refsgaard et al 2014 travel time based models were proposed to overcome these limitations in these models in contrast to the spatially explicit eulerian models the travel time replaces spatial coordinates as independent variables conceptually this leads to quasi one dimensional solute transport under the assumption that reaction fronts coincide with groundwater isochrones i e lines of equal travel time reactive transport is solved as a function of travel time which is defined as the time that a water particle resides in the domain of interest from the entry point at the domain inlet to the point of observation the effect of geochemical reactions on the solutes of interest is quantified in the travel time domain using an appropriate analytical or numerical model to provide a reaction function this is done apart from the modelling of the hydraulic system which is represented by the distribution of travel time in the model domain this distribution is interpreted as the result of many non interacting stream tubes being mixed upon the observation rather than within the domain reactive species concentrations in groundwater are then quantified through convolution of reaction function and travel time distribution travel time based solute transport models reduce the required computational effort dramatically and have been frequently applied in the past e g assteerawatt 2008 bellin et al 1993 cirpka and kitanidis 2000 cvetkovic and frampton 2010 cvetkovic and dagan 1994 dagan and nguyen 1989 dagan and

2019 zhao et al 2011 owing to the efficiency of the travel time approach investigating alternative reaction models and the sensitivity of the model parameters in a stochastic manner are possible malmström et al 2008 sanz prat et al 2015 sanz prat et al 2016 in this study we develop a travel time based model to simulate nitrate transport in fractured aquifers relevant geochemical reactions both within fracture and rock matrix as well as mass transfer processes are described by means of a 2 d numerical model the geochemical modelling results are used to provide the reaction function that quantifies the change in nitrate concentration within the fracture as a function of travel time by convolution with parametric probability density functions of groundwater travel time nitrate concentrations in groundwater are calculated the travel time based model is applied to quantify denitrification in a carbonate aquifer upper muschelkalk in the catchment of the river ammer close to the city of tübingen germany grathwohl et al 2013 thanks to the intense use of the aquifer for water supply the monitoring of quarrying activities and intense research activities a comprehensive field data set is available for the catchment the data shows considerable nitrate reduction in groundwater by means of an inverse correlation between measured nitrate concentration and derived groundwater age for a variety of measurement locations in the catchment a key question is whether these observations can be explained by microbial denitrification being restricted to the fractures given the low porosity and small pore sizes of the upper muschelkalk rock matrix it can be expected that a relevant microbial population may not develop in the matrix pore space and microbial activity is restricted to the fracture in this case nitrate reduction is controlled by the diffusive transfer of electron donors which are released within the rock matrix due to pyrite oxidation and siderite dissolution to the fracture although the available field data and knowledge from previous work may be rated as exceptional and some idea of the carbonate aquifer s geometry structure and heterogeneity could be developed the aquifer properties can be determined only approximately we first consider a reference scenario that reflects the current knowledge of the conditions in the case study area by a set of best guess effective values for the input parameters of the geochemical model the model simulation includes a preconditioning phase to take into account the redox evolution during about 10000 years of oxic recharge since the end of glaciation followed by a 100 years period of nitrate input the role of individual parameters is studied in a sensitivity analysis parameter uncertainty is also taken into account in the comparison of modelled and measured nitrate concentrations versus travel time finally the model is applied to roughly predict the further propagation of the nitrate front in the long term 2 case study area the study area is located in the catchment of the ammer river close to the city of tübingen germany fig 1 we consider the upper muschelkalk aquifer which has a total thickness of up to 80 m fig 2 see d affonseca et al 2020 for a 3 d high resolution geological model of the study area the upper muschelkalk consists of numerous meter scale cyclic limestone layers aigner and bachmann 1992 koehrer et al 2010 warnecke and aigner 2019 cycles consist of alternating limestone and thin clay marlstone horizons koehrer et al 2010 the main fracture network is connected to the bedding planes between limestones and clay layers in this study we focus on the micritic limestone facies which covers up to 90 of the thickness of upper muschelkalk in the ammer catchment visual observations have been performed in the quarries across the catchment and in the core samples to obtain fracture characteristics in the upper muschelkalk fractures vary by origin orientation and spacing the typical spacing that has been detected ranges between a few decimeters to several meters osenbrück et al 2021 the porosity of micritic limestone is low and varies in the range between about 0 1 and 2 adams and diamond 2017 palermo et al 2010 with pore sizes less than 0 1 μm rügner et al 1999 the limestones are comprised of calcite dolomite siderite pyrite and some minor contents of clay minerals and other iron carbonates saddle dolomite pyrite is commonly present in the rocks its concentration is up to 4 vol adams and diamond 2017 aigner and bachmann 1992 koehrer et al 2010 osenbrück et al 2021 warnecke and aigner 2019 scanning electron microscopy indicates the presence of siderite and saddle dolomites with contents of up to 1 vol kortunov 2018 comparable to the findings for limestones in other sedimentary basins ellwood et al 1988 the mutual presence of siderite and pyrite has been observed previously in various limestones ellwood et al 1988 haese et al 1997 koehrer et al 2010 while pyrite is formed during different stages of diagenesis siderite tends to form during the second phase of diagenesis as a result of pyrite oxidation and re precipitation the typical redox sequence appelo and postma 2005 is formed both in fracture and matrix provided that microbial denitrification is occuring in the rock matrix nitrate does not migrate much further than dissolved oxygen relatively high no3 concentrations observed in the limestone aquifer in the anoxic zone table 1 indicate that denitrification in the study area is rather slow the source of nitrate in the study area is the fertilizer applied to the agricultural areas visser et al 2021 which cover large parts of the catchment liu et al 2018 by stochastic modelling of nitrate leaching through a series of soil columns representing the variety of soil forms in the study area weber et al 2021 estimated an effective average nitrate concentration in groundwater recharge of 31 mg l 0 5 mmol l within the catchment of the ammer river routine sampling campaigns in the ammer catchment conducted in 2011 2014 and 2018 give an overview on groundwater chemistry a detailed description of sampling strategy measurement methodology and data analysis is given in visser et al 2021 the results of these campaigns include nitrate concentrations as well as estimates of the apparent groundwater age derived from tritium helium ratios equating the terms apparent groundwater age and apparent tracer age see suckow 2014 for a detailed discussion at 25 groundwater wells and springs in the catchment table 1 and fig 3 locations are shown in fig 1 measured nitrate concentrations in groundwater range from very low values below the detection limit e g at the production well tbbrhz to a maximum of 0 79 mmol l at the monitoring well has5 the pattern of measured data largely depends on the type of measurement location fig 3 while the data from monitoring wells show an irregular pattern the data measured at springs and production wells incl the artesian monitoring well reveal the expected trend of decreasing nitrate concentrations with increasing apparent groundwater age which we denote below as mean travel time τ most likely this is due to differences in the size of associated capture zones and the variation in relevant characteristics samples taken at monitoring wells have originated from small capture zones due to small flow rates at sampling see table 1 where nitrate input and subsurface properties are supposed to vary considerably from capture zone to capture zone this is particularly obvious in the large variation of measurements even among locally clustered monitoring wells at the three quarry sites see coloured symbols in fig 3 for has mötz and sulz samples from production wells or springs stem from rather large capture zones large flow rates with to a certain extent averaged characteristics which therefore are expected to be described much better by the model than the samples from the monitoring wells assuming a spatially rather constant nitrate input from agricultural land measured nitrate concentration can be directly attributed to different total denitrification stage the degree of nitrate reduction correlates with corresponding values of mean travel time τ 3 modelling approach 3 1 travel time based model concept we consider the fractured aquifer to consist of two domains fractures and rock matrix due to the small permeability of the micritic limestone water flow in the matrix is assumed to be very low and is therefore neglected the flow is assumed to pass through the connected system of fractures providing continuous exposure of water parcels to the surface of the limestone rock matrix the geochemical properties of both domains are assumed to be spatially constant within the model domain under this assumption of a geochemically homogeneous system the travel time based model approach consists of two tasks that can be conducted separately i the evaluation of the distribution of travel times of groundwater through the model domain towards the well or spring of interest in terms of a probability density function pdf and ii the simulation of reactive transport to provide the reaction function the reaction model represents any of the flow paths of the water parcels through the fractured aquifer in terms of travel time groundwater flow is assumed to be at steady state under fully water saturated conditions the spatial extent of the reactive transport model the initial conditions within the model domain as well as the chemistry of the water that enters the model at the upgradient boundary are set according to the specific conditions given at the site mineral composition and other model parameters are considered as effective values representing the properties of the rock formation in the model domain in average as there is no spatial differentiation with respect to geochemical properties it is not relevant in which area of the catchment and in which particular fracture the solute propagates through the subsurface the groundwater captured by an individual well spring or through sampling at any other measurement location is a mixture of different water fractions that travelled to the location along individual flow paths with different residence or travel time through the aquifer domain of interest see fig 3 for an exemplary illustration the distribution of travel time characterizes the ensemble of heterogeneous pathways in the domain differences in travel time result from and describe heterogeneity on all scales including density connectivity orientation and width of fractures channeling within fractures e g guiheneuf et al 2017 as well as travel distance being associated with a particular sub domain i e capture zone each sampling location is characterized by its specific pdf of travel time the shape of these travel time distributions is not known in natural aquifer systems and can be estimated only with considerable uncertainty for the estimation numerical multi dimensional flow models together with particle tracking routines may be used or parametric distributions that meet certain statistical characteristics the validity of either form of estimation largely depends on the level of knowledge about the aquifer system in this work we use a gamma distribution as probability distribution which has been applied previously for fractured systems kirchner et al 2000 hrachowitz et al 2010 1 f i τ α i β i τ α i 1 β i α i г α i e τ β i where г α i is the gamma function 2 г α i 0 e τ τ α i 1 dτ the unknown shape parameter α i and the scale parameter β i of the gamma distribution are related to each other via the distribution s mean value f i τ i α i β i if we assume to know the mean travel time τ i at the considered location i to be equal to the apparent groundwater age estimated using tritium helium measurements the scale parameter can be substituted β i τ i α i this leads to a formulation for the location specific pdf of travel time f i τ τ i α i having only one unknown parameter the shape parameter α i 3 f i τ τ i α i τ α i 1 τ i α i α i г α i e τ α i τ i this shape parameter is determined by calibration as will be explained further below given the results of the reactive transport simulation in terms of the nitrate concentration as a function of real time t and travel time τ c r t τ the nitrate concentration in groundwater c gw i t at some sampling location i is calculated by convolution e g cirpka and kitanidis 2000 4 c gw i t c gw t τ i α 0 c r t τ f τ α τ i dτ where f τ α τ i is the pdf of travel time at the measurement location i described by a gamma distribution for a given mean travel time τ i and shape parameter α the model calibration consists of two steps i the appropriate parameterization of the reactive model and ii the measurement point wise fitting of the gamma distribution s shape parameter see section 4 3 for further details 3 2 reaction model the reaction model describes a single fracture and the adjacent part of the rock matrix transport of solutes in the fracture is convective transport in the matrix is purely diffusive due to the symmetry it is sufficient to model only one half of the fracture matrix system fig 4 for the simulations we chose the multi component reactive transport code min3p thcm mayer et al 2002 su et al 2021 in flow direction the model is discretized into 100 columns of uniform length δx 0 1 m following the travel time based approach any location x in the model is interpreted in terms of travel time τ with τ x v where v is the average flow velocity in the fracture 0 2 m year a specified flux neumann boundary condition is applied to the upgradient boundary x 0 of the fracture such that the length of the model in terms of travel time is 50 years which is well above the largest value of measured apparent groundwater age 38 years see table 1 downgradient at the fracture outlet x lx 10 m a dirichlet boundary is employed with a fixed hydraulic head to maintain free drainage perpendicular to the fracture the matrix is discretized using a variable grid size with δz ranging from 0 1 mm near the fracture to 40 mm comprising a total number of 67 layers resulting in a total model thickness of lz 0 5 m fig 4 the conductivity of the matrix compartment was set to a very low value 10 14 m s leading to negligible flow in the matrix the diffusion coefficient in water daq is set to 1 5 10 9 m2 s 1 for all aqueous species initial water chemistry in the fracture and the matrix is assumed to be in equilibrium with the rock minerals the model is preconditioned to simulate the evolution of redox conditions in the aquifer due to oxic recharge with o2 pressure of 0 209 atm since the last ice age following spiessl et al 2008 for biotite oxidation in granites subsequently nitrate input is considered for a period of 100 years model parameter settings have been defined in relation to a reference scenario hereafter also denoted as the base case this base case is considered a best guess parameter setting based on the given knowledge and data in the case study area see section 2 nitrate input concentration is assumed to 31 mg l 0 5 mmol l pyrite and siderite contents in the rock matrix are set to 0 25 vol each corresponding to 0 44 and 0 35 mass calcite content is 99 5 99 21 the oxidation preconditioning period is 10 000 years fracture aperture is 0 2 mm and matrix porosity is set to 1 3 3 geochemical system following the assumption that the limited pore size of the rock matrix does not allow for the development of any relevant microbial mass in the matrix pore space microbial activity in terms of microbial denitrification in the fracture and the release of the required electron donor fe2 in the matrix are spatially separated in the model furthermore we do not consider any filling of the fracture that may otherwise contribute in terms of a direct provision of electron donors therefore diffusive mass transfer between matrix and fracture strongly controls denitrification the hydrogeochemical model considers redox sensitive species most relevant for denitrification in the aquifer such as dissolved oxygen of atmospheric origin agriculturally produced nitrate visser et al 2021 sulphate and ferrous iron fe2 is produced by siderite dissolution and pyrite oxidation rock matrix composition is defined by primary carbonate calcite and secondary siderite pyrite minerals of the sedimentary basin the main geochemical components and reactions considered in the model are described in table 2 and appendix 1 fig 4 shows a conceptual scheme of the redox zonation within the fracture matrix system and considered exchange processes such as diffusion mineral dissolution and microbial denitrification the latter has been proved by cultivation experiments with groundwater samples jakus et al 2021a jakus et al 2021b for dissolution precipitation of calcite siderite ferrihydrite and goethite constant reaction rates were assumed equilibrium constants for these components are based on previously published values ball and nordstrom 1991 to improve convergence fe2 oxidation to fe3 is combined with iron hydroxide precipitation and therefore fe3 is not present in the aqueous phase ferrihydrite and goethite are produced by oxygen reduction and denitrification respectively in order to distinguish between oxidation and nitrate biotic reduction of fe2 these processes are implemented in the reaction model as goethite and ferrihydrite precipitation other sources of goethite and ferrihydrite formation are not considered for the oxidation of pyrite the shrinking core model was used for sulphur with the same parameters as were published in previous studies langman et al 2014 bao et al 2017 followed by iron reduction by nitrate or oxygen table 2 denitrification takes place exclusively in anoxic conditions appelo and postma 2005 which is controlled in the model by an inhibition term note that pyrite is depleted only abiotically via oxygen reduction and does not directly contribute to the nitrate reduction because biotic reactions do not take place in the matrix but are limited to the fracture as mineral forms and concentrations are not known exactly we consider siderite as the iron carbonate phase which can dissolve and provide additional fe2 to the system siderite serves as representative for other minerals such as ankerite or saddle dolomites cax fe mg mn 1 x co3 2 which might also occur as potential sources of fe2 the reaction model also accounts for porosity changes due to precipitation of the secondary minerals and dissolution of carbonates and pyrite 4 results and discussion 4 1 reactive transport modelling base case the water chemistry in the fracture as modelled for the base case at the end of the simulation period is shown in fig 5 see sm4 for a video showing the development during the entire simulation period oxygen vanishes due to pyrite oxidation within a travel time of about 2 year after 10 000 years of preconditioning as described in section 3 2 as long as oxygen is present nitrate does not react the slight decrease in the concentration is caused by diffusion into the rock matrix when the oxygen is gone nitrate reduction starts at this stage fe2 is present in the fracture and nitrate decreases rapidly denitrification is followed by goethite and ferrihydrite precipitation this and pyrite oxidation produces h in the fracture table 1 which lowers ph from 9 1 in equilibrium with carbonate rocks to 6 9 7 1 neutral values as the ph decreases more siderite dissolves and more fe2 is released fig 5 downstream of the nitrate reduction front in the fracture the ph is slightly increasing again concentrations of goethite in the fracture are comparable to ferrihydrite goethite as a product of denitrification precipitates conjointly with the nitrate decrease after a travel time of about another 4 5 years in the anoxic zone the groundwater is free of nitrate an increasing amount of n2 appears in the fracture as a product of denitrification further downstream of the reaction front of nitrate n2 behaves as a conservative tracer diffusing into the rock matrix sulphate concentration in the fracture equilibrated with the matrix during the 10 000 years long preconditioning period and is not significantly affected during anthropogenic nitrate input within the last 100 years correspondingly the concentration of so4 2 stays almost at a constant level downstream of the oxygen front during the first 10 000 years oxygen is spreading in the first 2 mm of the rock matrix dissolving 0 54 mol of pyrite the subsequent 100 years of nitrate input result in consumption of additional 0 19 mol of siderite fig 6 secondary siderite precipitates in the rock matrix as a result of diffusive redistribution of fe2 see sm 1 fe2 oxidation leads to ferrihydrite and goethite precipitation in amounts of 0 45 and 0 21 mol accordingly which means that 32 of produced fe2 is consumed in denitrification 4 2 sensitivity analysis to understand the model behaviour in relation and response to parameter changes a series of model simulations with different parameter settings were performed these settings were generated by a systematic variation of individual parameters one at a time method of the base case model we considered a number of fractured aquifer properties namely fracture aperture rock matrix porosity and total mineral concentration which all are expected to vary across the catchment further we investigate the role of nitrate input concentration and the relevance of the duration of the preconditioning period the parameter ranges were set in accordance to field observations in the case study area and literature research about muschelkalk properties with hydraulic conductivity values ranging between 2 6 10 6 to 1 10 4 m s depending on the degree of karstification d affonseca et al 2020 and observed fracture spacings osenbrück et al 2021 from a few decimeters to several meters the range of reasonable values of fracture apertures in the case study area was estimated using the cubic law snow 1965 to be between 0 1 and 1 mm the variation of nitrate input concentrations in the case study area is not known measurements in the monitoring wells show concentrations of up to 0 79 mmol l table 1 depending on agricultural practices growing season recharge intensity and soil characteristics values might be considerably higher matrix porosity in the micritic upper muschelkalk limestone was determined to range from 0 1 to 2 and total content of fe ii bearing minerals to be up to 4 vol section 2 the duration of oxygen input being linked to the end of the last glacial period has been varied between 30 000 years assumed latest time of start of melting and 3000 years to confirm the hypothesis that preconditioning is sufficiently established even after much shorter periods of oxygen input minimum and maximum values of the parameters considered in this sensitivity analysis are summarized in table 3 in comparison to the base case settings for some parameters we extend the range of variation beyond the bounds described above to see the model response relative parameter change is defined as p p i p 0 where p 0 and p i denote the reference base case value of the parameter and its variation respectively model sensitivity in response to individual parameter changes is evaluated by means of the difference in travel time required to reduce the nitrate input concentration entering the fracture across the upgradient model boundary by 60 which is hereafter denoted as τ 60 the results are displayed in fig 7 note that nitrate degradation in the fracture starts only after oxygen is completely depleted thus the location of the oxygen front in terms of travel time represents a lower limit for τ 60 for the base case the oxygen free zone in the fracture starts at approx τ 2 years nitrate reduction by 60 is achieved within approx 4 5 years and complete denitrification within 5 5 years see fig 5 changes of the oxygen input duration cause only a slight variation of τ 60 values obviously the preconditioning of the redox system in the model domain is nearly completed after 3000 years such that any longer oxygen input does not remarkably change the initial conditions relevant for the nitrate transport through the system the decrease of the nitrate input load either due to a lower input concentration or a lower fracture aperture obviously leads to a faster nitrate reduction fig 7 vice versa τ 60 increases with nitrate input concentration and fracture aperture a decrease of the fracture aperture is raising the surface area to volume ratio of the fracture matrix system prompting quasi parabolic dependency similar to existing analytical solutions for the fractured systems e g rahman et al 2004 sidborn and neretnieks 2007 a change in mineral content has only a minor effect on the value of τ 60 as long as a sufficient amount of minerals is available a limitation is observed for values below approx 30 of the base case content i e 0 15 vol matrix porosity controls the diffusive mass transfer between matrix and fracture with larger porosity values of τ 60 are reduced considerably this is due to a faster reduction of both oxygen and nitrate please note that in all modelled scenarios porosity changes due to precipitation and diagenesis of the rock matrix are insignificant the denitrification potential has been found to be at maximum if pyrite and an iron carbonate here siderite are present in the rock matrix in comparable concentrations the dominance of one mineral fraction leads to significantly lower denitrification please see sm 2 for the scenario where only pyrite is present and sm 3 where only siderite is present fig 8 shows how variations of individual parameter values do change the reaction curve and modelled groundwater concentrations moderate variations p 2 p0 and p 0 5 p0 as well as maximum variations p pmin and p pmax are considered settings that favour the reduction of nitrate in the aquifer cause a steepening of the reactive curve and a shift to lower travel times while less favourable conditions compared to the base case are indicated by smoother curves shifted to larger travel times the profile of modelled nitrate concentrations does change in accordance with the change in the reactive curve note that for this illustration the shape parameter of the travel time distribution is set to α 5 see the following sections for its specific role obviously a variation of more than one parameter may lead to larger changes in model results than the variation of a single parameter qualitatively this can be easily read from the results of the sensitivity analysis as parameter changes that favour nitrate degradation will sum up to an even higher degradation to give an example fig 8 shows the effect of a simultaneous change of three parameters mineral content fracture aperture and matrix porosity 4 3 calibration of travel time distribution s shape to calculate nitrate concentration in groundwater the modelled nitrate concentration in groundwater c gw i t at some particular location i for a given time t depends on the outcome of the reactive transport simulation reaction function and on the specific pdf of travel time at the considered location see eqns 1 to 4 with this approach the modelled concentration of nitrate in groundwater depends on the parameter setting of the geochemical model and the shape parameter α i in f i τ τ i α i for a given reaction curve representing the result of the geochemical model with a particular parameter setting for the time of interest here t 100 a the concentration value c gw i t τ i α i is a function of the shape parameter α i of the pdf of travel time by comparison with the measured concentration the optimal α i value providing the best model fit can be determined however uncertainty in geochemical model parameters leads to a non uniqueness of the model calibration consequently any pair of measured values of nitrate concentration in groundwater and mean travel time may be explained through the model by different parameter combinations this is illustrated for the example of a single concentration measurement at location tbbrhz c gw tbbrhz 9 68 10 3 mmol l τ sul 1 37 7 years against which the model namely the travel time distribution s shape parameter α bbrhz has been fitted fig 9 for clarification the fitting is shown for two different parameter settings of the geochemical model here different total mineral concentration 0 05 vol and 0 5 vol respectively 4 4 comparison with field data in order to prove the feasibility of the model approach for the particular conditions of microbial denitrification being limited to the fractures due to small pore sizes of the rock matrix we compare modelled nitrate concentration with the data τ c gw i measured in monitoring and production wells as well as springs table 1 to reflect in an exemplary way the uncertainty demonstrated in the sensitivity analysis two different parameter settings are considered here i the reference scenario base case as has been discussed above and ii a scenario with limited availability of minerals total mineral content mc 0 05 vol modelling with these two settings provide the reaction curves that correspond to the bounds of this parameter range recall that model results are largely insensitive to an increase in mineral content compared to the base case as depicted in fig 7 in the context of this exemplary analysis we may claim these two reaction curves are forming the envelope of plausible reactive model results see fig 9a and grey shaded areas in right column of fig 10 by convolution with the pdf of travel time f τ τ α we obtain a plausibility area in which the model can explain the measured data pairs τ c c0 i the shape of this area varies with the shape parameter α see green shaded areas in right column of fig 10 for all data pairs located within this plausibility area it is possible to exactly fit the model by different model parameter settings model fits can be achieved for all production wells and springs and most of the monitoring wells all data points above the plausibility area indicate either a mismatch with the assumed initial nitrate concentration this is obviously the case where measured nitrate concentration is above the average concentration used as model input concentration or less favourable conditions for denitrification as could be represented in the model by deviating other parameters values from the base case setting as shown in fig 8 except for a few monitoring wells where rather low nitrate concentrations have been measured at very young apparent groundwater age see table 1 and fig 2 the model sufficiently explains the field observations the numerical simulation results give a clear indication that observed nitrate concentrations can indeed be explained by microbial denitrification in the fracture alone 4 5 long term propagation of nitrate front due to ongoing agricultural practices in the study area we expect a continuous input of nitrate also in the future consequently the nitrate reduction front will propagate further downgradient fig 11 shows how the reaction curve for denitrification will develop during the next centuries according to the reference scenario model fig 11 left the nitrate reduction front is retarded but does not move linear with time this is in accordance with analytical solutions for specific simplified cases describing a similar setting which show that the retardation factor increases with the square root of time a current reduction of fertilization would considerably slow down the front propagation see fig 11 right for the example of a 50 reduction 5 conclusion and outlook the travel time based hydrogeochemical model developed in the study is a comparably simple but computationally efficient tool to simulate solute transport in a fractured aquifer on the catchment scale simulation results for the muschelkalk aquifer in the catchment of the river ammer show that the model is able to realistically describe measured nitrate concentrations in groundwater for the special properties of the aquifer considered in this work namely for low porosity and small size of the pores of the rock matrix which restricts bacterial activity to the fracture though being diffusion limited mass transfer of electron donors from the matrix to the fracture obviously is sufficient to establish nitrate reduction in the fracture large enough to achieve the nitrate decrease over the travel time observed in the catchment denitrification is driven by redox reactions involving pyrite and iron carbonate together and causes a decrease in ph which further enhances release of fe2 from siderite dissolving in the rock matrix which may be considered as a self enhancing process if pyrite and siderite are present simultaneously then an optimum in no3 degradation is observed diffusive flux of the electron donor from the rock matrix to the fracture and the location of the oxygen front are the major factors controlling the nitrate reduction the model response on parameter variations has shown that fracture aperture input concentration and porosity are of a high importance for the location and propagation of the nitrate reduction front whereas the duration of system preconditioning assumed time since the last glaciation is of minor importance all physical and geochemical parameters required to describe nitrate transport in fractured aquifers vary in space and can be evaluated in nature only to some limited extent and detail data obtained from a number of drill cores and outcrops unavoidably provide an incomplete picture with respect to the geometry of relevant karstic features as well as to the range and spatial variation of parameter values given this situation the applied model makes use of effective parameter values in the sense of the average properties of the rock formation in the model domain we believe that this approach if encompassing an uncertainty analysis is reasonable available field data do also not allow the reliable estimation of the distribution of travel time through the aquifer to the measurement locations the unknown shape of these travel time distributions adds even more uncertainty with the simplified model approach proposed in this work this uncertainty can be addressed by stochastic simulations these will extend the findings on the role of individual geochemical parameters presented herein further work will include also the additional consideration of solutes that are subject to other processes such as sorption and radioactive decay the following are the supplementary data related to this article overview of supplementary materials supplementary

1289,this study attempts to learn the groundwater salinization mechanism in the large and well populated coastal gujarat alluvial plain under growing anthropogenic pressures for this purpose geochemical compositions and 87sr 86sr were analyzed in 53 groundwater samples collected in the three different seasons during 2016 2017 additionally surface water samples collected in each season from two nearby large rivers narmada and tapi and urban sewage discharge of surat city were also analyzed excluding a few salinity hotspots ec 8 18 ms cm the seasonal average of ec 2 3 2 5 ms cm in groundwater shows little fluctuations negating evaporation as the major salinization process localized anthropogenic inputs as traced using no3 also fail to explain the widespread groundwater salinity a strong marine influence on the groundwater salinity is revealed by an average cl br of 655 104 mol mol in groundwater except a few outliers falling close to the seawater composition the lateral seawater intrusion at shallow depths is generally not supported by the freshening of coastal groundwater samples and generally seaward movements of shallow groundwater as indicated by regional piezometric heads however few ca mg cl type groundwaters collected from north of the narmada river fall in the piezometric depressions and hint at seawater intrusion and or upconing of deep saline aquifers the sr isotope budget in most of the alluvial groundwater samples is controlled by the seepage groundwater seawater mixing exceptional 87sr 86sr values owing to sr inputs from different age terrains are found in the northeastern groundwater and a few groundwater samples collected downslope of ancient deposits in the central alluvium the upconing of salty waters having marine signatures partly altered by aquifer water interactions primarily governs the regional groundwater salinity which makes the study area vulnerable to continued salinization by excessive groundwater extraction

accessible freshwater in coastal alluvial aquifers is largely impacted by its massive loss as submarine groundwater discharge kwon et al 2014 moore 2010 zhou et al 2019 and or salinization due to subterranean ingress of seawater antonellini et al 2008 barlow and reichard 2010 steyl and dennis 2010 werner 2010 seasonal water exchange between coastal aquifers and seas hints at a delicate coastal water balance michael et al 2005 which is getting perturbed by alarmingly rising sea levels and excessive groundwater extraction worldwide sherif and singh 1999 werner et al 2013 werner and simmons 2009 in the future these perturbations may lead to a temporary to permanent seawater intrusion far inland in the most vulnerable coastal alluvial plains while the planning to tackle the problem of seawater intrusion in coastal regions is underway worldwide it is essential to first ascertain the region specific groundwater salinization mechanism particularly from well populated alluvial plains already suffering from anthropogenic pressures the groundwater salinization in coastal regions is a major sustainability issue in india cwc 2017 seawater intrusion has been highlighted as the major controlling factor of groundwater salinity in several hard rock as well as alluvial coastal aquifers of india kanagaraj et al 2018 maurya et al 2019 mondal et al 2011 soni and pujari 2010 whereas rising anthropogenic inputs have been demonstrated to be primarily responsible for groundwater salinity particularly in multilayered aquifers of pondicherry and cuddalore southeast india gassama et al 2012 in this study we attempt to delineate major controls of groundwater salinity in the densely populated coastal gujarat alluvial plain india this water stressed region is under high anthropogenic pressure from densely populated urban suburban areas as well as decadal expansion of agricultural lands sharma et al 2019 the declining water table below the modern sea level at many places in the region panda et al 2012 vengadesan and lakshmanan 2019 hints at the likelihood of active seawater intrusion additional support for the marine influence on the regional groundwater quality comes from past sea transgressions in the proximal basin of the mahi river raj et al 1998 and references therein thus it is imperative to delineate the regional groundwater salinization mechanism that may also be applicable for other coastal alluvial plains given the past incidences of sea ingress and or ongoing anthropogenic pressures to pin down various marine and terrestrial controls of the regional groundwater salinity we have measured major trace ions and radiogenic sr isotope ratio in 53 groundwater samples and a few riverine sewage water samples collected in different seasons of 2016 2017 the conservative ions of cl and br are widely used to trace seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers alcalá and custodio 2008 andreasen and fleck 1997 awaleh et al 2022 davis et al 1998 while other major ions in groundwater and surface waters are traditionally used to infer selective mineral weathering elango and kannan 2007 sarin et al 1989 radiogenic sr isotopes are used to trace solutes contributed by aquifer water interactions along the groundwater flow path blum et al 1993 collerson et al 1988 négrel et al 2004 neumann and dreiss 1995 xie et al 2013 and to distinguish the modern and ancient seawater particularly in coastal aquifers khaska et al 2013 kim et al 2003 mahlknecht et al 2017 santoni et al 2016 starinsky et al 1980 2 geohydrological settings the study area belongs to the

reanalysis of online available data of water table depth from the regional monitoring wells of cgwb central groundwater board delhi the piezometric map fig 2d of the study area suggests generally seaward groundwater movements following the surface drainage network the piezometric head distributions along the groundwater sampling transect xy identify different hydrological conditions in the north and south of the narmada river the seasonally interpolated piezometric profiles and land topography along the aa and bb transects following the groundwater flow direction fig 2e f indicate a permanent piezometric depression in the northeastern vadodara district historical 2000 2020 water table fluctuations and district wise annual rainfall departure are not inter correlated at selected locations from the aa and bb transects fig 2g h thus significant water table fluctuations only at the piezometric hotspot location segwa chowki vadodara seem to be suggestive of groundwater overexploitation as the most plausible reason for the northeastern piezometric depression 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection the groundwater samples 2 l were collected from domestic submersible pumps except for gw 8 and gw 11 taken from handpumps in the sampled area of the coastal gujarat alluvial plain fig 1 the sampling was done during the neap tides in the monsoon sep 2016 post monsoon dec 2016 and pre monsoon may 2017 seasons fig s2 a few water samples from the narmada and the tapi rivers and urban sewage of surat were also collected in each season the geographical coordinates of the collected groundwater and surface water samples along with the measured geochemical isotope data are given in tables 1 and 2 respectively 3 2 analytical methodology all water samples were filtered through mixed cellulose filters millipore pore size 0 22 μm using a vacuum filtration system soon after their recovery to our laboratory high sediment load in surface waters was first reduced by 0 45 μm filtration before the 0 22 μm filtration small aliquots of the filtered samples were titrated immediately to determine alkalinity while the other aliquots were stored as frozen in previously cleaned polypropylene pp bottles for later measurements of major ions for dissolved trace element and isotope measurements separate filtered aliquots were acidified to ph 2 3 with high purity concentrated hcl suprapur grade merck and stored in acid pre cleaned pp bottles the concentrations of major ions in suitably diluted water samples were analyzed by ion chromatography metrohm 883 basic ic using metrosep c 4 100 and metrosep a supp 4 columns for elution of major cations and anions respectively the ion chromatograph was calibrated by analyzing certified multi cation anion standard solutions sigma aldrich the rsd of the measurements was 10 as determined from repeat measurements of the middle calibration standard the charge balance error of 10 15 is generally obtained for the major ion concentrations in individual samples for trace element concentrations the samples were processed inside a clean lab at iiser bhopal following the analytical protocols used in previous studies singh et al 2011 singh et al 2013 mn concentration was measured directly in the filtered and acidified stored samples by external calibration while sr concentration was determined by the isotope dilution method using a quadrupole icpms i cap thermofisher scientific at iiser bhopal briefly precisely weighed 84sr enriched spike powder srco3 purchased from oak ridge national laboratory tennessee usa was dissolved in 10 of hno3 ultrapur grade merck and diluted suitably with milli q water the diluted spike solution was calibrated against multiple aliquots of varying proportions of slrs 6 crm national research council canada the sr concentration was determined from the 84sr 86sr ratio free from rb isobaric interferences measured in the precisely weighed sample spike mixtures the cumulative variance cv of 3 is obtained for sr concentration measurements in groundwater duplicates table 3 for sr isotope measurements aliquots from the filtered and acidified stored samples corresponding to 1 2 μg of sr were dried and dissolved in 2 n hcl double distilled using a sub boiling distillation unit dst 1000 from savillex inside a clean lab at iiser bhopal sr was purified from the dissolved sample matrix using the cation exchange column chemistry on the resin ag 50 w x8 following kumar et al 2018 the 87sr 86sr ratio in purified sr aliquots was determined using mc icpms neptune plus thermofisher scientific at iiser bhopal samples were introduced into the plasma via apex ir esi introduction system at a flow rate of 100 μl min the isotope data were collected using multiple faraday cups after 40 baseline measurements of 1 s integration the data acquisition was done for 40 80 cycles of 8 s integration time per cycle no blank correction was performed on the measured 87sr 86sr ratio as the total procedural sr blank 700 pg was 2 3 orders of magnitude lower as compared to the minimum sr analyte processed in the samples the accuracy of 87sr 86sr measurements was ensured from repeat measurements of the nist isotope standard srm 987 bracketing the samples the measured 87sr 86sr for srm 987 of 0 710334 0 000012 2 s n 16 is in agreement with the certified value of 0 71034 0 00026 however for a better comparison with the literature data we normalized our sr isotope data to generally accepted 87sr 86sr value of srm 987 0 710248 weis et al 2006 the 87sr 86sr measurements in groundwater duplicates are reproducible within uncertainty table 3 4 results the geochemical as well as sr isotope data of the groundwater and surface water samples of different seasons are given in tables 1 2 basic parameters and major ion concentrations in the groundwater samples vary as temperature 21 6 33 8 c electrical conductivity ec 0 4 17 9 ms cm hco3 0 44 13 33 mm f 0 03 0 21 mm cl 0 86 162 25 mm br 0 01 0 29 mm no3 0 01 2 21 mm po4 0 03 0 07 mm so4 0 09 26 08 mm na 1 53 164 09 mm k 0 01 2 90 mm ca 0 04 5 00 mm and mg 0 18 19 27 mm the average values of these data agree well with the earlier reported values for groundwater in coastal aquifers of the kutch district gujarat maurya et al 2019 the average concentrations of major cations and anions in groundwater follow the sequences of na mg ca k and cl hco3 so4 respectively the most abundant na and cl ions suggest a widespread marine influence on the groundwater salinity and or anthropogenic inputs during different seasons the marine influence is further supported by the average cl br of 655 104 mol mol in groundwater except a few outliers falling close to that of modern seawater alcalá and custodio 2008 davis et al 1998 whereas spikes of high no3 concentrations in some of the shallow groundwater samples indicate local anthropogenic inputs as observed elsewhere appelo and postma 2004 calderon et al 2014 gassama et al 2012 except for gw 52 mn 7 1 μm the low average mn concentration of 1 2 1 0 μm indicates generally oxic groundwater the role of mineral weathering drever 1988 during aquifer water interactions in contributing to groundwater salinity is further suggested by higher hco3 concentration in some of the groundwater samples as compared to that in the riverine waters as well as the modern seawater doe 1994 dissolved sr concentration and its radiogenic isotope ratio in the groundwater samples of different seasons vary extensively as sr 4 0 77 1 μm and 87sr 86sr 0 7081 0 7124 these data in the narmada river waters vary as sr 1 4 2 5 μm and 87sr 86sr 0 7098 0 7107 while in the tapi river waters as sr 2 0 2 9 μm and 87sr 86sr 0 7087 0 7089 these results agree well with the earlier reported values for a limited number of groundwater and the river water samples from the study area rahaman and singh 2012 interestingly the riverine as well as groundwater samples of different seasons show more radiogenic 87sr 86sr than the reported values for the highland deccan basalt lithology 0 7059 0 7066 melluso et al 2004 the groundwater samples of gw 16 to gw 18 monsoonal and gw 34 to gw 38 post monsoonal collected from northeastern alluvial aquifers located close to the aravalli granites are characterized by more radiogenic 87sr 86sr 0 7094 0 7124 table 1 than the modern seawater value 0 70916 palmer and edmond 1989 whereas other groundwater samples generally show less radiogenic 87sr 86sr values as compared to those of the regional riverine sediments 0 7095 0 7305 goswami et al 2012 acting as precursor grains of the gujarat alluvium these observations indicate marine as well as non marine sources contributing sr to the regional groundwater besides mineral dissolution during aquifer water interactions anthropogenic sr input is also plausible as mineral fertilizers are generally reported to have 87sr 86sr 0 708 0 709 vitoria et al 2004 widory et al 2004 overlapping to that of our groundwater samples 5 discussion for the sake of convenience the groundwater samples are grouped into three classes with increasing minimum distance of sampling locations from the nearest shore creak estuary the boundaries are placed arbitrarily at distances of 5 km 5 20 km and 20 km this classification helps to better understand the regional groundwater salinization mechanism in the terms of seawater intrusion and typical hydrogeochemical processes occurring in the coastal inland and far inland aquifers the spatial distributions of ec in groundwater for different seasons reveal that gw 7 collected in the monsoon season and the pre monsoonal samples of gw 41 and gw 58 are the hotspots of groundwater salinity ec 8 7 17 9 ms cm fig 2a c there is no consistency in the spatial distribution pattern of ec despite the significant lowering of the water table in the northeastern area and the presence of micro crystals of halites and gypsum in coastal soils of the sampled area kooistra 1983 this observation suggests that local anthropogenic inputs and or hydrogeochemical processes varying with aquifer sampling depth may control the groundwater salinity the highest ec of 17 9 ms cm in the coastal groundwater sample of gw 41 hints at the marine influence by seawater mixing and or sprayed seasalt dissolution estuarine seawater intrusion might have influenced the salinity of gw 58 ec 11 6 ms cm located close to the narmada river whereas high salinity ec 8 7 ms cm in the inland monsoonal groundwater of gw 7 is puzzling and might be driven by multiple salinization processes and or anthropogenic inputs the possible controls of the groundwater salinity are discussed below in sub sections 5 1 groundwater evaporation the seasonal average of groundwater temperature 1 s varies significantly as 29 7 1 1 c 27 0 1 8 c and 30 9 1 2 c in the monsoon post monsoon and pre monsoon seasons respectively whereas the average ec in the regional groundwater excluding the salinity hotspots of gw 7 gw 41 and gw 58 fig 3 shows seasonally invariant values of 2 3 1 4 ms cm 2 3 1 5 ms cm and 2 5 1 3 ms cm in the monsoon post monsoon and pre monsoon seasons respectively a one way anova test also suggests that the average ec in groundwater excluding the three salinity hotspots is not significantly altered in different seasons at the 95 confident interval f 1 385 p value 0 260 thus evaporation can be ruled out as the major cause of the widespread groundwater salinity in the region 5 2 anthropogenic inputs anthropogenic solute inputs to groundwater can easily be traced using dissolved no3 mostly sourced from irrigation return flow and leachate leakage of sewage landfill feedlot effluents gassama et al 2012 jiang et al 2009 keeney 1989 widory et al 2004 large anthropogenic inputs of no3 1 mm from localized sources are generally found in some of the shallow groundwater samples of different seasons fig 4 the relatively lower no3 1 mm in most of the groundwater samples drawn from different depths including the groundwater salinity hotspots could be the result of either minor anthropogenic inputs or denitrification owing to reducing conditions however low dissolved mn 2 μm except for the gw 8 gw 38 gw 51 and gw 52 indicate generally oxic and anthropogenically less perturbed groundwater further the difference in mean ec of the groundwater samples irrespective of the season having large anthropogenic inputs of no3 1 mm and those having the natural background levels of no3 0 1 mm appelo and postma 2004 is found to be insignificant at the 95 confidence interval t score 0 2497 p value 0 8056 df 18 the strong cl conductivity correlation table 4 in groundwater even after excluding the salinity hotspots confirms abundant cl ion as a reliable tracer of the regional groundwater salinity table 4 also shows the poor and insignificant correlations of cl ion with dissolved nutrients of no3 po4 k and so4 which suggests different entrainment pathways of these ions into the groundwater thus anthropogenic influence if any on groundwater is local only which also fails to explain the widespread groundwater salinity 5 3 marine influence the conservative ions of cl and br are reliable coupled tracers of groundwater salinity alcalá and custodio 2008 awaleh et al 2022 davis et al 1998 fabryka martin et al 1991 louvat et al 1999 strong and significant seasonal clbr correlations r2 0 92 0 99 p value 0 0001 fig 5a in the groundwater samples scattered around the seawater dilution line excluding the gw 7 gw 18 and gw 52 indicate a predominant marine influence on the regional groundwater salinity most of the groundwater samples have a similar cl br ratio but intermediate cl concentration as compared to the fields of seawater and coastal recharge waters fig 5b alcalá and custodio 2008 awaleh et al 2022 and references therein which could be due to seawater freshwater mixing the overlapping fields of septic effluents wastewaters make it difficult to unbiasedly deconvolute further the marine signatures the low cl br in gw 18 and gw 52 could be attributed to anthropogenic br inputs from pesticides used in agricultural lands feedlots while high cl br generally coupled with high nutrients so4 or no3 in the groundwater samples of gw 7 gw 35 gw 36 and gw 56 is likely derived from septic effluents wastewaters generally groundwater samples having relatively higher salinity fall close to the seawater composition in the piper diagram piper 1944 fig 6a which also suggests marine influence as the most plausible reason for the widespread groundwater salinity in the region fig 6b depicts different water types seawater freshwater mixing line and hydrogeochemical facies evolution trends during groundwater freshening and salinization processes following calderon et al 2014 a majority of groundwater samples are of nacl type in each of the sampled seasons exceptional groundwater samples are of the types of mgcl gw 18 ca mg cl gw 5 gw 16 gw 34 gw 35 gw 50 and gw60 ca mg hco3 gw 26 gw 33 and gw 51 and na ca hco3 gw 3 gw 47 and gw 49 the riverine freshwaters and urban sewage samples from a coastal creak in surat are particularly of ca mg hco3 and nacl type respectively the ca mg hco3 type groundwater samples gw 26 and gw 33 ec 0 7 ms cm from far inland alluvial aquifers indicate freshwater recharge besides vertical infiltration of meteoric waters groundwater seepage from the ukai dam reservoir could be another freshwater source for the downslope gw 26 and other groundwater samples located particularly in the tapi river basin figs 1 and 2d whereas the northeastern groundwater gw 33 has major ion composition similar to that of the narmada river indicating a common freshwater source or the river water groundwater exchange the salinity hotspots of gw 7 and gw 58 fall close to the seawater composition while most of the inland groundwater samples either fall around the seawater freshwater mixing line or follow the groundwater salinization trend on the other hand the salinity hotspot of gw 41 and other groundwater samples located in the coastal area follow the groundwater freshening trend in the piper diagram fig 6b this observation is also supported by the seaward moment of headwaters fig 2d e preventing the lateral seawater intrusion at shallow depths in the sampled coastal aquifers during any of the seasons most of the groundwater samples lying in the seawater quadrant of the chadha plot chadha 1999 fig 7 also indicate a dominating marine influence over the simple ion exchange process interestingly the ca mg cl type far inland groundwater samples from the northeastern piezometric depression fig 2 are typically placed at the common boundary of seawater and reverse ion exchange quadrants fig 7 this observation suggests a likelihood of the upconing from deep saline aquifers and or a leading edge of lateral seawater intrusion from north of the narmada river alfarrah and walraevens 2018 awaleh et al 2018 the lateral advance of the seawater freshwater interface by deep aquifer upconing at inland distances of a few tens of km from other coastal seas has already been demonstrated by earlier studies garcía menéndez et al 2016 ma et al 2019 5 4 aquifer water interactions by and large groundwater samples of different seasons follow the seawater dilution line in the scatter plots of cl versus na and so4 fig 8a b suggesting again the marine influence whereas some of the groundwater samples show higher na and or so4 concentrations than those expected from the seawater dilution line given the marine source of cl section 5 3 the non marine contribution excess of na in these groundwater samples fig 8a seems to be derived from the cation exchange process during aquifer freshening and or by dissolution of minerals such as plagioclase and alkali carbonates as previously suggested for the kutch region maurya et al 2019 whereas excess so4 in the gw 7 gw 36 and gw 55 fig 8b could be derived from gypsum dissolution and or localized anthropogenic inputs from septic effluents as previously discussed based on the cl br ratio section 5 3 thus excess so4 of 22 mm fig 8b and excess ca of 4 mm only fig 8c in the salinity hotspot of gw 7 seem related to localized anthropogenic inputs or gypsum dissolution followed by ca removal in calcite precipitation due to a common ion effect luo et al 2018 on the other hand so4 in the salinity hotspots of gw 41 and gw 58 fig 8b is primarily of a marine origin in the scatter plot of ca versus mg fig 8d groundwater samples of different seasons generally follow two trends diverging from the seawater line since the cation exchange process can not significantly fractionate the divalent ions of ca and mg these diverging trends indicate mineral precipitation dissolution reactions during aquifer water interactions the group 1 groundwater samples encircled in black fig 8d located on or downslope of the tertiary fluviomarine deposits in the central area fig 1 are generally enriched in ca probably due to limestone gypsum dissolution in the ancient deposits whereas the mg enrichment in group 2 groundwater samples collected from the alluvium is expected from preferential weathering of mafic minerals or mg smectites etc interestingly the scatter plot of cl versus sr fig 9a depicts that coastal groundwater samples generally fall in the mixing envelope of modern seawater and freshwater endmembers meteoric water river waters and groundwater seepage of gw 26 and gw 33 while the inland groundwater samples show higher sr concentration than that expected from the seawater mixing no discernible covarying trend in the no3 sr scatter plot fig 9b rules out widespread anthropogenic sr inputs on the other hand a significant clsr correlation r2 0 67 p value 0 0001 fig 9a is found in the inland groundwater samples mostly having cl of marine origin and sr addition by aquifer water interactions this observation hints at the upconing of deep saline aquifers where excess sr is added during the seawater intrusion or previously trapped seawater and or groundwater accumulation of seasalt in percolated waters to explore the sources of solutes x contributed by the aquifer water interaction we have calculated excess of na k ca mg and sr in groundwater by considering the major ion composition of seawater doe 1994 using eq 1 as given below 1 x excess x measured cl measured x cl seawater the scatter plot of excess ca versus excess mg fig 10a shows that group 1 and group 2 groundwater samples are orthogonal which rules out the widespread congruent dedolomitization in the region however incongruent dedolomitization dolomite dissolution and calcite precipitation de groot 1967 evamy 1967 generally occurring in shallow limestone aquifers could not be ruled out as an additional source of excess mg excess sr in groundwater is inversely correlated with excess na k r2 0 11 p value 0 014 fig 10b indicating minor contributions from weathering of feldspars on the other hand the excess sr shows significant correlations with excess ca r2 0 50 p value 0 004 fig 10c and excess mg r2 0 60 p value 0 0001 fig 10d in group 1 and group 2 groundwater samples respectively this observation strongly suggests preferential weathering of mg rich minerals in the widespread alluvium as the cogenetic source of excess sr and excess mg to groundwater 5 5 sr isotope budget of groundwater the scatter plot of sr concentration versus 87sr 86sr fig 11 helps to delineate sr specific sources in groundwater contributed by water mixing and aquifer water interactions considered water endmembers are 1 modern seawater doe 1994 rai 2008 2 meteoric water chatterjee and singh 2012 3 riverine waters of the narmada and tapi this study rahaman and singh 2012 and 4 the northern gw 33 and southern gw 26 seepage groundwaters this study despite the significant sr contributions by aquifer water interactions many groundwater samples mostly from the alluvium are enclosed by the envelope of modern seawater mixing with the seepage groundwater endmembers the sr isotope trend toward the modern seawater composition along with increasing sr concentration in these groundwater samples indicates negligible sr contribution by the dissolution of mafic minerals sourced from the deccan basalt lithology having less radiogenic 87sr 86sr melluso et al 2004 moreover groundwater samples gw 4 gw 7 gw 46 and gw 58 fig 9a significantly impacted by aquifer water interactions show elevated sr concentration characterized by a marine composition of 87sr 86sr likely obtained by the dissolution of authigenic minerals precipitated during past sea transgressions earlier dowling et al 2003 has suggested the dissolution of vermiculites controlling the sr isotope budget of groundwater from alluvial aquifers in the bengal basin based on the srcl relationship in inland groundwater fig 9a we have estimated sr concentration in deep saline aquifers as 365 μm at salinity 35 the seawater mixing envelope gray area in fig 11 does not significantly alter even if the seawater endmember has dissolved sr of 365 μm after the sr addition by aquifer water interactions a growing number of pre monsoonal groundwater samples well distributed along the line of seawater mixing with the southern seepage endmember fig 11c indicates a significant impact of groundwater over extraction on the upconing of deep saline aquifers having marine signatures the exceptional groundwater samples can be categorized into three different classes the class 1 groundwater samples gw 16 to gw 18 and gw 34 to gw 38 belonging to the northeastern alluvium have more radiogenic 87sr 86sr possibly derived from nearby aravalli granites the class 2 groundwater samples gw 3 gw 5 gw 20 gw 42 and gw 43 collected from surat have lower sr concentrations and but 87sr 86sr comparable to that of the seepage groundwater which is expected from a dilution effect during the freshening of these coastal shallow alluvial aquifers moreover the class 3 groundwater samples group 1 encircled in black fig 11 collected from and or downslope of the ancient deposits show wide variations in 87sr 86sr of 0 7083 0 7094 and sr concentration of 4 3 47 6 μm interestingly a few downslope groundwater samples of gw 14 gw 31 and gw 53 depth 60 m have lower 87sr 86sr 0 7083 0 7086 than those of other groundwater samples 0 7088 0 7093 gw 25 gw 52 gw 54 and gw 55 more proximal to ancient deposits higher 87sr 86sr 0 7084 0 7094 in gw 7 gw 8 gw 13 gw 30 and gw 51 collected from the miocene pliocene deposits fossiliferous limestone marl sandstone and agate conglomerates could influence these proximal shallow groundwater samples of gw 25 gw 52 gw 54 and gw 55 whereas relatively low 87sr 86sr 0 7085 0 7088 of gw 12 and gw 27 collected from the eocene oligocene deposits argillaceous limestone and claystone sandstone most likely impacts the deep groundwater of gw 14 gw 31 and gw 53 this observation indicates that seepage groundwaters reaching downslope locations of ancient deposits are sourced from different bed formations having distinct 87sr 86sr ratio thus the sr isotope budget of the regional alluvial groundwater is primarily controlled by mixing between the seepage groundwater and deep saline aquifers having marine signatures while exceptional sr isotope signatures of different age terrains are found in the northeastern alluvium and few locations at and or downslope of ancient deposits in the central alluvium 6 conclusions in this study the coupling of major trace ions and radiogenic sr isotopes is utilized to delineate the widespread groundwater salinization mechanism in the coastal gujarat alluvial plain except for a few salinity hotspots the groundwater salinity shows overlapping seasonal variations negating the major role of groundwater evaporation the freshening of the coastal groundwater generally rules out the lateral seawater intrusion at shallow depths in the sampled area the upconing of deep saline aquifers having marine signatures seems to play a major role in the regional groundwater salinity besides this widespread marine influence aquifer water interactions substantially alter the geochemical sr isotope

1289,this study attempts to learn the groundwater salinization mechanism in the large and well populated coastal gujarat alluvial plain under growing anthropogenic pressures for this purpose geochemical compositions and 87sr 86sr were analyzed in 53 groundwater samples collected in the three different seasons during 2016 2017 additionally surface water samples collected in each season from two nearby large rivers narmada and tapi and urban sewage discharge of surat city were also analyzed excluding a few salinity hotspots ec 8 18 ms cm the seasonal average of ec 2 3 2 5 ms cm in groundwater shows little fluctuations negating evaporation as the major salinization process localized anthropogenic inputs as traced using no3 also fail to explain the widespread groundwater salinity a strong marine influence on the groundwater salinity is revealed by an average cl br of 655 104 mol mol in groundwater except a few outliers falling close to the seawater composition the lateral seawater intrusion at shallow depths is generally not supported by the freshening of coastal groundwater samples and generally seaward movements of shallow groundwater as indicated by regional piezometric heads however few ca mg cl type groundwaters collected from north of the narmada river fall in the piezometric depressions and hint at seawater intrusion and or upconing of deep saline aquifers the sr isotope budget in most of the alluvial groundwater samples is controlled by the seepage groundwater seawater mixing exceptional 87sr 86sr values owing to sr inputs from different age terrains are found in the northeastern groundwater and a few groundwater samples collected downslope of ancient deposits in the central alluvium the upconing of salty waters having marine signatures partly altered by aquifer water interactions primarily governs the regional groundwater salinity which makes the study area vulnerable to continued salinization by excessive groundwater extraction

water balance michael et al 2005 which is getting perturbed by alarmingly rising sea levels and excessive groundwater extraction worldwide sherif and singh 1999 werner et al 2013 werner and simmons 2009 in the future these perturbations may lead to a temporary to permanent seawater intrusion far inland in the most vulnerable coastal alluvial plains while the planning to tackle the problem of seawater intrusion in coastal regions is underway worldwide it is essential to first ascertain the region specific groundwater salinization mechanism particularly from well populated alluvial plains already suffering from anthropogenic pressures the groundwater salinization in coastal regions is a major sustainability issue in india cwc 2017 seawater intrusion has been highlighted as the major controlling factor of groundwater salinity in several hard rock as well as alluvial coastal aquifers of india kanagaraj et al 2018 maurya et al 2019 mondal et al 2011 soni and pujari 2010 whereas rising anthropogenic inputs have been demonstrated to be primarily responsible for groundwater salinity particularly in multilayered aquifers of pondicherry and cuddalore southeast india gassama et al 2012 in this study we attempt to delineate major controls of groundwater salinity in the densely populated coastal gujarat alluvial plain india this water stressed region is under high anthropogenic pressure from densely populated urban suburban areas as well as decadal expansion of agricultural lands sharma et al 2019 the declining water table below the modern sea level at many places in the region panda et al 2012 vengadesan and lakshmanan 2019 hints at the likelihood of active seawater intrusion additional support for the marine influence on the regional groundwater quality comes from past sea transgressions in the proximal basin of the mahi river raj et al 1998 and references therein thus it is imperative to delineate the regional groundwater salinization mechanism that may also be applicable for other coastal alluvial plains given the past incidences of sea ingress and or ongoing anthropogenic pressures to pin down various marine and terrestrial controls of the regional groundwater salinity we have measured major trace ions and radiogenic sr isotope ratio in 53 groundwater samples and a few riverine sewage water samples collected in different seasons of 2016 2017 the conservative ions of cl and br are widely used to trace seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers alcalá and custodio 2008 andreasen and fleck 1997 awaleh et al 2022 davis et al 1998 while other major ions in groundwater and surface waters are traditionally used to infer selective mineral weathering elango and kannan 2007 sarin et al 1989 radiogenic sr isotopes are used to trace solutes contributed by aquifer water interactions along the groundwater flow path blum et al 1993 collerson et al 1988 négrel et al 2004 neumann and dreiss 1995 xie et al 2013 and to distinguish the modern and ancient seawater particularly in coastal aquifers khaska et al 2013 kim et al 2003 mahlknecht et al 2017 santoni et al 2016 starinsky et al 1980 2 geohydrological settings the study area belongs to the gujarat alluvial plain lying in the southern part of the cambay rift basin the lithological map of the study area fig 1 is modified from bhukosh http bhukosh gsi gov in the precambrian rocks of the

sediments hydraulically connected to the gulf of cambay the gently sloping intermittent linear clay deposits indicate no widespread perched aquifer in the area fig 2 a c depicts the seasonal reanalysis of online available data of water table depth from the regional monitoring wells of cgwb central groundwater board delhi the piezometric map fig 2d of the study area suggests generally seaward groundwater movements following the surface drainage network the piezometric head distributions along the groundwater sampling transect xy identify different hydrological conditions in the north and south of the narmada river the seasonally interpolated piezometric profiles and land topography along the aa and bb transects following the groundwater flow direction fig 2e f indicate a permanent piezometric depression in the northeastern vadodara district historical 2000 2020 water table fluctuations and district wise annual rainfall departure are not inter correlated at selected locations from the aa and bb transects fig 2g h thus significant water table fluctuations only at the piezometric hotspot location segwa chowki vadodara seem to be suggestive of groundwater overexploitation as the most plausible reason for the northeastern piezometric depression 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection the groundwater samples 2 l were collected from domestic submersible pumps except for gw 8 and gw 11 taken from handpumps in the sampled area of the coastal gujarat alluvial plain fig 1 the sampling was done during the neap tides in the monsoon sep 2016 post monsoon dec 2016 and pre monsoon may 2017 seasons fig s2 a few water samples from the narmada and the tapi rivers and urban sewage of surat were also collected in each season the geographical coordinates of the collected groundwater and surface water samples along with the measured geochemical isotope data are given in tables 1 and 2 respectively 3 2 analytical methodology all water samples were filtered through mixed cellulose filters millipore pore size 0 22 μm using a vacuum filtration system soon after their recovery to our laboratory high sediment load in surface waters was first reduced by 0 45 μm filtration before the 0 22 μm filtration small aliquots of the filtered samples were titrated immediately to determine alkalinity while the other aliquots were stored as frozen in previously cleaned polypropylene pp bottles for later measurements of major ions for dissolved trace element and isotope measurements separate filtered aliquots were acidified to ph 2 3 with high purity concentrated hcl suprapur grade merck and stored in acid pre cleaned pp bottles the concentrations of major ions in suitably diluted water samples were analyzed by ion chromatography metrohm 883 basic ic using metrosep c 4 100 and metrosep a supp 4 columns for elution of major cations and anions respectively the ion chromatograph was calibrated by analyzing certified multi cation anion standard solutions sigma aldrich the rsd of the measurements was 10 as determined from repeat measurements of the middle calibration standard the charge balance error of 10 15 is generally obtained for the major ion concentrations in individual samples for trace element concentrations the samples were processed inside a clean lab at iiser bhopal following the analytical protocols used in previous studies singh et al 2011 singh et al 2013 mn concentration was measured directly in the filtered and acidified stored samples by external calibration while sr concentration was determined by the isotope dilution method using a quadrupole icpms i cap thermofisher scientific at iiser bhopal briefly precisely weighed 84sr enriched spike powder srco3 purchased from oak ridge national laboratory tennessee usa was dissolved in 10 of hno3 ultrapur grade merck and diluted suitably with milli q water the diluted spike solution was calibrated against multiple aliquots of varying proportions of slrs 6 crm national research council canada the sr concentration was determined from the 84sr 86sr ratio free from rb isobaric interferences measured in the precisely weighed sample spike mixtures the cumulative variance cv of 3 is obtained for sr concentration measurements in groundwater duplicates table 3 for sr isotope measurements aliquots from the filtered and acidified stored samples corresponding to 1 2 μg of sr were dried and dissolved in 2 n hcl double distilled using a sub boiling distillation unit dst 1000 from savillex inside a clean lab at iiser bhopal sr was purified from the dissolved sample matrix using the cation exchange column chemistry on the resin ag 50 w x8 following kumar et al 2018 the 87sr 86sr ratio in purified sr aliquots was determined using mc icpms neptune plus thermofisher scientific at iiser bhopal samples were introduced into the plasma via apex ir esi introduction system at a flow rate of 100 μl min the isotope data were collected using multiple faraday cups after 40 baseline measurements of 1 s integration the data acquisition was done for 40 80 cycles of 8 s integration time per cycle no blank correction was performed on the measured 87sr 86sr ratio as the total procedural sr blank 700 pg was 2 3 orders of magnitude lower as compared to the minimum sr analyte processed in the samples the accuracy of 87sr 86sr measurements was ensured from repeat measurements of the nist isotope standard srm 987 bracketing the samples the measured 87sr 86sr for srm 987 of 0 710334 0 000012 2 s n 16 is in agreement with the certified value of 0 71034 0 00026 however for a better comparison with the literature data we normalized our sr isotope data to generally accepted 87sr 86sr value of srm 987 0 710248 weis et al 2006 the 87sr 86sr measurements in groundwater duplicates are reproducible within uncertainty table 3 4 results the geochemical as well as sr isotope data of the groundwater and surface water samples of different seasons are given in tables 1 2 basic parameters and major ion concentrations in the groundwater samples vary as temperature 21 6 33 8 c electrical conductivity ec 0 4 17 9 ms cm hco3 0 44 13 33 mm f

data agree well with the earlier reported values for groundwater in coastal aquifers of the kutch district gujarat maurya et al 2019 the average concentrations of major cations and anions in groundwater follow the sequences of na mg ca k and cl hco3 so4 respectively the most abundant na and cl ions suggest a widespread marine influence on the groundwater salinity and or anthropogenic inputs during different seasons the marine influence is further supported by the average cl br of 655 104 mol mol in groundwater except a few outliers falling close to that of modern seawater alcalá and custodio 2008 davis et al 1998 whereas spikes of high no3 concentrations in some of the shallow groundwater samples indicate local anthropogenic inputs as observed elsewhere appelo and postma 2004 calderon et al 2014 gassama et al 2012 except for gw 52 mn 7 1 μm the low average mn concentration of 1 2 1 0 μm indicates generally oxic groundwater the role of mineral weathering drever 1988 during aquifer water interactions in contributing to groundwater salinity is further suggested by higher hco3 concentration in some of the groundwater samples as compared to that in the riverine waters as well as the modern seawater doe 1994 dissolved sr concentration and its radiogenic isotope ratio in the groundwater samples of different seasons vary extensively as sr 4 0 77 1 μm and 87sr 86sr 0 7081 0 7124 these data in the narmada river waters vary as sr 1 4 2 5 μm and 87sr 86sr 0 7098 0 7107 while in the tapi river waters as sr 2 0 2 9 μm and 87sr 86sr 0 7087 0 7089 these results agree well with the earlier reported values for a limited number of groundwater and the river water samples from the study area rahaman and singh 2012 interestingly the riverine as well as groundwater samples of different seasons show more radiogenic 87sr 86sr than the reported values for the highland deccan basalt lithology 0 7059 0 7066 melluso et al 2004 the groundwater samples of gw 16 to gw 18 monsoonal and gw 34 to gw 38 post monsoonal collected from northeastern alluvial aquifers located close to the aravalli granites are characterized by more radiogenic 87sr 86sr 0 7094 0 7124 table 1 than the modern seawater value 0 70916 palmer and edmond 1989 whereas other groundwater samples generally show less radiogenic 87sr 86sr values as compared to those of the regional riverine sediments 0 7095 0 7305 goswami et al 2012 acting as precursor grains of the gujarat alluvium these observations indicate marine as well as non marine sources contributing sr to the regional groundwater besides mineral dissolution during aquifer water interactions anthropogenic sr input is also plausible as mineral fertilizers are generally reported to have 87sr 86sr 0 708 0 709 vitoria et al 2004 widory et al 2004 overlapping to that of our groundwater samples 5 discussion for the sake of convenience the groundwater samples are grouped into three classes with increasing minimum distance of sampling locations from the nearest shore creak estuary the boundaries are placed arbitrarily at distances of 5 km 5 20 km and 20 km this classification helps to better understand the regional groundwater salinization mechanism in the terms of seawater intrusion and typical hydrogeochemical processes occurring in the coastal inland and far inland aquifers the spatial distributions of ec in groundwater for different seasons reveal that gw 7 collected in the monsoon season and the pre monsoonal samples of gw 41 and gw 58 are the hotspots of groundwater salinity ec 8 7 17 9 ms cm fig 2a c there is no consistency in the spatial distribution pattern of ec despite the significant lowering of the water table in the northeastern area and the presence of micro crystals of halites and gypsum in coastal soils of the sampled area kooistra 1983 this observation suggests that local anthropogenic inputs and or hydrogeochemical processes varying with aquifer sampling depth may control the groundwater salinity the highest ec of 17 9 ms cm in the coastal groundwater sample of gw 41 hints at the marine influence by seawater mixing and or sprayed seasalt dissolution estuarine seawater intrusion might have influenced the salinity of gw 58 ec 11 6 ms cm located close to the narmada river whereas high salinity ec 8 7 ms cm in the inland monsoonal groundwater of gw 7 is puzzling and might be driven by multiple salinization processes and or anthropogenic inputs the possible controls of the groundwater salinity are discussed below in sub sections 5 1 groundwater evaporation the seasonal average of groundwater temperature 1 s varies significantly as 29 7 1 1 c 27 0 1 8 c and 30 9 1 2 c in the monsoon post monsoon and pre monsoon seasons respectively whereas the average ec in the regional groundwater excluding the salinity hotspots of gw 7 gw 41 and gw 58 fig 3 shows seasonally invariant values of 2 3 1 4 ms cm 2 3 1 5 ms cm and 2 5 1 3 ms cm in the monsoon post monsoon and pre monsoon seasons respectively a one way anova test also suggests that the average ec in groundwater excluding the three salinity hotspots is not significantly altered in different seasons at the 95 confident interval f 1 385 p value 0 260 thus evaporation can be ruled out as the major cause of the widespread groundwater salinity in the region 5 2 anthropogenic inputs anthropogenic solute inputs to groundwater can easily be traced using dissolved no3 mostly sourced from irrigation return flow and leachate leakage of sewage landfill feedlot effluents gassama et al 2012 jiang et al 2009 keeney 1989 widory et al 2004 large anthropogenic inputs of no3 1 mm from localized sources are generally found in some of the shallow groundwater samples of different seasons fig 4 the relatively lower no3 1 mm in most of the groundwater samples drawn from different depths including the groundwater salinity hotspots could be the result of either minor anthropogenic inputs or denitrification owing to reducing conditions however low dissolved mn 2 μm except for the gw 8 gw 38 gw 51 and gw 52 indicate generally oxic and anthropogenically less perturbed groundwater further the difference in mean ec of the groundwater samples irrespective of the season having large anthropogenic inputs of no3 1 mm and those having the natural background levels of no3 0 1 mm appelo and postma 2004 is found to be insignificant at the 95 confidence interval t score 0 2497 p value 0 8056 df 18 the strong cl conductivity correlation table 4 in groundwater even after excluding the salinity hotspots confirms abundant cl ion as a reliable tracer of the regional groundwater salinity table 4 also shows the poor and insignificant correlations of cl ion with dissolved nutrients of no3 po4 k and so4 which suggests different entrainment pathways of these ions into the groundwater thus anthropogenic influence if any on groundwater is local only which also fails to explain the widespread groundwater salinity 5 3 marine influence the conservative ions of cl and br are reliable coupled tracers of groundwater salinity alcalá and custodio 2008 awaleh et al 2022 davis et al 1998 fabryka martin et al 1991 louvat et al 1999 strong and significant seasonal clbr correlations r2 0 92 0 99 p value 0 0001 fig 5a in the groundwater samples scattered around the seawater dilution line excluding the gw 7 gw 18 and gw 52 indicate a predominant marine influence on the regional groundwater salinity most of the groundwater samples have a similar cl br ratio but intermediate cl concentration as compared to the fields of seawater and coastal recharge waters fig 5b alcalá and custodio 2008 awaleh et al 2022 and references therein which could be due to seawater freshwater mixing the overlapping fields of septic effluents wastewaters make it difficult to unbiasedly deconvolute further the marine signatures the low cl br in gw 18 and gw 52 could be attributed to anthropogenic br inputs from pesticides used in agricultural lands feedlots while high cl br generally coupled with high nutrients so4 or no3 in the groundwater samples of gw 7 gw 35 gw 36 and gw 56 is likely derived from septic effluents wastewaters generally groundwater samples having relatively higher salinity fall close to the seawater composition in the piper diagram piper 1944 fig 6a which also suggests marine influence as the most plausible reason for the widespread groundwater salinity in the region fig 6b depicts different water types seawater freshwater mixing line and hydrogeochemical facies evolution trends during groundwater freshening and salinization processes following calderon et al 2014 a majority of groundwater samples are of nacl type in each of the sampled seasons exceptional groundwater samples are of the types of mgcl gw 18 ca mg cl gw 5 gw 16 gw 34 gw 35 gw 50 and gw60 ca mg hco3 gw 26 gw 33 and gw 51 and na ca hco3 gw 3 gw 47 and gw 49 the riverine freshwaters and urban sewage samples from a coastal creak in surat are particularly of ca mg hco3 and nacl type respectively the ca mg hco3 type groundwater samples gw 26 and gw 33 ec 0 7 ms cm from far inland alluvial aquifers indicate freshwater recharge besides vertical infiltration of meteoric waters groundwater seepage from the ukai dam reservoir could be another freshwater source for the downslope gw 26 and other groundwater samples located particularly in the tapi river basin figs 1 and 2d whereas the northeastern groundwater gw 33 has major ion composition similar to that of the narmada river indicating a common freshwater source or the river water groundwater exchange the salinity hotspots of gw 7 and gw 58 fall close to the seawater composition while most of the inland groundwater samples either fall around the seawater freshwater mixing line or follow the groundwater salinization trend on the other hand the salinity hotspot of gw 41 and other groundwater samples located in the coastal area follow the groundwater freshening trend in the piper diagram fig 6b this observation is also supported by the seaward moment of headwaters fig 2d e preventing the lateral seawater intrusion at shallow depths in the sampled coastal aquifers during any of the seasons most of the groundwater samples lying in the seawater quadrant of the chadha plot chadha 1999 fig 7 also indicate a dominating marine influence over the simple ion exchange process interestingly the ca mg cl type far inland groundwater samples from the northeastern piezometric depression fig 2 are typically placed at the common boundary of seawater and reverse ion exchange quadrants fig 7 this observation suggests a likelihood of the upconing from deep saline aquifers and or a leading edge of lateral seawater intrusion from north of the narmada river alfarrah and walraevens 2018 awaleh et al 2018 the lateral advance of the seawater freshwater interface by deep aquifer upconing at inland distances of a few tens of km from other coastal seas has already been demonstrated by earlier studies garcía menéndez et al 2016 ma et al 2019 5 4 aquifer water interactions by and large groundwater samples of different seasons follow the seawater dilution line in the scatter plots of cl versus na and so4 fig 8a b suggesting again the marine influence whereas some of the groundwater samples show higher na and or so4 concentrations than those expected from the seawater dilution line given the marine source of cl section 5 3 the non marine contribution excess of na in these groundwater samples fig 8a seems to be derived from the cation exchange process during aquifer freshening and or by dissolution of minerals such as plagioclase and alkali carbonates as previously suggested for the kutch region maurya et al 2019 whereas excess so4 in the gw 7 gw 36 and gw 55 fig 8b could be derived from gypsum dissolution and or localized anthropogenic inputs from septic effluents as previously discussed based on the cl br ratio section 5 3 thus excess so4 of 22 mm fig 8b and excess ca of 4 mm only fig 8c in the salinity hotspot of gw 7 seem related to localized anthropogenic inputs or gypsum dissolution followed by ca removal in calcite precipitation due to a common ion effect luo et al 2018 on the other hand so4 in the salinity hotspots of gw 41 and gw 58 fig 8b is primarily of a marine origin in the scatter plot of ca versus mg fig 8d groundwater samples of different seasons generally follow two trends diverging from the seawater line since the cation exchange process can not significantly fractionate the divalent ions of ca and mg these diverging trends indicate mineral precipitation dissolution reactions during aquifer water interactions the group 1 groundwater samples encircled in black fig 8d located on or downslope of the tertiary fluviomarine deposits in the central area fig 1 are generally enriched in ca probably due to limestone gypsum dissolution in the ancient deposits whereas the mg enrichment in group 2 groundwater samples collected from the alluvium is expected from preferential weathering of mafic minerals or mg smectites etc interestingly the scatter plot of cl versus sr fig 9a depicts that coastal groundwater samples generally fall in the mixing envelope of modern seawater and freshwater endmembers meteoric water river waters and groundwater seepage of gw 26 and gw 33 while the inland groundwater samples show higher sr concentration than that expected from the seawater mixing no discernible covarying trend in the no3 sr scatter plot fig 9b rules out widespread anthropogenic sr inputs on the other hand a significant clsr correlation r2 0 67 p value 0 0001 fig 9a is found in the inland groundwater samples mostly having cl of marine origin and sr addition by aquifer water interactions this observation hints at the upconing of deep saline aquifers where excess sr is added during the seawater intrusion or previously trapped seawater and or groundwater accumulation of seasalt in percolated waters to explore the sources of solutes x contributed by the aquifer water interaction we have calculated excess of na k ca mg and sr in groundwater by considering the major ion composition of seawater doe 1994 using eq 1 as given below 1 x excess x measured cl measured x cl seawater the scatter plot of excess ca versus excess mg fig 10a shows that group 1 and group 2 groundwater samples are orthogonal which rules out the widespread congruent dedolomitization in the region however incongruent dedolomitization dolomite dissolution and calcite precipitation de groot 1967 evamy 1967 generally occurring in shallow limestone aquifers could not be ruled out as an additional source of excess mg excess sr in groundwater is inversely correlated with excess na k r2 0 11 p value 0 014 fig 10b indicating minor contributions from weathering of feldspars on the other hand the excess sr shows significant correlations with excess ca r2 0 50 p value 0 004 fig 10c and excess mg r2 0 60 p value 0 0001 fig 10d in group 1 and group 2 groundwater samples respectively this observation strongly suggests preferential weathering of mg rich minerals in the widespread alluvium as the cogenetic source of excess sr and excess mg to groundwater 5 5 sr isotope budget of groundwater the scatter plot of sr concentration versus 87sr 86sr fig 11 helps to delineate sr specific sources in groundwater contributed by water mixing and aquifer water interactions considered water endmembers are 1 modern seawater doe 1994 rai 2008 2 meteoric water chatterjee

contributions by aquifer water interactions many groundwater samples mostly from the alluvium are enclosed by the envelope of modern seawater mixing with the seepage groundwater endmembers the sr isotope trend toward the modern seawater composition along with increasing sr concentration in these groundwater samples indicates negligible sr contribution by the dissolution of mafic minerals sourced from the deccan basalt lithology having less radiogenic 87sr 86sr melluso et al 2004 moreover groundwater samples gw 4 gw 7 gw 46 and gw 58 fig 9a significantly impacted by aquifer water interactions show elevated sr concentration characterized by a marine composition of 87sr 86sr likely obtained by the dissolution of authigenic minerals precipitated during past sea transgressions earlier dowling et al 2003 has suggested the dissolution of vermiculites controlling the sr isotope budget of groundwater from alluvial aquifers in the bengal basin based on the srcl relationship in inland groundwater fig 9a we have estimated sr concentration in deep saline aquifers as 365 μm at salinity 35 the seawater mixing envelope gray area in fig 11 does not significantly alter even if the seawater endmember has dissolved sr of 365 μm after the sr addition by aquifer water interactions a growing number of pre monsoonal groundwater samples well distributed along the line of seawater mixing with the southern seepage endmember fig 11c indicates a significant impact of groundwater over extraction on the upconing of deep saline aquifers having marine signatures the exceptional groundwater samples can be categorized into three different classes the class 1 groundwater samples gw 16 to gw 18 and gw 34 to gw 38 belonging to the northeastern alluvium have more radiogenic 87sr 86sr possibly derived from nearby aravalli granites the class 2 groundwater samples gw 3 gw 5 gw 20 gw 42 and gw 43 collected from surat have lower sr concentrations and but 87sr 86sr comparable to that of the seepage groundwater which is expected from a dilution effect during the freshening of these coastal shallow alluvial aquifers moreover the class 3 groundwater samples group 1 encircled in black fig 11 collected from and or downslope of the ancient deposits show wide variations in 87sr 86sr of 0 7083 0 7094 and sr concentration of 4 3 47 6 μm interestingly a few downslope groundwater samples of gw 14 gw 31 and gw 53 depth 60 m have lower 87sr 86sr 0 7083 0 7086 than those of other groundwater samples 0 7088 0 7093 gw 25 gw 52 gw 54 and gw 55 more proximal to ancient deposits higher 87sr 86sr 0 7084 0 7094 in gw 7 gw 8 gw 13 gw 30 and gw 51 collected from the miocene pliocene deposits fossiliferous limestone marl sandstone and agate conglomerates could influence these proximal shallow groundwater samples of gw 25 gw 52 gw 54 and gw 55 whereas relatively low 87sr 86sr 0 7085 0 7088 of gw 12 and gw 27 collected from the eocene oligocene deposits argillaceous limestone and claystone sandstone most likely impacts the deep groundwater of gw 14 gw 31 and gw 53 this observation indicates that seepage groundwaters reaching downslope locations of ancient deposits are sourced from different bed formations having distinct 87sr 86sr ratio thus the sr isotope budget of the regional alluvial groundwater is primarily controlled by mixing between the seepage groundwater and deep saline aquifers having marine signatures while exceptional sr isotope signatures of different age terrains are found in the northeastern alluvium and few locations at and or downslope of ancient deposits in the central alluvium 6 conclusions in this study the coupling of major trace ions and radiogenic sr isotopes is utilized to delineate the widespread groundwater salinization mechanism in the coastal gujarat alluvial plain except for a few salinity hotspots the groundwater salinity shows overlapping seasonal variations negating the major role of groundwater evaporation the freshening of the coastal groundwater generally rules out the lateral seawater intrusion at shallow depths in the sampled area the upconing of deep saline aquifers having marine signatures seems to play a major role in the regional groundwater salinity besides this widespread marine influence aquifer water interactions substantially alter the geochemical sr isotope compositions of groundwater particularly from the northeastern alluvium and few locations downslope of ancient deposits in the central alluvium author credit statement all authors have made
