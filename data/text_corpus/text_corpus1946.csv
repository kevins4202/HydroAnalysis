based agricultural systems fas which rely on temporary floods provide livelihoods for nearly 50 million smallholder farmers across water stressed african basins this paper analyses the impact of externally driven agricultural production and productivity improvement interventions in fas taking the ethiopian fogera floodplain as a case study ostroms governing the commons principles were used as analytical framework field data was gathered through focus group discussions and interviews with 266 farmers and pastoralists and 10 local administration staff while the aquacrop model was used to simulate maize yield under varied floodwater management and farming practices the interventions in the fogera floodplain replaced vital maize and teff food crops with high return upstream rice cultivation it has characteristics similar to other interventions across africa 1 inadequate integration of local agricultural water management practices 2 narrow focus on short term economic gains and insufficient attention to long term sustainability of livelihoods and environmental issues and 3 lack of detailed ex ante analysis of basin wide consequences it failed to prioritize the needs of downstream vegetable producers and pastoralists using shallow wells the intervention missed several low cost opportunities including the establishment of rules to protect downstream water rights the construction of gabion strengthened on farm structures to efficiently distribute floods or raised brick walls to reinforce shallow wells and the implementation of measures for improved soil fertility and weed management the study establishes that these missed opportunities could have enhanced livelihoods by doubling rice yield to 6 tons ha increased teff and maize harvests by one third to 3 and 5 tons ha respectively and mitigated 25 vegetable yield loss and 40 reduction in grazing land these opportunities could have also produced environmental benefits including reduced soil moisture and fertility depletion lessons from the fogera floodplain on making interventions cost effective and considering basin wide livelihood impacts are relevant to fas globally keywords agricultural interventions floodwater productivity environmental benefits aquacrop modeling farming and pastoral communities floodwater management rules 1 introduction flood based agricultural systems fas have received relatively little research and investment attention as compared to perennial irrigation systems puertas et al 2015 they are however substantial they cover an estimated 25 million ha across arid and semi arid africa where they provide food and fodder for nearly 50 million farmers irrigating on average 0 5 ha kool et al 2017 there are four widely practiced fas 1 floodplain agriculture flood recession and flood rise the cultivation of floodplains using receding and or rising floodwater 2 flood inundation canal systems where canals fed by temporarily high water levels in rivers irrigate adjacent low lying fields 3 spate irrigation which makes use of short duration floods generated from mountain catchments and 4 depression agriculture shallow seasonally waterlogged depressions that retain sufficient moisture for dry season grazing and crop production kool et al 2017 floodplain agriculture complemented by flood inundation system is the focus of this paper it is the most extensive system covering nearly two thirds of the total 25 million ha potential of fas in arid and semi arid africa puertas et al 2015 floodplain agriculture goes back more than 5000 years in some parts of asia pakistan and yemen in particular and is also widely practiced in several african riverine environments including the logone chari niger senegal and volta rivers adams et al 2018 saarnak 2003 traore et al 2020 the okavango delta motsumi et al 2012 and lake victoria kipkemboi et al 2007 although floodplain agriculture and fas in general have received little policy attention van steenbergen et al 2011 motsumi et al 2012 several east african governments including in sudan ethiopia and kenya have recently invested and are planning to invest in improving the productivity and livelihoods of traditional fas in this paper traditional refers to farmer led fas woodhouse et al 2017 where farmers play a driving role in the design and establishment of the systems and are primarily responsible for the overall operation and maintenance of the floodwater management structures and all relevant farming practices traditional fas often support subsistence food cultivation and rely on simple earthen and stone diversion and distribution structures that are frequently breached by floods in ethiopia among the major local government led interventions was the introduction of rice as a high value crop in around 40 of the 15 000 ha fogera floodplain rice was envisioned to replace teff and maize which are relatively low revenue but vital food crops in order to boost economic growth and lift the living standards of the target communities the significant shift to rice took place in the last decade recent academic interests in fas have focused on scheme level technical improvements gebrehiwot et al 2015 libsekal and mehari 2020 mehari et al 2011 zenebe et al 2015 and impacts of environmental change sall et al 2020 they have also covered farmer management practices singh et al 2021 including the importance of indigenous knowledge motsumi et al 2012 few studies adequately address basin wide floodwater management and productivity issues that impact the livelihoods of multiple varied users and uses castelli et al 2018 attempted a detailed performance analysis of past interventions in the raya valley s fas located in the northern part of ethiopia the analyses however covered only one of the 17 raya valley schemes with relatively homogenous user groups in terms of the type of crops and the size of land they cultivated major basin wide interrelated issues were not discussed yet also at the local level castelli et al 2018 show that participatory engagement of farmers can result in improved design of irrigation and bank erosion structures that respond to the needs of and are in line with the operation and maintenance strategy of the farmers in the fogera floodplain as is typical of fas various users share the same basins with seasonal or intermittent river courses the lack of basin wide analysis could therefore curtail the positive impact of interventions designed to improve traditional fas and may increase the chance of unintended negative consequences as the needs and priorities of some users will not be sufficiently identified and responded to while scientific studies of the impacts of interventions are limited there are some documented cases one example is the wadi zabid spate irrigation scheme in yemen where the upstream expansion of a highly profitable but hugely water demanding banana plantation eventually contributed to frequent downstream sorghum food crop failures zenebe et al 2016 a second example comes from an intervention in wadi siham spate irrigation scheme in yemen the multiple offtake system that allowed downstream water users to withdraw water directly from the river was replaced with a single upstream distribution offtake this intervention is widely perceived as having contributed to floodwater supply scarcity in the downstream area van steenbergen et al 2010 other examples include upstream dam developments in the senegal river saarnak 2003 tana river in kenya zenebe et al 2021 and the mekong delta ngoc 2017 and the modernization of the spate irrigation system in eritrea mehari et al 2011 taking the fogera floodplain as a case study this paper analyses the following three questions what are the strengths and limitations of traditional floodwater management practices in meeting floodwater supply needs enhancing agricultural productivity and livelihoods of basin wide users how has the intervention that partially replaced the vital teff and maize food crops with high value rice upstream cultivation impacted traditional floodwater management practices agricultural productivity and basin wide livelihoods if a basin wide intervention approach had been implemented what technical and non technical measures could have been introduced to further improve floodwater management practices agricultural productivity and livelihoods the fogera floodplain is a relevant case study for two main reasons first the approach followed in the area a limited scope in detailed ex ante scientific diagnosis of basin wide issues as well as lack of attention to long term sustainability is representative of the characteristics of several interventions in fas see for instance zenebe et al 2021 ngoc 2017 mehari et al 2011 second the fogera floodplain is among the pioneer intervention sites to improve the productivity and livelihoods of traditional fas thus it is expected to harbor rich experiences and lessons that can make a significant contribution to enhancing similar endeavors in other fas across africa and perhaps globally 2 theoretical framework the principles of the theory governing the commons presented in table 1 ostrom 2000 provided an analytical framework for the data and information collection across the above outlined three research questions these principles drawn from extensive research have been widely recognized as imperative benchmarks for successful collective management of a shared resource such as the floodwater in fas to provide for the livelihood needs of all target beneficiary groups ostrom 2002 the overarching analytical question was to what extent the floodwater management rules and practices before and after the introduction of rice fulfils the requirement of the principles and how this in turn impacts floodwater availability and productivity and livelihoods of the fogera farming and pastoralist communities the operational effectiveness of the rules was further comparatively analysed against the scope of the package of rules successfully applied across some of the centuries old fas in asia pakistan and yemen in particular table 2 3 materials and methods 3 1 study area description the fogera floodplain is in the fogera district of the amhara region in ethiopia as shown in fig 1 the floodplain is the area with the lowest elevation bordered on the east by the bahir dar gonder road on the west by lake tana and on the north and the south by reb and gumara rivers respectively the potential inundation area is nearly 40 000 ha but the annually flood irrigated land is estimated at 15 000 ha nederveen et al 2011 the floodplain is the major source of food and fodder for 75 of the largely agrarian fogera district population of nearly 250 000 gebey et al 2012 during the june to september rainfall season overflows from lake tana the largest lake in ethiopia and the reb and gumara rivers that ultimately discharge their flow into the lake irrigate the fogera floodplain nederveen et al 2011 the annual average rainfall in the mountainous catchment upstream of the lake and the rivers is about 1200 mm this gradually decreases towards the lowlands reaching its lowest amount of about 400 mm in the downstream fogera floodplain where rainfall is more erratic in nature nederveen et al 2011 the mean monthly temperature ranges from about 20 30 c which is favorable for the major crops grown in the study area rice teff maize as well as vegetables mainly onions and beans gebey et al 2012 for several decades traditional food crops teff and maize have been grown in 8000 ha extending eastwards from the lake tana shore in nabega wagetera kdste hana shina and shaga wards fig 1 in the next kuhar mikael tihua ena kokit wereta and kuhar abo wards about 4000 ha have been cultivated with vegetables using flood recharged shallow wells further in the fringes of the floodplain a vast 3000 ha grazing area supported pastoral livelihoods the fogera floodplain has long attracted the attention of the local government and its development partners as a potential rice hub this is because the floodplain has flat topography and a 2 3 m deep silt loam soil profile with high water holding capacity of about 440 mm m mehari et al 2011 van steenbergen et al 2010 these soil conditions are favorable for the high water demanding rice crop but also for all the other major crops as they complete their entire growth cycle based on residual moisture harnessed with a single irrigation turn of about 350 mm depth during the preceding flood season although there were early attempts to introduce rice in the 1990 s the big push by the local administration came when ethiopia rolled out its nation wide development program in the late 2000 s rice production was first piloted in the upstream part of the floodplain in wagetera and nagega wards close to the lake tana shore fig 1 significant shift to rice cultivation however mainly happened in the last decade there is now 6000 ha rice cropped land in nabega wagetera kdste hana wards originally cultivated by maize and teff flood inundation and flood plain agriculture systems are complementarily practiced the floods generated when lake tana overflows its banks are distributed to the irrigated area through a series of field canals earthen bunds retain the floodwater in the irrigated fields where floodplain agriculture is practiced flood rise for rice and flood recession for the food crops teff and maize and as well as the vegetables a group of fields share a common canal and the floodwater is distributed from one field to the next by breaking the earth bunds field bunds are central to effective floodwater management at both individual farm and irrigation system levels fogera farmers invest time and labor to construct as strong earthen bunds as possible through compaction of 5 10 cm soil layer at a time and eventually reaching a height of about 35 cm unlike in perennial irrigation where multiple irrigation gifts are possible crops in fogera floodplain and other fas depend on one to two irrigation turns which must be adequately retained given this large amount of floodwater supply a breaching of any field bund could lead to devastating damage to neighboring fields and structures the fogera farmers often practice direct manual planting the crop growth period for rice extends from june to september which coincides with the flood season while the other crops complete their growth cycle from end of september to january under flood recession agriculture some of the large scale farmers 0 6 3 ha with relatively more financial resources than the small scale 0 5 ha farmers invest in weed management as well as fertilizer application other field management practices such as mulching are not common 3 2 methods for data and information gathering the analyses in this paper are derived from qualitative and quantitative data gathered from a total of 276 respondents of which 170 150 farmers and 20 pastoralists participated in individual interviews and 80 72 farmers and 8 pastoralists were engaged in focus group discussions fgds in addition 26 key informants guided the field surveys these comprised 12 farmers and four pastoralists purposefully selected and 10 local administration staff active in the fogera floodplain the 150 individually interviewed farmers were selected using stratified random sampling from a database of 1282 farmers with over 10 years of experience in floodwater management and farming practices the database consisted of 366 rice growers 432 teff and maize cultivators and 484 vegetables producers to ensure equal representation the sample sizes from each of the three farmer categories were proportional to their respective total populations since few pastoralists actively interact in floodwater management 20 pastoralists relatively more familiar with the topic and were willing to be interviewed were purposively sampled the 80 fgd participants were also selected using purposive sampling to ensure engagement of those with over 10 years farming or pastoral livelihood experiences the sections below have further details on the three data collection methods 3 2 1 field survey the field survey combined transect walks and key informant interviews kawulich 2005 fourteen transect walk days were organized four days to each of the upstream rice midstream teff and maize and downstream vegetable farming systems and two days to the grazing areas sites with good and poor floodwater management and farming practices were identified and visited together with 16 key farmer informants four representing each of the three category of farmers and the pastoralists who guided the transect walks each transect walk day started with an early morning preparatory meeting followed by 3 5 h walking in the field and an evening wrap up session to summarize main observations and findings the key informant farmers selected in consultation with the community leaders and the local administration met two criteria 1 over 15 year experience as active farmers or pastoralists and 2 good relations with the wider fogera community which was critical for having access to all the selected field visit sites the transect walks generated information on a range of issues floodwater sharing organization of repair and maintenance activities farming practices and actual harvest and the main factors that impact agricultural productivity follow up discussion with the key farmer informants further elaborated on the rules and enforcement mechanisms that governed floodwater management before and after the introduction of rice the discussions with the 10 local administration staff generated policy insights on why rice was introduced and the population and characteristics of the farming and pastoral communities these data and information established the basis for the detailed analyses during the fgds and individual interviews 3 2 2 focus group discussions this widely recognized qualitative research method guest et al 2017 moon et al 2016 engaged a total of 72 farmers and 8 pastoralists in ten homogeneous eight member focus groups that share similar challenges and priorities six farmer groups respectively representing small scale 0 5 ha and large scale 0 6 3 ha operators from either a upstream rice growers b midstream food crop teff and maize cultivators and c tail end vegetable producers one pastoralist group that have grazing land at the downstream fringes of the floodplain and three water masters groups farmer leaders responsible for enforcing floodwater management practices in the rice food crops and vegetable production areas the homogeneity of the focus groups as also discussed by smithson 2000 and cassell and symon 2004 enabled candid interactions in a public setting the fgds started with 25 min brainstorm sessions that introduced the participants to and made them comfortable with the discussion theme floodwater management practices before and after the introduction of rice using colored post it cards the participants were asked to write three short phrases that best expressed their priority floodwater management issues the cards were displayed in a large paperboard and all participants gave 2 3 min elaborations this was followed by 60 80 min discussions guided by 10 12 major questions and facilitated using the cards system all participated by either directly responding to the questions raised or expressing their views on the answers provided by their fellow group members in the concluding session each participant was given about two minutes to share new thoughts or elaborate on points that were not fully addressed the moderator then wrapped up the session with highlights of the important issues discussed this approach of conducting fgds is informed by previous experiences of the first author zenebe et al 2016 2021 and was also found to be effective during the two pilot fgds conducted with a farmer and a pastoralist group the fgds generated rich data across three priority themes a floodwater sharing rules and their impact on floodwater management b strengths and weaknesses of institutional floodwater management arrangements and c basin wide approach for efficient and productive floodwater utilization these thematic areas informed the individual interviews conducted 3 2 3 individual interviews individual interviews are a well recognized method to harvest individual perspectives including on issues that are perceived to be sensitive for public discussion bryman 2016 in this study individual interviews were employed to generate quantitative data across the three thematic areas identified by the fgds the interviews were conducted with 20 pastoralists and 150 farmers fig 2 the database was compiled using a household survey conducted as part of this study the local administration had a list of farmers who regularly cultivate their land and have experience of over 10 years which is imperative as livelihood and yield comparisons have to be made for the periods before and after the introduction of rice the list however lacked data on the size and location of the irrigable land and the crops grown which was completed during the household survey the questionnaire that guided the individual interview was prepared with the laddering technique schultze and avital 2011 an approach that facilitates harnessing detailed individual viewpoints on a specific issue through a set of subsequent interconnected questions for example the following questions captured the fogera farmers livelihood perspectives 1 how do you compare your living standard before and after introduction of rice a significantly improved b slightly improved c remained the same d got slightly worse and e became significantly worse 2 can you explain why there was a slight deterioration in your living standard 3 what do you suggest needs to be done to address the issues you outlined 3 3 data analysis methods the thematic method braun and clarke 2006 nowell et al 2017 was employed to systematically organize the fgds and generate the three main thematic areas outlined in section 3 2 2 this was achieved in a three stage process 1 observation during fgd data collection 2 data familiarization reading through the text and listening to audio recordings and 3 searching for themes taking a much deeper look at the data to identify patterns and eventually themes these thematic areas as mentioned earlier informed the individual interview descriptive statistics and frequency criteria guided the analyses of the individual interview data that was systematically organized in a spreadsheet ostrom s governing the commons principles see section 2 provided the analytical framework for all the data and information gathered through fgds and individual interviews covering floodwater management practices and rules agricultural productivity and livelihood impacts the rules that were operational before introduction of rice and those functional now were further analysed against the scope of the package of rules detailed in section 2 the analytical questions included to what extent have the rules contributed to protecting downstream floodwater rights limiting excessive upstream floodwater use facilitating timely operation and maintenance and mitigating flood damage how has this in turn affected agricultural productivity and livelihoods of the fogera farmers and pastoralists 3 4 aquacrop modeling aquacrop model was employed for detailed yield analyses this model simulates crop and water productivity kg ha and kg m3 under various water scarcity conditions but it can also assess the impacts of farming practices ranjbar et al 2019 steduto et al 2009 maize was singled out for analysis based on inputs from the farmers who participated in the fgds and the individual interviews a maize and teff are the two crops that have suffered the most from increased water scarcity following the introduction of rice of which maize is more sensitive to water stress b farmers are interested in enhancing their maize harvests because the crop has more market value in the region than teff aquacrop has been widely evaluated and found to be reliable for maize yield analyses hammer et al 2009 ranjbar et al 2019 although validating the model was not the objective in this paper good correlation was found between the model results and the individual interview data with regard to the impact of fertilizer deficiency and floodwater losses on maize yield see section 4 3 2 these results further confirm the model is reliable seven scenarios table 3 formulated by the fgd participating farmers assessed impacts on maize yield of various combinations of four factors a floodwater scarcity b floodwater losses caused by earthen field bund failures c soil fertility stress and d non optimal weed management the farmers were interested to know the yields that correspond to the scenarios in order to make an informed investment decision of their limited resources the scenarios reflect the varied floodwater management and farming realities on the ground three in four of the individually interviewed farmers informed that floods often breach earthen field bunds and 30 40 of the maximum 350 mm irrigation depth supplied to the fields is lost all individually interviewed farmers agreed that there is a medium soil fertility stress this corresponds to 20 deficiency in the quantitative categorization of aquacrop model the weed management ranged from good to fairly poor which is equivalent to 10 and 35 weed infestation rates in the model although waterlogging occurs during the flooding period it was not considered in the modeling because maize planting takes place after the floodwater has fully receded infiltrated and the soil is not wet and can allow proper tillage hence the soil is at near field capacity during the planting period the model input parameters are detailed in the appendix 4 results and discussion the socio demographic descriptions of the total population of 1282 farmers and the corresponding 150 sample of individual interview participants are summarized in table 4 the sample is representative of the total population as can be inferred from the closely correlated mean ages and irrigated areas the very low standard deviation stdev values across the six farmer categories are also an indication that the intra variability in the irrigated areas and ages of the farmers is largely insignificant 4 1 traditional floodwater management at a conceptual level as gathered from the fgds the traditional floodwater management system that existed for over two hundred years before the introduction of rice promoted equitable floodwater distribution between the upstream maize and teff growers and the downstream vegetable onion and beans producers this fulfils ostrom s 1st principle table 1 the practical effectiveness of the traditional system was however curtailed as it lacked some imperative rules presented in table 2 4 1 1 traditional floodwater distribution rules the strengths and limitations of the two rules that guided the traditional floodwater management are as discussed below upstream first but with restrictions rule the fgd participants informed that this rule dates back nearly two hundred years it grants the upstream farmers the priority for a single irrigation turn of 350 mm depth and a second turn only after all the other fields have secured the same single turn floods are guided from field to field by breaking earthen bunds which are restricted by this very upstream first rule to a maximum height of 35 cm to avoid excessive floodwater retention the first irrigation turn is less than the minimum 500 mm depth required for optimum maize productivity steduto et al 2012 a fact also recognized by the fgd participating farmers given the unpredictable nature of floods in timing and volume there is no guarantee of a second turn the upstream first rule does therefore in principle facilitate some fairness in floodwater sharing and hence fulfils ostrom s 1st principle table 1 its practical impact was however limited due to absence of the rule on small and large floods table 2 this rule could have restricted the diversion of large floods to the upstream which as observed during the field surveys often damaged the earthen field bunds and resulted in floodwater losses on the other hand letting these large floods flow downstream where they are relatively less destructive could have sufficiently recharged the shallow wells that irrigate vegetables and water the grazing area a third of the interviewed farmers managed to properly construct and timely maintain their field bunds but there were many instances of floodwater losses due to field bund damage this was also several decades back a major challenge in yemen and pakistan but it has been addressed by introducing gabion reinforced field intakes that mitigated field bund failures mehari et al 2005 van steenbergen 1997 the fgd participating farmers agreed that these improved intakes would also be useful in the fogera floodplain introducing such floodwater management structures and effective water distribution rules are also considered priority interventions for the shire valley flood recession and the eritrean western lowlands spate irrigated areas malota and mchenga 2020 mehari et al 2011 in a new year dry fields first rule this rule does not exist in the centuries old fas in yemen and pakistan outlined in table 2 according to the fgds participants it was introduced some 50 years after the upstream first rule to further increase fairness in floodwater sharing it directs that in a new flood season irrigation should start with the fields that did not receive floodwater the previous year while the rule has a powerful equity principle enforcing it is near impossible first it requires that upstream farmers let the floodwater flow downstream while their fields are dry a difficult ask second small and medium floods may dominate the start of the flood season and even if allowed to travel downstream to drier fields they may not have the necessary velocity and volume to reach there all farmers engaged in the fgds agreed that the rule on small and large floods is more practical and a better replacement 4 1 2 institutional floodwater management arrangements the fgd participating farmers explained that a group of three to five farmer leaders locally known as water masters enforced the rules and the operation and maintenance o m of field bunds and canals in their respective villages inhabited by between 200 and 600 farmers they are elected in a village meeting for a single 3 year term which can be renewed once for the same duration any farmer above the age of 25 years is eligible for election water masters do not receive salary but there is one strong incentive irrigation priority as per the provisions and restrictions of the upstream first rule the water masters have the mandate to respectively sanction 400 1200 etb about 10 26 euros for 1st and 2nd time violations of rules or failure to physically participate in o m activities farmers who repeatedly three times or more disobey water masters orders are brought before the local administration a scenario that usually leads to a payment of about 50 a hefty amount for any fogera farmer the money collected is used for food and drinks during o m and other events such as when the community supports elderly farmers during the labor intensive harvesting period the fgd participants emphasized that the hefty penalty was sparingly imposed as farmers often cooperated the water masters led enforcement mechanism is very much akin to the graduated sanctions approach advocated by ostrom s 3rd principle table 1 it was evaluated as being successful by nearly 80 of the interviewed farmers while it did not go as far as depriving farmers of floodwater supply as required by the rule on maintenance table 2 the threat of hefty sanction combined with the strong collaboration between the community respected water masters and the legally powerful local administration has achieved a high degree of discipline in abiding by the rules and conflicts were rare the traditional institutional arrangement does not fulfill ostrom s 4th principle table 1 as there is not any higher level organization that coordinates the activities of the water masters three in four of the interviewed farmers do not see the need for such an organization nearly 90 believe that it is financially unsustainable in their opinion the water masters across the villages are well connected and have the necessary coordination capacity lessons from other fas including the tana river in kenya zenebe et al 2021 and the mekong delta ngoc 2017 however indicate that it is imperative to have a fogera floodplain wide institution to partly represent the farming communities priorities more effectively during external development interventions the analyses of institutional alternatives for african smallholders shah et al 2002 confirms that collaborative institutional arrangement between farmers and irrigation agencies is the most effective farmers alone may not adequately manage irrigation systems because they often do not invest into long term sustainability of irrigation systems a role that can be fulfilled by the public institutions to ensure that farmer organizations adequately pay their share of o m cost however the objective of institutional reforms should shift from just irrigation water management improvement to enhancing productivity and income this implies that water users associations wuas may not be appropriate farmers organizations producers groups with a mandate that goes beyond just managing water distribution and includes agronomic and marketing aspects may be necessary 4 2 floodwater management in the rice era the fgds revealed that the traditional upstream first rule was modified to grant upstream rice farmers two irrigation turns of 350 mm depth each instead of the single turn which was the case in the traditional floodwater management system this modification is contrary to ostrom s 1st principle table 1 that advocates for equally and adequately responding to the needs and priorities of all target beneficiaries it has to be noted however the two irrigation turns is much less than the 1000 mm water requirement of early maturity 100 120 days rice varieties fao 2019 common in fogera floodplains despite its strong economic growth drive the local administration did not insist that upstream rice fields be fully irrigated first this compromise was mainly influenced by the interest of the local administration to maintain the good institutional collaboration they established with the water masters in the pre rice era which they believed was essential for the successful enforcement of the modified upstream first rule during the fgds the water masters informed that they did not play a decision making role in the modification of the rule as required by ostrom s 2nd principle table 1 in principle the water masters agreed that they might have had a stronger influence if the rules on special crop preference and demarcation table 2 were part of the traditional floodwater management system this could have led to a fairer floodwater sharing arrangement such as equally dividing the 3 month june to august flood period between the upstream rice growers and the downstream farmers and pastoralists this floodwater sharing arrangement was widely perceived as a good compromise by small and large scale fas farmers in kenya zenebe et al 2021 the second traditional rule in a new year dry fields first was scrapped to eliminate the risk posed by the rule on significant floodwater supply reduction to upstream rice fields from the above it can be deduced that the floodwater management intervention did not follow a basin wide approach it narrowly focused on mainly increasing floodwater supply to the upstream rice cultivation little attention was given to analyses of downstream farming and pastoral livelihoods priorities flood mitigation measures and environmental needs as a result some opportunities were missed including a the introduction of the rule on small and large floods which could have increased irrigation supply to the midstream food crops teff and maize and the downstream vegetable onion and beans cultivation by prohibiting the diversion of large floods to the upstream where they often cause more damage and are less productive and b low cost improved gabion re enforced field intakes which as discussed could significantly reduce breaching of earthen field bunds and floodwater losses some fas farmers in the tigray northern region of ethiopia are already using gabion structures libsekal and mehari 2020 cost may not therefore be a barrier for introducing it to fogera floodplain investing in the food and vegetable crops is not only essential to respond to midstream and downstream agricultural productivity and livelihood needs it can also contribute to shifting from monoculture rice farming to profitable diversified agricultural system which is more resilient to climate change impacts the fogera floodplain and all other fas are inherently vulnerable to climate change as they depend on floods highly unreliable in timing and volume 4 3 floodwater productivity and livelihood analyses drawing from the individual interviews fig 3 summarizes the comparative livelihood analyses for the periods before and after introduction of rice all teff and maize farmers were negatively impacted with about half reporting significant worsening of their living standards about two third of the vegetable producers experienced slight livelihood deterioration the majority 80 90 rice farmers who previously cultivated teff and maize slightly improved their livelihoods the rest significantly 4 3 1 rice irrigating farmers the assertion by the overwhelming majority of current rice irrigating farmers that the shift they made from teff and maize food crops to high value rice production only slightly improved their livelihoods fig 3 is informed by a combination of the high expectations set by the local administration above 5 tons ha and the relatively low rice crop harvests obtained fig 4 summarizes the yield obtained in 2019 by the interviewed 22 large scale and 21 small scale farmers even the highest reported yields of about 4 tons ha are far below the optimum 9 tons ha fao 2019 when irrigation soil fertility and other field management practices are not limiting factors the highest yields are also much less than the 6 tons ha achieved by small scale farmers in kenya with irrigation applications and soil profiles similar to that in the fogera floodplain ndiiri et al 2013 comparatively the large scale farmers obtained higher rice yields their median productivity 3 3 tons ha is 30 higher than that of the small scale farmers fig 4 further the inter quartile range iqr or the box width which measures data intra variability is 44 greater in the case of small scale farmers the majority of the small scale farmers are concentrated on the lower yield range as shown by the positive skewness of the data a median closer to the bottom of the box and a whisker line shorter on the lower end of the box this indicates the large scale farmers were more consistent in realizing their relatively higher yields all of the interviewed small scale farmers and 90 of the large scale farmers informed that the low rice harvest is the main constraint for better livelihoods as there is a vibrant and high market demand for rice in fogera district and the amhara region with about 20 million population nederveen et al 2011 the grain is both staple and cash crop while the straw provides nutritious livestock feed the farmers explained that there is no added value of leaving the straw in the field or integrating it into the soil as it does not quickly degrade and does not improve soil condition and fertility this assertion is supported by a field research conducted in thailand that concluded rice straw did not improve rice productivity maneepitak et al 2019 similar findings were reported by hanafi et al 2012 the individual interviews identified two key factors that contributed to the low rice yields 1 poor on farm floodwater management nearly 75 of the participating farmers explained that although there is some shortage in physical floodwater supply lack of effective field techniques to better manage floods and reduce losses was the more significant and frequent problem that reduced yield as discussed the intervention in fogera did not introduce improved gabion re enforced field intakes and the earthen bunds are often breached leading to significant irrigation losses the small scale farmers are more vulnerable as they lack resources to timely and properly maintain their field bunds 2 soil fertility stress the 71 and 24 of the interviewed large and small scale farmers who managed 3 0 tons ha and above fig 4 applied between 25 and 50 kg of urea ha 12 23 kg ha of nitrogen fertilization n the four best performing large scale farmers who obtained at least 4 tons ha used 100 kg of urea ha 46 kg ha n these facts back the claim by 80 of the interviewed farmers that the fogera floodplain has some soil fertility deficiency there was no significant difference in floodwater management and other farming practices among the interviewed large and small scale farmers nearly a third of the large scale and three quarters of the small scale farmers could not use fertilizers due to limited supply and high cost among those who managed the application rates are much less than the 60 kg ha of n recommended for rice cultivation in the lowland region of ethiopia bado et al 2018 a field experiment conducted in the region tamene et al 2017 has also shown positive yield response up to 75 kg ha of n there is therefore opportunity to further increase productivity by making fertilizers widely available and affordable it is important though to learn from mekong delta experience where nitrogen fertilizer overuse in rice fields has caused environmental degradation including soil acidification and water pollution tran et al 2018 a more sustainable approach would be to use organic compost fertilization what is relevant here as also discussed by motsumi et al 2012 and nguyen et al 2020 is to have supportive policies from national to local levels that encourage farmers participation and promote sustainable productivity and livelihoods rice planting practices were identified as yield impacting factors by just 15 of the rice interviewed farmers however all farmers practice direct broadcast sowing which often leads to high planting density poor germination and reduced seed setting a field experiment conduced in kenya has shown that transplanting of younger seedlings with wider spacing significantly increased productivity ndiiri et al 2013 these practices were also reported to have increased yield under flood recession in mali by about 40 traore et al 2020 seedling preparation is a well known practice in ethiopia see for example thijssen et al 2008 the local administration staff informed that the practice was not given attention but that it can be piloted in some farmers fields and then further upscaled finally spatial variability linked to the location of fields across the fogera floodplain was not identified by the rice farmers as a yield determining factor as mentioned earlier this may be due to the fact that for the majority of the farmers the major challenge is floodwater losses caused by poor management practices not physical water scarcity there is also no significant spatial variability in the soil type and depth nederveen et al 2011 4 3 2 traditional food crop farmers the data gathered from individual interviews with 51 teff and maize cultivating farmers indicates that the yield of both crops was low under the traditional system before introduction of rice at an average of about 40 of the attainable 7 5 tons ha and 3 tons ha maize and teff productivities respectively see the medians in figs 5 and 6 attainable yield refers to yields obtained in ethiopia with sufficient irrigation and fertilizer application clarke et al 2017 yihun et al 2013 it can also be inferred from figs 5 and 6 that the maize yield gap between large and small scale farmers is much bigger this is because 40 of the large scale maize farmers applied fertilizers to boost their harvest beyond their household requirements to generate income due to financial constraints maize fertilization was given preference as teff is relatively widely available and hence has much lower market value roughly 80 of the interviewed small scale farmers could not afford to use fertilizers nearly all 95 of the interviewed small and large scale maize and teff farmers explained that they now following introduction of rice often experience floodwater scarcity and their best case scenario is receiving a single 350 mm irrigation depth this would be sufficient for teff but is significantly lower than the 500 800 mm maize irrigation requirement fao 2019 furthermore maize is more sensitive to water stress these facts explain the greater decline in maize yield 36 small scale farmers and 25 large scale farmers compared to the 20 and 18 reductions in teff figs 5 and 6 maize farmers are highly interested in boosting their harvest to better understand the impact of key floodwater management and farming practices aquacrop model was used to simulate yield under the seven scenarios formulated by the farmers table 3 the objective was to support farmers make an informed decision on how best to invest their limited resources the main results were as follows the farmers who secure a single irrigation turn 350 mm could achieve a maximum 5 tons ha maize yield if they mitigate field bund damage avoid floodwater losses adequately apply fertilizers and undertake proper weed management 30 40 floodwater losses which as informed by all interviewed farmers often occur due to poor on farm water management and flood damage to field bunds could reduce the maximum yield by 45 and 60 respectively moderate fertility stress 20 can decrease the maximum yield by 1 6 tons ha or about one third this correlates with the 1 1 1 5 tons ha yield increase attained by large scale farmers who applied fertilizers see the difference between maximum and minimum yields in fig 5 the combined effect of 30 floodwater loss and 20 fertility stress can reduce the maximum yield by 66 to about 1 8 tons ha which is also the maximum obtained by the small scale farmers following the introduction of rice fig 5 as indicated earlier 80 of the small scale farmers did not apply fertilizers due to financial constraints for this same reason they are also the most vulnerable to floodwater losses 4 3 3 vegetable producers and pastoralists the 27 small scale and 29 large scale farmers who participated in the individual interviews figs 7 and 8 obtained an average yield of 16 75 tons ha onion and 4 3 tons ha fresh beans before rice was introduced these yields are roughly 40 and 60 of the optimum values under sufficient irrigation and fertilizer application fao 2019 the onions and beans are irrigated downstream by floodwater recharged shallow hand dug wells following the introduction of rice much of the small medium and large floods were retained upstream resulting in only occasional very large flood flows downstream as a result nearly 90 of the interviewed farmers claimed that the recharge capacity has significantly reduced and they have over the past years observed a decline in their well water levels while their cropping pattern and irrigated areas have not changed the local administration staff that participated in the key informant interviews agreed with the farmers observations but also pointed to the absence of groundwater level monitoring data moreover three in four of the interviewed farmers asserted that the very large floods frequently caused physical damage and sedimentation of the hand dug wells desilting repair and maintenance is not always timely done due to labor and financial constraints these factors resulted in inadequate or delayed irrigation and about 30 reduction in the average yields of both small and large scale farmers it should be noted here however that besides the introduction of rice intensified land use and climate change may be significant contributors to the frequent large flood occurrences unlike in the case of rice teff and maize crops the onion and beans yield gap between small and large scale farmers is less significant at about 10 figs 7 and 8 the large scale farmers have better financial capacity and nearly 60 timely desilted and repaired their shallow wells prepared their irrigation fields and harvested high yields the other 40 however were less attentive to farming they have off farm economic activities such as small retail shops and their productivity was low bringing down the large scale farmers overall average yield the high yield variability is reflected in the iqr of the large scale farmers which is three fold that of the small scale farmers in concluding the discussion on vegetables productivity we wish to emphasize the point made in section 4 2 that the lack of basin wide approach in fogera floodplain did not offer adequate prospects for detailed impact assessment of upstream rice interventions on downstream floodwater supply and management needs and priorities this has contributed to some low cost missed opportunities such as reinforcing the embankment of shallow wells with raised brick walls or stone riprap that could have reduced the rate of flood damage and sedimentation coming to the pastoralists the 20 individual interview participants and the 8 persons engaged in the fgds estimated that the annually irrigated pastureland has decreased by some 40 to about 1800 ha and the livestock mainly cattle population has decreased by nearly two thirds or roughly 1500 heads they explained that these decreases are caused by the increase in rice production which has resulted in the retention of floods in the upper part of the fogera plain including the larger floods that used to irrigate their grazing area 5 conclusion the paper analysed in detail floodwater management and productivity of the fogera floodplain and the livelihoods of its basin wide users prior to and following the agricultural intervention that replaced the vital teff and maize food crops with high value upstream rice cultivation the traditional floodwater management promoted some fairness in floodwater sharing it however lacked critical agricultural floodwater management rules techniques and practices and remained a low production and subsistence livelihood system the narrow focus of the agricultural intervention on enhancing rice harvests through primarily increasing floodwater supply and the desire to fast track development at the expense of long term sustainability and detailed analyses of all basin wide challenges and opportunities has negatively affected fogera floodplain agricultural productivity and hence livelihoods rice harvest remained low at about 3 tons ha as compared to the attainable 6 tons ha maize and teff harvests declined by 30 and 20 respectively vegetable onion and green bean productivity dropped by nearly a third and grazing land dwindled by some 40 to about 1800 ha taking a basin wide approach a package of low cost agricultural productivity and livelihood improvement measures could have been introduced a floodwater management rules that mitigate flood damage protect downstream rights and give preference to food crops b gabion reinforced on farm structures for efficient floodwater distribution c appropriate application of fertilizers and weed management this has improved maize and rice yields by one third and d strengthening shallow well embankments with raised brick walls to decrease flood damage and sedimentation and enhance recharge capacity these low cost interventions can also achieve environmental benefits including reducing water logging and salinity risk soil erosion moisture depletion and soil fertility decline the fogera floodplain is a pioneering agricultural intervention area the findings of this study on cost effective measures and the significant negative consequences of interventions that are not informed by basin wide analyses and that narrowly focus on monoculture rice intensification are relevant to fas across africa and perhaps globally such interventions as established by the study reduce overall productivity of floodplains cause deterioration of downstream livelihoods and the environment monoculture farming can also weaken the resilience of fas which are inherently vulnerable to climate change as they depend on floods that are highly unreliable in timing and volume declaration of

based agricultural systems fas which rely on temporary floods provide livelihoods for nearly 50 million smallholder farmers across water stressed african basins this paper analyses the impact of externally driven agricultural production and productivity improvement interventions in fas taking the ethiopian fogera floodplain as a case study ostroms governing the commons principles were used as analytical framework field data was gathered through focus group discussions and interviews with 266 farmers and pastoralists and 10 local administration staff while the aquacrop model was used to simulate maize yield under varied floodwater management and farming practices the interventions in the fogera floodplain replaced vital maize and teff food crops with high return upstream rice cultivation it has characteristics similar to other interventions across africa 1 inadequate integration of local agricultural water management practices 2 narrow focus on short term economic gains and insufficient attention to long term sustainability of livelihoods and environmental issues and 3 lack of detailed ex ante analysis of basin wide consequences it failed to prioritize the needs of downstream vegetable producers and pastoralists using shallow wells the intervention missed several low cost opportunities including the establishment of rules to protect downstream water rights the construction of gabion strengthened on farm structures to efficiently distribute floods or raised brick walls to reinforce shallow wells and the implementation of measures for improved soil fertility and weed management the study establishes that these missed opportunities could have enhanced livelihoods by doubling rice yield to 6 tons ha increased teff and maize harvests by one third to 3 and 5 tons ha respectively and mitigated 25 vegetable yield loss and 40 reduction in grazing land these opportunities could have also produced environmental benefits including reduced soil moisture and fertility depletion lessons from the fogera floodplain on making interventions cost effective and considering basin wide livelihood impacts are relevant to fas globally keywords agricultural interventions floodwater productivity environmental benefits aquacrop modeling farming and pastoral communities floodwater management rules 1 introduction flood based agricultural systems fas have received relatively little research and investment attention as compared to perennial irrigation systems puertas et al 2015 they are however substantial they cover an estimated 25 million ha across arid and semi arid africa where they provide food and fodder for nearly 50 million farmers irrigating on average 0 5 ha kool et al 2017 there are four widely practiced fas 1 floodplain agriculture flood recession and flood rise the cultivation of floodplains using receding and or rising floodwater 2 flood inundation canal systems where canals fed by temporarily high water levels in rivers irrigate adjacent low lying fields 3 spate irrigation which makes use of short duration floods generated from mountain catchments and 4 depression agriculture shallow seasonally waterlogged depressions that retain sufficient moisture for dry season grazing and crop production kool et al 2017 floodplain agriculture complemented by flood inundation system is the focus of this paper it is the most extensive system covering nearly two thirds of the total 25 million ha potential of fas in arid and semi arid africa puertas et al 2015 floodplain agriculture goes back more than 5000 years in some parts of asia pakistan and yemen in particular and is also widely practiced in several african riverine environments including the logone chari niger senegal and volta rivers adams et al 2018 saarnak 2003 traore et al 2020 the okavango delta motsumi et al 2012 and lake victoria kipkemboi et al 2007 although floodplain agriculture and fas in general have received little policy attention van steenbergen et al 2011 motsumi et al 2012 several east african governments including in sudan ethiopia and kenya have recently invested and are planning to invest in improving the productivity and livelihoods of traditional fas in this paper traditional refers to farmer led fas woodhouse et al 2017 where farmers play a driving role in the design and establishment of the systems and are primarily responsible for the overall operation and maintenance of the floodwater management structures and all relevant farming practices traditional fas often support subsistence food cultivation and rely on simple earthen and stone diversion and distribution structures that are frequently breached by floods in ethiopia among the major local government led interventions was the introduction of rice as a high value crop in around 40 of the 15 000 ha fogera floodplain rice was envisioned to replace teff and maize which are relatively low revenue but vital food crops in order to boost economic growth and lift the living standards of the target communities the significant shift to rice took place in the last decade recent academic interests in fas have focused on scheme level technical improvements gebrehiwot et al 2015 libsekal and mehari 2020 mehari et al 2011 zenebe et al 2015 and impacts of environmental change sall et al 2020 they have also covered farmer management practices singh et al 2021 including the importance of indigenous knowledge motsumi et al 2012 few studies adequately address basin wide floodwater management and productivity issues that impact the livelihoods of multiple varied users and uses castelli et al 2018 attempted a detailed performance analysis of past interventions in the raya valley s fas located in the northern part of ethiopia the analyses however covered only one of the 17 raya valley schemes with relatively homogenous user groups in terms of the type of crops and the size of land they cultivated major basin wide interrelated issues were not discussed yet also at the local level castelli et al 2018 show that participatory engagement of farmers can result in improved design of irrigation and bank erosion structures that respond to the needs of and are in line with the operation and maintenance strategy of the farmers in the fogera floodplain as is typical of fas various users share the same basins with seasonal or intermittent river courses the lack of basin wide analysis could therefore curtail the positive impact of interventions designed to improve traditional fas and may increase the chance of unintended negative consequences as the needs and priorities of some users will not be sufficiently identified and responded to while scientific studies of the impacts of interventions are limited there are some documented cases one example is the wadi zabid spate irrigation scheme in yemen where the upstream expansion of a highly profitable but hugely water demanding banana plantation eventually contributed to frequent downstream sorghum food crop failures zenebe et al 2016 a second example comes from an intervention in wadi siham spate irrigation scheme in yemen the multiple offtake system that allowed downstream water users to withdraw water directly from the river was replaced with a single upstream distribution offtake this intervention is widely perceived as having contributed to floodwater supply scarcity in the downstream area van steenbergen et al 2010 other examples include upstream dam developments in the senegal river saarnak 2003 tana river in kenya zenebe et al 2021 and the mekong delta ngoc 2017 and the modernization of the spate irrigation system in eritrea mehari et al 2011 taking the fogera floodplain as a case study this paper analyses the following three questions what are the strengths and limitations of traditional floodwater management practices in meeting floodwater supply needs enhancing agricultural productivity and livelihoods of basin wide users how has the intervention that partially replaced the vital teff and maize food crops with high value rice upstream cultivation impacted traditional floodwater management practices agricultural productivity and basin wide livelihoods if a basin wide intervention approach had been implemented what technical and non technical measures could have been introduced to further improve floodwater management practices agricultural productivity and livelihoods the fogera floodplain is a relevant case study for two main reasons first the approach followed in the area a limited scope in detailed ex ante scientific diagnosis of basin wide issues as well as lack of attention to long term sustainability is representative of the characteristics of several interventions in fas see for instance zenebe et al 2021 ngoc 2017 mehari et al 2011 second the fogera floodplain is among the pioneer intervention sites to improve the productivity and livelihoods of traditional fas thus it is expected to harbor rich experiences and lessons that can make a significant contribution to enhancing similar endeavors in other fas across africa and perhaps globally 2 theoretical framework the principles of the theory governing the commons presented in table 1 ostrom 2000 provided an analytical framework for the data and information collection across the above outlined three research questions these principles drawn from extensive research have been widely recognized as imperative benchmarks for successful collective management of a shared resource such as the floodwater in fas to provide for the livelihood needs of all target beneficiary groups ostrom 2002 the overarching analytical question was to what extent the floodwater management rules and practices before and after the introduction of rice fulfils the requirement of the principles and how this in turn impacts floodwater availability and productivity and livelihoods of the fogera farming and pastoralist communities the operational effectiveness of the rules was further comparatively analysed against the scope of the package of rules successfully applied across some of the centuries old fas in asia pakistan and yemen in particular table 2 3 materials and methods 3 1 study area description the fogera floodplain is in the fogera district of the amhara region in ethiopia as shown in fig 1 the floodplain is the area with the lowest elevation bordered on the east by the bahir dar gonder road on the west by lake tana and on the north and the south by reb and gumara rivers respectively the potential inundation area is nearly 40 000 ha but the annually flood irrigated land is estimated at 15 000 ha nederveen et al 2011 the floodplain is the major source of food and fodder for 75 of the largely agrarian fogera district population of nearly 250 000 gebey et al 2012 during the june to september rainfall season overflows from lake tana the largest lake in ethiopia and the reb and gumara rivers that ultimately discharge their flow into the lake irrigate the fogera floodplain nederveen et al 2011 the annual average rainfall in the mountainous catchment upstream of the lake and the rivers is about 1200 mm this gradually decreases towards the lowlands reaching its lowest amount of about 400 mm in the downstream fogera floodplain where rainfall is more erratic in nature nederveen et al 2011 the mean monthly temperature ranges from about 20 30 c which is favorable for the major crops grown in the study area rice teff maize as well as vegetables mainly onions and beans gebey et al 2012 for several decades traditional food crops teff and maize have been grown in 8000 ha extending eastwards from the lake tana shore in nabega wagetera kdste hana shina and shaga wards fig 1 in the next kuhar mikael tihua ena kokit wereta and kuhar abo wards about 4000 ha have been cultivated with vegetables using flood recharged shallow wells further in the fringes of the floodplain a vast 3000 ha grazing area supported pastoral livelihoods the fogera floodplain has long attracted the attention of the local government and its development partners as a potential rice hub this is because the floodplain has flat topography and a 2 3 m deep silt loam soil profile with high water holding capacity of about 440 mm m mehari et al 2011 van steenbergen et al 2010 these soil conditions are favorable for the high water demanding rice crop but also for all the other major crops as they complete their entire growth cycle based on residual moisture harnessed with a single irrigation turn of about 350 mm depth during the preceding flood season although there were early attempts to introduce rice in the 1990 s the big push by the local administration came when ethiopia rolled out its nation wide development program in the late 2000 s rice production was first piloted in the upstream part of the floodplain in wagetera and nagega wards close to the lake tana shore fig 1 significant shift to rice cultivation however mainly happened in the last decade there is now 6000 ha rice cropped land in nabega wagetera kdste hana wards originally cultivated by maize and teff flood inundation and flood plain agriculture systems are complementarily practiced the floods generated when lake tana overflows its banks are distributed to the irrigated area through a series of field canals earthen bunds retain the floodwater in the irrigated fields where floodplain agriculture is practiced flood rise for rice and flood recession for the food crops teff and maize and as well as the vegetables a group of fields share a common canal and the floodwater is distributed from one field to the next by breaking the earth bunds field bunds are central to effective floodwater management at both individual farm and irrigation system levels fogera farmers invest time and labor to construct as strong earthen bunds as possible through compaction of 5 10 cm soil layer at a time and eventually reaching a height of about 35 cm unlike in perennial irrigation where multiple irrigation gifts are possible crops in fogera floodplain and other fas depend on one to two irrigation turns which must be adequately retained given this large amount of floodwater supply a breaching of any field bund could lead to devastating damage to neighboring fields and structures the fogera farmers often practice direct manual planting the crop growth period for rice extends from june to september which coincides with the flood season while the other crops complete their growth cycle from end of september to january under flood recession agriculture some of the large scale farmers 0 6 3 ha with relatively more financial resources than the small scale 0 5 ha farmers invest in weed management as well as fertilizer application other field management practices such as mulching are not common 3 2 methods for data and information gathering the analyses in this paper are derived from qualitative and quantitative data gathered from a total of 276 respondents of which 170 150 farmers and 20 pastoralists participated in individual interviews and 80 72 farmers and 8 pastoralists were engaged in focus group discussions fgds in addition 26 key informants guided the field surveys these comprised 12 farmers and four pastoralists purposefully selected and 10 local administration staff active in the fogera floodplain the 150 individually interviewed farmers were selected using stratified random sampling from a database of 1282 farmers with over 10 years of experience in floodwater management and farming practices the database consisted of 366 rice growers 432 teff and maize cultivators and 484 vegetables producers to ensure equal representation the sample sizes from each of the three farmer categories were proportional to their respective total populations since few pastoralists actively interact in floodwater management 20 pastoralists relatively more familiar with the topic and were willing to be interviewed were purposively sampled the 80 fgd participants were also selected using purposive sampling to ensure engagement of those with over 10 years farming or pastoral livelihood experiences the sections below have further details on the three data collection methods 3 2 1 field survey the field survey combined transect walks and key informant interviews kawulich 2005 fourteen transect walk days were organized four days to each of the upstream rice midstream teff and maize and downstream vegetable farming systems and two days to the grazing areas sites with good and poor floodwater management and farming practices were identified and visited together with 16 key farmer informants four representing each of the three category of farmers and the pastoralists who guided the transect walks each transect walk day started with an early morning preparatory meeting followed by 3 5 h walking in the field and an evening wrap up session to summarize main observations and findings the key informant farmers selected in consultation with the community leaders and the local administration met two criteria 1 over 15 year experience as active farmers or pastoralists and 2 good relations with the wider fogera community which was critical for having access to all the selected field visit sites the transect walks generated information on a range of issues floodwater sharing organization of repair and maintenance activities farming practices and actual harvest and the main factors that impact agricultural productivity follow up discussion with the key farmer informants further elaborated on the rules and enforcement mechanisms that governed floodwater management before and after the introduction of rice the discussions with the 10 local administration staff generated policy insights on why rice was introduced and the population and characteristics of the farming and pastoral communities these data and information established the basis for the detailed analyses during the fgds and individual interviews 3 2 2 focus group discussions this widely recognized qualitative research method guest et al 2017 moon et al 2016 engaged a total of 72 farmers and 8 pastoralists in ten homogeneous eight member focus groups that share similar challenges and priorities six farmer groups respectively representing small scale 0 5 ha and large scale 0 6 3 ha operators from either a upstream rice growers b midstream food crop teff and maize cultivators and c tail end vegetable producers one pastoralist group that have grazing land at the downstream fringes of the floodplain and three water masters groups farmer leaders responsible for enforcing floodwater management practices in the rice food crops and vegetable production areas the homogeneity of the focus groups as also discussed by smithson 2000 and cassell and symon 2004 enabled candid interactions in a public setting the fgds started with 25 min brainstorm sessions that introduced the participants to and made them comfortable with the discussion theme floodwater management practices before and after the introduction of rice using colored post it cards the participants were asked to write three short phrases that best expressed their priority floodwater management issues the cards were displayed in a large paperboard and all participants gave 2 3 min elaborations this was followed by 60 80 min discussions guided by 10 12 major questions and facilitated using the cards system all participated by either directly responding to the questions raised or expressing their views on the answers provided by their fellow group members in the concluding session each participant was given about two minutes to share new thoughts or elaborate on points that were not fully addressed the moderator then wrapped up the session with highlights of the important issues discussed this approach of conducting fgds is informed by previous experiences of the first author zenebe et al 2016 2021 and was also found to be effective during the two pilot fgds conducted with a farmer and a pastoralist group the fgds generated rich data across three priority themes a floodwater sharing rules and their impact on floodwater management b strengths and weaknesses of institutional floodwater management arrangements and c basin wide approach for efficient and productive floodwater utilization these thematic areas informed the individual interviews conducted 3 2 3 individual interviews individual interviews are a well recognized method to harvest individual perspectives including on issues that are perceived to be sensitive for public discussion bryman 2016 in this study individual interviews were employed to generate quantitative data across the three thematic areas identified by the fgds the interviews were conducted with 20 pastoralists and 150 farmers fig 2 the database was compiled using a household survey conducted as part of this study the local administration had a list of farmers who regularly cultivate their land and have experience of over 10 years which is imperative as livelihood and yield comparisons have to be made for the periods before and after the introduction of rice the list however lacked data on the size and location of the irrigable land and the crops grown which was completed during the household survey the questionnaire that guided the individual interview was prepared with the laddering technique schultze and avital 2011 an approach that facilitates harnessing detailed individual viewpoints on a specific issue through a set of subsequent interconnected questions for example the following questions captured the fogera farmers livelihood perspectives 1 how do you compare your living standard before and after introduction of rice a significantly improved b slightly improved c remained the same d got slightly worse and e became significantly worse 2 can you explain why there was a slight deterioration in your living standard 3 what do you suggest needs to be done to address the issues you outlined 3 3 data analysis methods the thematic method braun and clarke 2006 nowell et al 2017 was employed to systematically organize the fgds and generate the three main thematic areas outlined in section 3 2 2 this was achieved in a three stage process 1 observation during fgd data collection 2 data familiarization reading through the text and listening to audio recordings and 3 searching for themes taking a much deeper look at the data to identify patterns and eventually themes these thematic areas as mentioned earlier informed the individual interview descriptive statistics and frequency criteria guided the analyses of the individual interview data that was systematically organized in a spreadsheet ostrom s governing the commons principles see section 2 provided the analytical framework for all the data and information gathered through fgds and individual interviews covering floodwater management practices and rules agricultural productivity and livelihood impacts the rules that were operational before introduction of rice and those functional now were further analysed against the scope of the package of rules detailed in section 2 the analytical questions included to what extent have the rules contributed to protecting downstream floodwater rights limiting excessive upstream floodwater use facilitating timely operation and maintenance and mitigating flood damage how has this in turn affected agricultural productivity and livelihoods of the fogera farmers and pastoralists 3 4 aquacrop modeling aquacrop model was employed for detailed yield analyses this model simulates crop and water productivity kg ha and kg m3 under various water scarcity conditions but it can also assess the impacts of farming practices ranjbar et al 2019 steduto et al 2009 maize was singled out for analysis based on inputs from the farmers who participated in the fgds and the individual interviews a maize and teff are the two crops that have suffered the most from increased water scarcity following the introduction of rice of which maize is more sensitive to water stress b farmers are interested in enhancing their maize harvests because the crop has more market value in the region than teff aquacrop has been widely evaluated and found to be reliable for maize yield analyses hammer et al 2009 ranjbar et al 2019 although validating the model was not the objective in this paper good correlation was found between the model results and the individual interview data with regard to the impact of fertilizer deficiency and floodwater losses on maize yield see section 4 3 2 these results further confirm the model is reliable seven scenarios table 3 formulated by the fgd participating farmers assessed impacts on maize yield of various combinations of four factors a floodwater scarcity b floodwater losses caused by earthen field bund failures c soil fertility stress and d non optimal weed management the farmers were interested to know the yields that correspond to the scenarios in order to make an informed investment decision of their limited resources the scenarios reflect the varied floodwater management and farming realities on the ground three in four of the individually interviewed farmers informed that floods often breach earthen field bunds and 30 40 of the maximum 350 mm irrigation depth supplied to the fields is lost all individually interviewed farmers agreed that there is a medium soil fertility stress this corresponds to 20 deficiency in the quantitative categorization of aquacrop model the weed management ranged from good to fairly poor which is equivalent to 10 and 35 weed infestation rates in the model although waterlogging occurs during the flooding period it was not considered in the modeling because maize planting takes place after the floodwater has fully receded infiltrated and the soil is not wet and can allow proper tillage hence the soil is at near field capacity during the planting period the model input parameters are detailed in the appendix 4 results and discussion the socio demographic descriptions of the total population of 1282 farmers and the corresponding 150 sample of individual interview participants are summarized in table 4 the sample is representative of the total population as can be inferred from the closely correlated mean ages and irrigated areas the very low standard deviation stdev values across the six farmer categories are also an indication that the intra variability in the irrigated areas and ages of the farmers is largely insignificant 4 1 traditional floodwater management at a conceptual level as gathered from the fgds the traditional floodwater management system that existed for over two hundred years before the introduction of rice promoted equitable floodwater distribution between the upstream maize and teff growers and the downstream vegetable onion and beans producers this fulfils ostrom s 1st principle table 1 the practical effectiveness of the traditional system was however curtailed as it lacked some imperative rules presented in table 2 4 1 1 traditional floodwater distribution rules the strengths and limitations of the two rules that guided the traditional floodwater management are as discussed below upstream first but with restrictions rule the fgd participants informed that this rule dates back nearly two hundred years it grants the upstream farmers the priority for a single irrigation turn of 350 mm depth and a second turn only after all the other fields have secured the same single turn floods are guided from field to field by breaking earthen bunds which are restricted by this very upstream first rule to a maximum height of 35 cm to avoid excessive floodwater retention the first irrigation turn is less than the minimum 500 mm depth required for optimum maize productivity steduto et al 2012 a fact also recognized by the fgd participating farmers given the unpredictable nature of floods in timing and volume there is no guarantee of a second turn the upstream first rule does therefore in principle facilitate some fairness in floodwater sharing and hence fulfils ostrom s 1st principle table 1 its practical impact was however limited due to absence of the rule on small and large floods table 2 this rule could have restricted the diversion of large floods to the upstream which as observed during the field surveys often damaged the earthen field bunds and resulted in floodwater losses on the other hand letting these large floods flow downstream where they are relatively less destructive could have sufficiently recharged the shallow wells that irrigate vegetables and water the grazing area a third of the interviewed farmers managed to properly construct and timely maintain their field bunds but there were many instances of floodwater losses due to field bund damage this was also several decades back a major challenge in yemen and pakistan but it has been addressed by introducing gabion reinforced field intakes that mitigated field bund failures mehari et al 2005 van steenbergen 1997 the fgd participating farmers agreed that these improved intakes would also be useful in the fogera floodplain introducing such floodwater management structures and effective water distribution rules are also considered priority interventions for the shire valley flood recession and the eritrean western lowlands spate irrigated areas malota and mchenga 2020 mehari et al 2011 in a new year dry fields first rule this rule does not exist in the centuries old fas in yemen and pakistan outlined in table 2 according to the fgds participants it was introduced some 50 years after the upstream first rule to further increase fairness in floodwater sharing it directs that in a new flood season irrigation should start with the fields that did not receive floodwater the previous year while the rule has a powerful equity principle enforcing it is near impossible first it requires that upstream farmers let the floodwater flow downstream while their fields are dry a difficult ask second small and medium floods may dominate the start of the flood season and even if allowed to travel downstream to drier fields they may not have the necessary velocity and volume to reach there all farmers engaged in the fgds agreed that the rule on small and large floods is more practical and a better replacement 4 1 2 institutional floodwater management arrangements the fgd participating farmers explained that a group of three to five farmer leaders locally known as water masters enforced the rules and the operation and maintenance o m of field bunds and canals in their respective villages inhabited by between 200 and 600 farmers they are elected in a village meeting for a single 3 year term which can be renewed once for the same duration any farmer above the age of 25 years is eligible for election water masters do not receive salary but there is one strong incentive irrigation priority as per the provisions and restrictions of the upstream first rule the water masters have the mandate to respectively sanction 400 1200 etb about 10 26 euros for 1st and 2nd time violations of rules or failure to physically participate in o m activities farmers who repeatedly three times or more disobey water masters orders are brought before the local administration a scenario that usually leads to a payment of about 50 a hefty amount for any fogera farmer the money collected is used for food and drinks during o m and other events such as when the community supports elderly farmers during the labor intensive harvesting period the fgd participants emphasized that the hefty penalty was sparingly imposed as farmers often cooperated the water masters led enforcement mechanism is very much akin to the graduated sanctions approach advocated by ostrom s 3rd principle table 1 it was evaluated as being successful by nearly 80 of the interviewed farmers while it did not go as far as depriving farmers of floodwater supply as required by the rule on maintenance table 2 the threat of hefty sanction combined with the strong collaboration between the community respected water masters and the legally powerful local administration has achieved a high degree of discipline in abiding by the rules and conflicts were rare the traditional institutional arrangement does not fulfill ostrom s 4th principle table 1 as there is not any higher level organization that coordinates the activities of the water masters three in four of the interviewed farmers do not see the need for such an organization nearly 90 believe that it is financially unsustainable in their opinion the water masters across the villages are well connected and have the necessary coordination capacity lessons from other fas including the tana river in kenya zenebe et al 2021 and the mekong delta ngoc 2017 however indicate that it is imperative to have a fogera floodplain wide institution to partly represent the farming communities priorities more effectively during external development interventions the analyses of institutional alternatives for african smallholders shah et al 2002 confirms that collaborative institutional arrangement between farmers and irrigation agencies is the most effective farmers alone may not adequately manage irrigation systems because they often do not invest into long term sustainability of irrigation systems a role that can be fulfilled by the public institutions to ensure that farmer organizations adequately pay their share of o m cost however the objective of institutional reforms should shift from just irrigation water management improvement to enhancing productivity and income this implies that water users associations wuas may not be appropriate farmers organizations producers groups with a mandate that goes beyond just managing water distribution and includes agronomic and marketing aspects may be necessary 4 2 floodwater management in the rice era the fgds revealed that the traditional upstream first rule was modified to grant upstream rice farmers two irrigation turns of 350 mm depth each instead of the single turn which was the case in the traditional floodwater management system this modification is contrary to ostrom s 1st principle table 1 that advocates for equally and adequately responding to the needs and priorities of all target beneficiaries it has to be noted however the two irrigation turns is much less than the 1000 mm water requirement of early maturity 100 120 days rice varieties fao 2019 common in fogera floodplains despite its strong economic growth drive the local administration did not insist that upstream rice fields be fully irrigated first this compromise was mainly influenced by the interest of the local administration to maintain the good institutional collaboration they established with the water masters in the pre rice era which they believed was essential for the successful enforcement of the modified upstream first rule during the fgds the water masters informed that they did not play a decision making role in the modification of the rule as required by ostrom s 2nd principle table 1 in principle the water masters agreed that they might have had a stronger influence if the rules on special crop preference and demarcation table 2 were part of the traditional floodwater management system this could have led to a fairer floodwater sharing arrangement such as equally dividing the 3 month june to august flood period between the upstream rice growers and the downstream farmers and pastoralists this floodwater sharing arrangement was widely perceived as a good compromise by small and large scale fas farmers in kenya zenebe et al 2021 the second traditional rule in a new year dry fields first was scrapped to eliminate the risk posed by the rule on significant floodwater supply reduction to upstream rice fields from the above it can be deduced that the floodwater management intervention did not follow a basin wide approach it narrowly focused on mainly increasing floodwater supply to the upstream rice cultivation little attention was given to analyses of downstream farming and pastoral livelihoods priorities flood mitigation measures and environmental needs as a result some opportunities were missed including a the introduction of the rule on small and large floods which could have increased irrigation supply to the midstream food crops teff and maize and the downstream vegetable onion and beans cultivation by prohibiting the diversion of large floods to the upstream where they often cause more damage and are less productive and b low cost improved gabion re enforced field intakes which as discussed could significantly reduce breaching of earthen field bunds and floodwater losses some fas farmers in the tigray northern region of ethiopia are already using gabion structures libsekal and mehari 2020 cost may not therefore be a barrier for introducing it to fogera floodplain investing in the food and vegetable crops is not only essential to respond to midstream and downstream agricultural productivity and livelihood needs it can also contribute to shifting from monoculture rice farming to profitable diversified agricultural system which is more resilient to climate change impacts the fogera floodplain and all other fas are inherently vulnerable to climate change as they depend on floods highly unreliable in timing and volume 4 3 floodwater productivity and livelihood analyses drawing from the individual interviews fig 3 summarizes the comparative livelihood analyses for the periods before and after introduction of rice all teff and maize farmers were negatively impacted with about half reporting significant worsening of their living standards about two third of the vegetable producers experienced slight livelihood deterioration the majority 80 90 rice farmers who previously cultivated teff and maize slightly improved their livelihoods the rest significantly 4 3 1 rice irrigating farmers the assertion by the overwhelming majority of current rice irrigating farmers that the shift they made from teff and maize food crops to high value rice production only slightly improved their livelihoods fig 3 is informed by a combination of the high expectations set by the local administration above 5 tons ha and the relatively low rice crop harvests obtained fig 4 summarizes the yield obtained in 2019 by the interviewed 22 large scale and 21 small scale farmers even the highest reported yields of about 4 tons ha are far below the optimum 9 tons ha fao 2019 when irrigation soil fertility and other field management practices are not limiting factors the highest yields are also much less than the 6 tons ha achieved by small scale farmers in kenya with irrigation applications and soil profiles similar to that in the fogera floodplain ndiiri et al 2013 comparatively the large scale farmers obtained higher rice yields their median productivity 3 3 tons ha is 30 higher than that of the small scale farmers fig 4 further the inter quartile range iqr or the box width which measures data intra variability is 44 greater in the case of small scale farmers the majority of the small scale farmers are concentrated on the lower yield range as shown by the positive skewness of the data a median closer to the bottom of the box and a whisker line shorter on the lower end of the box this indicates the large scale farmers were more consistent in realizing their relatively higher yields all of the interviewed small scale farmers and 90 of the large scale farmers informed that the low rice harvest is the main constraint for better livelihoods as there is a vibrant and high market demand for rice in fogera district and the amhara region with about 20 million population nederveen et al 2011 the grain is both staple and cash crop while the straw provides nutritious livestock feed the farmers explained that there is no added value of leaving the straw in the field or integrating it into the soil as it does not quickly degrade and does not improve soil condition and fertility this assertion is supported by a field research conducted in thailand that concluded rice straw did not improve rice productivity maneepitak et al 2019 similar findings were reported by hanafi et al 2012 the individual interviews identified two key factors that contributed to the low rice yields 1 poor on farm floodwater management nearly 75 of the participating farmers explained that although there is some shortage in physical floodwater supply lack of effective field techniques to better manage floods and reduce losses was the more significant and frequent problem that reduced yield as discussed the intervention in fogera did not introduce improved gabion re enforced field intakes and the earthen bunds are often breached leading to significant irrigation losses the small scale farmers are more vulnerable as they lack resources to timely and properly maintain their field bunds 2 soil fertility stress the 71 and 24 of the interviewed large and small scale farmers who managed 3 0 tons ha and above fig 4 applied between 25 and 50 kg of urea ha 12 23 kg ha of nitrogen fertilization n the four best performing large scale farmers who obtained at least 4 tons ha used 100 kg of urea ha 46 kg ha n these facts back the claim by 80 of the interviewed farmers that the fogera floodplain has some soil fertility deficiency there was no significant difference in floodwater management and other farming practices among the interviewed large and small scale farmers nearly a third of the large scale and three quarters of the small scale farmers could not use fertilizers due to limited supply and high cost among those who managed the application rates are much less than the 60 kg ha of n recommended for rice cultivation in the lowland region of ethiopia bado et al 2018 a field experiment conducted in the region tamene et al 2017 has also shown positive yield response up to 75 kg ha of n there is therefore opportunity to further increase productivity by making fertilizers widely available and affordable it is important though to learn from mekong delta experience where nitrogen fertilizer overuse in rice fields has caused environmental degradation including soil acidification and water pollution tran et al 2018 a more sustainable approach would be to use organic compost fertilization what is relevant here as also discussed by motsumi et al 2012 and nguyen et al 2020 is to have supportive policies from national to local levels that encourage farmers participation and promote sustainable productivity and livelihoods rice planting practices were identified as yield impacting factors by just 15 of the rice interviewed farmers however all farmers practice direct broadcast sowing which often leads to high planting density poor germination and reduced seed setting a field experiment conduced in kenya has shown that transplanting of younger seedlings with wider spacing significantly increased productivity ndiiri et al 2013 these practices were also reported to have increased yield under flood recession in mali by about 40 traore et al 2020 seedling preparation is a well known practice in ethiopia see for example thijssen et al 2008 the local administration staff informed that the practice was not given attention but that it can be piloted in some farmers fields and then further upscaled finally spatial variability linked to the location of fields across the fogera floodplain was not identified by the rice farmers as a yield determining factor as mentioned earlier this may be due to the fact that for the majority of the farmers the major challenge is floodwater losses caused by poor management practices not physical water scarcity there is also no significant spatial variability in the soil type and depth nederveen et al 2011 4 3 2 traditional food crop farmers the data gathered from individual interviews with 51 teff and maize cultivating farmers indicates that the yield of both crops was low under the traditional system before introduction of rice at an average of about 40 of the attainable 7 5 tons ha and 3 tons ha maize and teff productivities respectively see the medians in figs 5 and 6 attainable yield refers to yields obtained in ethiopia with sufficient irrigation and fertilizer application clarke et al 2017 yihun et al 2013 it can also be inferred from figs 5 and 6 that the maize yield gap between large and small scale farmers is much bigger this is because 40 of the large scale maize farmers applied fertilizers to boost their harvest beyond their household requirements to generate income due to financial constraints maize fertilization was given preference as teff is relatively widely available and hence has much lower market value roughly 80 of the interviewed small scale farmers could not afford to use fertilizers nearly all 95 of the interviewed small and large scale maize and teff farmers explained that they now following introduction of rice often experience floodwater scarcity and their best case scenario is receiving a single 350 mm irrigation depth this would be sufficient for teff but is significantly lower than the 500 800 mm maize irrigation requirement fao 2019 furthermore maize is more sensitive to water stress these facts explain the greater decline in maize yield 36 small scale farmers and 25 large scale farmers compared to the 20 and 18 reductions in teff figs 5 and 6 maize farmers are highly interested in boosting their harvest to better understand the impact of key floodwater management and farming practices aquacrop model was used to simulate yield under the seven scenarios formulated by the farmers table 3 the objective was to support farmers make an informed decision on how best to invest their limited resources the main results were as follows the farmers who secure a single irrigation turn 350 mm could achieve a maximum 5 tons ha maize yield if they mitigate field bund damage avoid floodwater losses adequately apply fertilizers and undertake proper weed management 30 40 floodwater losses which as informed by all interviewed farmers often occur due to poor on farm water management and flood damage to field bunds could reduce the maximum yield by 45 and 60 respectively moderate fertility stress 20 can decrease the maximum yield by 1 6 tons ha or about one third this correlates with the 1 1 1 5 tons ha yield increase attained by large scale farmers who applied fertilizers see the difference between maximum and minimum yields in fig 5 the combined effect of 30 floodwater loss and 20 fertility stress can reduce the maximum yield by 66 to about 1 8 tons ha which is also the maximum obtained by the small scale farmers following the introduction of rice fig 5 as indicated earlier 80 of the small scale farmers did not apply fertilizers due to financial constraints for this same reason they are also the most vulnerable to floodwater losses 4 3 3 vegetable producers and pastoralists the 27 small scale and 29 large scale farmers who participated in the individual interviews figs 7 and 8 obtained an average yield of 16 75 tons ha onion and 4 3 tons ha fresh beans before rice was introduced these yields are roughly 40 and 60 of the optimum values under sufficient irrigation and fertilizer application fao 2019 the onions and beans are irrigated downstream by floodwater recharged shallow hand dug wells following the introduction of rice much of the small medium and large floods were retained upstream resulting in only occasional very large flood flows downstream as a result nearly 90 of the interviewed farmers claimed that the recharge capacity has significantly reduced and they have over the past years observed a decline in their well water levels while their cropping pattern and irrigated areas have not changed the local administration staff that participated in the key informant interviews agreed with the farmers observations but also pointed to the absence of groundwater level monitoring data moreover three in four of the interviewed farmers asserted that the very large floods frequently caused physical damage and sedimentation of the hand dug wells desilting repair and maintenance is not always timely done due to labor and financial constraints these factors resulted in inadequate or delayed irrigation and about 30 reduction in the average yields of both small and large scale farmers it should be noted here however that besides the introduction of rice intensified land use and climate change may be significant contributors to the frequent large flood occurrences unlike in the case of rice teff and maize crops the onion and beans yield gap between small and large scale farmers is less significant at about 10 figs 7 and 8 the large scale farmers have better financial capacity and nearly 60 timely desilted and repaired their shallow wells prepared their irrigation fields and harvested high yields the other 40 however were less attentive to farming they have off farm economic activities such as small retail shops and their productivity was low bringing down the large scale farmers overall average yield the high yield variability is reflected in the iqr of the large scale farmers which is three fold that of the small scale farmers in concluding the discussion on vegetables productivity we wish to emphasize the point made in section 4 2 that the lack of basin wide approach in fogera floodplain did not offer adequate prospects for detailed impact assessment of upstream rice interventions on downstream floodwater supply and management needs and priorities this has contributed to some low cost missed opportunities such as reinforcing the embankment of shallow wells with raised brick walls or stone riprap that could have reduced the rate of flood damage and sedimentation coming to the pastoralists the 20 individual interview participants and the 8 persons engaged in the fgds estimated that the annually irrigated pastureland has decreased by some 40 to about 1800 ha and the livestock mainly cattle population has decreased by nearly two thirds or roughly 1500 heads they explained that these decreases are caused by the increase in rice production which has resulted in the retention of floods in the upper part of the fogera plain including the larger floods that used to irrigate their grazing area 5 conclusion the paper analysed in detail floodwater management and productivity of the fogera floodplain and the livelihoods of its basin wide users prior to and following the agricultural intervention that replaced the vital teff and maize food crops with high value upstream rice cultivation the traditional floodwater management promoted some fairness in floodwater sharing it however lacked critical agricultural floodwater management rules techniques and practices and remained a low production and subsistence livelihood system the narrow focus of the agricultural intervention on enhancing rice harvests through primarily increasing floodwater supply and the desire to fast track development at the expense of long term sustainability and detailed analyses of all basin wide challenges and opportunities has negatively affected fogera floodplain agricultural productivity and hence livelihoods rice harvest remained low at about 3 tons ha as compared to the attainable 6 tons ha maize and teff harvests declined by 30 and 20 respectively vegetable onion and green bean productivity dropped by nearly a third and grazing land dwindled by some 40 to about 1800 ha taking a basin wide approach a package of low cost agricultural productivity and livelihood improvement measures could have been introduced a floodwater management rules that mitigate flood damage protect downstream rights and give preference to food crops b gabion reinforced on farm structures for efficient floodwater distribution c appropriate application of fertilizers and weed management this has improved maize and rice yields by one third and d strengthening shallow well embankments with raised brick walls to decrease flood damage and sedimentation and enhance recharge capacity these low cost interventions can also achieve environmental benefits including reducing water logging and salinity risk soil erosion moisture depletion and soil fertility decline the fogera floodplain is a pioneering agricultural intervention area the findings of this study on cost effective measures and the significant negative consequences of interventions that are not informed by basin wide analyses and that narrowly focus on monoculture rice intensification are relevant to fas across africa and perhaps globally such interventions as established by the study reduce overall productivity of floodplains cause deterioration of downstream livelihoods and the environment monoculture farming can also weaken the resilience of fas which are inherently vulnerable to climate change as they depend on floods that are highly unreliable in timing and volume declaration of

9731,selecting appropriate reference evapotranspiration eto methods is crucial for managing water resources efficiently statistical criteria commonly used to assess the performance of empirical eto models on a station level may produce inconsistent results making ranking approaches a complex process this study was conducted in india s humid and subtropical region considering 11 years of mean daily data from 2009 to 2019 we evaluated thirty empirical eto models which were categorized into four groups based on the input parameters namely temperature based 10 radiation based 10 mass transfer based 9 and combination model 1 the results show that the observed eto reached maximum magnitude during monsoon followed by spring summer autumn winter and pre winter season the average observed eto from 2009 to 2019 was 1163 mm among temperature based and radiation based models the hargreaves model with rmse of 1 45 mm day and the turc model with rmse of 1 01 mm day yielded the best eto predictions under the humid sub tropical climate conditions the radiation based models demonstrate higher accuracy in the prediction of eto than the temperature based and mass transfer based models the fao56 pm technique turc model hargreaves model makkink model and papadakis model were ranked as the five best models among all 30 tested models overall the fao56 pm method outperformed among all 30 selected models thus the exact calculation of eto is essential for many agricultural water engineering applications particularly in developing countries with a lack of meteorological data records and limited resources to conduct long term in situ observation of evapotranspiration the methodological approach proposed in this work applies to any other location for a simple yet rigorous

and immovable plane of 70 s m 1 resistance with an albedo of 0 23 smith et al 1992 eto magnitude is influenced by various climatic variables such as relative humidity air temperature solar radiation and wind speed its accuracy is essential for calculating the crop water requirement irrigation scheduling water resource management climate change management and evaluating the water budget lysimeters provide accurate measurement used to evaluate other eto measurement techniques lópez urrea et al 2006 however due to the high cost and intricacy its application is generally limited with short term investigations allen et al 2011 as a result using mathematical equations based on climatological data is the best alternative for real world applications a standard fao56 pm method is a physical approach for calculating eto using meteorological variables it has proven to be the benchmark method for evaluating this parameter and calibrating other empirical eto equations allen et al 1998 however the large amount of data required for the fao56 pm method calls for an alternative eto measurement method based on limited data requirements although few such methods already exist and are classified as 1 temperature methods oudin et al 2005 thornthwaite 1948 xu and singh 2001 2 mass transfer methods singh and xu 1997 3 radiation methods hargreaves and samani 1985 djaman et al 2015 2017

methods with 26 mathematical equations at the modern agriculture centre in kluang located in johor peninsular malaysia they found that the mass transfer based penman model gave the best eto results as compared to others similarly bourletsikas et al 2017 compared 24 mathematical methods for evaluating eto they found that mass transfer based models must be calibrated to enhance performance in greece gao et al 2017 also examined 14 different empirical eto equations in different climates regions in china they found that the priestley taylor hargreaves and makkink methods performed best in dry semidry and humid climates respectively celestin et al 2020 used temperature solar radiation and mass transfer data to compare the 32 empirical eto equations with the fao56 pm in northwest china they discovered that the world meteorological organization wmo and the mahringer methods produced the best outcome sharafi and ghaleni 2021 studied various empirical models for eto in varying climatic conditions in iran they discovered that the simplest regression model mlr was more accurate based on the minimum and maximum temperature data than the empirical models they also suggested that the irmak equation could be an alternative for the fao56 pm method particularly in arid and semi arid climates there is a lack of studies comparing various empirical eto in humid and subtropical climate conditions to best our knowledge therefore to fill this gap in knowledge and address the difference in findings from previous studies we evaluated 31 different empirical eto models applied in a region characterized by humid and subtropical climate conditions the performance of each model was assessed using eight different statistical indicators thus the main objective of this study is to assess which of the models proposed is more suitable to be implemented for accurate eto estimation at the study area which is subject to a humid and subtropical climate the findings also aim to aid agricultural engineers scientists and researchers in calculating eto crop et and assessing crop water requirements for rain fed and irrigated agriculture the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 gives brief information about the study site and the methodological approach section 3 summarizes the main results and discusses their relevance finally the main conclusions derived from this study are presented in section 4 novelty this study was conducted to compare several eto methods to select the best method for water developers and users for the most precise irrigation scheduling this work is more important and necessary for the study area we can apply it in other arid or semi arid regions for agricultural water management to save high amounts of water 2 materials and method 2 1 study area the present study was conducted in the ludhiana station of punjab india located between latitude 30 56 n and longitude 75 52 e with an altitude of 247 m above mean sea level fig 1 the maximum temperature varies from 43 c to 45 c in may and june while the minimum temperature ranges from 0 6 c to 3 8 c in january the area s annual rainfall is 680 0 mm with 32 22 during

indicated as positive and negative in contrast platykurtic and leptokurtic attributes were noted via kurtosis in the study area the variation of monthly rainfall and pan evaporation values for the analyzed period are displayed in fig 2 the maximum and minimum rainfall was recorded in august and march with 331 4 mm and 4 0 mm respectively at the same time the maximum and minimum pan evaporation value was observed in june 291 4 mm and december 30 5 mm months respectively the variation of monthly climatic parameters i e maximum and minimum temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity daily mean wind speed daily sunshine hour pan evaporation and solar radiation are shown in fig 3 pan evaporation is a famous indirect method which is widely used for eto estimation the pan evaporation data is multiplied by the pan coefficient to get the observed eto this coefficient varies from 0 35 to 0 85 depending upon several factors muhammad et al 2019 the daily eto is calculated by multiplying the pan evaporation data ep by the pan coefficient kp in the recent decades various researchers have suggested different equations for calculating kp values cuenca 1989 allen and pruitt 1991 snyder 1992 pereira et al 1995 orang 1998 raghuwanshi and wallender 1998 snyder 2008 and the same models are used in the present study for estimation of kp in this study the pereira et al method was used to estimate the pan coefficient described in section 2 2 2 2 methodology in this study 30 empirical eto models were categorized into four groups based on the various climatic variables temperature 10 radiation 10 mass transfer 9 and combination model 1 reference evapotranspiration was calculated by comparing their estimates to pan evaporation data the various methods included for evaluation in temperature based radiation based mass transfer based and combination models are given in tables 2 5 respectively because of its applicability simplicity of use and the broad availability of pan evaporation data estimating eto from pan evaporation ep data using pan coefficient kp is a widespread technique furthermore when the evaporation pan is correctly maintained numerous studies have shown a significant degree of connection between ep and eto pradhan et al 2013 it provides a significant estimate of kp since utilizing a single kp value for most stations throughout the year may result in substantial eto estimation error as a result many studies have been performed to determine the value of kp for various months and to assess various empirical techniques for kp estimate in a semi arid and humid area of india allen and pruitt 1991 cuenca 1989 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 pradhan et al 2013 roderick et al 2007 sabziparvar et al 2010 snyder 1992 the relation between these two is given as follows et o e p k p the kp accounts for relative humidity wind speed and windward side distance of a green crop or a dry fallow this coefficient kp varies from 0 35 to 1 1 depending upon several factors aschonitis et al 2012 muhammad et al 2019 several models have been developed to estimate kp for the particular stations region sabziparvar et al 2010

2 3 statistical analysis the various statistical performance indicators namely nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index of agreement d pearson correlation coefficient pcc r coefficient of determination r2 normalized root mean square error nmrse mean square error mse mean absolute error mae mean bias error mbe and taylor diagram described in table 6 were used to evaluate the effectiveness of these empirical models a model nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 90 indicates that the model or equation of interest is satisfactory numbers between 80 and 90 indicate acceptable efficiency however values below 80 indicate that the model is not performing satisfactorily chauhan and shrivastava 2009 the nse ranges from minus infinity to one nse 1 nse below zero nse 0 indicates that the observed median is as strong as the average whereas negative values suggest that the observed median is a more robust indicator than the average liu et al 2013 the agreement d index calculates the additive and proportional differences between observed and gridded data willmott 1981 therefore d and nse values near 1 indicate a better match between observed and gridded data the nrmse refers to the accuracy of the modeled data by calculating the size of the errors willmott 1982 the pcc is also known as the correlation coefficient and is used to calculate the degree of collinearity between observed and estimated values the pcc varies from minus one to plus one 1 pcc 1 the rmse range is zero to infinity 0 rmse the lower the rmse the better the model s performance the most accurate models were selected based on the highest values of nse d pcc r and r2 while showing the lowest nrmse mse mae and mbe among all developed models kumar et al 2021 3 results and discussion the reference eto values were estimated by four different methods based on temperature radiation mass transfer and combination during the annual and seasonal period i e winter spring summer monsoon autumn and pre winter in the study area for the period of 2009 2019 for 11 years are displayed in the tables 7 10 respectively the maximum value of observed eto was found in the summer season followed by spring monsoon autumn pre winter and winter at the same time the total observed eto was detected to be 1234 35 mm from january 2009 december 2019 the maximum and minimum values of estimated annual and seasonal eto using temperature based models namely ivanov hamon papadakis schendel blaney criddle linacre kharrufa hargreaves trajkovic and ravazzani are shown in table 7 on the annual scale the models ivanov hamon papadakis schendel linacre kharrufa hargreaves trajkovic and ravazzani overestimated the considerable value in contrast only the blaney criddle model indicated the underestimated value similarly the annual and seasonal estimation of eto in the radiation based models viz irmak rn irmak rs abtew jones caprio priestley jensen turc makkink and cochrane orcutt are shown in table 8 from the data it can be perceived that the models namely irmak rn irmak rs abtew jones caprio jensen and turc displayed the overestimated value while the rest showed significant underestimation in mass transfer based models i e dalton trabert meyer rohwer penman albrecht brockamp wmo and mehringer the maximum and minimum annual and seasonal values of expected eto are represented in table 9 shows that all the models depict overestimation except in mahringer model furthermore the combination based model namely the penmen monteith model was very close to the observed eto and slight underestimation as shown in table 10 in addition the total eto values simulated for the entire experiment period 01 01 2019 31 12 2019 are illustrated in fig 4 models such as hamon szasz mahringer wmo brockmap albrecht meyer trabert and dalton underestimated the eto values compared to the observed eto at the same time ravazzani and trajkovic overestimated the eto value as compared to other models only fao penman monteith model was very close to the observed eto the efficiency of 30 selected eto models was evaluated based on performance indicators such as nse d pcc r r2 nrmse mse mae and mbe for higher accuracy in the prediction of eto the model with a higher performance indication of parameters such as nse d pcc r and r2 while the lowest value of nrmse mse mae and mbe or even close to 0 are only considered the statistical evaluation of temperature mass transfer radiation and combination based models is depicted in tables 11 14 respectively a perusal of data presented in table 11 and fig 5 revealed that among the different temperature based eto models the hargreaves model was found to be the best for the prediction of eto in comparison to observed eto with the highest values of nse 0 79 d 0 89 pcc r 0 93 r2 0 87 along with the lowest values of nrmse 0 41 mse 1 02 mae 1 10 and mbe 0 22 the scatter plots of various temperature based models between estimated and observed daily eto were represented in fig 6 respectively the regression line rl was above the best fit 1 1 for trajkovic ravazzani kharrufa schendel and ivanov revealing that these five models overestimated the daily observed eto also the regression line was located under the 1 1 line for hamon blaney criddle linacre and hargreaves model signifying that these models underestimated eto concerning the daily observed eto values in addition to the above the performance of the temperature based models was assessed using a radar chart for the best calculated values of rmse mm having a better diagnostic analysis of the efficiency of all temperature based models the results of the best estimated values are shown in fig 13 the smaller size of stars with lower values for rmse would indicate the better performance of the models fig 13 reveals that temperature based models estimated eto values better than mass transfer based models but performed lower than radiation based models further comparative analysis of temperature based models was done using the taylor diagram according to fig 15 the hamon model was located furthest in contrast the hargreaves model was located nearest the observed point based on the standard deviation correlation and rmse concluding hamon as the worst model and hargreaves as the best model among the selected temperature based models a similar result had been reported by several researchers dhakal et al 2020 djaman et al 2017 muhammad et al 2019 tabari et al 2013 the data summarized in table 12 and fig 7 divulge that among the mass transfer based models the penman model produced the highest values of nse d pcc r and r2 at 0 67 0 81 0 92 and 0 84 respectively while the values of nrmse mse mae and mbe were the lowest at 0 41 1 19 0 94 and 0 46 respectively the scatter plots the observed against the estimated eto of the dalton trabert meyer rohwer penman albrecht brockamp wmo and mahringer models over the experiential period shown in fig 8 the different conditions have resulted between rl and 1 1 line for all the models in the case of the penman model rl s location was above the best fil line 1 1 showing that the model has overestimated the observed daily eto the rl divided the best fit 1 1 for the mahringer and rohwer models this showed that models overestimated the lower values of eto 2 3 mm day for the mahringer model and 8 5 mm day for the rohwer model and under estimated the higher values of eto in the selected humid subtropical climate region the comparison among the mass transfer based models was made using a radar chart of rmse values fig 13 showed the high values of calculated rmse for all the models this reveals that mass transfer based models have lower performance as compared to the temperature and radiation based models the comparison among the mass transfer based models was made with a radar chart of rmse values fig 13 showed the high values of calculated rmse for all the models this reveals that mass transfer based models have lower performance as compared to the temperature and radiation based models further evaluation was achieved using the taylor diagram to check the models performances as presented in fig 17 it is clear from fig 17 that penman models were located nearest to the observed point followed by the rohwer model based on the standard deviation correlation and rmse the meyer model was located furthest and yielded the worst performance in the estimation of daily eto values in radiation based eto models the statistical performance of the turc model was seen to be the best in comparison to the observed eto with the maximum value of nse d pcc r and r2 which is 0 65 0 74 0 86 and 0 74 and minimum values of 0 56 1 32 1 43 1 01 and 1 09 respectively under nrmse mse mae and mbe as shown in table 13 and fig 9 the scatter plots and temporal variation graphs of the observed against the estimated eto of the cochrane orcutt makkink turc jensen priestley caprio jones abtew irmak rs and irmak rn models over the experiential period are displayed in fig 10 the different conditions have resulted between rl and 1 1 lines for all the models for caprio and jensen models fig 9 the rl was over the 1 1 line thus over estimating the eto values in the case of cochrane orcutt makkink turc priestley jones abtew irmak rs and irmak rn models the regression line divided the best fit line 1 1 this reveals that the models over estimated the smaller values 2 5 mm day for cochrane orcutt and makkink models 4 2 mm day for turc abtew and irmak rs models 2 2 mm day for priestley model 5 9 mm day for jones model and 3 8 mm day for irmak rn model while under estimated the higher values of eto in the study area fig 13 represents the radar chart for the best calculated values of rmse mm it reveals that solar radiation based models have higher accuracy in estimating eto values these models have smaller stars with lower values for rmse compared to the temperature based and mass transfer based models further a comparison among the radiation based models was using the taylor diagram from fig 16 model caprio and jansen showed the highest correlation coefficient but models high rmse values were observed turc model can be considered a high performing model with the lowest rmse and high correlation however it has a standard deviation lower than the observed values further from the data represented in table 14 the parameters of the statistical performance of the combination based eto model i e fao 56 pm were found to be as 0 76 0 90 0 96 0 93 0 84 0 67 0 24 and 0 12 under nse d pcc r r2 nrmse mse mae and mbe respectively versus the observed eto the time series plots between estimated and observed daily eto and their scatter plots for the fao56 pm were represented in fig 11 a the regression line rl was located below the best fit 1 1 for fao56 pm revealing that these models were very close to the observed daily eto among other models fig 11b the fao56 pm method is the most efficient for estimating eto in different climatic regions the fao56 pm model was developed based on physiological and aerodynamic theories of surface water release to the atmosphere therefore based on the fao recommendation it can be used as a standard model for estimating eto in any region without adjusting parameters lang et al 2017 the present study also found that fao penman monteith is the best model for the study area the time series plots between estimated and observed daily eto and their scatter plots for the fao56 pm were represented in fig 11a the regression line rl was located below the best fit 1 1 for fao56 pm thus revealing that these models were very close to the observed daily eto among all other models fig 11b however the fao56 pm model for estimating eto needs many meteorological variables including air temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation it is often challenging to obtain data of all the meteorological variables many meteorological stations in developing countries do not measure all these variables therefore a large number of alternative models have been developed based on the availability of data in this study 30 selected models were evaluated in the humid subtropical climate according to the rmse and sse values the ten best models were selected among the 30 considered eto models from fig 14 12 respectively penmen monteith model ranked first with an rmse of 1 006 mm day and sse of 369 389 mm2 turc model radiation based ranked second with an rmse of 1 423 mm day and sse of 739 327 mm2 the temperature based hargreaves and radiation based makkink can be considered the third and fourth best models with rmse values of 1 444 and 1 472 mm day respectively and sse values of 761 326 791 307 mm2 respectively the fifth was the papadakis temperature based model with an rmse of 1 477 mm day and sse of 796 606 mm2 the irmak rs cochrane orcutt jones priestley and irmak rn ranked sixth to tenth from fig 18 the taylor diagram confirmed the model s performance as stated in the manuscript in general the radiation based models can accurately estimate eto values and the mass transfer based models had shown the worst performances among the eto models evaluated tabari et al 2013 the radiation based and temperature based models were the best suited equations for the study area the finding of this study aligned with the earlier studies dar et al 2017 muhammad et al 2019 tabari et al 2013 4 conclusions and outlook in the present study thirty empirical eto models were evaluated classified in a different category based on the various climatic variables i e temperature 10 radiation 10 mass transfer 9 and combination model 1 in humid and subtropical climate conditions the various statistical performance indicators were used to evaluate the effectiveness of these empirical models in general the radiation based models can accurately estimate the eto values that combination based fao56 pm model was the best model with the highest values of nse 0 76 d 0 90 pcc r 0 96 r2 0 93 and the lowest nrmse 0 84 mse 0 67 mae 0 12 thus ranked one in general the radiation based models can accurately estimate the eto values and the mass transfer based models except the penman model had the worst performances among all models the different temperature based eto models the hargreaves model was found to be the best for the prediction of eto in comparison to observed eto with the highest values of nse 0 79 d 0 89 pcc r 0 93 r2 0 87 along with the lowest values of nrmse 0 41 mse 1 02 mae 1 10 and mbe 0 22 the result showed that the radiation based and temperature based models were the best suited equations for the study area the research is a vital scientific contribution to eto quantification and influential empirical models in such a diverse climatic condition of india where many meteorological datasets could not be acquired this study provides essential guidance for agricultural water practices hydrological processes and irrigation management in india also helpful as well as the similar subtropical climate region elsewhere in the world we acknowledge that the precision of model performance is entirely dependable on the quality of input data some empirical models require only input data e g inavov and schendel model still most of them require more input data so that data scarcity can be a problem on the other side field experiments could take much time therefore when selecting an empirical model to estimate eto it is crucial to define a trade off between data

9731,selecting appropriate reference evapotranspiration eto methods is crucial for managing water resources efficiently statistical criteria commonly used to assess the performance of empirical eto models on a station level may produce inconsistent results making ranking approaches a complex process this study was conducted in india s humid and subtropical region considering 11 years of mean daily data from 2009 to 2019 we evaluated thirty empirical eto models which were categorized into four groups based on the input parameters namely temperature based 10 radiation based 10 mass transfer based 9 and combination model 1 the results show that the observed eto reached maximum magnitude during monsoon followed by spring summer autumn winter and pre winter season the average observed eto from 2009 to 2019 was 1163 mm among temperature based and radiation based models the hargreaves model with rmse of 1 45 mm day and the turc model with rmse of 1 01 mm day yielded the best eto predictions under the humid sub tropical climate conditions the radiation based models demonstrate higher accuracy in the prediction of eto than the temperature based and mass transfer based models the fao56 pm technique turc model hargreaves model makkink model and papadakis model were ranked as the five best models among all 30 tested models overall the fao56 pm method outperformed among all 30 selected models thus the exact calculation of eto is essential for many agricultural water engineering applications particularly in developing countries with a lack of meteorological data records and limited resources to conduct long term in situ observation of evapotranspiration the methodological approach proposed in this work applies to any other location for a simple yet rigorous

and immovable plane of 70 s m 1 resistance with an albedo of 0 23 smith et al 1992 eto magnitude is influenced by various climatic variables such as relative humidity air temperature solar radiation and wind speed its accuracy is essential for calculating the crop water requirement irrigation scheduling water resource management climate change management and evaluating the water budget lysimeters provide accurate measurement used to evaluate other eto measurement techniques lópez urrea et al 2006 however due to the high cost and intricacy its application is generally limited with short term investigations allen et al 2011 as a result using mathematical equations based on climatological data is the best alternative for real world applications a standard fao56 pm method is a physical approach for calculating eto using meteorological variables it has proven to be the benchmark method for evaluating this parameter and calibrating other empirical eto equations allen et al 1998 however the large amount of data required for the fao56 pm method calls for an alternative eto measurement method based on limited data requirements although few such methods already exist and are classified as 1 temperature methods oudin et al 2005 thornthwaite 1948 xu and singh 2001 2 mass transfer methods singh and xu 1997 3 radiation methods hargreaves and samani 1985 djaman et al 2015 2017 and 4 combination methods allen et al 1998 a significant number of studies have been done in various parts of the world to determine the best eto model bogawski and bednorz 2014 farzanpour et al 2019

methods with 26 mathematical equations at the modern agriculture centre in kluang located in johor peninsular malaysia they found that the mass transfer based penman model gave the best eto results as compared to others similarly bourletsikas et al 2017 compared 24 mathematical methods for evaluating eto they found that mass transfer based models must be calibrated to enhance performance in greece gao et al 2017 also examined 14 different empirical eto equations in different climates regions in china they found that the priestley taylor hargreaves and makkink methods performed best in dry semidry and humid climates respectively celestin et al 2020 used temperature solar radiation and mass transfer data to compare the 32 empirical eto equations with the fao56 pm in northwest china they discovered that the world meteorological organization wmo and the mahringer methods produced the best outcome sharafi and ghaleni 2021 studied various empirical models for eto in varying climatic conditions in iran they discovered that the simplest regression model mlr was more accurate based on the minimum and maximum temperature data than the empirical models they also suggested that the irmak equation could be an alternative for the fao56 pm method particularly in arid and semi arid climates there is a lack of studies comparing various empirical eto in humid and subtropical climate conditions to best our knowledge therefore to fill this gap in knowledge and address the difference in findings from previous studies we evaluated 31 different empirical eto models applied in a region characterized by humid and subtropical climate conditions the performance of each model was assessed using eight different statistical indicators thus the main objective of this study is to assess which of the models proposed is more suitable to be implemented for accurate eto estimation at the study area which is subject to a humid and subtropical climate the findings also aim to aid agricultural engineers scientists and researchers in calculating eto crop et and assessing crop water requirements for rain fed and irrigated agriculture the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 gives brief information about the study site and the methodological approach section 3 summarizes the main results and discusses their relevance finally the main conclusions derived from this study are presented in section 4 novelty this study was conducted to compare several eto methods to select the best method for water developers and users for the most precise irrigation scheduling this work is more important and necessary for the study area we can apply it in other arid or semi arid regions for agricultural water management to save high amounts of water 2 materials and method 2 1 study area the present study was conducted in the ludhiana station of punjab india located between latitude 30 56 n and longitude 75 52 e with an altitude of 247 m above mean sea level

analyzed period are displayed in fig 2 the maximum and minimum rainfall was recorded in august and march with 331 4 mm and 4 0 mm respectively at the same time the maximum and minimum pan evaporation value was observed in june 291 4 mm and december 30 5 mm months respectively the variation of monthly climatic parameters i e maximum and minimum temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity daily mean wind speed daily sunshine hour pan evaporation and solar radiation are shown in fig 3 pan evaporation is a famous indirect method which is widely used for eto estimation the pan evaporation data is multiplied by the pan coefficient to get the observed eto this coefficient varies from 0 35 to 0 85 depending upon several factors muhammad et al 2019 the daily eto is calculated by multiplying the pan evaporation data ep by the pan coefficient kp in the recent decades various researchers have suggested different equations for calculating kp values cuenca 1989 allen and pruitt 1991 snyder 1992 pereira et al 1995 orang 1998 raghuwanshi and wallender 1998 snyder 2008 and the same models are used in the present study for estimation of kp in this study the pereira et al method was used to estimate the pan coefficient described in section 2 2 2 2 methodology in this study 30 empirical eto models were categorized into four groups based on the various climatic variables temperature 10 radiation 10 mass transfer 9 and combination model 1 reference evapotranspiration was calculated by comparing their estimates to pan evaporation data the various methods included for evaluation in temperature based radiation based mass transfer based and combination models are given in tables 2 5 respectively because of its applicability simplicity of use and the broad availability of pan evaporation data estimating eto from pan evaporation ep data using pan coefficient kp is a widespread technique furthermore when the evaporation pan is correctly maintained numerous studies have shown a significant degree of connection between ep and eto pradhan et al 2013 it provides a significant estimate of kp since utilizing a single kp value for most stations throughout the year may result in substantial eto estimation error as a result many studies have been performed to determine the value of kp for various months and to assess various empirical techniques for kp estimate in a semi arid and humid area of india allen and pruitt 1991 cuenca 1989 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 pradhan et al 2013 roderick et al 2007 sabziparvar et al 2010 snyder 1992 the relation between these two is given as follows et o e p k p the kp accounts for relative humidity wind speed and windward side distance of a green crop or a dry fallow this coefficient kp varies from 0 35 to 1 1 depending upon several factors aschonitis et al 2012 muhammad et al 2019 several models have been developed to estimate kp for the particular stations region sabziparvar et al 2010

2 3 statistical analysis the various statistical performance indicators namely nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index of agreement d pearson correlation coefficient pcc r coefficient of determination r2 normalized root mean square error nmrse mean square error mse mean absolute error mae mean bias error mbe and taylor diagram described in table 6 were used to evaluate the effectiveness of these empirical models a model nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 90 indicates that the model or equation of interest is satisfactory numbers between 80 and 90 indicate acceptable efficiency however values below 80 indicate that the model is not performing satisfactorily chauhan and shrivastava 2009 the nse ranges from minus infinity to one nse 1 nse below zero nse 0 indicates that the observed median is as strong as the average whereas negative values suggest that the observed median is a more robust indicator than the average liu et al 2013 the agreement d index calculates the additive and proportional differences between observed and gridded data willmott 1981 therefore d and nse values near 1 indicate a better match between observed and gridded data the nrmse refers to the accuracy of the modeled data by calculating the size of the errors willmott 1982 the pcc is also known as the correlation coefficient and is used to calculate the degree of collinearity between observed and estimated values the pcc varies from minus one to plus one 1 pcc 1 the rmse range is zero to infinity 0 rmse the lower the rmse the better the model s performance the most accurate models were selected based on the highest values of nse d pcc r and r2 while showing the lowest nrmse mse mae and mbe among all developed models kumar et al 2021 3 results and discussion the reference eto values were estimated by four different methods based on temperature radiation mass transfer and combination during the annual and seasonal period i e winter spring summer monsoon autumn and pre winter in the study area for the period of 2009 2019 for 11 years are displayed in the tables 7 10 respectively the maximum value of observed eto was found in the summer season followed by spring monsoon autumn pre winter and winter at the same time the total observed eto was detected to be 1234 35 mm from january 2009 december 2019 the maximum and minimum values of estimated annual and seasonal eto using temperature based models namely ivanov hamon papadakis schendel blaney criddle linacre kharrufa hargreaves trajkovic and ravazzani are shown in table 7 on the annual scale the models ivanov hamon papadakis schendel linacre kharrufa hargreaves trajkovic and ravazzani overestimated the considerable value in contrast only the blaney criddle model indicated the underestimated value similarly the annual and seasonal estimation of eto in the radiation based models viz irmak rn irmak rs abtew jones caprio priestley jensen turc makkink and cochrane orcutt are shown in table 8 from the data it can be perceived that the models namely irmak rn irmak rs abtew jones caprio jensen and turc displayed the overestimated value while the rest showed significant underestimation in mass transfer based models i e dalton trabert meyer rohwer penman albrecht brockamp wmo and mehringer the maximum and minimum annual and seasonal values of expected eto are represented in table 9 shows that all the models depict overestimation except in mahringer model furthermore the combination based model namely the penmen monteith model was very close to the observed eto and slight underestimation as shown in table 10 in addition the total eto values simulated for the entire experiment period 01 01 2019 31 12 2019 are illustrated in fig 4 models such as hamon szasz mahringer wmo brockmap albrecht meyer trabert and dalton underestimated the eto values compared to the observed eto at the same time ravazzani and trajkovic overestimated the eto value as compared to other models only fao penman monteith model was very close to the observed eto the efficiency of 30 selected eto models was evaluated based on performance indicators such as nse d pcc r r2 nrmse mse mae and mbe for higher accuracy in the prediction of eto the model with a higher performance indication of parameters such as nse d pcc r and r2 while the lowest value of nrmse mse mae and mbe or even close to 0 are only considered the statistical evaluation of temperature mass transfer radiation and combination based models is depicted in tables 11 14 respectively a perusal of data presented in table 11 and fig 5 revealed that among the different temperature based eto models the hargreaves model was found to be the best for the prediction of eto in comparison to observed eto with the highest values of nse 0 79 d 0 89 pcc r 0 93 r2 0 87 along with the lowest values of nrmse 0 41 mse 1 02 mae 1 10 and mbe 0 22 the scatter plots of various temperature based models between estimated and observed daily eto were represented in fig 6 respectively the regression line rl was above the best fit 1 1 for trajkovic ravazzani kharrufa schendel and ivanov revealing that these five models overestimated the daily observed eto also the regression line was located under the 1 1 line for hamon blaney criddle linacre and hargreaves model signifying that these models underestimated eto concerning the daily observed eto values in addition to the above the performance of the temperature based models was assessed using a radar chart for the best calculated values of rmse mm having a better diagnostic analysis of the efficiency of all temperature based models the results of the best estimated values are shown in fig 13 the smaller size of stars with lower values for rmse would indicate the better performance of the models fig 13 reveals that temperature based models estimated eto values better than mass transfer based models but performed lower than radiation based models further comparative analysis of temperature based models was done using the taylor diagram according to fig 15 the hamon model was located furthest in contrast the hargreaves model was located nearest the observed point based on the standard deviation correlation and rmse concluding hamon as the worst model and hargreaves as the best model among the selected temperature based models a similar result had been reported by several researchers dhakal et al 2020 djaman et al 2017 muhammad et al 2019 tabari et al 2013 the data summarized in table 12 and fig 7 divulge that among the mass transfer based models the penman model produced the highest values of nse d pcc r and r2 at 0 67 0 81 0 92 and 0 84 respectively while the values of nrmse mse mae and mbe were the lowest at 0 41 1 19 0 94 and 0 46 respectively the scatter plots the observed against the estimated eto of the dalton trabert meyer rohwer penman albrecht brockamp wmo and mahringer models over the experiential period shown in fig 8 the different conditions have resulted between rl and 1 1 line for all the models in the case of the penman model rl s location was above the best fil line 1 1 showing that the model has overestimated the observed daily eto the rl divided the best fit 1 1 for the mahringer and rohwer models this showed that models overestimated the lower values of eto 2 3 mm day for the mahringer model and 8 5 mm day for the rohwer model and under estimated the higher values of eto in the selected humid subtropical climate region the comparison among the mass transfer based models was made using a radar chart of rmse values fig 13 showed the high values of calculated rmse for all the models this reveals that mass transfer based models have lower performance as compared to the temperature and radiation based models the comparison among the mass transfer based models was made with a radar chart of rmse values fig 13 showed the high values of calculated rmse for all the models this reveals that mass transfer based models have lower performance as compared to the temperature and radiation based models further evaluation was achieved using the taylor diagram to check the models performances as presented in fig 17 it is clear from fig 17 that penman models were located nearest to the observed point followed by the rohwer model based on the standard deviation correlation and rmse the meyer model was located furthest and yielded the worst performance in the estimation of daily eto values in radiation based eto models the statistical performance of the turc model was seen to be the best in comparison to the observed eto with the maximum value of nse d pcc r and r2 which is 0 65 0 74 0 86 and 0 74 and minimum values of 0 56 1 32 1 43 1 01 and 1 09 respectively under nrmse mse mae and mbe as shown in table 13 and fig 9 the scatter plots and temporal variation graphs of the observed against the estimated eto of the cochrane orcutt makkink turc jensen priestley caprio jones abtew irmak rs and irmak rn models over the experiential period are displayed in fig 10 the different conditions have resulted between rl and 1 1 lines for all the models for caprio and jensen models fig 9 the rl was over the 1 1 line thus over estimating the eto values in the case of cochrane orcutt makkink turc priestley jones abtew irmak rs and irmak rn models the regression line divided the best fit line 1 1 this reveals that the models over estimated the smaller values 2 5 mm day for cochrane orcutt and makkink models 4 2 mm day for turc abtew and irmak rs models 2 2 mm day for priestley model 5 9 mm day for jones model and 3 8 mm day for irmak rn model while under estimated the higher values of eto in the study area fig 13 represents the radar chart for the best calculated values of rmse mm it reveals that solar radiation based models have higher accuracy in estimating eto values these models have smaller stars with lower values for rmse compared to the temperature based and mass transfer based models further a comparison among the radiation based models was using the taylor diagram from fig 16 model caprio and jansen showed the highest correlation coefficient but models high rmse values were observed turc model can be considered a high performing model with the lowest rmse and high correlation however it has a standard deviation lower than the observed values further from the data represented in table 14 the parameters of the statistical performance of the combination based eto model i e fao 56 pm were found to be as 0 76 0 90 0 96 0 93 0 84 0 67 0 24 and 0 12 under nse d pcc r r2 nrmse mse mae and mbe respectively versus the observed eto the time series plots between estimated and observed daily eto and their scatter plots for the fao56 pm were represented in fig 11 a the regression line rl was located below the best fit 1 1 for fao56 pm revealing that these models were very close to the observed daily eto among other models fig 11b the fao56 pm method is the most efficient for estimating eto in different climatic regions the fao56 pm model was developed based on physiological and aerodynamic theories of surface water release to the atmosphere therefore based on the fao recommendation it can be used as a standard model for estimating eto in any region without adjusting parameters lang et al 2017 the present study also found that fao penman monteith is the best model for the study area the time series plots between estimated and observed daily eto and their scatter plots for the fao56 pm were represented in fig 11a the regression line rl was located below the best fit 1 1 for fao56 pm thus revealing that these models were very close to the observed daily eto among all other models fig 11b however the fao56 pm model for estimating eto needs many meteorological variables including air temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation it is often challenging to obtain data of all the meteorological variables many meteorological stations in developing countries do not measure all these variables therefore a large number of alternative models have been developed based on the availability of data in this study 30 selected models were evaluated in the humid subtropical climate according to the rmse and sse values the ten best models were selected among the 30 considered eto models from fig 14 12 respectively penmen monteith model ranked first with an rmse of 1 006 mm day and sse of 369 389 mm2 turc model radiation based ranked second with an rmse of 1 423 mm day and sse of 739 327 mm2 the temperature based hargreaves and radiation based makkink can be considered the third and fourth best models with rmse values of 1 444 and 1 472 mm day respectively and sse values of 761 326 791 307 mm2 respectively the fifth was the papadakis temperature based model with an rmse of 1 477 mm day and sse of 796 606 mm2 the irmak rs cochrane orcutt jones priestley and irmak rn ranked sixth to tenth from fig 18 the taylor diagram confirmed the model s performance as stated in the manuscript in general the radiation based models can accurately estimate eto values and the mass transfer based models had shown the worst performances among the eto models evaluated tabari et al 2013 the radiation based and temperature based models were the best suited equations for the study area the finding of this study aligned with the earlier studies dar et al 2017 muhammad et al 2019 tabari et al 2013 4 conclusions and outlook in the present study thirty empirical eto models were evaluated classified in a different category based on the various climatic variables i e temperature 10 radiation 10 mass transfer 9 and combination model 1 in humid and subtropical climate conditions the various statistical performance indicators were used to evaluate the effectiveness of these empirical models in general the radiation based models can accurately estimate the eto values that combination based fao56 pm model was the best model with the highest values of nse 0 76 d 0 90 pcc r 0 96 r2 0 93 and the lowest nrmse 0 84 mse 0 67 mae 0 12 thus ranked one in general the radiation based models can accurately estimate the eto values and the mass transfer based models except the penman model had the worst performances among all models the different temperature based eto models the hargreaves model was found to be the best for the prediction of eto in comparison to observed eto with the highest values of nse 0 79 d 0 89 pcc r 0 93 r2 0 87 along with the lowest values of nrmse 0 41 mse 1 02 mae 1 10 and mbe 0 22 the result showed that the radiation based and temperature based models were the best suited equations for the study area the research is a vital scientific contribution to eto quantification and influential empirical models in such a diverse climatic condition of india where many meteorological datasets could not be acquired this study provides essential guidance for agricultural water practices hydrological processes and irrigation management in india also helpful as well as the similar subtropical climate region elsewhere in the world we acknowledge that the precision of model performance is entirely dependable on the quality of input data some empirical models require only input data e g inavov and schendel model still most of them require more input data so that data scarcity can be a problem on the other side field experiments could take much time therefore when selecting an empirical model to estimate eto it is crucial to define a trade off between data

9732,drought sensitivity in olive trees varies throughout the season the yield response to drought needs to consider the final use of the fruits and harvest date in mediterranean climates the oil accumulation tends to occur in a period of low evaporative demand and during the rainy period the aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of water stress during pit hardening on the yield components of oil olive trees the experiment was conducted during three seasons 2017 2019 in a mature hedgerow olive orchard 11 years old arbequina cv the experiment design was a randomized completed block with 4 repetitions of 4 different irrigation treatments treatments were control no water stress throughout the season regulated deficit irrigation rdi 1 moderate water stress during pit hardening and total recovery after the last week of august rdi 2 same as rdi 1 but with severe water stress and partial recovery and sustained deficit irrigation sdi constant applied water rate and the same seasonal water than rdi 2 the irrigation scheduling in rdis were based on the frequencies of the trunk growth rate no significant differences were found in fruit and oil yield between treatments there were a significant relationship between water status measurements and fruit and oil yield part of the decrease in fruit yield with midday stem water potential swp was related to fruit moisture as no significant fruit drop was found only conditions of water stress in 2017 before the end of endocarp size were related to a great reduction of fruit volume and consequently with fruit and oil yield the relationship between the percentage of oil in dry weight and swp was quadratic in different phases such relationships could help quantify the water stress level in these periods to maximize oil accumulation keywords fruit development regulated deficit irrigation sustained deficit irrigation water potential 1 introduction the yield response in olive trees to drought varies according to the moment and level of water stress as in other fruit trees hsiao 1990 for other drupes the drought response is closely related to endocarp development e g peaches chalmers and wilson 1978 in olive trees drought sensitivity decreased from shoot sprouting to pit hardening when endocarp size was at its maximum the hardening was increasingly faster and the massive pit hardening started rapoport et al 2013 in this period the impact of water stress in the yield was small even null under moderate conditions goldhamer 1999 most of the irrigation works defined this latter period considering the central summer months as constant dates and without evaluating the hardening process some works used knife cutting but because pit hardening is dynamic and progressive this traditional methodology sanz cortes et al 2002 is very imprecise rapoport et al 2013 proposed the fruit length as an objective indicator to establish the beginning of this period but there are not many such indicators to identify the end under field conditions on the other hand the hardening process presented a sigmoid curve with two slow slope periods at the beginning and at the end in the middle of a fast increase rapoport et al 2013 therefore it would be difficult to determine the end of the pit hardening even with an accurate evaluation then regulated deficit irrigation rdi strategies commonly fixed a recovery period from the last month of the summer period which changed slightly according to the fruit use being earlier for table olive girón et al 2015 than for oil production fernández et al 2013 the impact of the water stress during this recovery period until harvest was variable for table olives a controlled water stress with values less negative than 2 mpa of midday stem water potential swp did not reduce yield significantly martín palomo et al 2020 but the amount of oil was reduced when water stress was more negative than 2 7 mpa hueso et al 2019 pit hardening was the most interesting period from an rdi strategy perspective because it is the one with the greatest irrigation needs yet the least yield sensitive to water stress moreover in mature orchards the vegetative growth is not affected because it stops for the hardening process rallo and suarez 1989 for the rdi strategies it is necessary to know the response of the yield component so an accurate irrigation scheduling can be defined extrapolating to different conditions for table olives fruit size and drop have been reported as the most limiting factors corell et al 2020 for oil olive the content of oil in the fruit is also very important oil accumulation is a complex process that depends on the cultivar and the environment navas lópez et al 2019 some works reported that oil accumulation in dry weight decreased under moderate water stress conditions until pit hardening from 1 80 mpa and late summer early autumn hereinafter the so called recovery period from 2 71 mpa hueso et al 2019 2021 during pit hardening some works reported a decrease in oil accumulation with severe water stress lavee and wodner 1991 moriana et al 2003 fernández et al 2013 naor et al 2013 ahumada orellana et al 2017 ben gal et al 2021 however moderate water stress conditions would increase the fruit oil content moriana et al 2003 lavee et al 2007 fernández et al 2013 ben gal et al 2021 the aim of this work was to evaluate in a commercial oil olive orchard the yield response of several rdi strategies that consider different water stress levels during pit hardening and recovery taking into account the

olive orchard in carmona 37 49 n 5 67 w seville spain the orchard arbequina cv 4 m x 1 5 m spacing 1667 tree ha 1 was 11 years old at the beginning of the experiment the pattern of the rainfall and reference evapotranspiration eto throughout the experiment was as expected in a mediterranean climate fig 1 most rainfall concentrated during autumn and winter there was no rainfall measured for long periods of spring summer the beginning of the rainfall period was delayed until the second half of september even october in the 2017 season the seasonal amount of rain was below the 20 year average of the station 539 mm in 2017 278 mm and 2019 328 but greater in 2018 705 mm eto was maximum at around mid summer with values close to 8 mm day 1 eto values greater or around 6 mm day 1 were measured from mid may until the last week of august in the three seasons the irrigation system was a single line of emitters 3 4 l h 1 which were spaced 0 4 m applied water was measured with water meter in each replication and weekly checked during the irrigation season irrigation scheduling was programmed daily based on trunk growth rate tgr measurements using dendrometers corell et al 2019 martín palomo et al 2021 data of water relations response and usefulness of this approach are widely discussed in corell et al 2019 and martín palomo et al 2021 the current work summarizes the most important data of these works or presents them as complementary information the soil had a sandy loam texture with 29 4 volumetric water content field capacity and 12 8 wilting point saxton and rawls 2006 high ph level 8 4 and a high percentage of carbonates greater than 25 the amount of p2o5 and k2o in the soil was adequate and so was the percentage of organic matter 1 8 four irrigation treatments were carried out in a completed randomized block design with 4 repetitions each plot consisted of three lines of trees measuring 20 m long each plot had 60 trees only central trees 18 were used for sampling irrigation season was divided in the three phases considered for the deficit treatments a before pit hardening b until the last week of august pit hardening period and c until harvest rehydration period no irrigation was provided during the postharvest period the beginning of pit hardening was dated according to rapoport et al 2013 in short the pit hardening starts when a sharp decrease in the rate of longitudinal fruit growth occurs irrigation was scheduled daily with a remote programming device ciclon c 146 v 3 53 maher almeria spain the amount of water applied was measured every week with a water meter on each plot the irrigation treatments were control the objective of this treatment was to attain full irrigated conditions throughout the season during 2017 the amount of water applied was based only on the fao 56 approach allen et al 1998 using kc of 0 55 and the reduction coefficient kr was 0 47 according to steduto et al 2012 however this approach decreased midday stem water potential swp at mid season below expected values of full irrigated conditions 1 4 mpa moriana et al 2012 then to ensure an optimum water status the amount of water applied

objective of this treatment was to attain an optimal rdi before pit hardening and during rehydration periods the water status was scheduled to remain near optimum during pit hardening moderate water stress conditions were applied the water stress level was controlled using trunk growth rate tgr frequencies corell et al 2019 martín palomo et al 2021 for more details in short only values of tgr lower than 0 1 or greater than 0 3 mm day 1 were considered as water stress indicators tgr weekly frequency values were minimized during no low water stress conditions while progressively increased during water stress applied water was scheduling according to measured tgr values obtained table 1 rdi 2 the objective of his treatment was to apply an rdi strategy but with a maximum amount of seasonal water 2017 150 mm 2018 170 mm 2019 270 mm the increase in the seasonal maximum water applied in 2019 was due to very scarce amount of rain irrigation scheduling was based on the tgr approach but with a more severe water stress during pit hardening and a partial recovery during rehydration applied water was scheduling according to measured tgr values obtained table 2 sustained deficit irrigation sdi applied water was at constant rate along the season the seasonal amount of water was similar to the ones of rdi 2 treatment the main differences between both treatments was that in rdi 2 level of water stress was considered in the irrigation scheduling but it was not in this 2 2 water relations and shoot growth climatic data were obtained from the andalusian network climatic station villanueva de rio y minas siar 2021 9 4 km from the experimental orchard average seasonal data were obtained from this station for the period 2007 2016 to compare with the current data obtained plant water relations were described using swp gas exchange measurements trunk diameter fluctuations and soil moisture determinations these data are described and analyzed in corell et al 2019 and martín palomo et al 2021 only a part of swp data are presented in the current work swp was measured weekly at midday with a pressure bomb leaves near the main trunks were covered with aluminum bags two hours before measurement the stress integral si was estimated using the seasonal swp data according to myers 1988 using 1 2 mpa as maximum value as suggested moriana et al 2012 the expression used was 2 si swp 1 2 n where si stress integral swp average midday stem water potential between two consecutive measurements n number of days between two consecutive measurements ten shoots per plot were randomly selected and marked at the beginning of each season shoot elongation was measured every 15 days throughout the experiment the number of fruits was counted only in the shoots with fruit at the beginning of pit hardening the percentage of fruit drop was estimated as the ratio of the difference between the amount of fruit on this first date and just before harvest vs the initial number of fruit 2 3 fruit development fruit dimensions longitudinal and equatorial were measured in 10 fruits per plot periodically from fruit set until harvest and fruit volume was estimated fruit longitudinal dimensions were used for estimating the beginning of the pit hardening rapoport et al 2013 from pit hardening until harvest a 250 g of fruit sample per plot was randomly selected to estimate oil content fresh and dry weight and fruit moisture four times during the season the last determination was always at harvest and the fruit oil content was determined using the soxhlet method an accurate description of the pit hardening process was conducted during the 2019 season from fruit set until harvest a randomized sample of 40 fruits per plot was collected weekly half of the sample was weighed and dried to a constant weight in an oven at 70 c to determine the dry weight the rest were used for determining the pit breaking pressure using the experimental device described in rapoport et al 2013 pit breaking pressure curves were adjusted to a sigmoid curve in order to estimate the following parameters a range of pit breaking pressure b slope coefficient c date of inflection and d minimum pit breaking pressure rapoport et al 2013 the slope coefficient was used to estimate the beginning and the end of the massive pit hardening the inflection date was considered that on which 50 of pit hardening occurred 2 4 yield response harvest date was different for the different seasons the earliest being in 2019 24th october day of the year doy 297 and the latest occurring in 2018 11th december doy 345 these differences were due to the commercial decisions of the owner climatic conditions oil prices fruit oil content machinery availability the central line of each plot was harvested with a grape straddle harvester for hedgerows and weighted individually then a sample of around 1 5 kg from each plot was obtained to measure the oil content and other fruit features in a laboratory the fruit size was estimated using the number of fruits per kilogram in a sample of 250 g the maturity index mi was determined in 100 fruits per plot according to hermoso et al 1997 oil yield was estimated as the results of fruit yield by the percentage of oil content in fresh weight 2 5 statistical analysis a statistical analysis was carried out with anova and the mean separation tukey s test using the statistix sx program 8 0 significant differences were considered for the p level 0 05 in both tests the data normality was tested using a shapiro wilk test calculations of the p level were performed considering the f test of variance equality homoscedasticity when conditions of variance equality could not be obtained a decrease in the degree of freedom and therefore a more restrictive p value was calculated the number of samples measured is specified in the text and figures in order to evaluate the irrigation treatments based on the water stress level linear regressions were calculated between percentage of fruit drop percentage of oil in dry weight fruit yield and oil yield vs si and vs minimum midday swp at different periods a multivariable analysis was performed using several water stress indicators but they did not improve the single relationship and they are not presented 3 results 3 1 water relations and shoot growth the amount of water applied changed during the different seasons in order to maintain the water status defined for each treatment in each season all treatments started irrigation on the same date but the dates were different each year fig 2 the earliest season was 2019 because of the scarce rains during winter although the actual start was around the end of april irrigation in the control treatments was almost linear and increased from 2017 around 400 mm to 2019 close to 1000 mm rdi 1 also presented a linear pattern throughout the season but with lower slope than control after the deficit period rdi 1 slightly increased the rate of water provided the seasonal water applied was lower in 2017 180 mm than in the other two years around 400 mm such differences were likely related to climatic conditions fig 1 and yield the lowest one occurring in 2017 rdi 2 and sdi received a similar seasonal amount of water in all years but there were differences in the pattern of water supplied for both treatments the seasonal irrigation was between 150 and 180 mm in 2017 and 2018 but higher in 2019 250 mm in rdi 2 the application rate was lower sometimes null during the deficit period but greater during recovery than in sdi data for the midday stem water potential swp soil moisture and gas exchange were presented in previously published works corell et al 2019 martín palomo et al 2021 table 3 summarizes the average swp for each season in order to describe the general pattern not for statistical comparison these are at supplementary material in all seasons the less negative swp values were obtained before pit hardening during the active shoot growth in this period the water status was similar between treatments only in 2019 control tended to lower negative swp values than the rest the most negative values of swp were measured during the pit hardening period control presented the least negative values in all seasons with the greatest differences during 2019 the most negative values were obtained in rdi 2 while rdi 1 and sdi presented similar values finally rehydration improved the water status in all treatments although this was almost null in sdi in comparison to the rest however only rdi 1 was close to control in 2018 and 2019 then rdi 2 presented only a partial recovery stress integral si covers the effect of the level and duration of water stress in a sole value significant differences in si were found in 2018 and 2019 fig 3 in all treatments the si during phase ii pit hardening was greater than during phase iii rehydration control presented the lowest value in all seasons and si decreased from 2017 to 2019 when it was almost null rdi 1 presented similar values than the rest of rdi treatments with no significant differences with them neither with control the si was clearly reduced in rdi 1 during 2018 and 2019 conversely rdi 2 showed the greatest si values in all seasons although only significantly different from control during 2018 and 2019 shoot growth presented in all years a similar seasonal pattern fig 4 the main period of shoot growth was until the beginning of the pit hardening period then it stopped the stop date was the same for all treatments only the data for control during the 2019 season reveals that shoot growth increased until halfway through the pit hardening period the effect of the irrigation treatments on shoot expansion was significant in some seasons but not clear no significant differences were found on any dates during 2017 in 2018 when the maximum shoot expansions were measured significant differences were found only between sdi and control with a greater growth in the former than in the latter in 2019 sdi rdi 1 and control were not significantly different only control was significantly greater than rdi 2 for most of the season the sensibility of fruit drop to water stress was measured with the relationship between the percentage of fruit drop in each shoot and swp and si fig 5 in this figure the prediction of corell et al 2020 is also presented according to this latter equation fruit drop would be at its maximum in the most stressed treatments however no significant relationships were found with any of the indicators selected and the data are clearly out of the equation suggested by corell et al 2020 in both figures fruit drop was almost unrelated to the water status of the tree and almost constant at around 20 3 2 fruit development fruit volume was significantly affected by the water stress in all seasons fig 6 the seasonal pattern of fruit development was similar in different seasons with a period of low fruit growth during pit hardening and a great increase from the end of august fruit volume was lower in all treatments during the 2017 season in comparison to 2018 or 2019 rdi 1 was significantly lower than control only at the end of 2017 in 2018 and 2019 the fruit volume in this treatment was slightly lower than control but not significantly so at the beginning of the rehydration period and almost equal in the last 2 4 weeks before harvest significant and persistent differences were found in all seasons in the most severe water stress treatments from the second part of pit hardening after this date in all seasons control treatments were significantly greater than rdi 2 and only in 2018 the recovery of this treatment reached values similar to the maximum the pattern of sdi was similar to the rdi 2 but with fewer significant differences with control sdi treatments toggled between rdi 1 and rdi 2 with not significant differences between them on most dates only at the end of all seasons rdi 2 and sdi were almost equal the pattern of oil accumulation was almost linear in all treatments and all seasons fig 7 the last measurements of the 2018 season the ones with the latest harvest date suggest that in fact there was a saturation curve there were no significant differences in any of the season in percentage of oil dry weight in fruit and in the slope of these accumulation lines at the beginning of the recovery period about half of the total oil content was reached in all seasons some trends of greater values in sdi and rdi 1 than control and rdi 2 were found the difference on the harvest date between the highest values sdi in all season and the lowest values control in 2017 and rdi 2 in 2018 and 2019 varied from 6 in 2017 to 2 in 2018 which indicates a relative increase of 18 and 5 respectively the relationship between fruit moisture and swp was significant in the three seasons fig 8 these equations showed that fruit moisture strongly decreased with swp data obtained in 2017 and 2018 presented an almost equal relationship with a range in fruit moisture between 45 and 65 conversely data from the 2019 season presented lower fruit moisture than the two previous years the fit obtained in this latter season 2019 was significantly different for the other two the sampling period in the three seasons were similar from the end of july to mid september there were more fruit samples later than the ones shown in fig 8 but they are not included because the swp measured occurred at a different date the relationship between the minimum swp during pit hardening and the percentage of fruit oil in dry weight at harvest is presented in fig 9a the percentage of oil in all the plots during 2019 was greater than the one obtained in 2017 and 2018 the best fit in 2017 data were quadratic but with a pattern of increase when swp was less negative in all the ranges considered maximum value greater than 0 two data of 2017 were not included because they corresponded to two control plots in which problems with irrigation strongly affected the water status of the trees no significant relationships were found with the 2018 data but when both datasets 2017 and 2018 were included a significant regression was observed this common regression using both seasons showed that although the oil content increased with less negative values of swp there was a maximum around 1 8 mpa the best relationship was obtained with 2019 data the error was the lowest and the range of swp was the widest in this latter season the best fit was also quadratic with a maximum value around 3 6 mpa relationship did not improve using the stress integral values the relationship between the oil data from fig 9a and the minimum swp during recovery was analyzed in two ways fig 9b first only data below 2 1 mpa were considered according to hueso et al 2019 in this case only 2017 data presented a significant linear relationship between oil content and swp in this equation the oil percentage in the fruit decreased with the decrease of swp the second way considered all the data available from each season no significant relationship was found between the 2017 and 2018 data but when both seasons were considered a poor quadratic fit was adjusted in this latter equation higher values of fruit oil were reached with the increase of swp maximum at positive value greater than 0 data of the 2019 season presented the best fit and also a quadratic equation in this case the maximum oil content would be around 3 4 mpa no better relationships were found with the stress integral for any of the seasons the equations calculated in this figure were poorer than the ones from fig 9a the adjustment did not improved when both swp were used additional fruit features fruit dry weight and pit breaking pressure were characterized only for 2019 fig 10 the fruit dry weight presented a linear increase throughout the experiment in all treatments fig 10a only at the end of the stress period significant differences were found between rdi 2 and control from this date on rdi 2 tended to values lower that the rest of treatments but the differences were not significant the seasonal pattern of the pit breaking pressure was a sigmoidal curve with a short period of great increase from doy 164 199 fig 10b small but significant differences were found between control and sdi in the last period of hardening when maximum values were reached there was a significant relationship between the average swp for this period of greatest hardening increase and fruit oil at harvest fig 10c this equation was similar in accuracy and shape to the ones obtained for other periods fig 9 however maximum values of percentage of oil were obtained with swp around 1 6 mpa table 4 contains the average value of the parameters that defined the individual pit hardening pressure curves these parameters showed a significant delay in the pit hardening curve of control in comparison to the rest of treatments the date when 50 of the maximum values were reached was used to estimate the average hardening rate this parameter was significantly later in control around doy 181 than the rest of treatments around doy 179 the slope of increase also tended to lower values in control than in rdi 2 and sdi although no significant differences were found maximum values of pressure also tended to be greater in control than in rdi 2 and sdi rdi 1 data presented an intermediate pattern with a significant advance to the control curve but similar slope and maximum pressure values 3 3 yield response yield response is the summed of different components the lowest fruit yield was measured in 2017 and the highest in 2018 for all treatments fig 11 fruit and oil yield were not significantly different in any of the seasons fig 11 control tended to the highest fruit yield value in the three seasons and rdi 2 or sdi to the lowest fig 11 this result was in agreement with fruit size at harvest table 5 the number of fruits per kg was significantly lower or tended to lower values in control and rdi 1 depending of the season than rdi 2 which was always the highest table 5 however differences in fruit yield between treatments were reduced or even changed in oil yield fig 11 when the oil percentage based on fresh weight table 5 was considered although this latter measurement was not significant all deficit treatments tended to a higher oil percentage in fresh weight than control table 5 differences between control and the rest of treatments in percentage of oil varied from 0 3 2018 control vs rdi 2 to 3 2017 control vs rdi 2 and sdi table 5 such differences in oil percentage were not related to the ripening process because the mature index data were not significantly different between treatments in any of the seasons table 5 harvest occurred at the beginning of the veraison mi around 2 table 5 in all seasons the amount of water applied increased throughout the experiment with significant differences between control maximum rdi 1 and the other two treatments rdi 2 and sdi were very similar and not significantly different to each other table 5 on the other hand water productivity was significantly higher in rdi 2 and sdi than control for most of the seasons with maximum values during 2018 and minimum during the 2019 season table 5 variability between repetitions could affect the real yield respond when single plot data was analyzed fruit yield presented significant regressions in the 2017 and 2019 seasons but not in 2018 the season with the latest harvest date fig 12a in both seasons 2017 and 2019 the best relationships were obtained with minimum swp during pit hardening the fruit yield decreased gradually with more negative values of swp no common regressions were found between 2018 and the other two sets of data the oil yield presented significant regressions also in the 2017 and 2019 seasons with the total si data fig 12b both of them were significantly different in 2017 the best fit was a linear regression with a continuous decrease of oil yield with water stress there was a significant quadratic adjustment with the 2018 and 2019 data but this fit improved only if the 2019 season was considered the relationship of the 2018 and 219 data showed a maximum value at 109 3 mpa day but in the interval until this value the equation looked almost constant the decrease in oil yield was strong from around 200 mpa day the range of si data in the 2018 2019 equation were wider than in the 2017 adjustment in fact there were two sets of data in the 2017 season lower than 100 mpa day average oil yield 1049 105 kg ha 1 and greater than 100 mpa day average oil yield 780 66 kg ha 1 4 discussion 4 1 influence of water relations and shoot growth in yield response the drought resistance of the oil and fruit yield was extremely high with deficit irrigation from pit hardening extremely low swp from this period fig 9 with a long duration of the water stress level fig 3 and even partial rehydration table 3 resulted in a lack of significant fruit and oil yield reduction fig 11 however when the water status of each plot was considered there was a significant impact on oil and some seasons fruit yield fig 12 several works suggest a great response of olive to irrigation moriana et al 2003 ben gal et al 2011 but when the water stress was controlled ben gal et a 2021 and not coincident with a sensitive period such as olive flowering moriana et al 2003 the decrease in oil yield was low moriana et al 2003 ben gal et al 2021 the decrease presented in the current work fig 12 was similar to those reported in other previous works with moderate water stress fernández et al 2013 naor et al 2013 ahumada orellana et al 2017 the lack of results when the data averages are considered fig 11 suggested that the variability of the water status between plots offset the impact of the irrigation strategies these support the conclusion of ben gal et al 2021 about the limitations of sdi in comparison to rdi strategies and the usefulness of the water status measurements in olive irrigation scheduling moriana et al 2012 girón et al 2015 ahumada orellana et al 2017 hueso et al 2019 2021 corell et al 2020 ben gal et al 2021 crown volume and fruit load are two factors which could affect the yield response to irrigation naor et al 2013 corell et al 2020 pierantozzi et al 2020 however the former is associated with irrigated young olive orchard and the latter with cultivars with an alternate bearing pattern none of these factors are commonly present in mature hedgerow olive orchards in these orchards the cultivar the most common is arbequina has not a strong alternate bearing pattern barranco 1997 and the crown volume is similar at the beginning of each season to facilitate mechanic harvest therefore the current seasonal factors are more important than in intensive or traditional orchards oil production has three main yield components number of fruits fruit size and oil content fruit drop was almost null in the current work fig 5 with some very severe levels and duration of water stress fruit drop is not commonly evaluated in irrigation works but previous work in manzanilla table olive reported that the yield reduction would be significant with water stress level more negative than 2 mpa of swp girón et al 2015 corell et al 2020 such yield reduction would be lower than the ones predicted in the shoots corell et al 2020 but it could be important in the greatest level of water stress the lack of results for this component was likely related to the cultivar arbequina oil olive vs manzanilla table olive 4 2 influence of fruit development in yield response the fruit size was significantly affected throughout the experiment fig 6 but partially recovered at harvest even in the most stressed treatments fig 6 and table 5 most of the differences in fruit yield figs 11 and 12 were likely related to this component in fact part of the differences in fruit yield are only seen in fruit moisture the absence of a relationship between fruit yield and swp during 2018 suggests that the fruit moisture may have not been limiting in that season the 2018 season had the latest harvest date with a lot of prior rains fig 1 and the fruit volume was almost the same fig 6 conversely in the 2017 and 2019 seasons when the harvest date was before most of the rains presented reductions of fruit volume at harvest fig 6 some of them likely related to the fruit moisture fig 12 other data supporting that part of fruit yield differences are related to fruit moisture is the comparison between the two graphs in fig 12 the 2018 and 2019 oil yield data are in the same fit while they are clearly different in fruit yield fig 12 in the 2019 season the year with the greatest level of water stress fig 3 no significant differences were found in fruit dry weight fig 10 therefore according to the strong relationship between fruit moisture and swp fig 8 the linear decrease in fruit yield with swp fig 12 was strongly linked to differences in fruit water content the reduction in fruit size was reported as very sensitive to water stress girón et al 2015 ahumada orellana et al 2017 martín palomo et al 2020 and related to less absorption of water during the recovery period for table olive girón et al 2015 corell et al 2020 but although fruit size is an important yield component it is not a quality feature for oil production moreover if the increase in fruit yield is related to an increase in fruit moisture this will affect the industrial extractability of the oil garcía et al 2013 and in fact reduce the commercial oil yield then irrigation scheduling should be adapted to minimize this effect ben gal et al 2021 which the autumn rains would enhance a slightly lower fruit yield than in control such as rdi 1 but with similar oil yield than fully irrigated would secure a greater industrial oil yield and would be an optimization of the grower s profit on the other hand the reduction in fruit size in the 2017 season in comparison with the rest of the years fig 6 and table 5 was the main limiting factor for fruit and oil yield in this season this decrease was not related to an alternate bearing pattern because the low fruit yield was not associated with a greater fruit size i e girón et al 2015 corell et al 2020 such lower fruit size was likely produced by the water stress around the beginning of pit hardening table 3 and supplementary material s1 that likely reduced endocarp size and fruit volume the impact on endocarp growth reduced the fruit yield even though a full irrigation recovery was applied gómez del campo et al 2014 the water stress level of this latter work gómez del campo 2013 was similar to the supplementary material s1 but did not affect the following season flowering fig 11 as described in more severe conditions gucci et al 2019 4 3 influence of oil accumulation in yield response oil accumulation curves fig 7 and oil yield fig 11 were not significantly affected but important relationships between oil yield and si in the plot data were found fig 12b they support the trends in figs 7 and 11 of lower values in oil percentage in control than in some deficit irrigation strategies rdi 1 and sdi such differences in oil yield offset the differences in fruit yield fig 12 therefore a moderate water stress would enhance oil accumulations while a severe water stress or full irrigated conditions reduced it oil accumulation is commonly reported as sensitive to water stress lavee and wodner 1991 gómez del campo 2013 ahumada orellana et al 2017 hueso et al 2019 2021 however other works suggest that a moderate water stress promotes oil accumulation in fresh weight moriana et al 2003 grattan et al 2006 gucci et al 2007 lavee et al 2007 fernández et al 2013 ben gal et al 2021 such differences in the literature could be related not only to the level of water stress but also to the time point similar relationships between oil content and swp were found in three different parts of the season in 2019 massive pit hardening fig 10c pit hardening fig 9a and rehydration fig 9b and in two of them in 2017 2018 fig 9 data of the current work cannot help to conclude which is the most limiting or if there was a synergy between periods in fact all of them could be related because the best agreement of oil yield was with seasonal is fig 12b even in the 2017 season when oil yield was limited by fruit growth the relationship suggested a similar response in 2018 2019 fig 12b the rehydration period the nearest to harvest presented the worse agreement fig 9b hueso et al 2019 concluded that in this period the oil content is almost constant until swp about 2 mpa and then follows a linear decrease from this threshold this latter relationship was not found in most of the data in fig 9b and this suggests that it could be the least important better agreements were found between the water stress in pit hardening fig 9a and the maximum oil values reached at 1 7 mpa 2017 2018 and 3 6 mpa 2019 such range is common in irrigation works that reported an increase of oil accumulation moriana et al 2003 grattan et al 2006 fernández et al 2013 ben gal et al 2021 finally a water stress during the fast hardening period massive pit hardening around 1 6 mpa fig 10 maximizes oil accumulation hueso et al 2021 reported a linear decrease of fruit oil with values more negative than 1 8 mpa but did not describe any improvement the massive hardening process needs a greater amount of assimilates rallo and suarez 1989 then if it ended in deficit earlier than in control irrigation rdi 1 table 4 part of these assimilates could be used for oil production hammami et al 2013 concluded that the water status affected the sclerification timing which was faster in rainfed than in full irrigated treatments recently lópez bernal et al 2021 concluded that oil content could be modeled with two parameters slope of accumulation β independent of fruit carbon assimilation and fruit dry weight at onset of oil accumulation wfo depending among others on the water relation in the earlier stage of fruit growth this latter parameter wfo could be associated to changes in the massive pit hardening process related to water stress fig 10 5 conclusions regulated deficit irrigation allows optimizing the yield response in olive trees the regulation of the time point and the water stress level was decisive in identifying the best response the oil yield was dependent on two main components fruit size and oil content because there was no impact of the water stress conditions on fruit drop this latter result was cultivar dependent and the response could change significantly in other orchards fruit size variations were mainly caused by the fruit moisture around harvest and its decrease would be strongly reduced with irrigation or rain a similar fruit size with a low fruit yield reduction was obtained with the rdi 1 strategy which was associated with low fruit moisture the oil content was increased with a moderate water stress at different periods and rdi 1 and sdi tended to produce the greatest values at harvest the maximum oil yield was obtained in plots where the seasonal si was lower than 100 mpa day these levels of water stress included plots with moderate water stress during pit hardening and moderate or null water stress during rehydration as rdi 1 treatment causing a maximization of the two factors considered fruit size and oil content the period between the end of maximum endocarp growth and the end of massive pit hardening was critical water stress in this period decreased fruit size irreversibly thus reducing the oil yield but also oil content was maximized with less severe water stress during massive pit hardening endocarp development growth and hardening are the most

9732,drought sensitivity in olive trees varies throughout the season the yield response to drought needs to consider the final use of the fruits and harvest date in mediterranean climates the oil accumulation tends to occur in a period of low evaporative demand and during the rainy period the aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of water stress during pit hardening on the yield components of oil olive trees the experiment was conducted during three seasons 2017 2019 in a mature hedgerow olive orchard 11 years old arbequina cv the experiment design was a randomized completed block with 4 repetitions of 4 different irrigation treatments treatments were control no water stress throughout the season regulated deficit irrigation rdi 1 moderate water stress during pit hardening and total recovery after the last week of august rdi 2 same as rdi 1 but with severe water stress and partial recovery and sustained deficit irrigation sdi constant applied water rate and the same seasonal water than rdi 2 the irrigation scheduling in rdis were based on the frequencies of the trunk growth rate no significant differences were found in fruit and oil yield between treatments there were a significant relationship between water status measurements and fruit and oil yield part of the decrease in fruit yield with midday stem water potential swp was related to fruit moisture as no significant fruit drop was found only conditions of water stress in 2017 before the end of endocarp size were related to a great reduction of fruit volume and consequently with fruit and oil yield the relationship between the percentage of oil in dry weight and swp was quadratic in different phases such relationships could help quantify the water stress level in these periods to maximize oil accumulation keywords fruit development regulated deficit irrigation sustained deficit irrigation water potential 1 introduction the yield response in olive trees to drought varies according to the moment and level of water stress as in other fruit trees hsiao 1990 for other drupes the drought response is closely related to endocarp development e g peaches chalmers and wilson 1978 in olive trees drought sensitivity decreased from shoot sprouting to pit hardening when endocarp size was at its maximum the hardening was increasingly faster and the massive pit hardening started rapoport et al 2013 in this period the impact of water stress in the yield was small even null under moderate conditions goldhamer 1999 most of the irrigation works defined this latter period considering the central summer months as constant dates and without evaluating the hardening process some works used knife cutting but because pit hardening is dynamic and progressive this traditional methodology sanz cortes et al 2002 is very imprecise rapoport et al 2013 proposed the fruit length as an objective indicator to establish the beginning of this period but there are not many such indicators to identify the end under field conditions on the other hand the hardening process presented a sigmoid curve with two slow slope periods at the beginning and at the end in the middle of a fast increase rapoport et al 2013 therefore it would be difficult to determine the end of the pit hardening even with an accurate evaluation then regulated deficit irrigation rdi strategies commonly fixed a recovery period from the last month of the summer period which changed slightly according to the fruit use being earlier for table olive girón et al 2015 than for oil production fernández et al 2013 the impact of the water stress during this recovery period until harvest was variable for table olives a controlled water stress with values less negative than 2 mpa of midday stem water potential swp did not reduce yield significantly martín palomo et al 2020 but the amount of oil was reduced when water stress was more negative than 2 7 mpa hueso et al 2019 pit hardening was the most interesting period from an rdi strategy perspective because it is the one with the greatest irrigation needs yet the least yield sensitive to water stress moreover in mature orchards the vegetative growth is not affected because it stops for the hardening process rallo and suarez 1989 for the rdi strategies it is necessary to know the response of the yield component so an accurate irrigation scheduling can be defined extrapolating to different conditions for table olives fruit size and drop have been reported as the most limiting factors corell et al 2020 for oil olive the content of oil in the fruit is also very important oil accumulation is a complex process that depends on the cultivar and the environment navas lópez et al 2019 some works reported that oil accumulation in dry weight decreased under moderate water stress conditions until pit hardening from 1 80 mpa and late summer early autumn hereinafter the so called recovery period from 2 71 mpa hueso et al 2019 2021 during pit hardening some works reported a decrease in oil accumulation with severe water stress lavee and wodner 1991 moriana et al 2003 fernández et al 2013 naor et al 2013 ahumada orellana et al 2017 ben gal et al 2021 however moderate water stress conditions would increase the fruit oil content moriana et al 2003 lavee et al 2007 fernández et al 2013 ben gal et al 2021 the aim of this work was to evaluate in a commercial oil olive orchard the yield response of several rdi strategies that consider different water stress levels during pit hardening and recovery taking into account the fruit drop the size and the oil accumulation 2 material and methods 2 1 site and treatments descriptions the experiment was performed during three consecutive years 2017 2019 in a commercial hedgerow olive orchard in carmona 37 49 n 5 67 w seville spain the orchard arbequina cv 4 m x 1 5 m spacing 1667 tree ha 1 was 11 years old at the beginning of the experiment the pattern of the rainfall and reference evapotranspiration eto throughout the experiment was as expected in a mediterranean climate fig 1 most rainfall concentrated during autumn and winter there was no rainfall measured for long periods of spring summer the beginning of the rainfall period was delayed until the second half of september even october in the 2017 season the seasonal amount of rain was below the 20 year average of the station 539 mm in 2017 278 mm and 2019 328 but greater in 2018 705 mm eto was maximum at around mid summer with values close to 8 mm day 1 eto values greater or around 6 mm day 1 were measured from mid may until the last week of august in the three seasons the irrigation system was a single line of emitters 3 4 l h 1 which were spaced 0 4 m applied water was measured with water meter in each replication and weekly checked during the irrigation season irrigation scheduling was programmed daily based on trunk growth rate tgr measurements using dendrometers corell et al 2019 martín palomo et al 2021 data of water relations response and usefulness of this approach are widely discussed in corell et al 2019 and martín palomo et al 2021 the current work summarizes the most important data of these works or presents them as complementary information the soil had a sandy loam texture with 29 4 volumetric water content field capacity and 12 8 wilting point saxton and rawls 2006 high ph level 8 4 and a high percentage of carbonates greater than 25 the amount of p2o5 and k2o in the soil was adequate and so was the percentage of organic matter 1 8 four irrigation treatments were carried out in a completed randomized block design with 4 repetitions each plot consisted of three lines of trees measuring 20 m long each plot had 60 trees only central trees 18 were used for sampling irrigation season was divided in the three phases considered for the deficit treatments a before pit hardening b until the last week of august pit hardening period and c until harvest rehydration period no irrigation was provided during the postharvest period the beginning of pit hardening was dated according to rapoport et al 2013 in short the pit hardening starts when a sharp decrease in the rate of longitudinal fruit growth occurs irrigation was scheduled daily with a remote programming device ciclon c 146 v 3 53 maher almeria spain the amount of water applied was measured every week with a water meter on each plot the irrigation treatments were control the objective of this treatment was to attain full irrigated conditions throughout the season during 2017 the amount of water applied was based only on the fao 56 approach allen et al 1998 using kc of 0 55 and the reduction coefficient kr was 0 47 according to steduto et al 2012 however this approach decreased midday stem water potential swp at mid season below expected values of full irrigated conditions 1 4 mpa moriana et al 2012 then to ensure an optimum water status the amount of water applied in the 2018 season was around 150 etc and in 2019 around 175 etc manual fao 56 estimated etc as 1 etc eto kc kr where etc crop evapotranspiration kc crop coefficient kr reduction coefficient rdi 1 the objective of this treatment was to attain an optimal rdi before pit hardening and during rehydration periods the water status was scheduled to remain near optimum during pit hardening moderate water stress conditions were applied the water stress level was controlled using trunk growth rate tgr frequencies corell et al 2019 martín palomo et al 2021 for more details in short only values of tgr lower than 0 1 or greater than 0 3 mm day 1 were considered as water stress indicators tgr weekly frequency values were minimized during no low water stress conditions while progressively increased during water stress applied water was scheduling according to measured tgr values obtained table 1 rdi 2 the objective of his treatment was to apply an rdi strategy but with a maximum amount of seasonal water 2017 150 mm 2018 170 mm 2019 270 mm the increase in the seasonal maximum water applied in 2019 was due to very scarce amount of rain irrigation scheduling was based on the tgr approach but with a more severe water stress during pit hardening and a partial recovery during rehydration applied water was scheduling according to measured tgr values obtained table 2 sustained deficit irrigation sdi applied water was at constant rate along the season the seasonal amount of water was similar to the ones of rdi 2 treatment the main differences between both treatments was that in rdi 2 level of water stress was considered in the irrigation scheduling but it was not in this 2 2 water relations and shoot growth climatic data were obtained from the andalusian network climatic station villanueva de rio y minas siar 2021 9 4 km from the experimental orchard average seasonal data were obtained from this station for the period 2007 2016 to compare with the current data obtained plant water relations were described using swp gas exchange measurements trunk diameter fluctuations and soil moisture determinations these data are described and analyzed in corell et al 2019 and martín palomo et al 2021 only a part of swp data are presented in the current work swp was measured weekly at midday with a pressure bomb leaves near the main trunks were covered with aluminum bags two hours before measurement the stress integral si was estimated using the seasonal swp data according to myers 1988 using 1 2 mpa as maximum value as suggested moriana et al 2012 the expression used was 2 si swp 1 2 n where si stress integral swp average midday stem water potential between two consecutive measurements n number of days between two consecutive measurements ten shoots per plot were randomly selected and marked at the beginning of each season shoot elongation was measured every 15 days throughout the experiment the number of fruits was counted only in the shoots with fruit at the beginning of pit hardening the percentage of fruit drop was estimated as the ratio of the difference between the amount of fruit on this first date and just before harvest vs the initial number of fruit 2 3 fruit development fruit dimensions longitudinal and equatorial were measured in 10 fruits per plot periodically from fruit set until harvest and fruit volume was estimated fruit longitudinal dimensions were used for estimating the beginning of the pit hardening rapoport et al 2013 from pit hardening until harvest a 250 g of fruit sample per plot was randomly selected to estimate oil content fresh and dry weight and fruit moisture four times during the season the last determination was always at harvest and the fruit oil content was determined using the soxhlet method an accurate description of the pit hardening process was conducted during the 2019 season from fruit set until harvest a randomized sample of 40 fruits per plot was collected weekly half of the sample was weighed and dried to a constant weight in an oven at 70 c to determine the dry weight the rest were used for determining the pit breaking pressure using the experimental device described in rapoport et al 2013 pit breaking pressure curves were adjusted to a sigmoid curve in order to estimate the following parameters a range of pit breaking pressure b slope coefficient c date of inflection and d minimum pit breaking pressure rapoport et al 2013 the slope coefficient was used to estimate the beginning and the end of the massive pit hardening the inflection date was considered that on which 50 of pit hardening occurred 2 4 yield response harvest date was different for the different seasons the earliest being in 2019 24th october day of the year doy 297 and the latest occurring in 2018 11th december doy 345 these differences were due to the commercial decisions of the owner climatic conditions oil prices fruit oil content machinery availability the central line of each plot was harvested with a grape straddle harvester for hedgerows and weighted individually then a sample of around 1 5 kg from each plot was obtained to measure the oil content and other fruit features in a laboratory the fruit size was estimated using the number of fruits per kilogram in a sample of 250 g the maturity index mi was determined in 100 fruits per plot according to hermoso et al 1997 oil yield was estimated as the results of fruit yield by the percentage of oil content in fresh weight 2 5 statistical analysis a statistical analysis was carried out with anova and the mean separation tukey s test using the statistix sx program 8 0 significant differences were considered for the p level 0 05 in both tests the data normality was tested using a shapiro wilk test calculations of the p level were performed considering the f test of variance equality homoscedasticity when conditions of variance equality could not be obtained a decrease in the degree of freedom and therefore a more restrictive p value was calculated the number of samples measured is specified in the text and figures in order to evaluate the irrigation treatments based on the water stress level linear regressions were calculated between percentage of fruit drop percentage of oil in dry weight fruit yield and oil yield vs si and vs minimum midday swp at different periods a multivariable analysis was performed using several water stress indicators but they did not improve the single relationship and they are not presented 3 results 3 1 water relations and shoot growth the amount of water applied changed during the different seasons in order to maintain the water status defined for each treatment in each season all treatments started irrigation on the same date but the dates were different each year fig 2 the earliest season was 2019 because of the scarce rains during winter although the actual start was around the end of april irrigation in the control treatments was almost linear and increased from 2017 around 400 mm to 2019 close to 1000 mm rdi 1 also presented a linear pattern throughout the season but with lower slope than control after the deficit period rdi 1 slightly increased the rate of water provided the seasonal water applied was lower in 2017 180 mm than in the other two years around 400 mm such differences were likely related to climatic conditions fig 1 and yield the lowest one occurring in 2017 rdi 2 and sdi received a similar seasonal amount of water in all years but there were differences in the pattern of water supplied for both treatments the seasonal irrigation was between 150 and 180 mm in 2017 and 2018 but higher in 2019 250 mm in rdi 2 the application rate was lower sometimes null during the deficit period but greater during recovery than in sdi data for the midday stem water potential swp soil moisture and gas exchange were presented in previously published works corell et al 2019 martín palomo et al 2021 table 3 summarizes the average swp for each season in order to describe the general pattern not for statistical comparison these are at supplementary material in all seasons the less negative swp values were obtained before pit hardening during the active shoot growth in this period the water status was similar between treatments only in 2019 control tended to lower negative swp values than the rest the most negative values of swp were measured during the pit hardening period control presented the least negative values in all seasons with the greatest differences during 2019 the most negative values were obtained in rdi 2 while rdi 1 and sdi presented similar values finally rehydration improved the water status in all treatments although this was almost null in sdi in comparison to the rest however only rdi 1 was close to control in 2018 and 2019 then rdi 2 presented only a partial recovery stress integral si covers the effect of the level and duration of water stress in a sole value significant differences in si were found in 2018 and 2019 fig 3 in all treatments the si during phase ii pit hardening was greater than during phase iii rehydration control presented the lowest value in all seasons and si decreased from 2017 to 2019 when it was almost null rdi 1 presented similar values than the rest of rdi treatments with no significant differences with them neither with control the si was clearly reduced in rdi 1 during 2018 and 2019 conversely rdi 2 showed the greatest si values in all seasons although only significantly different from control during 2018 and 2019 shoot growth presented in all years a similar seasonal pattern fig 4 the main period of shoot growth was until the beginning of the pit hardening period then it stopped the stop date was the same for all treatments only the data for control during the 2019 season reveals that shoot growth increased until halfway through the pit hardening period the effect of the irrigation treatments on shoot expansion was significant in some seasons but not clear no significant differences were found on any dates during 2017 in 2018 when the maximum shoot expansions were measured significant differences were found only between sdi and control with a greater growth in the former than in the latter in 2019 sdi rdi 1 and control were not significantly different only control was significantly greater than rdi 2 for most of the season the sensibility of fruit drop to water stress was measured with the relationship between the percentage of fruit drop in each shoot and swp and si fig 5 in this figure the prediction of corell et al 2020 is also presented according to this latter equation fruit drop would be at its maximum in the most stressed treatments however no significant relationships were found with any of the indicators selected and the data are clearly out of the equation suggested by corell et al 2020 in both figures fruit drop was almost unrelated to the water status of the tree and almost constant at around 20 3 2 fruit development fruit volume was significantly affected by the water stress in all seasons fig 6 the seasonal pattern of fruit development was similar in different seasons with a period of low fruit growth during pit hardening and a great increase from the end of august fruit volume was lower in all treatments during the 2017 season in comparison to 2018 or 2019 rdi 1 was significantly lower than control only at the end of 2017 in 2018 and 2019 the fruit volume in this treatment was slightly lower than control but not significantly so at the beginning of the rehydration period and almost equal in the last 2 4 weeks before harvest significant and persistent differences were found in all seasons in the most severe water stress treatments from the second part of pit hardening after this date in all seasons control treatments were significantly greater than rdi 2 and only in 2018 the recovery of this treatment reached values similar to the maximum the pattern of sdi was similar to the rdi 2 but with fewer significant differences with control sdi treatments toggled between rdi 1 and rdi 2 with not significant differences between them on most dates only at the end of all seasons rdi 2 and sdi were almost equal the pattern of oil accumulation was almost linear in all treatments and all seasons fig 7 the last measurements of the 2018 season the ones with the latest harvest date suggest that in fact there was a saturation curve there were no significant differences in any of the season in percentage of oil dry weight in fruit and in the slope of these accumulation lines at the beginning of the recovery period about half of the total oil content was reached in all seasons some trends of greater values in sdi and rdi 1 than control and rdi 2 were found the difference on the harvest date between the highest values sdi in all season and the lowest values control in 2017 and rdi 2 in 2018 and 2019 varied from 6 in 2017 to 2 in 2018 which indicates a relative increase of 18 and 5 respectively the relationship between fruit moisture and swp was significant in the three seasons fig 8 these equations showed that fruit moisture strongly decreased with swp data obtained in 2017 and 2018 presented an almost equal relationship with a range in fruit moisture between 45 and 65 conversely data from the 2019 season presented lower fruit moisture than the two previous years the fit obtained in this latter season 2019 was significantly different for the other two the sampling period in the three seasons were similar from the end of july to mid september there were more fruit samples later than the ones shown in fig 8 but they are not included because the swp measured occurred at a different date the relationship between the minimum swp during pit hardening and the percentage of fruit oil in dry weight at harvest is presented in fig 9a the percentage of oil in all the plots during 2019 was greater than the one obtained in 2017 and 2018 the best fit in 2017 data were quadratic but with a pattern of increase when swp was less negative in all the ranges considered maximum value greater than 0 two data of 2017 were not included because they corresponded to two control plots in which problems with irrigation strongly affected the water status of the trees no significant relationships were found with the 2018 data but when both datasets 2017 and 2018 were included a significant regression was observed this common regression using both seasons showed that although the oil content increased with less negative values of swp there was a maximum around 1 8 mpa the best relationship was obtained with 2019 data the error was the lowest and the range of swp was the widest in this latter season the best fit was also quadratic with a maximum value around 3 6 mpa relationship did not improve using the stress integral values the relationship between the oil data from fig 9a and the minimum swp during recovery was analyzed in two ways fig 9b first only data below 2 1 mpa were considered according to hueso et al 2019 in this case only 2017 data presented a significant linear relationship between oil content and swp in this equation the oil percentage in the fruit decreased with the decrease of swp the second way considered all the data available from each season no significant relationship was found between the 2017 and 2018 data but when both seasons were considered a poor quadratic fit was adjusted in this latter equation higher values of fruit oil were reached with the increase of swp maximum at positive value greater than 0 data of the 2019 season presented the best fit and also a quadratic equation in this case the maximum oil content would be around 3 4 mpa no better relationships were found with the stress integral for any of the seasons the equations calculated in this figure were poorer than the ones from fig 9a the adjustment did not improved when both swp were used additional fruit features fruit dry weight and pit breaking pressure were characterized only for 2019 fig 10 the fruit dry weight presented a linear increase throughout the experiment in all treatments fig 10a only at the end of the stress period significant differences were found between rdi 2 and control from this date on rdi 2 tended to values lower that the rest of treatments but the differences were not significant the seasonal pattern of the pit breaking pressure was a sigmoidal curve with a short period of great increase from doy 164 199 fig 10b small but significant differences were found between control and sdi in the last period of hardening when maximum values were reached there was a significant relationship between the average swp for this period of greatest hardening increase and fruit oil at harvest fig 10c this equation was similar in accuracy and shape to the ones obtained for other periods fig 9 however maximum values of percentage of oil were obtained with swp around 1 6 mpa table 4 contains the average value of the parameters that defined the individual pit hardening pressure curves these parameters showed a significant delay in the pit hardening curve of control in comparison to the rest of treatments the date when 50 of the maximum values were reached was used to estimate the average hardening rate this parameter was significantly later in control around doy 181 than the rest of treatments around doy 179 the slope of increase also tended to lower values in control than in rdi 2 and sdi although no significant differences were found maximum values of pressure also tended to be greater in control than in rdi 2 and sdi rdi 1 data presented an intermediate pattern with a significant advance to the control curve but similar slope and maximum pressure values 3 3 yield response yield response is the summed of different components the lowest fruit yield was measured in 2017 and the highest in 2018 for all treatments fig 11 fruit and oil yield were not significantly different in any of the seasons fig 11 control tended to the highest fruit yield value in the three seasons and rdi 2 or sdi to the lowest fig 11 this result was in agreement with fruit size at harvest table 5 the number of fruits per kg was significantly lower or tended to lower values in control and rdi 1 depending of the season than rdi 2 which was always the highest table 5 however differences in fruit yield between treatments were reduced or even changed in oil yield fig 11 when the oil percentage based on fresh weight table 5 was considered although this latter measurement was not significant all deficit treatments tended to a higher oil percentage in fresh weight than control table 5 differences between control and the rest of treatments in percentage of oil varied from 0 3 2018 control vs rdi 2 to 3 2017 control vs rdi 2 and sdi table 5 such differences in oil percentage were not related to the ripening process because the mature index data were not significantly different between treatments in any of the seasons table 5 harvest occurred at the beginning of the veraison mi around 2 table 5 in all seasons the amount of water applied increased throughout the experiment with significant differences between control maximum rdi 1 and the other two treatments rdi 2 and sdi were very similar and not significantly different to each other table 5 on the other hand water productivity was significantly higher in rdi 2 and sdi than control for most of the seasons with maximum values during 2018 and minimum during the 2019 season table 5 variability between repetitions could affect the real yield respond when single plot data was analyzed fruit yield presented significant regressions in the 2017 and 2019 seasons but not in 2018 the season with the latest harvest date fig 12a in both seasons 2017 and 2019 the best relationships were obtained with minimum swp during pit hardening the fruit yield decreased gradually with more negative values of swp no common regressions were found between 2018 and the other two sets of data the oil yield presented significant regressions also in the 2017 and 2019 seasons with the total si data fig 12b both of them were significantly different in 2017 the best fit was a linear regression with a continuous decrease of oil yield with water stress there was a significant quadratic adjustment with the 2018 and 2019 data but this fit improved only if the 2019 season was considered the relationship of the 2018 and 219 data showed a maximum value at 109 3 mpa day but in the interval until this value the equation looked almost constant the decrease in oil yield was strong from around 200 mpa day the range of si data in the 2018 2019 equation were wider than in the 2017 adjustment in fact there were two sets of data in the 2017 season lower than 100 mpa day average oil yield 1049 105 kg ha 1 and greater than 100 mpa day average oil yield 780 66 kg ha 1 4 discussion 4 1 influence of water relations and shoot growth in yield response the drought resistance of the oil and fruit yield was extremely high with deficit irrigation from pit hardening extremely low swp from this period fig 9 with a long duration of the water stress level fig 3 and even partial rehydration table 3 resulted in a lack of significant fruit and oil yield reduction fig 11 however when the water status of each plot was considered there was a significant impact on oil and some seasons fruit yield fig 12 several works suggest a great response of olive to irrigation moriana et al 2003 ben gal et al 2011 but when the water stress was controlled ben gal et a 2021 and not coincident with a sensitive period such as olive flowering moriana et al 2003 the decrease in oil yield was low moriana et al 2003 ben gal et al 2021 the decrease presented in the current work fig 12 was similar to those reported in other previous works with moderate water stress fernández et al 2013 naor et al 2013 ahumada orellana et al 2017 the lack of results when the data averages are considered fig 11 suggested that the variability of the water status between plots offset the impact of the irrigation strategies these support the conclusion of ben gal et al 2021 about the limitations of sdi in comparison to rdi strategies and the usefulness of the water status measurements in olive irrigation scheduling moriana et al 2012 girón et al 2015 ahumada orellana et al 2017 hueso et al 2019 2021 corell et al 2020 ben gal et al 2021 crown volume and fruit load are two factors which could affect the yield response to irrigation naor et al 2013 corell et al 2020 pierantozzi et al 2020 however the former is associated with irrigated young olive orchard and the latter with cultivars with an alternate bearing pattern none of these factors are commonly present in mature hedgerow olive orchards in these orchards the cultivar the most common is arbequina has not a strong alternate bearing pattern barranco 1997 and the crown volume is similar at the beginning of each season to facilitate mechanic harvest therefore the current seasonal factors are more important than in intensive or traditional orchards oil production has three main yield components number of fruits fruit size and oil content fruit drop was almost null in the current work fig 5 with some very severe levels and duration of water stress fruit drop is not commonly evaluated in irrigation works but previous work in manzanilla table olive reported that the yield reduction would be significant with water stress level more negative than 2 mpa of swp girón et al 2015 corell et al 2020 such yield reduction would be lower than the ones predicted in the shoots corell et al 2020 but it could be important in the greatest level of water stress the lack of results for this component was likely related to the cultivar arbequina oil olive vs manzanilla table olive 4 2 influence of fruit development in yield response the fruit size was significantly affected throughout the experiment fig 6 but partially recovered at harvest even in the most stressed treatments fig 6 and table 5 most of the differences in fruit yield figs 11 and 12 were likely related to this component in fact part of the differences in fruit yield are only seen in fruit moisture the absence of a relationship between fruit yield and swp during 2018 suggests that the fruit moisture may have not been limiting in that season the 2018 season had the latest harvest date with a lot of prior rains fig 1 and the fruit volume was almost the same fig 6 conversely in the 2017 and 2019 seasons when the harvest date was before most of the rains presented reductions of fruit volume at harvest fig 6 some of them likely related to the fruit moisture fig 12 other data supporting that part of fruit yield differences are related to fruit moisture is the comparison between the two graphs in fig 12 the 2018 and 2019 oil yield data are in the same fit while they are clearly different in fruit yield fig 12 in the 2019 season the year with the greatest level of water stress fig 3 no significant differences were found in fruit dry weight fig 10 therefore according to the strong relationship between fruit moisture and swp fig 8 the linear decrease in fruit yield with swp fig 12 was strongly linked to differences in fruit water content the reduction in fruit size was reported as very sensitive to water stress girón et al 2015 ahumada orellana et al 2017 martín palomo et al 2020 and related to less absorption of water during the recovery period for table olive girón et al 2015 corell et al 2020 but although fruit size is an important yield component it is not a quality feature for oil production moreover if the increase in fruit yield is related to an increase in fruit moisture this will affect the industrial extractability of the oil garcía et al 2013 and in fact reduce the commercial oil yield then irrigation scheduling should be adapted to minimize this effect ben gal et al 2021 which the autumn rains would enhance a slightly lower fruit yield than in control such as rdi 1 but with similar oil yield than fully irrigated would secure a greater industrial oil yield and would be an optimization of the grower s profit on the other hand the reduction in fruit size in the 2017 season in comparison with the rest of the years fig 6 and table 5 was the main limiting factor for fruit and oil yield in this season this decrease was not related to an alternate bearing pattern because the low fruit yield was not associated with a greater fruit size i e girón et al 2015 corell et al 2020 such lower fruit size was likely produced by the water stress around the beginning of pit hardening table 3 and supplementary material s1 that likely reduced endocarp size and fruit volume the impact on endocarp growth reduced the fruit yield even though a full irrigation recovery was applied gómez del campo et al 2014 the water stress level of this latter work gómez del campo 2013 was similar to the supplementary material s1 but did not affect the following season flowering fig 11 as described in more severe conditions gucci et al 2019 4 3 influence of oil accumulation in yield response oil accumulation curves fig 7 and oil yield fig 11 were not significantly affected but important relationships between oil yield and si in the plot data were found fig 12b they support the trends in figs 7 and 11 of lower values in oil percentage in control than in some deficit irrigation strategies rdi 1 and sdi such differences in oil yield offset the differences in fruit yield fig 12 therefore a moderate water stress would enhance oil accumulations while a severe water stress or full irrigated conditions reduced it oil accumulation is commonly reported as sensitive to water stress lavee and wodner 1991 gómez del campo 2013 ahumada orellana et al 2017 hueso et al 2019 2021 however other works suggest that a moderate water stress promotes oil accumulation in fresh weight moriana et al 2003 grattan et al 2006 gucci et al 2007 lavee et al 2007 fernández et al 2013 ben gal et al 2021 such differences in the literature could be related not only to the level of water stress but also to the time point similar relationships between oil content and swp were found in three different parts of the season in 2019 massive pit hardening fig 10c pit hardening fig 9a and rehydration fig 9b and in two of them in 2017 2018 fig 9 data of the current work cannot help to conclude which is the most limiting or if there was a synergy between periods in fact all of them could be related because the best agreement of oil yield was with seasonal is fig 12b even in the 2017 season when oil yield was limited by fruit growth the relationship suggested a similar response in 2018 2019 fig 12b the rehydration period the nearest to harvest presented the worse agreement fig 9b hueso et al 2019 concluded that in this period the oil content is almost constant until swp about 2 mpa and then follows a linear decrease from this threshold this latter relationship was not found in most of the data in fig 9b and this suggests that it could be the least important better agreements were found between the water stress in pit hardening fig 9a and the maximum oil values reached at 1 7 mpa 2017 2018 and 3 6 mpa 2019 such range is common in irrigation works that reported an increase of oil accumulation moriana et al 2003 grattan et al 2006 fernández et al 2013 ben gal et al 2021 finally a water stress during the fast hardening period massive pit hardening around 1 6 mpa fig 10 maximizes oil accumulation hueso et al 2021 reported a linear decrease of fruit oil with values more negative than 1 8 mpa but did not describe any improvement the massive hardening process needs a greater amount of assimilates rallo and suarez 1989 then if it ended in deficit earlier than in control irrigation rdi 1 table 4 part of these assimilates could be used for oil production hammami et al 2013 concluded that the water status affected the sclerification timing which was faster in rainfed than in full irrigated treatments recently lópez bernal et al 2021 concluded that oil content could be modeled with two parameters slope of accumulation β independent of fruit carbon assimilation and fruit dry weight at onset of oil accumulation wfo depending among others on the water relation in the earlier stage of fruit growth this latter parameter wfo could be associated to changes in the massive pit hardening process related to water stress fig 10 5 conclusions regulated deficit irrigation allows optimizing the yield response in olive trees the regulation of the time point and the water stress level was decisive in identifying the best response the oil yield was dependent on two main components fruit size and oil content because there was no impact of the water stress conditions on fruit drop this latter result was cultivar dependent and the response could change significantly in other orchards fruit size variations were mainly caused by the fruit moisture around harvest and its decrease would be strongly reduced with irrigation or rain a similar fruit size with a low fruit yield reduction was obtained with the rdi 1 strategy which was associated with low fruit moisture the oil content was increased with a moderate water stress at different periods and rdi 1 and sdi tended to produce the greatest values at harvest the maximum oil yield was obtained in plots where the seasonal si was lower than 100 mpa day these levels of water stress included plots with moderate water stress during pit hardening and moderate or null water stress during rehydration as rdi 1 treatment causing a maximization of the two factors considered fruit size and oil content the period between the end of maximum endocarp growth and the end of massive pit hardening was critical water stress in this period decreased fruit size irreversibly thus reducing the oil yield but also oil content was maximized with less severe water stress during massive pit hardening endocarp development growth and hardening are the most

9733,a widely promoted approach to tackle food insecurity and water shortage challenges simultaneously is to enhance crop water productivity wp therefore multiple international organizations have featured wp improvements as their major policy goal and substantial public and private investments have been made in this domain advances in remote sensing allow accurate rapid and cost effective wp analysis for agricultural monitoring however translating the data to actionable information seems fraught with difficulties as it only provides spatial and temporal variability in wp and no information on the causes of the variability this paper introduces a standard approach using open source remote sensing data for diagnosing reasons behind wp variations comparing high performing fields bright spots with low performing fields hotspots the framework is applied to a case study on the bekaa valley in lebanon considering wheat potato and table grapes six factors crop water stress irrigation uniformity soil salinity nitrogen application crop rotation and soil type were analysed to identify their influence on wp and yield this paper reveals that the growth of wheat and potatoes is negatively affected by water stress in the critical crop growth stages non uniform irrigation and nitrogen stress also it was found that potatoes grown on clay loam soil has better wp and yield than potatoes grown loam soil such information with regard to wp factors assists practitioners to identify priority areas and actions aiming at cropfield level wp improvement while acknowledging errors uncertainties and caveats inherent to the use of remote sensing data this paper shows the feasibility and practical usefulness of the diagnostic framework keywords wapor crop water stress water scarcity agronomic practices irrigation practices bekaa valley 1 introduction a significant challenge for the current and future generations is to ensure food security with the sustainable use of limited land and water resources globally 820 million people face hunger fao 2019 at the same time about four billion people face water scarcity during at least one month of the year unesco world water assessment programme wwap 2019 in the future the situation is expected to get worse due to climate change farmers will be exposed to increased agricultural water supply variability growing unpredictability and frequent droughts and floods fao 2011 due to the increased competition with industrial and domestic sectors water availability for agriculture production will decrease zwart and bastiaanssen 2007 bakkes et al 2009 therefore a widely promoted approach to cope with the water and food insecurity challenges is to increase agricultural water productivity thus multiple international organisations including world water council wwc the international water management institute iwmi wwap and fao have featured water productivity improvement as a major policy goal scheierling and tréguer 2018 the term water productivity wp was introduced to emphasise that increasing local irrigation efficiency might not lead to basin wide water savings seckler 1996 since then many other authors have defined wp differently revolving around crop per drop scheierling and tréguer 2018 kijne et al 2003 defined wp as the ratio of the value or amount of product to the value or volume of water depleted or diverted molden et al 2010 have defined it as the net benefit from the plant fishery livestock and mixed agricultural system per unit water used for this research study we define wp as the amount of marketable biomass economic product of a specific crop in kilograms produced per unit volume of actual evapotranspiration and interception et capturing and analyzing spatial and temporal variability in wp paves the way for identifying the potential for improving wp zwart and bastiaanssen 2007 remote sensing is an excellent tool that allows comprehensive analysis and requires comparatively little ground information cai and sharma 2010 it enables wp estimation with acceptable accuracy with errors ranging from 7 to 22 for the best case scenario blatchford et al 2019 finally remote sensing is low cost compared to the ground measurements and offers a rapid scan of the wp in a rather large extent of area zwart and leclert 2010 in combination with other spatial information it can diagnose the causes of low performance and identify interventions for improving wp since the first applications of remote sensing for agricultural monitoring using the energy balance to estimate evapotranspiration bastiaanssen et al 1998 open source remote sensing products have become more available not only are there various remote sensing products for evapotranspiration in combination with vegetation related products such as leaf area index lai normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and net primary production npp it can also provide spatial and temporal wp estimates however observing the variability of wp on its own does not contribute to improving wp the data has to be translated to actionable information by identifying the causes for the variability this study therefore evaluates how open source spatial data products can be used to identify reasons behind low performances this study developed a standard procedure framework that can be used to utilize open source remote sensing data for identifying reasons behind wp variations 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the bekaa valley was chosen as the case study for developing and testing the diagnostic framework due to the availability and accessibility of both field data and high resolution rs imagery the bekaa valley located in eastern lebanon has a total area of 90 000 ha and is situated between anti lebanon and mount lebanon to the east and west respectively fig 1 the valley has a mediterranean climate with average annual rainfall ranging from 700 mm year 1 in the southern part to 250 mm year 1 in the northern part chalak and sabra 2007 the major crops grown in the valley are wheat early potatoes and vegetables caiserman et al 2019 next to seasonal crops many perennial fruit trees are grown in the bekaa valley including apples grapes citrus cherries almonds apricots peaches plums and pears verner et al 2018 during summer the main cropping season the reference evapotranspiration exceeds the precipitation irrigation supply is therefore essential to meet the evaporative demand of the crops fig 2 a large portion of the irrigation water 72 is supplied from groundwater fao and ihe delft 2019 based on the field survey most of the farmers in the valley use sprinkler irrigation 65 followed by drip irrigation 22 micro sprinklers 6 and furrow irrigation 4 jaafar et al 2017 potatoes and table grapes are grown under full irrigation while supplementary irrigation is practiced for wheat stokvis 2017 this research is carried out on three major crops potatoes wheat and table grapes the bekaa valley is known as the country s food basket and 42 of the total agricultural land is concentrated in the valley verner et al 2018 however insufficient rainfall and its seasonality make water a primary constraint for agricultural production saab et al 2014 therefore improving water productivity is of vital importance in the valley to sustain food production in light of growing water scarcity 2 2 remote sensing data 2 2 1 wapor data fao s portal to monitor water productivity through open access of remotely sensed derived data wapor contains datasets for estimating wp it comes in three levels with different resolutions fao 2018 for the bekaa valley the highest resolution 30 m is available and was used for this study the most recent wapor version 2 1 was accessed through https wapor apps fao org home wapor 2 3 table 1 shows the different wapor datasets used in this study 2 2 2 other remote sensing data data from the landsat 8 and sentinel 2 satellite missions have been acquired this data is used to calculate leaf moisture soil salinity and leaf nitrogen described separately in the later sections on demand surface reflectance landsat 8 data is downloaded from the official united states geological survey usgs website then clouds and shadows were removed using the cloud masking for landsat products plugin in qgis sentinel 2 data was downloaded from theia which had already been atmospherically and slope corrected the clouds and shadows were removed by using the masks already provided with the data soil type data is acquired from soilgrids a global soil properties mapping system that is based on state of the art machine learning methods hengl et al 2017 2 2 3 unit of analysis this study applies the analyses at the crop field level the crop field boundaries polygons are delineated based on a 30 m resolution crop mask obtained from wapor as can be seen from tables 1 and 2 the spatial resolution of the various datasets used varies with wapor and landsat 8 data being available at 30 m resolution sentinel 2 10 20 m while soilgrids data is having a coarser resolution of 250 m while the statistics calculated for crop fields based on sentinel 2 data is not expected to affect the accuracy of the analysis the coarser resolution data from soilgrids could affect the accuracy of the results therefore crop fields laying on multiple soil types were removed from analysis 2 2 4 period of analysis the analyses were implemented for the year 2017 when there was an overlap between the crop type map of wapor available at the time of the study and the sentinel 2b data a comparison was done on the water productivity values from 2015 to 2019 to ensure the selected year was not abnormal 2 3 analytical framework the analytical framework fig 3 applied in this study consist of four steps 1 yield and wp figures for each crop field were calculated using wapor data 2 bright spots well performing crop fields and hot spots poor performing crop fields were identified in the study area 3 based on available wapor and other remote sensing data various indicators were defined to identify factors affecting yield and water productivity 4 finally analyses of wp factors were done between different indicators and the hotspots and the bright spots to diagnose reasons behind yield and wp variations the framework is applied to three main crops in the bekaa valley wheat potatoes and grapes each step is described in detail in the next sections 2 3 1 yield and water productivity estimation the yield and water consumption are calculated for the selected crops using a field boundary map this was obtained for each crop type by polygonising a raster crop type map of the study area for wheat and potatoes the crop type map corresponding to the full canopy cover for each crop for the wheat first decade of march and potatoes last decade of april from wapor were used for the table grapes the crop type mask was provided by alvarez carrion 2018 as wapor crop type map does not differentiate between the table grapes and wine grapes yield and wp are calculated by using wapor data npp and et the above ground biomass production is calculated using eqs 1 and 2 fao 2018 and finally crop yield is calculated by eq 3 mul and bastiaanssen 2019 1 dm p i npp 22 222 n d i 2 agb p s i sos eos dm p i aot 3 y agbp hi c 4 1 m c the dmpi is dry matter production kgdmp ha 1 dekad 1 npp is net primary production gc m 2 day 1 ndi is the number of days in a dekade days and agbps is seasonal above ground biomass production kg ha 1 season 1 from the start of the season sos to the end of the season eos hi is dry basis harvest index fraction and aot is agbp over total biomass production tbp the fraction aot is used in the calculation of agbp if the hi of a crop is calculated as yield to above ground biomass for wheat the hi is calculated as yield to above ground biomass ratio abi saab et al 2019 karam et al 2009 contrary to this hi of potatoes is the ratio of the dry weight of the tubers to the dry weight of the entire plant darwish et al 2006 mazurczyk et al 2009 and hi of grapes is calculated as the marketable yield divided by the total biomass production tbp alvarez carrion 2018 therefore unlike the wheat crop the aot value for potatoes and grapes is 1 00 and can be ignored in agbp s equation thus users must be clear on how the hi is defined in the literature consulted y is yield kg ha 1 season 1 the light use efficiency of c4 crops is about 80 higher than the c3 crops therefore the y of c4 crops is multiplied by a factor of 1 8 mul and bastiaanssen 2019 for c3 crops the factor value is 1 00 and can be ignored in eq 3 the mc is wet weight basis plant moisture content fraction the sos and eos for each crop were identified from the ndvi time series whereas the crop specific parameters were adapted from literature as summarized in table 3 wapor data quality index qi is produced while compositing the ndvi and indicates the gap between the nearest observation date and reconstruction date fao 2018 for the available and reliable observations the reconstruction is not needed and thus the qi is set to zero an ideal condition the ndvi composites are used as inputs to npp and et calculation therefore the qi depicts the quality of npp and et fao 2018 to ensure better accuracy of the data used the npp and et pixels with qi greater than 3 dekades were removed from each image it means that the data constructed based on a gap longer than 30 days in between valid observations is discarded this criterion for qi can adjusted based on the user preferences and local circumstances as this study uses the crop field level as the unit of analysis the average value of all pixels within a crop field is considered for analysis therefore removing low quality pixels did not create data gaps at the field level water productivity is calculated using the following formula chukalla et al 2021 4 wp y e t 1 10 the wp is water productivity kg m 3 y is yield kg ha 1 season 1 and et is seasonal actual evapotranspiration for a specific crop type mm season 1 after the yield and wp maps have been prepared then the crop fields with implausible data were removed by using the following four criteria filter to avoid erroneous conclusions crop fields with a coefficient of variation of wp wpcv greater than 20 with wpcv calculated using the following equation 5 w p cv σ wp w p mean σwp is the standard deviation of wp within the crop field and wpmean is the mean water productivity of a crop field crop fields with an area of less than one hectare crop fields with the yield value higher than the maximum achievable and lower than the minimum recorded based on literature crop fields with an average lcc accuracy of less than 80 fig 4 shows all the selected crop fields after removal of the fields with implausible data for the analysis 2 3 2 identification of bright and hot spots bright spots generally can be defined as the agricultural communities and households which are performing better than their neighbours even with the same social environmental and demographic pressures de vries 2005 on the other hand low performing areas are considered hot spots karimi et al 2019 these bright and hot spots can be used to identify the causes behind what is affecting the performance bright spots can be defined in terms of higher yield e g cai and sharma 2010 in india higher wp or a combination e g alauddin et al 2010 in bangladesh by focusing on wp improvements alone ignores the farmers need to produce crops for food security and income whilst only focusing on yield improvement may affect the sustainability of the basin water resources therefore in this study we focused on identifying bright and hot spots based on both yield and wp there is still a debate as to what level defines better performance for yield licker et al 2010 defined the attainable yield within regions of similar climate at the 90th percentile whereas foley et al 2011 used the 95th percentile for wp alauddin et al 2010 used the top quartile 75th percentile whereas zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 and zwart et al 2010 used the 95th percentile to exclude extremes the selection of the threshold is arbitrary but has a significant effect on the results for example using high threshold values 95th primarily identifies extremes zwart et al 2010 while the focus should be more on values which are attainable under the set conditions i e a lower threshold value for this study we tested threshold values 70th to 95th percentile with 5 percentile intervals and selected the threshold value which provided a sufficiently large number of fields in the bright and hotspots categories exceeding the threshold levels in both yield and wp and significantly large performance gap we therefore used the 80th percentile threshold for both yield and wp to be classified as bright spots while fields below the 20th percentile are categorised as hot spots 2 3 3 defining indicators for wp factors reasons behind yield and wp variations can be diagnosed by analyzing the internal genetic and external environmental factors that affect crop production six wp factors external water stress irrigation heterogeneity salinity stress nitrogen stress and soil type were considered in this study as they can be determined using wapor and other remote sensing data each factor is analyzed by using one or more indicator s to find reasons behind wp variations see fig 5 each indicator is separately discussed in the following sections 2 3 4 water stress water stress is assumed to be linked to leaf water content and plant moisture stress this can be observed using the mid infrared mir carlson et al 1971 thomas et al 1971 tucker 1980 everitt 1986 ripple 1986 and near infrared nir wavelengths hardisky et al 1983 everitt 1986 ceccato et al 2001 rs bands therefore various vegetation indices based on nir are proposed for detecting plant moisture stress we selected the normalized difference moisture index ndmi in this study as it was found to have the highest correlation with leaf and canopy water content r2 0 68 zhang et al 2018 6 ndmi r n r s r n r s rn and rs are reflectances for nir and shortwave infrared swir respectively the index is calculated by using sentinel 2 band 8 a nir and band 11 swir to increase the temporal resolution of data ndmi was also calculated by using similar bands on landsat 8 band 5 nir and band 6 swir images acquired on the same date resulted in highly similar ndmi maps represented by r2 0 98 and mean bias error 0 003 the crop response to water stress was identified from the change in leaf moisture content and corresponding changes in biomass production crop fields identified as bright spots were assumed to have optimal moisture content conditions therefore the average ndmi value of bright spots was considered a benchmark against which the hot spots ndmi value was compared in this way the moisture stress in hotspots was quantified by subtracting the average ndmi of hot spots from the average ndmi of bright spots from sos to the eos the larger difference in ndmi ndmidiff indicates higher stress in hotspots and vice versa similarly the difference in biomass production nppdiff was quantified by subtracting the average npp of hot spots npphs from the average npp of bright spots nppbs the core methodology is to compare ndmidiff with nppdiff to know how crops respond to water stress in terms of changes in biomass production to better understand crop response to water stress the stress sensitivity index ssi was developed in this study the ssi was calculated by dividing the nppdiff of a decade over the corresponding ndmidiff the ssi was calculated for all decades from sos to the eos the ssi time series indicates how biomass production is affected by changes in the moisture stress along the crop growth cycle the crop response to stress is investigated through all phenological stages of each crop type to identify its stress sensitive growth stages for this purpose four general physiological stages introduced by fao initial developing mid and late stage and more crop specific growth stages were adapted from literature 7 ssi np p bs np p hs ndm i bs ndm i hs where ssi is stress sensitivity index ndm i bs is average normalised difference moisture index of bright spots ndm i hs is average normalised difference moisture index of hot spots 2 3 5 irrigation heterogeneity the variability in evapotranspiration et within a crop field is assumed to be related to the heterogeneity in the water application the within field coefficient of variation of et cvet karimi et al 2019 is calculated and correlated with the yield and wp to assess non uniform irrigation practices effect on crop production and water consumption 2 3 6 salinity stress in cases where the salinity stress is coupled with other stresses moisture aeration or diseases bare soil salinity can help identify the impact of soil salt content on crop production al khaier 2003 proposed the normalized difference salinity index ndsi that allows accurate salinity detection r2 0 86 of the bare agricultural soil 8 ndsi r s 1 r s 2 r s 1 r s 2 rs1 and rs2 are reflectances for swir1 band 4 and swir2 band 5 on advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster as aster data is not available currently similar bands of landsat 8 swir1 band 6 and swir2 band 7 are used for ndsi calculation abuelgasim and ammad 2019 have also used landsat 8 data for bare soil salinity detection they have assessed the accuracy of multiple salinity indices of which the nir swir index nsi has the highest accuracy 60 9 nsi r s 1 r s 2 r s 1 nir rs1 rs2 and nir are reflectances for swir1 band 6 swir2 band 7 and nir band 5 on landsat 8 respectively to identify the effect of salinity the ndsi and nsi of each crop field are correlated with their yield and wp figures 2 3 7 nitrogen stress a study by ramoelo and cho 2018 has exposed that the simple ratio of red edge index srre3 based on sentinel 2 data allows an accurate estimate of the leaf nitrogen content represented by r2 of 0 75 and rmse of 0 17 n in this study the srre3 is used for leaf nitrogen estimation 10 s r re 3 r re 3 r re 1 rre1 and rre3 are respectively reflectances for visible red edge vre1 band 5 and vre3 band 7 on sentinel 2 the srre3 values of all identified bright spots were averaged for each decade from sos to the eos to produce their average leaf nitrogen content time series a similar time series for hot spots were also produced then their average leaf nitrogen content time series were compared with each other to know the role of nitrogen application in biomass production 2 3 8 effect of crop rotation on yield and wp crop rotation is the growing of a series of various crop types on the same crop field in successive years or seasons cottren and gryder 2014 for each crop its preceding crop grown on the same field was identified by using wapor lcc of the previous season the crop fields were categorized as rotated and mono cropped for instance if the preceding crop of a wheat field in 2017 was identified as wheat in 2016 then the field was categorized as mono cropped further if multiple crops are grown on the same crop field in 2016 then the area of partial rotation is considered if more than 50 of the crop field area is covered by crops other than wheat in 2016 then the crop field is categorised as rotated otherwise the crop field is mono cropped the yield and wp figures of the two groups rotated and mono cropped fields were tested with the t test to determine the significance of the rotation practices more detailed information about the t test is provided in the section data analysis 2 3 4 2 3 9 effect of soil type on yield and wp the raster layer of soil type soil classes based on united states department of agriculture usda classification map was acquired from soilgrids table 2 the soil information is then extracted to the polygon of each crop field by using the zonal statistic in qgis the yield and wp figures of the crop fields associated with the different soil types were tested with the t test to identify the statistical significance of soil type influence on yield and wp 2 3 10 data analysis various approaches were adapted for analysis based on the data type in this study three kinds of data analysis were performed each is described separately in the below sections 2 3 11 bright and hot spots time series comparison the ndmi npp ssi and srre3 of each crop is changing from time to time during the growth period therefore time series from sos to the eos for these indicators were produced to track their fluctuations along the crop growth cycle to increase the significance of the results average time series were produced for the bright and hot spots categories for example the ndmi time series of all wheat bright spots were averaged into one average wheat bright spot ndmi time series similarly one average wheat hot spot ndmi time series were produced variations in these average time series were analysed to understand various factors affecting crop yield 2 3 12 t test analysis the crop fields can be clustered into a specific number of groups based on their soil type for instance they were grouped as loam and clay loam soils then the yield and wp figures of both groups were tested with the t test to determine whether the difference between the means of the groups is significant or not if the t score exceeds its critical value at p 0 05 then the difference is significant and vice versa a significant difference implies that the factor soil type has affected yield or wp 2 3 13 correlation analysis for the cvet ndsi and nsi all crop fields have a single value for a season therefore their time series cannot be produced besides for these indicators all crop fields have a unique value therefore they cannot be categorised into groups thus cvet ndsi and nsi of the individual crop fields were correlated with their corresponding yield and wp figures correlation evaluates the relationship between two variables quantitatively a higher correlation indicates a stronger relationship between variables whereas a weak correlation implies that the variables are not related to each other 3 results and discussion 3 1 yield and water productivity estimation crop yield and wp maps of each crop type for all crop fields were estimated the summary is presented in table 4 and fig 6 the average estimated wheat yield 3203 kg ha 1 and potatoes yield 31 495 kg ha 1 are quite comparable with the reported wheat yield 3000 kg ha 1 tohmé tawk et al 2019 and potatoes yield 32 533 kg ha 1 awad 2019 in the valley the average grapes yield in lebanon based on faostat 2020 data from 2008 to 2018 is 8741 kg ha 1 whereas the calculated grapes yield in this study is 17 858 kg ha 1 the discrepancy is because the faostat 2020 reports the average yield of both wine and table grapes and this study considers only table grapes also the reported yield is the average value at the country level while the estimated yield value is only for the bekaa valley furthermore the estimated average wp of wheat 0 82 kg m 3 potatoes 8 05 kg m 3 and grapes 2 40 kg m 3 are within their respective global wp ranges 0 62 2 00 kg m 3 foley et al 2019 4 00 11 00 kg m 3 steduto et al 2012 and 1 3 4 5 kg m 3 alvarez carrion 2018 although the yield and wp estimations using the wapor data with the single hi value show a good correlation with figures from the field but the hi should be adjusted upward or downward depending on the timing crop phenological stage and extent of various stresses and sensitivity of the crop to these stresses steduto et al 2012 whereas in this study based on literature one constant hi value is used thus considering the hi dynamics yield estimated by using a single hi value might not depict the real crop yield variations the analyses further presented in the paper reflect the diagnostic analysis for the year 2017 which is an average year of table 4 3 2 identified bright and hot spots table 5 summarises the total number of crop fields and the number of crop fields categorised as bright and hot spots for each crop type the spatial distribution of bright and hot spots of wheat potatoes and grapes is shown in fig 7 an example of a scatter plot of yield versus wp for potatoes with the identified bright and hot spots are shown in fig 8 a single threshold value is used for the entire valley to identify bright and hot spots but the valley has various climatic zones therefore the threshold value might be too high or low for certain areas thus it is recommended to determine and delineate various agro climatic zones and apply separate thresholds to each zone 3 3 analysis of wp factors 3 3 1 water stress fig 9 a shows that before 12th march the wheat nppdiff is marginal even though the ndmidiff around february is very high from the booting stage onward despite a decrease in ndmidiff the nppdiff soars the ssi curve further demonstrates the influence of moisture stress on biomass production fig 9 b the ssi remains close to zero from the initial to the mid of the developing stage start of booting while with the onset of the booting stage the ssi mounts and remains higher till the end of the grain filling stage this indicates that the wheat biomass is more sensitive to moisture stress from the mid developing to grain filling stage zhang and oweis 1999 have also found that wheat sensitivity to water stress in the mediterranean region is higher from the booting stage to grain filling and then reduces at the late stage table 6 biomass loss in the potatoes has occurred from the tuber initiation until maturity fig 9 c at tuber initiation and the start of tuber filling the moisture deficit has a real time effect on biomass production the nppdiff soars as the ndmidiff rises however in the mid tuber filling the decreases in ndmidiff do not affect the gained momentum of the nppdiff curve it is because water deficit during tuber initiation limits the number of tubers formation obidiegwu et al 2015 which reduces biomass accumulation during tuber filling the ssi for the potato crop fig 9 d demonstrates that yield response to stress is peaking in the tuber filling stage and then sharply declines at maturity late stage steduto et al 2012 also reported that the yield response factor ky for potatoes sharply declines from 0 7 in the mid stage to 0 2 in the late stage table 6 the ssi of potatoes remains low from the establishment to mid tuber initiation while table 6 shows a very high potatoes sensitivity to stress at the initial stage at this period the potatoes are not stressed ndmi diff remains almost zero see fig 9 c therefore crop response in terms of yield reduction is not captured thus to better understand crop response to stress at each stage crops should be intentionally stressed at every phenological stage many grape varieties some are listed by leeters 2018 and alvarez carrion 2018 in the valley causes significant heterogeneity in phenological stages and in harvest time within and between the groups bright and hot spots therefore a comparison of ndmi and npp figures does not give sufficient information about the grapes stress response to biomass production this also signifies that the ssi analysis for intercropping leads to erroneous results due to differences in biomass production hi and et of various crops in the same crop field the results show that the changes in ndmi and npp of potatoes are more prominent than in wheat this implies that the potato leaf welt sooner than the wheat in response to the water stress such information can be very useful for choosing stress tolerant cultivars such as wheat in areas where water stress occurs the results also reveal that farmers associated with the hot spots have lost substantial wheat yield during the flowering and grain filling stages and potato yield during the tuber filling stage these growth stages were also identified as the most stress sensitivity periods for their corresponding crops therefore water stress during the most sensitive growth periods is suggested to be prevented this indicates a need for better irrigation scheduling improved moisture conservation or wiser water allocation along the crop growth period 3 3 2 irrigation heterogeneity fig 10 a c show that irrigation heterogeneity cvet negatively correlates with the yield of all three crops whereas cvet does not significantly correlate with the wp this exposes that only the yield of the crops is negatively affected by irrigation heterogeneity this confirms findings by abd el wahed et al 2016 currently 65 of the farmers use sprinkler irrigation systems with only 65 efficiency due to the windy nature of the valley jaafar et al 2017 the reduction in cvet and subsequent increase in the potato yield can be realized by changing the sprinkler irrigation system to the drip irrigation system the farmers who have switched to drip irrigation systems have already increased their potato yield in the valley united states agency for international development usaid 2014 the cvet indicates variations in et which is assumed to be due to irrigation application this could be caused due to variable application of non water inputs and variability in soil properties gil et al 2019 also partial infection of a crop field with diseases could lead to variability in et furthermore a farmer may grow various varieties of the same crop in a field the chances of these contributing factors to variability are higher in the larger crop fields than the smaller therefore the users must be aware of the other potential contributors to cvet to better inform decisions 3 3 3 salinity stress the results in fig 10 d show that salinity has neither affected wheat yield nor wp as represented by a non significant and weak correlation likewise potato wp and yield is not affected by salinity demonstrated by weak correlations fig 10 e fao and international atomic energy agency iaea 2018 also state that the soil salinity of rain fed flood irrigation and alternative drip and sprinkler irrigation practices is very low 0 7 1 7 ds m in the valley however monoculture and localized irrigation practices have increased soil salinity up to 9 ds m at 20 cm soil depth in the northern parts of the valley furthermore the indices used for soil salinity analysis in this study are only capable to detect topsoil salinity based on surface soil reflectance but for irrigated agriculture only topsoil salinity assessment is not sufficient and root zone salinity analysis from where crops take up water is of vital importance therefore it is suggested to complement these results with root zone salinity analysis as recommended by scudiero et al 2016 3 3 4 nitrogen stress fig 11 demonstrates that leaf nitrogen content srre3 of bright spots is higher than the hot spots in all three crop types so farmers associated with bright spots have applied more nitrogen than the hot spot farmers fig 11 a shows that the difference between srre3 of the bright and hot spots of the wheat crop is very small this indicates that wheat bright spot farmers have applied slightly more nitrogen than the hot spots farmers realising that nitrogen treatment has a limited impact on wheat yield karam et al 2009 on the other hand the srre3 of potatoes bright spots is prominently higher than the hot spots this indicates that potatoes bright spot farmers have applied more nitrogen knowing that the potato yield can be significantly improved with increase nitrogen application xing et al 2016 similarly nitrogen doses significantly increase grape yield in the mediterranean climate ozdemir et al 2010 therefore bright spot farmers have applied more nitrogen to obtain better table grapes yield as reflected in fig 11 c the results show that better performers bright spots are associated with higher nitrogen applications however it is difficult to explicitly identify nitrogen contribution to better performance in proportion to other improved irrigation and agronomic practices adapted by the bright spot farmers it is also worth mentioning that the uptake of phosphorous and potassium is also encouraged by nitrogen bloom 2015 hemerly 2016 therefore it is challenging to separate the direct and indirect influence of nitrogen application on crop yield thus further correlation and comparative analysis between crop fields with different nitrogen applications and similar irrigation agronomic practices can improve the results moreover leaf nitrogen content srre3 is calculated as an index for practical purposes the index value has to be translated to the leaf nitrogen in percentage and then related to the applied amount of nitrogen the further suggested study will also help quantify the optimum amount and timing of nitrogen application for each crop 3 3 5 effect of crop rotation on yield and wp table 7 summarizes the t test results for crop rotation influence on yield and wp the results show that the t score for wheat wp 3 48 has exceeded the critical value 1 96 thus rotation has a statistically significant impact on wheat wp while the impact of rotation on wheat yield is not statistically significant the t score 0 73 is lower than the critical value 1 96 however wheat rotated with other crops has resulted in a 55 kg ha 1 increase in yield this means that there is an increase in wheat yield yet not statistically significant as the t test fails the t score for both potatoes wp and yield are lower than the critical value this implies that the crop rotation has neither significantly influenced potatoes yield nor wp even though the results are not statistically significant t tests have not been passed the farmers practising crop rotation harvest 709 kg ha 1 more potatoes than the farmers engaged in mono cropping also wp is slightly higher in the rotated crop fields crop rotation increases crop yield because it improves soil structure and organic matter and controls pests nuñez et al 2019 a study based on the data collected over the 20 years by strauss 2017 has also revealed that wheat mono cropping has the lowest yield than any other wheat crop succession our results also confirm that rotation has increased yield of both wheat and potatoes but not statistically significant an improvement in the methodology might signify the results if the yield figures of fully rotated crop fields are compared with the fully mono cropped field currently partially rotated crop fields are also included in the analysis see section 2 3 3 5 for methodology moreover other factors like irrigation practices and inputs application also affect wp and yield and thus may diminish the influence of crop rotation furthermore in this study the crop rotation analysis is based on only two years of data it can reflect the nutritional enrichment of the soil but not the breaking of the disease cycle for the most appropriate cropping sequences and their impact on yield it is recommended to analyse crop rotation data of four to five years mohler and johnson 2009 3 3 6 effect of soil type on yield and wp according to the usda soil classification nine soil classes were identified in the valley see fig 12 however the figure shows that crops under study wheat potatoes and grapes are grown only on xeralf and xerolls soil classes the number of crop fields distributed over each soil type is presented in fig 13 xeralf and xerolls are respectively loam and clay loam soils based on soil texture triangle the hydrological properties of both soil classes are presented in table 8 to ensure the accuracy of the results crop fields lying partially on both soil types were removed from the analysis thereafter the t tests were conducted to determine the statistical significance of the soil type influence on yield and wp table 9 results show that soil type significantly impacts wheat wp but not wheat yield p 0 05 results also reveal that both yield and wp of potatoes are significantly influenced by soil type although the values are close to the critical threshold for significance soil type is not a statistically significant factor influencing yield and wp for grapes the influence of soil type can be ascribed to its hydrological properties the plant available water paw of the xerolls clay loam soil 200 mm m 1 is higher than the xeralf loam soil 167 mm m 1 new mexico state university 2018 therefore in a water scarce region bekaa valley the potatoes and grapes grown on the xerolls soils have a higher yield than xeralf a proper irrigation scheduling can increase potatoes and grapes yield grown on xeralf soils for this purpose the depth of irrigation is recommended to be reduced and frequency increased as xeralf soils cannot hold a larger quantity of water to support crop water demand for a longer time 3 4 framework limitations the above mentioned research findings with regard to yield and wp figures estimation crop response to water stress variability in et salinity stress nitrogen application and influence of crop rotation and soil type on performances compare well with the available information from the field and knowledge in literature however we acknowledge the limitations of this framework this framework is mainly aimed at crop field level analysis therefore the spatial resolution of the remote sensing data in relation to crop field polygons size is a key consideration concerning the accuracy of results in this study crop fields smaller than one hectare is removed from the analysis based on data with a 30 m resolution for a coarser resolution 250 m soil data analysis the crop fields lying on multiple soil types are not considered for analysis removal of such crop fields from analysis reduces data population and affects the significance of the results therefore users are recommended to consider data with reasonable spatial resolution in relation to crop field size in this study after data cleaning the population of the data remained sufficient for analysis due to a reasonable resolution of the data as compared to the size of crop fields in the valley 4 conclusions to translate open source remote sensing data to actionable information by using a structured approach a diagnostic framework has been developed the realistic estimation of yield and et figures with sufficient spatial resolution to capture crop field level variability enabled crop fields categorisation and their comparative analysis the study revealed that four factors have negatively affected yield and wp in the bekaa valley and they are water stress at the critical crop growth stages low within farm irrigation uniformity low nitrogen application and improper irrigation schedule based on soil properties it was also exposed that mono cropping has reduced yield and wp but the results are not statistically significant whereas topsoil salinity has neither influenced yield nor wp in the valley to improve yield and wp in the valley investments should target the above four factors while we acknowledge the errors and caveats inherent to the use of remote sensing data we are confident that the application of the diagnostic framework provides reliable and useful results since the analyses focus on the comparative analyses and less on the absolute value declaration

9733,a widely promoted approach to tackle food insecurity and water shortage challenges simultaneously is to enhance crop water productivity wp therefore multiple international organizations have featured wp improvements as their major policy goal and substantial public and private investments have been made in this domain advances in remote sensing allow accurate rapid and cost effective wp analysis for agricultural monitoring however translating the data to actionable information seems fraught with difficulties as it only provides spatial and temporal variability in wp and no information on the causes of the variability this paper introduces a standard approach using open source remote sensing data for diagnosing reasons behind wp variations comparing high performing fields bright spots with low performing fields hotspots the framework is applied to a case study on the bekaa valley in lebanon considering wheat potato and table grapes six factors crop water stress irrigation uniformity soil salinity nitrogen application crop rotation and soil type were analysed to identify their influence on wp and yield this paper reveals that the growth of wheat and potatoes is negatively affected by water stress in the critical crop growth stages non uniform irrigation and nitrogen stress also it was found that potatoes grown on clay loam soil has better wp and yield than potatoes grown loam soil such information with regard to wp factors assists practitioners to identify priority areas and actions aiming at cropfield level wp improvement while acknowledging errors uncertainties and caveats inherent to the use of remote sensing data this paper shows the feasibility and practical usefulness of the diagnostic framework keywords wapor crop water stress water scarcity agronomic practices irrigation practices bekaa valley 1 introduction a significant challenge for the current and future generations is to ensure food security with the sustainable use of limited land and water resources globally 820 million people face hunger fao 2019 at the same time about four billion people face water scarcity during at least one month of the year unesco world water assessment programme wwap 2019 in the future the situation is expected to get worse due to climate change farmers will be exposed to increased agricultural water supply variability growing unpredictability and frequent droughts and floods fao 2011 due to the increased competition with industrial and domestic sectors water availability for agriculture production will decrease zwart and bastiaanssen 2007 bakkes et al 2009 therefore a widely promoted approach to cope with the water and food insecurity challenges is to increase agricultural water productivity thus multiple international organisations including world water council wwc the international water management institute iwmi wwap and fao have featured water productivity improvement as a major policy goal scheierling and tréguer 2018 the term water productivity wp was introduced to emphasise that increasing local irrigation efficiency might not lead to basin wide water savings seckler 1996 since then many other authors have defined wp differently revolving around crop per drop scheierling and tréguer 2018 kijne et al 2003 defined wp as the ratio of the value or amount of product to the value or volume of water depleted or diverted molden et al 2010 have defined it as the net benefit from the plant fishery livestock and mixed agricultural system per unit water used for this research study we define wp as the amount of marketable biomass economic product of a specific crop in kilograms produced per unit volume of actual evapotranspiration and interception et capturing and analyzing spatial and temporal variability in wp paves the way for identifying the potential for improving wp zwart and bastiaanssen 2007 remote sensing is an excellent tool that allows comprehensive analysis and requires comparatively little ground information cai and sharma 2010 it enables wp estimation with acceptable accuracy with errors ranging from 7 to 22 for the best case scenario blatchford et al 2019 finally remote sensing is low cost compared to the ground measurements and offers a rapid scan of the wp in a rather large extent of area zwart and leclert 2010 in combination with other spatial information it can diagnose the causes of low performance and identify interventions for improving wp since the first applications of remote sensing for agricultural monitoring using the energy balance to estimate evapotranspiration bastiaanssen et al 1998 open source remote sensing products have become more available not only are there various remote sensing products for evapotranspiration in combination with vegetation related products such as leaf area index lai normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and net primary production npp it can also provide spatial and temporal wp estimates however observing the variability of wp on its own does not contribute to improving wp the data has to be translated to actionable information by identifying the causes for the variability this study therefore evaluates how open source spatial data products can be used to identify reasons behind low performances this study developed a standard procedure framework that can be used to utilize open source remote sensing data for identifying reasons behind wp variations 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the bekaa valley was chosen as the case study for developing and testing the diagnostic framework due to the availability and accessibility of both field data and high resolution rs imagery the bekaa valley located in eastern lebanon has a total area of 90 000 ha and is situated between anti lebanon and mount lebanon to the east and west respectively fig 1 the valley has a mediterranean climate with average annual rainfall ranging from 700 mm year 1 in the southern part to 250 mm year 1 in the northern part chalak and sabra 2007 the major crops grown in the valley are wheat early potatoes and vegetables caiserman et al 2019 next to seasonal crops many perennial fruit trees are grown in the bekaa valley including apples grapes citrus cherries almonds apricots peaches plums and pears verner et al 2018 during summer the main cropping season the reference evapotranspiration exceeds the precipitation irrigation supply is therefore essential to meet the evaporative demand of the crops fig 2 a large portion of the irrigation water 72 is supplied from groundwater fao and ihe delft 2019 based on the field survey most of the farmers in the valley use sprinkler irrigation 65 followed by drip irrigation 22 micro sprinklers 6 and furrow irrigation 4 jaafar et al 2017 potatoes and table grapes are grown under full irrigation while supplementary irrigation is practiced for wheat stokvis 2017 this research is carried out on three major crops potatoes wheat and table grapes the bekaa valley is known as the country s food basket and 42 of the total agricultural land is concentrated in the valley verner et al 2018 however insufficient rainfall and its seasonality make water a primary constraint for agricultural production saab et al 2014 therefore improving water productivity is of vital importance in the valley to sustain food production in light of growing water scarcity 2 2 remote sensing data 2 2 1 wapor data fao s portal to monitor water productivity through open access of remotely sensed derived data wapor contains datasets for estimating wp it comes in three levels with different resolutions fao 2018 for the bekaa valley the highest resolution 30 m is available and was used for this study the most recent wapor version 2 1 was accessed through https wapor apps fao org home wapor 2 3 table 1 shows the different wapor datasets used in this study 2 2 2 other remote sensing data data from the landsat 8 and sentinel 2 satellite missions have been acquired this data is used to calculate leaf moisture soil salinity and leaf nitrogen described separately in the later sections on demand surface reflectance landsat 8 data is downloaded from the official united states geological survey usgs website then clouds and shadows were removed using the cloud masking for landsat products plugin in qgis sentinel 2 data was downloaded from theia which had already been atmospherically and slope corrected the clouds and shadows were removed by using the masks already provided with the data soil type data is acquired from soilgrids a global soil properties mapping system that is based on state of the art machine learning methods hengl et al 2017 2 2 3 unit of analysis this study applies the analyses at the crop field level the crop field boundaries polygons are delineated based on a 30 m resolution crop mask obtained from wapor as can be seen from tables 1 and 2 the spatial resolution of the various datasets used varies with wapor and landsat 8 data being available at 30 m resolution sentinel 2 10 20 m while soilgrids data is having a coarser resolution of 250 m while the statistics calculated for crop fields based on sentinel 2 data is not expected to affect the accuracy of the analysis the coarser resolution data from soilgrids could affect the accuracy of the results therefore crop fields laying on multiple soil types were removed from analysis 2 2 4 period of analysis the analyses were implemented for the year 2017 when there was an overlap between the crop type map of wapor available at the time of the study and the sentinel 2b data a comparison was done on the water productivity values from 2015 to 2019 to ensure the selected year was not abnormal 2 3 analytical framework the analytical framework fig 3 applied in this study consist of four steps 1 yield and wp figures for each crop field were calculated using wapor data 2 bright spots well performing crop fields and hot spots poor performing crop fields were identified in the study area 3 based on available wapor and other remote sensing data various indicators were defined to identify factors affecting yield and water productivity 4 finally analyses of wp factors were done between different indicators and the hotspots and the bright spots to diagnose reasons behind yield and wp variations the framework is applied to three main crops in the bekaa valley wheat potatoes and grapes each step is described in detail in the next sections 2 3 1 yield and water productivity estimation the yield and water consumption are calculated for the selected crops using a field boundary map this was obtained for each crop type by polygonising a raster crop type map of the study area for wheat and potatoes the crop type map corresponding to the full canopy cover for each crop for the wheat first decade of march and potatoes last decade of april from wapor were used for the table grapes the crop type mask was provided by alvarez carrion 2018 as wapor crop type map does not differentiate between the table grapes and wine grapes yield and wp are calculated by using wapor data npp and et the above ground biomass production is calculated using eqs 1 and 2 fao 2018 and finally crop yield is calculated by eq 3 mul and bastiaanssen 2019 1 dm p i npp 22 222 n d i 2 agb p s i sos eos dm p i aot 3 y agbp hi c 4 1 m c the dmpi is dry matter production kgdmp ha 1 dekad 1 npp is net primary production gc m 2 day 1 ndi is the number of days in a dekade days and agbps is seasonal above ground biomass production kg ha 1 season 1 from the start of the season sos to the end of the season eos hi is dry basis harvest index fraction and aot is agbp over total biomass production tbp the fraction aot is used in the calculation of agbp if the hi of a crop is calculated as yield to above ground biomass for wheat the hi is calculated as yield to above ground biomass ratio abi saab et al 2019 karam et al 2009 contrary to this hi of potatoes is the ratio of the dry weight of the tubers to the dry weight of the entire plant darwish et al 2006 mazurczyk et al 2009 and hi of grapes is calculated as the marketable yield divided by the total biomass production tbp alvarez carrion 2018 therefore unlike the wheat crop the aot value for potatoes and grapes is 1 00 and can be ignored in agbp s equation thus users must be clear on how the hi is defined in the literature consulted y is yield kg ha 1 season 1 the light use efficiency of c4 crops is about 80 higher than the c3 crops therefore the y of c4 crops is multiplied by a factor of 1 8 mul and bastiaanssen 2019 for c3 crops the factor value is 1 00 and can be ignored in eq 3 the mc is wet weight basis plant moisture content fraction the sos and eos for each crop were identified from the ndvi time series whereas the crop specific parameters were adapted from literature as summarized in table 3 wapor data quality index qi is produced while compositing the ndvi and indicates the gap between the nearest observation date and reconstruction date fao 2018 for the available and reliable observations the reconstruction is not needed and thus the qi is set to zero an ideal condition the ndvi composites are used as inputs to npp and et calculation therefore the qi depicts the quality of npp and et fao 2018 to ensure better accuracy of the data used the npp and et pixels with qi greater than 3 dekades were removed from each image it means that the data constructed based on a gap longer than 30 days in between valid observations is discarded this criterion for qi can adjusted based on the user preferences and local circumstances as this study uses the crop field level as the unit of analysis the average value of all pixels within a crop field is considered for analysis therefore removing low quality pixels did not create data gaps at the field level water productivity is calculated using the following formula chukalla et al 2021 4 wp y e t 1 10 the wp is water productivity kg m 3 y is yield kg ha 1 season 1 and et is seasonal actual evapotranspiration for a specific crop type mm season 1 after the yield and wp maps have been prepared then the crop fields with implausible data were removed by using the following four criteria filter to avoid erroneous conclusions crop fields with a coefficient of variation of wp wpcv greater than 20 with wpcv calculated using the following equation 5 w p cv σ wp w p mean σwp is the standard deviation of wp within the crop field and wpmean is the mean water productivity of a crop field crop fields with an area of less than one hectare crop fields with the yield value higher than the maximum achievable and lower than the minimum recorded based on literature crop fields with an average lcc accuracy of less than 80 fig 4 shows all the selected crop fields after removal of the fields with implausible data for the analysis 2 3 2 identification of bright and hot spots bright spots generally can be defined as the agricultural communities and households which are performing better than their neighbours even with the same social environmental and demographic pressures de vries 2005 on the other hand low performing areas are considered hot spots karimi et al 2019 these bright and hot spots can be used to identify the causes behind what is affecting the performance bright spots can be defined in terms of higher yield e g cai and sharma 2010 in india higher wp or a combination e g alauddin et al 2010 in bangladesh by focusing on wp improvements alone ignores the farmers need to produce crops for food security and income whilst only focusing on yield improvement may affect the sustainability of the basin water resources therefore in this study we focused on identifying bright and hot spots based on both yield and wp there is still a debate as to what level defines better performance for yield licker et al 2010 defined the attainable yield within regions of similar climate at the 90th percentile whereas foley et al 2011 used the 95th percentile for wp alauddin et al 2010 used the top quartile 75th percentile whereas zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 and zwart et al 2010 used the 95th percentile to exclude extremes the selection of the threshold is arbitrary but has a significant effect on the results for example using high threshold values 95th primarily identifies extremes zwart et al 2010 while the focus should be more on values which are attainable under the set conditions i e a lower threshold value for this study we tested threshold values 70th to 95th percentile with 5 percentile intervals and selected the threshold value which provided a sufficiently large number of fields in the bright and hotspots categories exceeding the threshold levels in both yield and wp and significantly large performance gap we therefore used the 80th percentile threshold for both yield and wp to be classified as bright spots while fields below the 20th percentile are categorised as hot spots 2 3 3 defining indicators for wp factors reasons behind yield and wp variations can be diagnosed by analyzing the internal genetic and external environmental factors that affect crop production six wp factors external water stress irrigation heterogeneity salinity stress nitrogen stress and soil type were considered in this study as they can be determined using wapor and other remote sensing data each factor is analyzed by using one or more indicator s to find reasons behind wp variations see fig 5 each indicator is separately discussed in the following sections 2 3 4 water stress water stress is assumed to be linked to leaf water content and plant moisture stress this can be observed using the mid infrared mir carlson et al 1971 thomas et al 1971 tucker 1980 everitt 1986 ripple 1986 and near infrared nir wavelengths hardisky et al 1983 everitt 1986 ceccato et al 2001 rs bands therefore various vegetation indices based on nir are proposed for detecting plant moisture stress we selected the normalized difference moisture index ndmi in this study as it was found to have the highest correlation with leaf and canopy water content r2 0 68 zhang et al 2018 6 ndmi r n r s r n r s rn and rs are reflectances for nir and shortwave infrared swir respectively the index is calculated by using sentinel 2 band 8 a nir and band 11 swir to increase the temporal resolution of data ndmi was also calculated by using similar bands on landsat 8 band 5 nir and band 6 swir images acquired on the same date resulted in highly similar ndmi maps represented by r2 0 98 and mean bias error 0 003 the crop response to water stress was identified from the change in leaf moisture content and corresponding changes in biomass production crop fields identified as bright spots were assumed to have optimal moisture content conditions therefore the average ndmi value of bright spots was considered a benchmark against which the hot spots ndmi value was compared in this way the moisture stress in hotspots was quantified by subtracting the average ndmi of hot spots from the average ndmi of bright spots from sos to the eos the larger difference in ndmi ndmidiff indicates higher stress in hotspots and vice versa similarly the difference in biomass production nppdiff was quantified by subtracting the average npp of hot spots npphs from the average npp of bright spots nppbs the core methodology is to compare ndmidiff with nppdiff to know how crops respond to water stress in terms of changes in biomass production to better understand crop response to water stress the stress sensitivity index ssi was developed in this study the ssi was calculated by dividing the nppdiff of a decade over the corresponding ndmidiff the ssi was calculated for all decades from sos to the eos the ssi time series indicates how biomass production is affected by changes in the moisture stress along the crop growth cycle the crop response to stress is investigated through all phenological stages of each crop type to identify its stress sensitive growth stages for this purpose four general physiological stages introduced by fao initial developing mid and late stage and more crop specific growth stages were adapted from literature 7 ssi np p bs np p hs ndm i bs ndm i hs where ssi is stress sensitivity index ndm i bs is average normalised difference moisture index of bright spots ndm i hs is average normalised difference moisture index of hot spots 2 3 5 irrigation heterogeneity the variability in evapotranspiration et within a crop field is assumed to be related to the heterogeneity in the water application the within field coefficient of variation of et cvet karimi et al 2019 is calculated and correlated with the yield and wp to assess non uniform irrigation practices effect on crop production and water consumption 2 3 6 salinity stress in cases where the salinity stress is coupled with other stresses moisture aeration or diseases bare soil salinity can help identify the impact of soil salt content on crop production al khaier 2003 proposed the normalized difference salinity index ndsi that allows accurate salinity detection r2 0 86 of the bare agricultural soil 8 ndsi r s 1 r s 2 r s 1 r s 2 rs1 and rs2 are reflectances for swir1 band 4 and swir2 band 5 on advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster as aster data is not available currently similar bands of landsat 8 swir1 band 6 and swir2 band 7 are used for ndsi calculation abuelgasim and ammad 2019 have also used landsat 8 data for bare soil salinity detection they have assessed the accuracy of multiple salinity indices of which the nir swir index nsi has the highest accuracy 60 9 nsi r s 1 r s 2 r s 1 nir rs1 rs2 and nir are reflectances for swir1 band 6 swir2 band 7 and nir band 5 on landsat 8 respectively to identify the effect of salinity the ndsi and nsi of each crop field are correlated with their yield and wp figures 2 3 7 nitrogen stress a study by ramoelo and cho 2018 has exposed that the simple ratio of red edge index srre3 based on sentinel 2 data allows an accurate estimate of the leaf nitrogen content represented by r2 of 0 75 and rmse of 0 17 n in this study the srre3 is used for leaf nitrogen estimation 10 s r re 3 r re 3 r re 1 rre1 and rre3 are respectively reflectances for visible red edge vre1 band 5 and vre3 band 7 on sentinel 2 the srre3 values of all identified bright spots were averaged for each decade from sos to the eos to produce their average leaf nitrogen content time series a similar time series for hot spots were also produced then their average leaf nitrogen content time series were compared with each other to know the role of nitrogen application in biomass production 2 3 8 effect of crop rotation on yield and wp crop rotation is the growing of a series of various crop types on the same crop field in successive years or seasons cottren and gryder 2014 for each crop its preceding crop grown on the same field was identified by using wapor lcc of the previous season the crop fields were categorized as rotated and mono cropped for instance if the preceding crop of a wheat field in 2017 was identified as wheat in 2016 then the field was categorized as mono cropped further if multiple crops are grown on the same crop field in 2016 then the area of partial rotation is considered if more than 50 of the crop field area is covered by crops other than wheat in 2016 then the crop field is categorised as rotated otherwise the crop field is mono cropped the yield and wp figures of the two groups rotated and mono cropped fields were tested with the t test to determine the significance of the rotation practices more detailed information about the t test is provided in the section data analysis 2 3 4 2 3 9 effect of soil type on yield and wp the raster layer of soil type soil classes based on united states department of agriculture usda classification map was acquired from soilgrids table 2 the soil information is then extracted to the polygon of each crop field by using the zonal statistic in qgis the yield and wp figures of the crop fields associated with the different soil types were tested with the t test to identify the statistical significance of soil type influence on yield and wp 2 3 10 data analysis various approaches were adapted for analysis based on the data type in this study three kinds of data analysis were performed each is described separately in the below sections 2 3 11 bright and hot spots time series comparison the ndmi npp ssi and srre3 of each crop is changing from time to time during the growth period therefore time series from sos to the eos for these indicators were produced to track their fluctuations along the crop growth cycle to increase the significance of the results average time series were produced for the bright and hot spots categories for example the ndmi time series of all wheat bright spots were averaged into one average wheat bright spot ndmi time series similarly one average wheat hot spot ndmi time series were produced variations in these average time series were analysed to understand various factors affecting crop yield 2 3 12 t test analysis the crop fields can be clustered into a specific number of groups based on their soil type for instance they were grouped as loam and clay loam soils then the yield and wp figures of both groups were tested with the t test to determine whether the difference between the means of the groups is significant or not if the t score exceeds its critical value at p 0 05 then the difference is significant and vice versa a significant difference implies that the factor soil type has affected yield or wp 2 3 13 correlation analysis for the cvet ndsi and nsi all crop fields have a single value for a season therefore their time series cannot be produced besides for these indicators all crop fields have a unique value therefore they cannot be categorised into groups thus cvet ndsi and nsi of the individual crop fields were correlated with their corresponding yield and wp figures correlation evaluates the relationship between two variables quantitatively a higher correlation indicates a stronger relationship between variables whereas a weak correlation implies that the variables are not related to each other 3 results and discussion 3 1 yield and water productivity estimation crop yield and wp maps of each crop type for all crop fields were estimated the summary is presented in table 4 and fig 6 the average estimated wheat yield 3203 kg ha 1 and potatoes yield 31 495 kg ha 1 are quite comparable with the reported wheat yield 3000 kg ha 1 tohmé tawk et al 2019 and potatoes yield 32 533 kg ha 1 awad 2019 in the valley the average grapes yield in lebanon based on faostat 2020 data from 2008 to 2018 is 8741 kg ha 1 whereas the calculated grapes yield in this study is 17 858 kg ha 1 the discrepancy is because the faostat 2020 reports the average yield of both wine and table grapes and this study considers only table grapes also the reported yield is the average value at the country level while the estimated yield value is only for the bekaa valley furthermore the estimated average wp of wheat 0 82 kg m 3 potatoes 8 05 kg m 3 and grapes 2 40 kg m 3 are within their respective global wp ranges 0 62 2 00 kg m 3 foley et al 2019 4 00 11 00 kg m 3 steduto et al 2012 and 1 3 4 5 kg m 3 alvarez carrion 2018 although the yield and wp estimations using the wapor data with the single hi value show a good correlation with figures from the field but the hi should be adjusted upward or downward depending on the timing crop phenological stage and extent of various stresses and sensitivity of the crop to these stresses steduto et al 2012 whereas in this study based on literature one constant hi value is used thus considering the hi dynamics yield estimated by using a single hi value might not depict the real crop yield variations the analyses further presented in the paper reflect the diagnostic analysis for the year 2017 which is an average year of table 4 3 2 identified bright and hot spots table 5 summarises the total number of crop fields and the number of crop fields categorised as bright and hot spots for each crop type the spatial distribution of bright and hot spots of wheat potatoes and grapes is shown in fig 7 an example of a scatter plot of yield versus wp for potatoes with the identified bright and hot spots are shown in fig 8 a single threshold value is used for the entire valley to identify bright and hot spots but the valley has various climatic zones therefore the threshold value might be too high or low for certain areas thus it is recommended to determine and delineate various agro climatic zones and apply separate thresholds to each zone 3 3 analysis of wp factors 3 3 1 water stress fig 9 a shows that before 12th march the wheat nppdiff is marginal even though the ndmidiff around february is very high from the booting stage onward despite a decrease in ndmidiff the nppdiff soars the ssi curve further demonstrates the influence of moisture stress on biomass production fig 9 b the ssi remains close to zero from the initial to the mid of the developing stage start of booting while with the onset of the booting stage the ssi mounts and remains higher till the end of the grain filling stage this indicates that the wheat biomass is more sensitive to moisture stress from the mid developing to grain filling stage zhang and oweis 1999 have also found that wheat sensitivity to water stress in the mediterranean region is higher from the booting stage to grain filling and then reduces at the late stage table 6 biomass loss in the potatoes has occurred from the tuber initiation until maturity fig 9 c at tuber initiation and the start of tuber filling the moisture deficit has a real time effect on biomass production the nppdiff soars as the ndmidiff rises however in the mid tuber filling the decreases in ndmidiff do not affect the gained momentum of the nppdiff curve it is because water deficit during tuber initiation limits the number of tubers formation obidiegwu et al 2015 which reduces biomass accumulation during tuber filling the ssi for the potato crop fig 9 d demonstrates that yield response to stress is peaking in the tuber filling stage and then sharply declines at maturity late stage steduto et al 2012 also reported that the yield response factor ky for potatoes sharply declines from 0 7 in the mid stage to 0 2 in the late stage table 6 the ssi of potatoes remains low from the establishment to mid tuber initiation while table 6 shows a very high potatoes sensitivity to stress at the initial stage at this period the potatoes are not stressed ndmi diff remains almost zero see fig 9 c therefore crop response in terms of yield reduction is not captured thus to better understand crop response to stress at each stage crops should be intentionally stressed at every phenological stage many grape varieties some are listed by leeters 2018 and alvarez carrion 2018 in the valley causes significant heterogeneity in phenological stages and in harvest time within and between the groups bright and hot spots therefore a comparison of ndmi and npp figures does not give sufficient information about the grapes stress response to biomass production this also signifies that the ssi analysis for intercropping leads to erroneous results due to differences in biomass production hi and et of various crops in the same crop field the results show that the changes in ndmi and npp of potatoes are more prominent than in wheat this implies that the potato leaf welt sooner than the wheat in response to the water stress such information can be very useful for choosing stress tolerant cultivars such as wheat in areas where water stress occurs the results also reveal that farmers associated with the hot spots have lost substantial wheat yield during the flowering and grain filling stages and potato yield during the tuber filling stage these growth stages were also identified as the most stress sensitivity periods for their corresponding crops therefore water stress during the most sensitive growth periods is suggested to be prevented this indicates a need for better irrigation scheduling improved moisture conservation or wiser water allocation along the crop growth period 3 3 2 irrigation heterogeneity fig 10 a c show that irrigation heterogeneity cvet negatively correlates with the yield of all three crops whereas cvet does not significantly correlate with the wp this exposes that only the yield of the crops is negatively affected by irrigation heterogeneity this confirms findings by abd el wahed et al 2016 currently 65 of the farmers use sprinkler irrigation systems with only 65 efficiency due to the windy nature of the valley jaafar et al 2017 the reduction in cvet and subsequent increase in the potato yield can be realized by changing the sprinkler irrigation system to the drip irrigation system the farmers who have switched to drip irrigation systems have already increased their potato yield in the valley united states agency for international development usaid 2014 the cvet indicates variations in et which is assumed to be due to irrigation application this could be caused due to variable application of non water inputs and variability in soil properties gil et al 2019 also partial infection of a crop field with diseases could lead to variability in et furthermore a farmer may grow various varieties of the same crop in a field the chances of these contributing factors to variability are higher in the larger crop fields than the smaller therefore the users must be aware of the other potential contributors to cvet to better inform decisions 3 3 3 salinity stress the results in fig 10 d show that salinity has neither affected wheat yield nor wp as represented by a non significant and weak correlation likewise potato wp and yield is not affected by salinity demonstrated by weak correlations fig 10 e fao and international atomic energy agency iaea 2018 also state that the soil salinity of rain fed flood irrigation and alternative drip and sprinkler irrigation practices is very low 0 7 1 7 ds m in the valley however monoculture and localized irrigation practices have increased soil salinity up to 9 ds m at 20 cm soil depth in the northern parts of the valley furthermore the indices used for soil salinity analysis in this study are only capable to detect topsoil salinity based on surface soil reflectance but for irrigated agriculture only topsoil salinity assessment is not sufficient and root zone salinity analysis from where crops take up water is of vital importance therefore it is suggested to complement these results with root zone salinity analysis as recommended by scudiero et al 2016 3 3 4 nitrogen stress fig 11 demonstrates that leaf nitrogen content srre3 of bright spots is higher than the hot spots in all three crop types so farmers associated with bright spots have applied more nitrogen than the hot spot farmers fig 11 a shows that the difference between srre3 of the bright and hot spots of the wheat crop is very small this indicates that wheat bright spot farmers have applied slightly more nitrogen than the hot spots farmers realising that nitrogen treatment has a limited impact on wheat yield karam et al 2009 on the other hand the srre3 of potatoes bright spots is prominently higher than the hot spots this indicates that potatoes bright spot farmers have applied more nitrogen knowing that the potato yield can be significantly improved with increase nitrogen application xing et al 2016 similarly nitrogen doses significantly increase grape yield in the mediterranean climate ozdemir et al 2010 therefore bright spot farmers have applied more nitrogen to obtain better table grapes yield as reflected in fig 11 c the results show that better performers bright spots are associated with higher nitrogen applications however it is difficult to explicitly identify nitrogen contribution to better performance in proportion to other improved irrigation and agronomic practices adapted by the bright spot farmers it is also worth mentioning that the uptake of phosphorous and potassium is also encouraged by nitrogen bloom 2015 hemerly 2016 therefore it is challenging to separate the direct and indirect influence of nitrogen application on crop yield thus further correlation and comparative analysis between crop fields with different nitrogen applications and similar irrigation agronomic practices can improve the results moreover leaf nitrogen content srre3 is calculated as an index for practical purposes the index value has to be translated to the leaf nitrogen in percentage and then related to the applied amount of nitrogen the further suggested study will also help quantify the optimum amount and timing of nitrogen application for each crop 3 3 5 effect of crop rotation on yield and wp table 7 summarizes the t test results for crop rotation influence on yield and wp the results show that the t score for wheat wp 3 48 has exceeded the critical value 1 96 thus rotation has a statistically significant impact on wheat wp while the impact of rotation on wheat yield is not statistically significant the t score 0 73 is lower than the critical value 1 96 however wheat rotated with other crops has resulted in a 55 kg ha 1 increase in yield this means that there is an increase in wheat yield yet not statistically significant as the t test fails the t score for both potatoes wp and yield are lower than the critical value this implies that the crop rotation has neither significantly influenced potatoes yield nor wp even though the results are not statistically significant t tests have not been passed the farmers practising crop rotation harvest 709 kg ha 1 more potatoes than the farmers engaged in mono cropping also wp is slightly higher in the rotated crop fields crop rotation increases crop yield because it improves soil structure and organic matter and controls pests nuñez et al 2019 a study based on the data collected over the 20 years by strauss 2017 has also revealed that wheat mono cropping has the lowest yield than any other wheat crop succession our results also confirm that rotation has increased yield of both wheat and potatoes but not statistically significant an improvement in the methodology might signify the results if the yield figures of fully rotated crop fields are compared with the fully mono cropped field currently partially rotated crop fields are also included in the analysis see section 2 3 3 5 for methodology moreover other factors like irrigation practices and inputs application also affect wp and yield and thus may diminish the influence of crop rotation furthermore in this study the crop rotation analysis is based on only two years of data it can reflect the nutritional enrichment of the soil but not the breaking of the disease cycle for the most appropriate cropping sequences and their impact on yield it is recommended to analyse crop rotation data of four to five years mohler and johnson 2009 3 3 6 effect of soil type on yield and wp according to the usda soil classification nine soil classes were identified in the valley see fig 12 however the figure shows that crops under study wheat potatoes and grapes are grown only on xeralf and xerolls soil classes the number of crop fields distributed over each soil type is presented in fig 13 xeralf and xerolls are respectively loam and clay loam soils based on soil texture triangle the hydrological properties of both soil classes are presented in table 8 to ensure the accuracy of the results crop fields lying partially on both soil types were removed from the analysis thereafter the t tests were conducted to determine the statistical significance of the soil type influence on yield and wp table 9 results show that soil type significantly impacts wheat wp but not wheat yield p 0 05 results also reveal that both yield and wp of potatoes are significantly influenced by soil type although the values are close to the critical threshold for significance soil type is not a statistically significant factor influencing yield and wp for grapes the influence of soil type can be ascribed to its hydrological properties the plant available water paw of the xerolls clay loam soil 200 mm m 1 is higher than the xeralf loam soil 167 mm m 1 new mexico state university 2018 therefore in a water scarce region bekaa valley the potatoes and grapes grown on the xerolls soils have a higher yield than xeralf a proper irrigation scheduling can increase potatoes and grapes yield grown on xeralf soils for this purpose the depth of irrigation is recommended to be reduced and frequency increased as xeralf soils cannot hold a larger quantity of water to support crop water demand for a longer time 3 4 framework limitations the above mentioned research findings with regard to yield and wp figures estimation crop response to water stress variability in et salinity stress nitrogen application and influence of crop rotation and soil type on performances compare well with the available information from the field and knowledge in literature however we acknowledge the limitations of this framework this framework is mainly aimed at crop field level analysis therefore the spatial resolution of the remote sensing data in relation to crop field polygons size is a key consideration concerning the accuracy of results in this study crop fields smaller than one hectare is removed from the analysis based on data with a 30 m resolution for a coarser resolution 250 m soil data analysis the crop fields lying on multiple soil types are not considered for analysis removal of such crop fields from analysis reduces data population and affects the significance of the results therefore users are recommended to consider data with reasonable spatial resolution in relation to crop field size in this study after data cleaning the population of the data remained sufficient for analysis due to a reasonable resolution of the data as compared to the size of crop fields in the valley 4 conclusions to translate open source remote sensing data to actionable information by using a structured approach a diagnostic framework has been developed the realistic estimation of yield and et figures with sufficient spatial resolution to capture crop field level variability enabled crop fields categorisation and their comparative analysis the study revealed that four factors have negatively affected yield and wp in the bekaa valley and they are water stress at the critical crop growth stages low within farm irrigation uniformity low nitrogen application and improper irrigation schedule based on soil properties it was also exposed that mono cropping has reduced yield and wp but the results are not statistically significant whereas topsoil salinity has neither influenced yield nor wp in the valley to improve yield and wp in the valley investments should target the above four factors while we acknowledge the errors and caveats inherent to the use of remote sensing data we are confident that the application of the diagnostic framework provides reliable and useful results since the analyses focus on the comparative analyses and less on the absolute value declaration

9734,water scarcity and saline stress are primary threats for water use and agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions such as the hetao irrigation district china the current study using irrigation with saline water developed through three seasons 2017 2019 of field experimental surveillance of mulched maize water use in two cropped weighing lysimeters measurements included crop characteristics height lai dates of development stages soil and water salinity and daily actual crop evapotranspiration etc act deficit surface irrigation was scheduled in 2017 and 2018 seasons while in 2019 drip irrigation was used aimed at satisfying crop water requirements both approaches aimed at improving irrigation management while controlling impacts of salinity the collected information was used to parameterize and calibrate the soil water balance model simdualkc the model uses the fao56 dual crop coefficient approach and considers the combined effect of water and salinity stresses due to salinity of both soil and irrigation water results show that the simdualkc model adequately simulates the dynamics of the observed etc act throughout the three growing seasons the goodness of fit indicators show highly appropriate model fitting of observed etc act with low rmse of 0 42 mm d 1 for the calibration and 0 53 mm d 1 for validation the calibrated standard basal crop coefficients kcb of maize for the initial mid and end stages were respectively 0 15 1 15 and 0 25 which agree with those recently proposed by pereira et al 2021 due to the impacts of both water and salt stress in 2017 and 2018 etc act was much below the potential value etc ranging 64 83 while in 2019 that percentage increased to 92 due to avoiding water stress by then the average kcb mid act range 0 58 1 06 therefore lower than kcb mid with the lower values occuring in the lysimeter that was irrigated with a large deficit the irrigation scheduling practiced was assessed using water use and productivity indicators which have shown the advantage in using drip irrigation with small time intervals between irrigations moreover the current study and the calibrated model provide for adopting irrigation management practices that may save water and control salinity keywords basal crop coefficient drip irrigation hetao irrigation district salinity stress impacts surface irrigation water stress impacts 1 introduction the influence and management of salinity has been for long a focus of concern in irrigated agriculture minhas 1996 tanji and kielen 2002 hoffman and shalhevet 2007 grattan et al 2012 human induced salinization is one of the most important abiotic stresses to food production affecting millions of hectares fao 2015 mostly in arid and semiarid regions in these regions the scarcity of fresh irrigation water for agriculture is becoming a recurrent major issue pereira 2017 with farmers having many times no alternative but to use saline groundwater drainage water or wastewater in irrigated agriculture rhoades et al 1992 pereira et al 2009 2014 minhas et al 2020 the use of treated wastewater in agriculture has increased in the last decades pereira et al 2009 2014 however attention should be paid to the wastewater salinity because under those conditions aiming at high yields there is the need for blending saline sodic treated wastewater with good quality water and use improved leaching moghbel et al 2017 the use of low quality water in irrigation leads to the reduction of the soil osmotic potential in the rootzone with the increase of the ionic concentration of the soil solution reducing soil water availability and uptake by plants and further reducing yields when no mitigation measures are considered namely leaching water requirements minhas et al 2020 thus it is imperative to adjust water use and management to saline environments and adopt irrigation water saving practices capable of mitigating the deleterious effect of salinity on crop production and the soil itself however the use of water saving technologies with low water quality must be carefully assessed not only in terms of yield but also relative to soil salinization and sodification ayers and westcot 1985 anjum et al 2014 the hetao irrigation district hetao in northern china is facing widespread soil salinization resulting from both the application of excessive irrigation water and due to hydrogeological conditions this situation affects crops and increases groundwater levels that may affect the regime of the yellow river from where irrigation water is derived and to where drainage water is returned moreover when saline water tables become shallower capillary rise add promoting salinity build up in the root zone feng et al 2005 xu et al 2013 tong et al 2015 as a result salt accumulation in the upper layers of farmland soils is nowadays observed over half of the irrigated farmland area 525 000 ha wu et al 2008 yu et al 2010 several measures have been adopted to improve that situation but they have proven to still be insufficient as shown through several monitoring studies e g gao et al 2014 guo et al 2018 ren et al 2019 most water saving measures have mainly focused on improving crop water use e g by optimizing irrigation scheduling and practices pereira et al 2003a 2007 miao et al 2016 bai et al 2017 other adopted water saving irrigation technologies include basin precision land leveling bai et al 2010 miao et al 2015 2018 ridge furrows in level basins dong et al 2018 and the use of straw and plastic film mulching zhao et al 2016 qi et al 2018 dong et al 2018 however often leaching requirements and soil salinity control are not considered surface irrigation is a well adapted irrigation method for hetao because the yellow river water has an extremely high concentration of sediments which is detrimental to sprinkler and drip equipment precise land leveling is then particularly appropriate because it provides for significant reduction of the irrigation advance time and promotes uniformity of infiltration bai et al 2010 2011 miao et al 2015 however farmers commonly prefer the simpler and cheaper traditional land smoothing nevertheless main attention must be paid to salt leaching and drainage gonçalves et al 2007 pereira et al 2007 wang et al 2019 wen et al 2020 the review performed by minhas et al 2020 provided for a thorough description of the available methodologies for controlling salts with adequate irrigation management including a good bibliographic review impacts of decreasing the net water diversion and reducing deep percolation for salt leaching are reported by bai et al 2017 who show that these practices may induce the rise of soil water stress and the decrease of crop et and yield the study by ben gal et al 2008 reported that vegetable yield maximization when using saline irrigation water could be achieved only when an increased leaching is used which may result in an unsustainable practice appropriate irrigation schedules and efficient salt leaching management practices have become a top priority of research in the region irrigation scheduling in saline environments requires the precise quantification of crop water requirements i e the knowledge of the potential crop evapotranspiration etc and the actual crop evapotranspiration etc act as affected by salinity and water stresses these fluxes can be measured in the field using a variety of techniques allen et al 2011a 2011b and pereira et al 2021 revised a variety of approaches and related requirements for accuracy of estimates of the etc act values including i lysimeters ii the use of eddy covariance energy balance systems iii the bowen ratio energy balance iv scintillometers v sap flow methods vi remote sensing techniques and vii the monitoring of changes in soil water content measurements over a period of time lysimeters have been used to obtain accurate information for developing calibrating and validating crop evapotranspiration and crop coefficients for many crops howell et al 1985 pruitt 1991 lópez urrea et al 2020 lysimeters are also a good tool for studying the transport of solutes when saline waters are used and therefore for assessing salinization and alkalization hazards gonçalves et al 2006 three main types of lysimeters are used constant water table lysimeters talebnejad and sepaskhah 2015 drainage lysimeters poss et al 2004 skaggs et al 2006 raij et al 2018 and weighing lysimeters wright 1990 loos et al 2007 bryla et al 2010 evett et al 2012 2016 weighing lysimeters wl are well described and their accurate use is discussed by several authors e g allen and fisher 1990 wright 1990 allen et al 1991b and evett et al 2012 when duly managed weighing lysimeters can provide very accurate estimates of etc act data even for short time periods as 30 min evett et al 2012 further offering a straight forward approach to the determination of the water balance components in the soil plant atmosphere continuum howell et al 1985 zhang et al 1999 their use for evapotranspiration as well as for water and solutes flux studies is often reported in literature relative to their use in china large scale wl are reported as being mainly used to evaluate etc act of various crops and vegetation types assessing groundwater fluxes and performing water balances for most cases the use of models is not considered e g the determination of etc act of humid alpine meadows ecosystems dai et al 2021 cases where specific modelling is used do not report on developing public software but comparing approaches to estimate etc act e g comparing winter wheat wl results with those of the penman monteith combination equation the priestley taylor equation and the fao single kc method liu et al 2020 another example is reported by liu and luo 2010 on evaluating whether or not the fao 56 dual kc approach is suitable for common use however the reported kcb values are much above their upper limit as discussed by pereira et al 2020 a different use was to compare 16 reference et equations with data from grassed wl liu et al 2017a also weighed microlysimeters were used to support developing an et model suitable for evaluation of water use in the xilin river basin yu et al 2021 however none of the reviewed papers were either dealing with salinity nor reported on calibrating and validating a soil water balance swb or fao 56 model with lysimeter data the wl use in other regions similarly to the china studies also primely refers to assess etc act and to estimate the terms of the swb as well as to estimate etc act and crop coefficients one example refers to the use of the crop water solutes mechanistic model root zone water quality model rzwqm2 where the maize potential etc was estimated from either the shuttleworth wallace method or the asce alfalfa reference et multiplied by crop coefficients zhang et al 2018a soldevilla martinez et al 2014 compared two models dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer and wave water and agrochemicals in soil crop and vadose environment for assessing groundwater contribution to etc act luo and sophocleous 2010 reported that the mechanistic flux model hydrus 1d was first calibrated and validated with wl data then performing scenario analysis of groundwater contribution under different water table depths and water input rainfall plus irrigation chen et al 2018 used wl to evaluate improvements in simulating etc act and irrigation amount and frequency another common use of wl is the determination of crop coefficients e g marek et al 2006 bryla et al 2010 and lópez urrea et al 2020 salinity studies using wl are reported by raij et al 2018 referring the use of small size wl to evaluate the effects of drainage different leaching fractions and water uptake reduction due to solute stress the review and discussion by minhas et al 2020 consist of an appropriate complement of the review above the current review shows that the use of wl is common to assess the components of the soil water balance mainly percolation and groundwater contribution but crop water simulation models are unfrequently associated with wl and rarely wl studies are referring to salinity conditions when some kind of association exists then it occurs with mechanistic models and wl data characterizing the simulators of the various swb components e g capillary rise and percolation fluxes in addition of etc act the use of wl for calibrating and validating swb and salinity empirical or semi empirical models was not found in this review although field lysimeters can provide very accurate estimates of etc act and of other components of the soil water balance they are costly labor consuming and difficult to maintain swb models after proper calibration and validation can be a viable alternative also offering the capability of estimating the different components of the soil water balance with high accuracy minhas et al 2020 as reviewed by pereira et al 2020 most swb models follow the fao56 approach allen et al 1998 which adopts a daily stress coefficient ks representing both water and salt stresses to adjust the crop coefficient kc when it is multiplied by the grass reference eto to obtain the etc act values for saline environments etc act ks kc eto this approach is embedded into several models like isareg liu et al 1998 pereira et al 2003b budget raes et al 2006 and mopeco domínguez et al 2011 the same concept is also applied to the dual kc approach kc ks kcb ke with ks used to adjust the basal crop coefficient kcb and estimate the impact of rootzone stressors directly on crop transpiration tc and indirectly on soil evaporation es after partitioning of the etc allen et al 1998 2005 the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012a and the saltmed model ragab 2002 constitute rare examples of models using this precise approach for computing the soil water balance pereira et al 2015a 2020 the dual kc approach is now widely used for estimating etc act of crops grown under different climatic regions and under different management practices e g lópez urrea et al 2009 paço et al 2012 the simdualkc is a soil water balance model using the dual kc approach as defined in fao56 guidelines which description is provided by rosa et al 2012 and examples of application are given by rosa et al 2012b the numerous applications of the model namely those referred bellow show that the model is quite precise in determining basal kc thus in computing transpiration and soil evaporation as well as the other components of the soil water balance it has been selected because authors know about its precision when well calibrated and validated against observations of the soil water and of crop et or crop transpiration examples of application to maize include the north china plain zhao et al 2013 eastern inner mongolia wu et al 2015 and hetao in china miao et al 2016 ran et al 2017 xuan et al 2021 southern brazil martins et al 2013 gonzález et al 2015 ávila et al 2017 uruguay giménez et al 2016 and portugal paredes et al 2014 the model has also been applied for intercropping of wheat maize in hetao miao et al 2016 and potato legume in kenya nyawade et al 2021 tree crops in india peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 italy puig sirera et al 2021 and portugal paço et al 2012 2014 horticultural crops such as potato in italy paredes et al 2018 and zucchini in syria darouich et al 2020 rosa et al 2016 developed and tested a new approach for simdualkc for computing actual transpiration and soil evaporation in maize and sweet sorghum irrigated with saline waters while water balance models such as simdualkc can assess the impact of saline stress conditions on crop et and estimate irrigation needs to develop irrigation schedules there is the need to further consider a leaching fraction lf so that irrigation amounts can be adjusted to help flushing salts away from the rootzone generally the lf is as an input to model simulations for leaching requirements the u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 proposed a solution which presumed the existence of long term steady state conditions and ensured that net downward flow of water through the root zone was the best mode of restraining soil salinity assuming that the absorption of salt by crops can be neglected and crop evapotranspiration is a distillation process without chemical reaction the leaching requirements lr can be calculated ayers and westcot 1985 as 1 lr ec iw 5 ec e ec iw where eciw is the electrical conductivity of the irrigation water and ece is the electrical conductivity of the saturated paste extract of the soil however the use of eq 1 may not be appropriate when the steady state conditions cannot be assumed minhas et al 2020 furthermore the proportion of salt leaching depends on the soil texture in order to minimize the influence of salt during sensitive crop growth stages leaching and crop salt tolerance should maintain synchronization differently the autumn irrigation applied before soil freezing is the method used in north china in addition to leach salts it is used for improving soil structure due to the multiple occurrences of soil freezing and thawing particularly for silty soils and constitutes a soil water reserve for plant use in early spring feng et al 2005 pereira et al 2007 li et al 2012 liu et al 2021 however farmers may use excessive water in the autumn irrigation relative to water saving recommendations currently in place based on accurate estimation of the crop water requirement the current study proposes adopting appropriate irrigation schedules combined with efficient salt leaching management practices the main objectives of this research are 1 to calibrate and validate the simdualkc model with 3 year independent etc act daily measurements in weighing lysimeters performed in plastic mulched soil cultivated with maize under salinity conditions 2 to analyze the simulated daily dynamics of the basal and evaporation coefficients along three maize seasons using basin and drip irrigation 3 assessing the current irrigation schedules in terms of water use and water productivity as previously discussed about wl the novelty of the current study refers to the first time that the model simdualkc is calibrated validated with large scale weighing lysimeter data under saline conditions thus providing for the results of both the model and lysimeter to be extended out of the experimental location since there is a lack of swb model uses that assess salinity impacts on et and transpiration with the fao56 method in hetao and in the upper yellow river basin the adoption of the dual kc method provides for an innovative approach relative to empirical methods and to flux and crop models in addition and in alternative to crop yield models adopting a dual kc method allows using the stewart model modified by paredes et al 2014 which predicts maize yields from seasonal transpiration under salinity conditions thus requiring less parameters to calibrate 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and lysimeters facilities the study was conducted at the shuguang experimental station 40 46 n 107 24 e 1039 6 m located in the hetao irrigation district inner mongolia china along three years 2017 2019 the climate in the region is

2300 mm meteorological data for the study period were collected every 30 min in an automatic meteorological station placed over a well watered clipped grass located at 2 m of the lysimeters facility data included maximum and minimum air temperatures tmax and tmin ºc average and minimum relative humidity rhmax and rhmin number of sunshine hours n h and mean daily wind speed at 2 m height u2 m s 1 these data were used for calculating the daily grass reference evapotranspiration eto mm d 1 with the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 precipitation p mm d 1 was also recorded data were continuously collected from january to december during the three study growing seasons a brief characterization of the weather conditions along the three years is presented in fig 1 with 2017 being the year with higher climatic demand conditions two weighing lysimeters 1 4 m 1 4 m 2 0 m cropped with maize were installed inside an experimental field 8 6 ha distanced 100 m from the field edges and 10 m from each other in such a way that the equilibrium boundary layer of the air could be fully adjusted above lysimeters as recommended by wright 1991 and allen et al 1991a 1991b 2011a 2011b lysimeter walls are metallic wrapped in plastic to reduce their thermal conductance the soil inside lysimeters was similar to that of the surrounding field lysimeters were filled with the same repacked soil monoliths removed during installation a 0 30 m thick filter layer with sand and gravel was placed at lysimeters bottom to enable free drainage the distance between soil surface and lysimeters rims was 5 cm to minimize possible advective effects lysimeters were sustained by a counter weighted platform scale data were recorded every 30 min in a computer and was summed to hourly and daily means the lysimeter mass resolution was 20 g with an accuracy of 0 01 mm of equivalent water depth calibration of the lysimeters followed the procedures described by howell et al 1985 aiming at preventing sources of error in lysimeter measurements in rainy days an automatic movable rainfall shelter was installed to cover lysimeters when any rainfall occurred following the recommendations by allen et al 2011a a quality assessment and control of the etc act measurements in the lysimeter were conducted along the seasons the main physical and hydraulic properties of the soil inside the lysimeters is presented in table 1 the soil texture classified as silty loam classification usda 1987 is relatively homogeneous the particle size distribution was measured with a laser particle size analyzer ms 2000 malvern instruments ltd malvern uk the dry bulk density ρb was obtained by drying three volumetric undisturbed soil samples 100 cm3 at 105 ºc to constant weight soil hydraulic properties were measured also in 100 cm3 undisturbed soil cores with a pressure plate extractor model 1500f1 soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara ca usa the soil water content at field capacity θfc and at wilting point θwp were assumed to correspond to the soil pressure heads values of 10 and 1500 kpa respectively soil water content at saturation θsat was determined from the maximum holding capacity of those soil cores on a volumetric basis 2 2 experimental treatments and field measurements the same crop varieties plant density and management practices such as weeding fertilizing and pesticide application were conducted similarly in both lysimeters and in the surrounding field standard practices proposed to local farmers were adopted maize var ximeng 3358 was grown inside and outside lysimeters so contributing to the one dimensionality of measurements allen et al 1991a and controlling local advection sowing was performed in april may for harvesting by late september the dates of the crop growth stages are presented in table 2 plants were sown with a row spacing of 0 40 m and a distance between plants of 0 27 m thus with a plant density of approximately 92 600 plants ha 1 fig 2 four maize lines were located inside each lysimeter plant rows were covered by transparent polyethylene sheets with 0 20 mm thickness as disposed in fig 2 fertilization was applied in agreement with the results of soil analysis nitrogen application summed 309 kg n ha 1 in each growing season a mixture with urea 75 kg ha 1 and diammonium phosphate 375 kg ha 1 was applied before sowing as base fertilizer the remaining n amount were applied as urea during the first and third irrigation events of the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons in 2019 the remaining n fertilization was applied during the most critical maize growth periods namely the tasseling and filling stages the experimental field was divided into two so that irrigation treatments performed inside lysimeters could be replicated in the areas surrounding each lysimeter during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons irrigation in one of the weighing lysimeters herein denoted as lysimeter a followed the management practices carried out usually by local farmers based upon the water delivery opportunity imposed by the water conveyance service in the other lysimeter here denoted as lysimeter b irrigation schedules were based upon the increasing water demand by other sectors and forecasted constraints on water delivery thus a reduction in 30 of the irrigation depths applied in the lysimeter a were set a total of 336 and 236 mm were applied in each growing season in lysimeters a and b respectively which were distributed through 4 irrigation events with irrigation depths ranging from 72 to 100 mm per event table 3 differently by 2019 due to the high impact of the previous established irrigation schedules on maize yield irrigation schedules were targeted to replace the crop water consumption in addition it was also taken into consideration that water saving technologies being implemented in hetao include the adoption of drip irrigation drip irrigation was provided by manually opening the system early in the morning whenever targeted thresholds were observed consequently lysimeter a was irrigated every time that the cumulated crop evapotranspiration reached 20 mm and lysimeter b was irrigated with a three day interval with a water depth corresponding to the sum of crop evapotranspiration during those three days irrigation depths ranged then from 11 mm to 26 mm per event a total of 573 and 568 mm were applied respectively in lysimeters a and b during that growing season aiming at controlling soil salinity an autumn irrigation event of 200 mm was performed every year tables 3 and 4 water was applied by flooding in addition a pre sowing irrigation event was also carried out every year to ensure good emergence of maize a total of 45 50 and 50 mm were applied 5 days before the 2017 2018 and 2019 sowing dates respectively irrigation water was pumped from the groundwater and conveyed to each lysimeter and surrounding field by a pvc pipe irrigation depths were measured manually using water meters the average electrical conductivity eciw of the water pumped from the groundwater was 1 85 1 75 and 1 90 ds m 1 respectively in 2017 2018 and 2019 which correspond to high salinity risk waters for irrigating maize according to the u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 guidelines measurements were taken before each irrigation event with those values constituting the respective averages in addition to continuous measurement of lysimeters mass disturbed soil samples were collected from the areas surrounding each weighing lysimeters and used to determine the electrical conductivity of the 1 5 soil water extract ec1 5 ds m 1 for the 0 1 m soil layer these values were then converted into electrical conductivity of the saturation paste extract ece ds m 1 following slavich and petterson s 1993 approach 2 ec e f ec 1 5 with 3 f 2 46 3 03 ρ b θ s at where ρb is sol bulk density g cm 3 and θsat cm3 cm 3 is soil water content at saturation crop height h and leaf area index lai were monitored in 9 randomly distributed plants in each lysimeter at a 10 days interval using a non destructive method to avoid removing plants from the lysimeters the length l mm and width w mm of all leaves of 9 plants were measured using a ruler and converted to lai using the relationship proposed by montgomery 1911 4 lai 0 75 i n l w the multiplier may vary with the variety development stage and agronomic practices elings 2000 nevertheless similar procedures are commonly used e g mananze et al 2018 table 4 presents the measured h while table 5 lists the lai and the estimated fc values along each crop season a non destructive method was used to monitoring the maize root depth zr m by collecting soil samples in the adjacent areas where experimental conditions were consistent with those in the lysimeters soil samples were taken with an auger down to a depth of 1 0 m at 5 randomly distributed locations at the end of each crop season root depth was then determined by visual analysis of the soil samples according to these observations maize roots were mainly concentrated in the 0 0 4 m layer with the finer roots extending down to 0 8 1 0 m depth the maize yield was assessed by harvesting the entire lysimeter and adjusting the observed values taking into consideration the yield harvested in the surrounding field 2 3 modelling approach 2 3 1 model description the simdualkc computes the daily soil water balance as follows allen et al 1998 rosa et al 2012a 5 d r i d r i 1 p ro i i i cr i et c act i dp i where dr is the root zone depletion mm p is the precipitation mm ro is the surface runoff mm i is the net irrigation mm cr is the capillary rise from the groundwater table mm etc act is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm and dp is the deep percolation from the root zone mm all referring to days i or i 1 in this study p was null because lysimeters were under a rain shelter ro was neglected since the size of lysimeters is small and the soil surface was flat cr was null because no water table was maintained in the lysimeters the simdualkc model adopts the dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 2005 minhas et al 2020 for estimating crop evapotranspiration etc by separately computing its individual components crop transpiration tc and soil evaporation es as follows 6 t c k cb et o 7 e s k e et o where kcb is the is the basal crop coefficient ke is the evaporation coefficient and eto is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm under water and or salt stress conditions tc is not maintained at its potential rate thus there is the need for using a stress coefficient ks 8 t c act k s k cb et o k cb a ct et o where tc act is the actual crop transpiration mm and kcb act represents the actual basal crop coefficient ks ranges from 0 0 to 1 0 with the latter representing non stress conditions under both saline and water stress conditions the ks coefficient is computed as pereira et al 2007 rosa et al 2016 minhas et al 2020 9 k s

describes the relationship between the relative yield decrease with the relative evapotranspiration deficit stewart et al 1977 doorenbos and kassam 1979 tables containing updated values for the parameters of eq 9 are presented by minhas et al 2020 the first term on the right side of eq 9 represents the water matric stress when dr i rawsalt and is computed daily through the water balance of the entire root zone the second term is used to correct the former for the effects of salinity osmotic stress i e when ece ece threshold relative to the considered crop in this approach following rosa

al 1998 2005 thus 15 k r 1 f o r d e i 1 r e w 16 k r tew d e i 1 tew rew for d e i 1 rew where tew is the maximum depth of water that can be evaporated from the evaporation soil layer when it has been completely wetted mm rew is the depth of water that can be easily evaporated without water availability restrictions mm and de is the evaporation layer depletion at the end of day i 1 mm de is computed through a daily water balance of the evaporation soil layer with the evaporation decreasing beyond rew as the evaporable soil water decreases in the evaporation soil layer few depends upon the fraction of ground covered by the crop fc 17 f ew min 1 f c f w where fw is the fraction of the soil surface wetted by irrigation the fc value for different crop stages can be inserted directly or computed from lai and crop height h allen and pereira 2009 as follows 18 f c 1 e 0 7 lai 1 h when the soil surface is covered by plastic mulch the fc values may increase as follows 19 f c max f c f r mulch where fr mulch is the fraction of soil covered by the plastic sheet or the organic mulch rosa et al 2012a thus in the simdualkc model the use of mulching leads to a reduction of few which then constrains the kc max by limiting the evaporation component adjustments on the mulch conditions along the season may be performed particularly in terms of the materials deterioration further information on the computational approach used for estimation of the effects of mulch in soil evaporation is provided in rosa et al 2012a and application examples relative to organic and plastic mulch are given respectively in martins et al 2013 and zhang et al 2018b the usability of equations described above eqs 5 to 19 is demonstrated in the studies cited in the introduction section 2 3 2 model

salinity data ece values specified for different dates along the crop growing season table 5 and the ece threshold ds m 1 and b ds m 1 parameters characterizing maize tolerance to salinity these parameters are available from maas and hoffman 1977 ayers and westcot 1985 allen et al 1998 and minhas et al 2020 non observed crop parameters values used to initialize the model were based upon allen et al 1998 and the dp parameters were set according to the soil hydraulic characteristics table 1 2 3 3 model calibration validation the simdualkc model was calibrated by adjusting non observed model parameters one at a time within reasonable ranges of values using a trial and error procedure until deviations between observed crop evapotranspiration etc act obs and model predictions of etc act were minimized data collected in lysimeter a in the 2017 growing season was used for this purpose the calibrated parameters corresponded to i the kcb and p values relative to the initial mid and end season crop stages and ii the depth of the evaporative soil layer ze the initial values used for the soil evaporation parameters tew and rew the parameters related to the deep percolation function ad and bd and the salinity parameters ece threshold and b were also assessed during calibration they were found to provide good results and therefore were not modified the calibrated model parameters were validated using independent data sets corresponding to etc act obs measured in lysimeter a during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons and in lysimeter b during the three year period 2017 2019 following pereira et al 2015b it was considered that model performance was acceptable when the goodness of fit indicators relative to the validation were within a range of 20 variation relative to calibration model performance during calibration validation was first assessed through visual analysis of the simulated vs measured crop evapotranspiration values which allowed a fairly perception of trends or bias in modelling when they occurred as commonly used in other applications pereira et al 2015b the following goodness of fit indicators were used a the regression coefficient b0 describing a linear regression forced through the origin eisenhauer 2003 between measured etc act obs and model simulated crop evapotranspiration etc act values 20 b 0 i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i 2 where oi and pi i 1 2 n represent the measured and model simulated values targeted b0 values are close to 1 0 because then the estimated values are statistically close to the measured ones b0 1 suggest an overestimation bias while b0 1 an underestimation bias b the coefficient of determination r2 of the ordinary least squares regression estimated as 21 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 0 5 i 1 n p i p 2 0 5 2 where o and p are the observed and predicted etc act mean values and n is the number of observations r2 values close to 1 0 show that most of the variance of the measured values is well explained by model simulations r2 values above 0 50 are generally considered acceptable moriasi et al 2007 c the root mean square error rmse mm which describes the variance of the residual errors 22 rmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n 0 5 rmse values vary between 0 0 and a positive value and the target is a much smaller value than the mean of observations d the average absolute error aae mm d 1 in alternative

ratio between rmse and the mean of observations o consists of a non dimensional measure of the relative error of estimate computed as follows 24 nrmse 100 rmse o nrmse values vary between the optimum

indicator proposed by nash and sutcliffe 1970 used to assess the magnitude of the mean square error mse rmse2 relative to the observed data variance legates and mccabe jr 1999 26 ef 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 the optimal value for ef is 1 0 then indicating that the variance of residuals is much small than the variance of observations contrarily when the ef value is close to 0 0 or negative then ef indicates that the variance of residuals is similar or larger than the variance of observations 2 4 assessment of experimental irrigation schedules several water productivity wp kg m 3 indicators are used to assess the various irrigation schedules practiced along the experimental years wp is defined as the ratio between the actual crop yield achieved ya kg and the corresponding water use however it may refer to the total water use twu to the irrigation water use iwu to the consumptive use etc act or just to crop transpiration tc act all expressed in m3 pereira et al 2012 2020 thus the various wp indicators are defined as 27 wp total y a twu y a p cr δ sw i 28 wp irrig y a iwu 29 wp et y a et c act 30 wp tc y a t c act where ya is the actual harvestable yield kg p is rainfall cr is capillary rise or groundwater contribution δsw is the variation in soil water storage in the root zone i is the amount of irrigation etc act is the actual crop evapotranspiration and tc act is the actual crop transpiration all expressed in m3 ya values were those observed in the lysimeters after adjustment using the surrounding fields yields etc act and tc act were estimated using the simdualkc model after proper calibration 3 results and discussion 3 1 field experiments the results of monitoring salinity in the soil along the three irrigation seasons are presented in table 5 for all surveyed dates ece 1 7 ds m 1 which is commonly considered as the ece threshold for maize ayers and westcot 1985 minhas et al 2020 higher ece values were observed in 2017 slightly decreasing for 2018 and 2019 which is likely related with the leaching effects for most dates the ece values are higher in lysimeter b which was irrigated with larger deficit than lysimeter a thus indicating that deficit irrigation for maize is less adequate under saline conditions an economic evaluation is advisable to assess the viability of deficit irrigation under saline conditions the scheduled 3 days interval between irrigation events lysimeter b set in 2019 showed to be the most adequate schedule under saline conditions resulting in the lower ece values despite the irrigation water had the highest observed eciw likely this behaviour results from the large number of irrigation events associated with drip irrigation which favoured salts leaching from the root zone as a result of the salinity levels reported in table 5 and the deficit irrigation scheduled adopted the maize crop development expressed in terms of crop height and lai tables 6 and 7 was constraint by water and salts stress this is particularly evident in case of lysimeter b where a higher deficit irrigation was imposed along both 2017 and 2018 season the impacts of the salinity and water stress were large in terms of final grain yield in 2017 the maize yield under the farmers schedule lysimeter a was 13 322 kg ha 1 while lysimeter b under higher water stress yielded only 9546 kg ha 1 in 2018 yields slightly increased in both lysimeters to 14 163 kg ha 1 and 10 826 kg ha 1 respectively but the differences between both lysimeters is similar differently maize yield in 2019 was much large respectively 17 893 kg ha 1 and 17 405 kg ha 1 due to much frequent applications with drip irrigation either when irrigation was set to replace every 20 mm of water used etc or when a 3 day interval between irrigation events was adopted likely the small and frequent applications played a major role when compared with the large and infrequent applications with flooding similar yields were reported by liu et al 2017b for maize cropped under similar saline conditions in hetao the dynamics relative to the maize etc act measured in lysimeters with a 30 minutes time step and cumulated to daily values along the 2017 2019 growing seasons are presented in fig 3 results show that etc act values were relatively high during the initial stage 2 6 mm d 1 with high evaporation rates resulting from the combined effect of high surface soil moisture and high energy available at the soil surface in fact during the initial stage table 2 etc act mainly depends on soil evaporation which was favoured by the pre sowing irrigation events with depths from 45 to 50 mm that increased soil moisture in the top soil thus promoting soil evaporation etc act progressively decreased later when the soil dried out and was progressively covered by the crop that decrease in es was associated with a progressive increase in crop transpiration with tc act becoming the main part of etc act by the mid season from mid july to early september etc act attained maximum values close to 8 mm d 1 when there was enough water in the soil and tc act was maintained relatively high until senescence depending on atmospheric conditions and irrigation events in 2017 and 2018 with high intervals between irrigation events etc act values always increased to a maximum immediately after irrigation but soon dropped to a minimum due to depletion of soil moisture in the upper soil layer because lysimeter b received 30 less water than lysimeter a the et reduction was there more pronounced in 2019 when irrigation was frequent in both lysimeters higher et rates occurred throughout the mid season with variations mostly related to weather variability during crop senescence period there was a progressive reduction of etc act in both lysimeters due to transpiration decreasing and soil evaporation also decreasing due to reduced water in the soil top layer 3 2 model calibration and validation the first step to adequately simulate the actual crop etc act was to parameterize the simdualkc model by inputting the non observed parameters kcb p ze tew rew ad bd as referred in the set up section 2 3 2 the default and calibrated model parameters are presented in table 8 they consist of the calibrated standard potential kcb values which correspond to pristine cropping conditions i e without water or salinity stresses and under optimal agronomic conditions the standard kcb for the initial mid season and end season crop stages were 0 15 1 15 and 0 25 respectively these kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end values matched the standard values for maize proposed by allen et al 1998 and in the recent review by pereira et al 2021 however the kcb end value depends on the crop management and has lower values when maize grain is harvested with low moisture as for the current study the pini and pmid values were not changed from those proposed by allen et al 1998 and pereira et al 2021 but the pend value was set to 0 80 table 8 thus matching the late season value adopted by miao et al 2016 and rosa et al 2016 that high value pend 0 80 is due to assuming that water stress during the late season stage is adequate when low grain moisture at harvest is considered and a long late season occurs no adjustments were made to the default salinity parameters ece threshold and b proposed by minhas et al 2020 nor to the dp parameters ad and bd proposed by liu et al 2006 finally ze was slightly increased from the default value due to the high silt content observed in the soil profile when compared with tabled values by allen et al 1998 results in fig 3 show that after appropriate calibration the simdualkc model adequately simulated the dynamics of the daily etc act in both lysimeters and throughout the three crop growth seasons the goodness of fit indicators relative to the model calibration and validation are presented in table 9 whose results confirmed the good accuracy of the simdualkc in predicting etc act for the calibration set b0 0 99 indicates no trends for under or over estimation tendency and that the estimated etc act values were statistically close to the measured ones associated with a b0 close to 1 0 pbias is quite low 2 5 r2 0 96 indicates that most of the observed variance could be explained by the model the errors of estimates are quite small rmse is 0 42 mm d 1 and nrmse is approximately 12 finally the ef value 0 95 is very high indicating that the variance of residuals is much lower than the variance of the measured data similar results were obtained for the five validation sets the values for b0 ranged 0 96 1 01 so close to the target and pbias values are also small from 6 2 to 0 8 i e no trend exists for under or over estimation r2 values range 0 90 0 96 thus close to the value obtained for the calibration estimation errors were low with rmse ranging from 0 51 to 0 54 mm d 1 and nrmse ranging from 12 4 to 19 8 ef results are high ef 0 87 confirming that the variance of residuals is much lower than the variance of measured data results therefore show that the simdualkc model fitted well the dynamics of maize etc act cropped in a plastic mulched maize irrigated with saline waters results of the present study for fitting etc act are similar or better than those reported in literature for maize cropped in a plastic mulched soil and using the simdualkc model ding et al 2013 using a modification of the fao56 dual kc model reported rmse 0 48 mm d 1 ran et al 2017 reported rmse values from 0 70 mm d 1 to 0 98 mm d 1 when predicting et other studies performed with maize without plastic mulch include zhang et al 2013 that reported rmse ranging 0 43 0 60 mm d 1 higher rmse values ranging from 0 80 mm d 1 to 0 84 mm d 1 were reported by jiang et al 2014 when using the fao56 approach to estimate maize et chen et al 2021 using the bsw soil water balance model for estimating crop etc act of maize cropped with plastic mulch reported mean absolute errors ranging 9 16 9 which are comparable with the nrmse values of the current study based on these results the current application of the simdualkc model can be considered as an adequate tool to estimate maize etc act rates in a plastic mulched maize in a saline environment thus able to support improving irrigation scheduling and salinity control as aimed for the hetao irrigated region 3 3 crop coefficients the fao56 allen et al 1998 segmented kcb curve and the daily dynamics relative to actual kc kcb and ke coefficients in both weighing lysimeters along the three crop seasons are presented in fig 4 the observed kc act kc act obs derived from the ratio between the lysimeter etc act to eto is also depicted there as expected from the previous results fig 3 and table 9 the dynamics of kc act match well those of kc act obs as discussed by pereira et al 2021 under arid conditions like those prevailing in hetao daily kc values may approach 1 30 for a tall and dense crop as it is the case of maize to note that this condition occurred for a few days by 2019 when kc act obs was higher than the upper limit 1 30 in only 3 days the computed standard kcb for the initial mid season and end season crop stages are 0 15 1 15 and 0 25 as shown in table 5 ece values measured in the soil layer of 1 0 m depth during the three crop seasons were always above the ece threshold for maize 1 7 ds m 1 ayers and westcot 1985 minhas et al 2020 as a result the kcb act curves departed from the potential kcb curves in both lysimeters and along the three crop seasons thus reflecting the impact of both salinity and water stresses on reducing transpiration rates relative to their potential values the peaks of kcb mid act in 2017 and 2018 fig 4 are below the kcb mid horizontal line which is due to the effect of saline stress which impedes maize to attain the potential etc the fall of kcb mid act a few days after those peaks are due to water stress differently in 2019 there is no evidence of water stress but only salinity stress therefore this fig 4 shows that the traditional irrigation schedules adopted in lysimeter a in 2017 and 2018 were never able to prevent the occurrence of water and salinity stresses obviously with 30 less water applied the combined effect of both stresses was more severe in lysimeter b the large irrigation depths and intervals between application events to both lysimeters were not sufficient to meet crop water requirements and to leach salts i e those schedules revealed inadequate for a sustainable irrigation in that saline environment during the 2019 growing season when the irrigation in both lysimeters followed the crop water demand maize was not affected by water stress however salinity stress occurred from sowing to harvest in both lysimeters thus the actual kcb mid is about 10 50 smaller than the standard kcb mid with kcb mid act 0 58 1 06 with 0 58 due to combined effects of deficit irrigation salinity and plastic mulch and 1 06 relative to effects of salinity and plastic mulch the plastic mulch helped to reduce soil evaporation and therefore ke values along every maize crop seasons the ke values were always higher at sowing due to the capillary rise favoured by the pre season irrigation events fig 4 thus explaining the higher et rates measured during those periods fig 3 ke values decreased during the following days as the soil dried out also reducing et rates in 2017 and 2018 the ke peaks were coincident with the irrigation events decreasing later to nearly zero since the evaporation from the soil is then decreasing to nearly dry out the evaporation layer of the soil in 2019 season the higher irrigation frequency supported maintaining ke values almost constant along the mid season in both lysimeters differently during the late season due to senescence of leaves transpiration and ground cover reduced thus ke increased because more energy becomes available at the soil surface 3 4 soil water balance components and et partitioning the soil water balance terms for both lysimeters during the three experimental years are presented in table 10 because a rain shelter was used during the maize growing season the water input by precipitation only occurred during the non growing season the fallow period i e from harvesting to sowing the next crop then representing a very low portion of the crop total water use twu p i δsw ranging from 2 5 to 6 2 irrigation was mostly applied during the growing season and represented 50 70 of the total water applied the higher climatic demand condition prevailing by 2017 lead to the highest twu despite the deficit irrigation was practiced by then in lysimeter a the second highest twu was observed in 2019 which corresponds to the lower climatic demand conditions because irrigation was then scheduled for fully satisfying crop water requirements deep percolation dp mainly resulted from the application of the pre irrigation ranging from 5 7 to 9 3 of the sum of precipitation and irrigation depths applied during the non growing season as previously discussed the pre irrigation revealed to be very important to control salt accumulation in the soil table 5 the total etc act values varied from 479 to 673 mm mostly referring to the growing season representing 75 85 of the total etc act the results relative to the estimated etc act along the non growing and the growing season for all studied years and its partitioning are presented in table 11 results show that total tc act ranged from 373 to 541 mm with only a residual amount of tc act during the non growing season that portion mainly consists of the residual diffusive evaporation component supplied by the soil water below the dry soil surface analyzing the tc act results along the three growing seasons they show low tc act values during the initial and late season stages and the highest tc act by the mid season stage when maize is fully developed the ratio tc act tc was lower than the unit in all experimental years due to the impacts of water and salinity stresses table 11 during 2017 both lysimeters showed a reduction of the transpiration rates relative to their potential value of 17 and 34 approximately due to high water and salinity stresses fig 4 the effect of stressors on root water uptake was attenuated by irrigation but the timing and frequency of irrigation events were never adequate for maize to reach its potential tc and maximize crop yields likewise the combined effect of both stressors led to a 20 and 36 reduction of tc values in lysimeters a and b in 2018 contrarily in 2019 fig 4 and table 11 with the increase of irrigation frequency and non limiting applied depths aimed at fulfilling crop water requirements crop transpiration was only affected by soil salinity with the ece measured in both lysimeters ranging from 2 38 to 2 60 ds m 1 with tc act reduced by about 8 relative to tc values es was high during the non growing season when the soil surface was not covered with plastic mulch contrarily due to mulch during the growing season es values were generally low varying from 10 to 47 mm the higher values correspond to 2019 when a large number of irrigation events contributed to es as expected tc act was the main et component during the growing season while es was the main one during the non growing season the limited es contribution to etc act along the initial and development stages was due to using the plastic mulch to control soil evaporation 3 5 assessing the irrigation schedules using water productivity indicators the irrigation scheduling used along the three experimental years were assessed using the water productivity wp indicators eqs 27 to 30 all indicators were estimated using the observed yield and considering both the non growing and the growing season soil water inputs and outputs tables 10 and 11 i e taking in account the autumn and pre sowing irrigations which contributed to both salts leaching soil water storage and use by the crop as well as improving soil structure through the freeze thaw processes li et al 2012 liu et al 2021 and also plays a major role of controlling the groundwater depth unfortunately the majority of studies relative to north china do not include the autumn and pre sowing irrigations as part of the total water use twu or the irrigation water use iwu but these irrigations likely are the for base success of agricultural production in that vast region as reported by ren et al 2018 those two irrigations accounted for more than 50 of annual water diversion from the yellow river which justifies the need for a further in depth optimization study results show that three of the wp indicators so excepting wpirrig have a similar behavior with higher values for the 2019 irrigation schedules table 12 when the highest yields were achieved about 17 900 kg ha 1 however using also the highest twu likewise etc act and tc act were then the largest in both lysimeters wptotal ranged between 1 85 and 2 52 kg m 3 with the lowest value referring to the schedule that led to the highest irrigation deficit which caused the largest water and salinity stresses tables 5 and 11 fig 4 and the smallest yield table 12 wptotal is reported in only one study performed with maize and cropped under saline conditions murad et al 2018 wptotal ranged 1 82 3 02 kg m 3 which are in the range of the current study relative to maize cropped under no saline conditions table 13 reported wptotal values ranged 1 36 2 69 kg m 3 in various studies performed in portugal rodrigues et al 2013 paredes et al 2014 ramos et al 2017 and in china yufeng et al 2021 the latter showing much higher values 3 20 5 80 kg m 3 likely because the non growing season autumn irrigation was not considered wptotal is not commonly found in literature because most authors use wpirrig or to wpet because season iwu and et are easily estimated the wpirrig values ranged from 1 98 to 2 42 kg m 3 table 12 results show that the highest iwu was observed by 2019 when the irrigation schedules were set for no water stress adopting frequent and small water applications to replace around 20 mm of depleted water it happens that iwu and therefore wpirrig values vary much with the climatic demand conditions and mostly with the amount of rainfall available during the crop season thus that indicator should only be used in comparative studies if performed in similar climates to our knowledge no study available in literature took into consideration the autumn irrigation despite as previously commented its common use for salts leaching and soil structure improvement much higher wpirrig values were reported in hetao irrigation district under saline conditions by liu et al 2017b for maize cropped under saline conditions ranging from 4 95 to 8 74 kg m 3 because despite similar yields 14220 17821 kg ha 1 were reported the seasonal irrigation depth applied was low from 186 mm to 357 mm likely due to non accounted groundwater contribution and the autumn irrigation feng et al 2017 relative to hetao reported for maize cropped under salinity conditions wpirrig values comparable with those of the current study ranging 1 73 2 57 kg m 3 but values were computed disregarding non growing season irrigation and achieving much lower yields 5 53 8 21 t ha 1 xue et al 2020 for a maize study performed for the jiefangzha sub district of hetao reported wpirrig values ranging 0 47 4 65 kg m 3 other studies performed for salinity conditions table 13 also report a very wide range of wpirrig values 1 16 4 78 kg m 3 for non saline conditions wpirrig values are in a much wide range from 0 59 to 17 14 kg m 3 fan et al 2014 yan et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 likely due to differences in climate among sites mainly due to precipitation as referred above the wpet values on the current study ranged 1 92 2 67 kg m 3 table 12 with the lowest values observed for severe deficit irrigation schedules these wpet values are comparable with others reported in studies performed with maize cropped under saline conditions 0 66 5 31 kg m 3 as referred before and shown in table 13 these broad ranges of wpet values table 13 likely result from the varied conditions prevailing in respective studies e g plant density irrigation method climate irrigation schedules that variability is well shown by bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 when using the watpro model at the global scale where the average wpet is 2 25 0 94 wptc in the current study ranged from 2 56 to 3 34 kg m 3 where the highest value refers to the largest ya table 12 only a study on maize cropped under saline conditions reported on wptc table 13 it is the case of the study by rosa et al 2016 reporting on the impacts of diverse saline conditions on maize et which show a much lower wptc 1 78 2 11 kg m 3 resulting from lower yields and higher climatic demand conditions thus with higher tc act values 420 636 mm results show that all but wpirrig are appropriate to be used as comparators while wpirrig is adequate for the use of both irrigation water and energy savings however it should be used together with the other wp indicators particularly those that refer to the impacts of the diverse practices on farmers income which appropriately describe the farming performance rodrigues et al 2013 paredes et al 2014 darouich et al 2017 further studies are required to assess the impact of all practices on both an environmental and economic perspective 4 conclusions the experimental data collected in two weighing lysimeters along 2017 2019 allowed to successfully calibrate and validate the water balance simdualkc model for maize cropped under diverse water and salinity levels estimation errors are quite small with nrmse 20 and rmse ranging from 0 42 to 0 55 mm d 1 the model performance confirmed the appropriateness of the simdualkc model for estimating maize et under various water and salinity conditions and therefore supporting the quality of the water balance data the calibration of simdualkc provided for deriving the standard basal crop coefficient values which agree with those tabulated in fao56 allen et al 1998 and in the updated review by pereira et al 2021 resulting standard kcb at the initial mid and end season stages are respectively 0 15 1 15 and 0 20 simulations with the six sets of lysimeter et data provided for computing the actual kcb act and ke data as well as the actual soil water balance terms the actual kcb at the mid season stage varies 0 58 1 06 thus about 10 50 lower than the standard kcb mid 1 15 it results that when planning irrigation a reduced kcb mid 1 00 should be used when both water and salinity stresses occur and 1 06 if water stress is avoided to be noted that those kcb values correspond to the condition of adopting the autumn irrigation for leaching salts out before the growing season the methodology proposed by fao56 and minhas et al 2020 for computing the stress coefficient ks to be applied to compute kcb act under salinity conditions was well tested moreover the calibration and validation of the simdualkc model also confirmed the fao56 dual kc approach when considering impacts of plastic mulch on soil evaporation these results do not oppose to the continuity of studies on plastic mulch effects presently carried out in china which require focusing on the interaction between evaporation and kc or kcb autumn irrigation is a common practice in north china particularly in hetao it refers to large amounts of irrigation water aiming at salt leaching improving the structure of the silty soils through the freeze thaw process and augmenting soil water storage considering its great importance its volume is presently included as part of the total irrigation volume when performing the soil water balance of the lysimeters so relative to the non growing period i e the autumn and pre sowing irrigations shall be included in the total irrigation applied otherwise actual kcb and wp values would be smaller than those computed herein it results that the current study used much more water that customary reported studies in the area which do not consider those irrigations but rarely in the same line the results relative to the surveillance of the soil ece confirmed the adequateness of the irrigations during the non growing period to control salt accumulation in the soil results of modelling and partitioning etc act showed that soil evaporation was the main et component during the initial period while during the crop development mid and late season es was residual es etc act 2 8 due to effects of both the crop shadow and the plastic mulch covering the soil surface as well as the lack of precipitation however due to the plastic degradation its effect on es reduction decreases with time particularly in the late season the higher irrigation frequency adopted during 2019 led to a larger es when compared with the other two experimental years i e 8 vs 4 season average the transpiration ratio tc act tc was always 1 0 due to water and salinity stress in 2017 and 2018 when deficit basin irrigation was adopted so resulting that the ratio tc act tc was low ranging 51 76 results for 2019 were different with tc act tc of 91 and 92 since irrigation strategies were replacing crop water consumption relative to every 3 day interval or when cumulated etc 20 mm thus aiming at avoiding water stress salinity stress could not be avoided but just insufficiently controlled nevertheless frequent water applications may increase es the irrigation schedules were assessed using the wp indicators results revealed that all wp indicators except wpirrig follow a similar tendency with the highest wp value obtained for the drip schedule with many irrigation events and larger yield as tested for drip irrigation in 2019 however drip irrigation is expensive requires a distribution network different of that for surface irrigation and needs desilting the yellow river water used for irrigation moreover because farmers know well surface irrigation but not drip it is required advising farmers relative to control water volumes applied and or on using both surface and sub surface drip to cope with salinity and to enhance yields as well as to impose water stress only during periods when impacts on maize yields can be minimized then water deficit should be avoided during flowering and yield formation and the grain filling periods in addition it is advisable to use a kcb mid act instead of the standard value since that value adjusted to the climate corresponds to the maximum usable value in presence of salt stress and of the plastic mulch water managers should therefore be aware of these limitations when managing water deliveries to farmers thus extension teams should be appropriately trained since aimed water

9734,water scarcity and saline stress are primary threats for water use and agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions such as the hetao irrigation district china the current study using irrigation with saline water developed through three seasons 2017 2019 of field experimental surveillance of mulched maize water use in two cropped weighing lysimeters measurements included crop characteristics height lai dates of development stages soil and water salinity and daily actual crop evapotranspiration etc act deficit surface irrigation was scheduled in 2017 and 2018 seasons while in 2019 drip irrigation was used aimed at satisfying crop water requirements both approaches aimed at improving irrigation management while controlling impacts of salinity the collected information was used to parameterize and calibrate the soil water balance model simdualkc the model uses the fao56 dual crop coefficient approach and considers the combined effect of water and salinity stresses due to salinity of both soil and irrigation water results show that the simdualkc model adequately simulates the dynamics of the observed etc act throughout the three growing seasons the goodness of fit indicators show highly appropriate model fitting of observed etc act with low rmse of 0 42 mm d 1 for the calibration and 0 53 mm d 1 for validation the calibrated standard basal crop coefficients kcb of maize for the initial mid and end stages were respectively 0 15 1 15 and 0 25 which agree with those recently proposed by pereira et al 2021 due to the impacts of both water and salt stress in 2017 and 2018 etc act was much below the potential value etc ranging 64 83 while in 2019 that percentage increased to 92 due to avoiding water stress by then the average kcb mid act range 0 58 1 06 therefore lower than kcb mid with the lower values occuring in the lysimeter that was irrigated with a large deficit the irrigation scheduling practiced was assessed using water use and productivity indicators which have shown the advantage in using drip irrigation with small time intervals between irrigations moreover the current study and the calibrated model provide for adopting irrigation management practices that may save water and control salinity keywords basal crop coefficient drip irrigation hetao irrigation district salinity stress impacts surface irrigation water stress impacts 1 introduction the influence and management of salinity has been for long a focus of concern in irrigated agriculture minhas 1996 tanji and kielen 2002 hoffman and shalhevet 2007 grattan et al 2012 human induced salinization is one of the most important abiotic stresses to food production affecting millions of hectares fao 2015 mostly in arid and semiarid regions in these regions the scarcity of fresh irrigation water for agriculture is becoming a recurrent major issue pereira 2017 with farmers having many times no alternative but to use saline groundwater drainage water or wastewater in irrigated agriculture rhoades et al 1992 pereira et al 2009 2014 minhas et al 2020 the use of treated wastewater in agriculture has increased in the last decades pereira et al 2009 2014 however attention should be paid to the wastewater salinity because under those conditions aiming at high yields there is the need for blending saline sodic treated wastewater with good quality water and use improved leaching moghbel et al 2017 the use of low quality water in irrigation leads to the reduction of the soil osmotic potential in the rootzone with the increase of the ionic concentration of the soil solution reducing soil water availability and uptake by plants and further reducing yields when no mitigation measures are considered namely leaching water requirements minhas et al 2020 thus it is imperative to adjust water use and management to saline environments and adopt irrigation water saving practices capable of mitigating the deleterious effect of salinity on crop production and the soil itself however the use of water saving technologies with low water quality must be carefully assessed not only in terms of yield but also relative to soil salinization and sodification ayers and westcot 1985 anjum et al 2014 the hetao irrigation district hetao in northern china is facing widespread soil salinization resulting from both the application of excessive irrigation water and due to hydrogeological conditions this situation affects crops and increases groundwater levels that may affect the regime of the yellow river from where irrigation water is derived and to where drainage water is returned moreover when saline water tables become shallower capillary rise add promoting salinity build up in the root zone feng et al 2005 xu et al 2013 tong et al 2015 as a result salt accumulation in the upper layers of farmland soils is nowadays observed over half of the irrigated farmland area 525 000 ha wu et al 2008 yu et al 2010 several measures have been adopted to improve that situation but they have proven to still be insufficient as shown through several monitoring studies e g gao et al 2014 guo et al 2018 ren et al 2019 most water saving measures have mainly focused on improving crop water use e g by optimizing irrigation scheduling and practices pereira et al 2003a 2007 miao et al 2016 bai et al 2017 other adopted water saving irrigation technologies include basin precision land leveling bai et al 2010 miao et al 2015 2018 ridge furrows in level basins dong et al 2018 and the use of straw and plastic film mulching zhao et al 2016 qi et al 2018 dong et al 2018 however often leaching requirements and soil salinity control are not considered surface irrigation is a well adapted irrigation method for hetao because the yellow river water has an extremely high concentration of sediments which is detrimental to sprinkler and drip equipment precise land leveling is then particularly appropriate because it provides for significant reduction of the irrigation advance time and promotes uniformity of infiltration bai et al 2010 2011 miao et al 2015 however farmers commonly prefer the simpler and cheaper traditional land smoothing nevertheless main attention must be paid to salt leaching and drainage gonçalves et al 2007 pereira et al 2007 wang et al 2019 wen et al 2020 the review performed by minhas et al 2020 provided for a thorough description of the available methodologies for controlling salts with adequate irrigation management including a good bibliographic review impacts of decreasing the net water diversion and reducing deep percolation for salt leaching are reported by bai et al 2017 who show that these practices may induce the rise of soil water stress and the decrease of crop et and yield the study by ben gal et al 2008 reported that vegetable yield maximization when using saline irrigation water could be achieved only when an increased leaching is used which may result in an unsustainable practice appropriate irrigation schedules and efficient salt leaching management practices have become a top priority of research in the region irrigation scheduling in saline environments requires the precise quantification of crop water requirements i e the knowledge of the potential crop evapotranspiration etc and the actual crop evapotranspiration etc act as affected by salinity and water stresses these fluxes can be measured in the field using a variety of techniques allen et al 2011a 2011b and pereira et al 2021 revised a variety of approaches and related requirements for accuracy of estimates of the etc act values including i lysimeters ii the use of eddy covariance energy balance systems iii the bowen ratio energy balance iv scintillometers v sap flow methods vi remote sensing techniques and vii the monitoring of changes in soil water content measurements over a period of time lysimeters have been used to obtain accurate information for developing calibrating and validating crop evapotranspiration and crop coefficients for many crops howell et al 1985 pruitt 1991 lópez urrea et al 2020 lysimeters are also a good tool for studying the transport of solutes when saline waters are used and therefore for assessing salinization and alkalization hazards gonçalves et al 2006 three main types of lysimeters are used constant water table lysimeters talebnejad and sepaskhah 2015 drainage lysimeters poss et al 2004 skaggs et al 2006 raij et al 2018 and weighing lysimeters wright 1990 loos et al 2007 bryla et al 2010 evett et al 2012 2016 weighing lysimeters wl are well described and their accurate use is discussed by several authors e g allen and fisher 1990 wright 1990 allen et al 1991b and evett et al 2012 when duly managed weighing lysimeters can provide very accurate estimates of etc act data even for short time periods as 30 min evett et al 2012 further offering a straight forward approach to the determination of the water balance components in the soil plant atmosphere continuum howell et al 1985 zhang et al 1999 their use for evapotranspiration as well as for water and solutes flux studies is often reported in literature relative to their use in china large scale wl are reported as being mainly used to evaluate etc act of various crops and vegetation types assessing groundwater fluxes and performing water balances for most cases the use of models is not considered e g the determination of etc act of humid alpine meadows ecosystems dai et al 2021 cases where specific modelling is used do not report on developing public software but comparing approaches to estimate etc act e g comparing winter wheat wl results with those of the penman monteith combination equation the priestley taylor equation and the fao single kc method liu et al 2020 another example is reported by liu and luo 2010 on evaluating whether or not the fao 56 dual kc approach is suitable for common use however the reported kcb values are much above their upper limit as discussed by pereira et al 2020 a different use was to compare 16 reference et equations with data from grassed wl liu et al 2017a also weighed microlysimeters were used to support developing an et model suitable for evaluation of water use in the xilin river basin yu et al 2021 however none of the reviewed papers were either dealing with salinity nor reported on calibrating and validating a soil water balance swb or fao 56 model with lysimeter data the wl use in other regions similarly to the china studies also primely refers to assess etc act and to estimate the terms of the swb as well as to estimate etc act and crop coefficients one example refers to the use of the crop water solutes mechanistic model root zone water quality model rzwqm2 where the maize potential etc was estimated from either the shuttleworth wallace method or the asce alfalfa reference et multiplied by crop coefficients zhang et al 2018a soldevilla martinez et al 2014 compared two models dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer and wave water and agrochemicals in soil crop and vadose environment for assessing groundwater contribution to etc act luo and sophocleous 2010 reported that the mechanistic flux model hydrus 1d was first calibrated and validated with wl data then performing scenario analysis of groundwater contribution under different water table depths and water input rainfall plus irrigation chen et al 2018 used wl to evaluate improvements in simulating etc act and irrigation amount and frequency another common use of wl is the determination of crop coefficients e g marek et al 2006 bryla et al 2010 and lópez urrea et al 2020 salinity studies using wl are reported by raij et al 2018 referring the use of small size wl to evaluate the effects of drainage different leaching fractions and water uptake reduction due to solute stress the review and discussion by minhas et al 2020 consist of an appropriate complement of the review above the current review shows that the use of wl is common to assess the components of the soil water balance mainly percolation and groundwater contribution but crop water simulation models are unfrequently associated with wl and rarely wl studies are referring to salinity conditions when some kind of association exists then it occurs with mechanistic models and wl data characterizing the simulators of the various swb components e g capillary rise and percolation fluxes in addition of etc act the use of wl for calibrating and validating swb and salinity empirical or semi empirical models was not found in this review although field lysimeters can provide very accurate estimates of etc act and of other components of the soil water balance they are costly labor consuming and difficult to maintain swb models after proper calibration and validation can be a viable alternative also offering the capability of estimating the different components of the soil water balance with high accuracy minhas et al 2020 as reviewed by pereira et al 2020 most swb models follow the fao56 approach allen et al 1998 which adopts a daily stress coefficient ks representing both water and salt stresses to adjust the crop coefficient kc when it is multiplied by the grass reference eto to obtain the etc act values for saline environments etc act ks kc eto this approach is embedded into several models like isareg liu et al 1998 pereira et al 2003b budget raes et al 2006 and mopeco domínguez et al 2011 the same concept is also applied to the dual kc approach kc ks kcb ke with ks used to adjust the basal crop coefficient kcb and estimate the impact of rootzone stressors directly on crop transpiration tc and indirectly on soil evaporation es after partitioning of the etc allen et al 1998 2005 the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012a and the saltmed model ragab 2002 constitute rare examples of models using this precise approach for computing the soil water balance pereira et al 2015a 2020 the dual kc approach is now widely used for estimating etc act of crops grown under different climatic regions and under different management practices e g lópez urrea et al 2009 paço et al 2012 the simdualkc is a soil water balance model using the dual kc approach as defined in fao56 guidelines which description is provided by rosa et al 2012 and examples of application are given by rosa et al 2012b the numerous applications of the model namely those referred bellow show that the model is quite precise in determining basal kc thus in computing transpiration and soil evaporation as well as the other components of the soil water balance it has been selected because authors know about its precision when well calibrated and validated against observations of the soil water and of crop et or crop transpiration examples of application to maize include the north china plain zhao et al 2013 eastern inner mongolia wu et al 2015 and hetao in china miao et al 2016 ran et al 2017 xuan et al 2021 southern brazil martins et al 2013 gonzález et al 2015 ávila et al 2017 uruguay giménez et al 2016 and portugal paredes et al 2014 the model has also been applied for intercropping of wheat maize in hetao miao et al 2016 and potato legume in kenya nyawade et al 2021 tree crops in india peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 italy puig sirera et al 2021 and portugal paço et al 2012 2014 horticultural crops such as potato in italy paredes et al 2018 and zucchini in syria darouich et al 2020 rosa et al 2016 developed and tested a new approach for simdualkc for computing actual transpiration and soil evaporation in maize and sweet sorghum irrigated with saline waters while water balance models such as simdualkc can assess the impact of saline stress conditions on crop et and estimate irrigation needs to develop irrigation schedules there is the need to further consider a leaching fraction lf so that irrigation amounts can be adjusted to help flushing salts away from the rootzone generally the lf is as an input to model simulations for leaching requirements the u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 proposed a solution which presumed the existence of long term steady state conditions and ensured that net downward flow of water through the root zone was the best mode of restraining soil salinity assuming that the absorption of salt by crops can be neglected and crop evapotranspiration is a distillation process without chemical reaction the leaching requirements lr can be calculated ayers and westcot 1985 as 1 lr ec iw 5 ec e ec iw where eciw is the electrical conductivity of the irrigation water and ece is the electrical conductivity of the saturated paste extract of the soil however the use of eq 1 may not be appropriate when the steady state conditions cannot be assumed minhas et al 2020 furthermore the proportion of salt leaching depends on the soil texture in order to minimize the influence of salt during sensitive crop growth stages leaching and crop salt tolerance should maintain synchronization differently the autumn irrigation applied before soil freezing is the method used in north china in addition to leach salts it is used for improving soil structure due to the multiple occurrences of soil freezing and thawing particularly for silty soils and constitutes a soil water reserve for plant use in early spring feng et al 2005 pereira et al 2007 li et al 2012 liu et al 2021 however farmers may use excessive water in the autumn irrigation relative to water saving recommendations currently in place based on accurate estimation of the crop water requirement the current study proposes adopting appropriate irrigation schedules combined with efficient salt leaching management practices the main objectives of this research are 1 to calibrate and validate the simdualkc model with 3 year independent etc act daily measurements in weighing lysimeters performed in plastic mulched soil cultivated with maize under salinity conditions 2 to analyze the simulated daily dynamics of the basal and evaporation coefficients along three maize seasons using basin and drip irrigation 3 assessing the current irrigation schedules in terms of water use and water productivity as previously discussed about wl the novelty of the current study refers to the first time that the model simdualkc is calibrated validated with large scale weighing lysimeter data under saline conditions thus providing for the results of both the model and lysimeter to be extended out of the experimental location since there is a lack of swb model uses that assess salinity impacts on et and transpiration with the fao56 method in hetao and in the upper yellow river basin the adoption of the dual kc method provides for an innovative approach relative to empirical methods and to flux and crop models in addition and in alternative to crop yield models adopting a dual kc method allows using the stewart model modified by paredes et al 2014 which predicts maize yields from seasonal transpiration under salinity conditions thus requiring less parameters to calibrate 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and lysimeters facilities the study was conducted at the shuguang experimental station 40 46 n 107 24 e 1039 6 m located in the hetao irrigation district inner mongolia china along three years 2017 2019 the climate in the region is classified as arid semi arid continental the mean annual precipitation is only 137 mm mostly occurring between june and september while the mean annual pan evaporation potential evaporation reaches 2300 mm meteorological data for the study period were collected every 30 min in an automatic meteorological station placed over a well watered clipped grass located at 2 m of the lysimeters facility data included maximum and minimum air temperatures tmax and tmin ºc average and minimum relative humidity rhmax and rhmin number of sunshine hours n h and mean daily wind speed at 2 m height u2 m s 1 these data were used for calculating the daily grass reference evapotranspiration eto mm d 1 with the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 precipitation p mm d 1 was also recorded data were continuously collected from january to december during the three study growing seasons a brief characterization of the weather conditions along the three years is presented in fig 1 with 2017 being the year with higher climatic demand conditions two weighing lysimeters 1 4 m 1 4 m 2 0 m cropped with maize were installed inside an experimental field 8 6 ha distanced 100 m from the field edges and 10 m from each other in such a way that the equilibrium boundary layer of the air could be fully adjusted above lysimeters as recommended by wright 1991 and allen et al 1991a 1991b 2011a 2011b lysimeter walls are metallic wrapped in plastic to reduce their thermal conductance the soil inside lysimeters was similar to that of the surrounding field lysimeters were filled with the same repacked soil monoliths removed during installation a 0 30 m thick filter layer with sand and gravel was placed at lysimeters bottom to enable free drainage the distance between soil surface and lysimeters rims was 5 cm to minimize possible advective effects lysimeters were sustained by a counter weighted platform scale data were recorded every 30 min in a computer and was summed to hourly and daily means the lysimeter mass resolution was 20 g with an accuracy of 0 01 mm of equivalent water depth calibration of the lysimeters followed the procedures described by howell et al 1985 aiming at preventing sources of error in lysimeter measurements in rainy days an automatic movable rainfall shelter was installed to cover lysimeters when any rainfall occurred following the recommendations by allen et al 2011a a quality assessment and control of the etc act measurements in the lysimeter were conducted along the seasons the main physical and hydraulic properties of the soil inside the lysimeters is presented in table 1 the soil texture classified as silty loam classification usda 1987 is relatively homogeneous the particle size distribution was measured with a laser particle size analyzer ms 2000 malvern instruments ltd malvern uk the dry bulk density ρb was obtained by drying three volumetric undisturbed soil samples 100 cm3 at 105 ºc to constant weight soil hydraulic properties were measured also in 100 cm3 undisturbed soil cores with a pressure plate extractor model 1500f1 soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara ca usa the soil water content at field capacity θfc and at wilting point θwp were assumed to correspond to the soil pressure heads values of 10 and 1500 kpa respectively soil water content at saturation θsat was determined from the maximum holding capacity of those soil cores on a volumetric basis 2 2 experimental treatments and field measurements the same crop varieties plant density and management practices such as weeding fertilizing and pesticide application were conducted similarly in both lysimeters and in the surrounding field standard practices proposed to local farmers were adopted maize var ximeng 3358 was grown inside and outside lysimeters so contributing to the one dimensionality of measurements allen et al 1991a and controlling local advection sowing was performed in april may for harvesting by late september the dates of the crop growth stages are presented in table 2 plants were sown with a row spacing of 0 40 m and a distance between plants of 0 27 m thus with a plant density of approximately 92 600 plants ha 1 fig 2 four maize lines were located inside each lysimeter plant rows were covered by transparent polyethylene sheets with 0 20 mm thickness as disposed in fig 2 fertilization was applied in agreement with the results of soil analysis nitrogen application summed 309 kg n ha 1 in each growing season a mixture with urea 75 kg ha 1 and diammonium phosphate 375 kg ha 1 was applied before sowing as base fertilizer the remaining n amount were applied as urea during the first and third irrigation events of the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons in 2019 the remaining n fertilization was applied during the most critical maize growth periods namely the tasseling and filling stages the experimental field was divided into two so that irrigation treatments performed inside lysimeters could be replicated in the areas surrounding each lysimeter during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons irrigation in one of the weighing lysimeters herein denoted as lysimeter a followed the management practices carried out usually by local farmers based upon the water delivery opportunity imposed by the water conveyance service in the other lysimeter here denoted as lysimeter b irrigation schedules were based upon the increasing water demand by other sectors and forecasted constraints on water delivery thus a reduction in 30 of the irrigation depths applied in the lysimeter a were set a total of 336 and 236 mm were applied in each growing season in lysimeters a and b respectively which were distributed through 4 irrigation events with irrigation depths ranging from 72 to 100 mm per event table 3 differently by 2019 due to the high impact of the previous established irrigation schedules on maize yield irrigation schedules were targeted to replace the crop water consumption in addition it was also taken into consideration that water saving technologies being implemented in hetao include the adoption of drip irrigation drip irrigation was provided by manually opening the system early in the morning whenever targeted thresholds were observed consequently lysimeter a was irrigated every time that the cumulated crop evapotranspiration reached 20 mm and lysimeter b was irrigated with a three day interval with a water depth corresponding to the sum of crop evapotranspiration during those three days irrigation depths ranged then from 11 mm to 26 mm per event a total of 573 and 568 mm were applied respectively in lysimeters a and b during that growing season aiming at controlling soil salinity an autumn irrigation event of 200 mm was performed every year tables 3 and 4 water was applied by flooding in addition a pre sowing irrigation event was also carried out every year to ensure good emergence of maize a total of 45 50 and 50 mm were applied 5 days before the 2017 2018 and 2019 sowing dates respectively irrigation water was pumped from the groundwater and conveyed to each lysimeter and surrounding field by a pvc pipe irrigation depths were measured manually using water meters the average electrical conductivity eciw of the water pumped from the groundwater was 1 85 1 75 and 1 90 ds m 1 respectively in 2017 2018 and 2019 which correspond to high salinity risk waters for irrigating maize according to the u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 guidelines measurements were taken before each irrigation event with those values constituting the respective averages in addition to continuous measurement of lysimeters mass disturbed soil samples were collected from the areas surrounding each weighing lysimeters and used to determine the electrical conductivity of the 1 5 soil water extract ec1 5 ds m 1 for the 0 1 m soil layer these values were then converted into electrical conductivity of the saturation paste extract ece ds m 1 following slavich and petterson s 1993 approach 2 ec e f ec 1 5 with 3 f 2 46 3 03 ρ b θ s at where ρb is sol bulk density g cm 3 and θsat cm3 cm 3 is soil water content at saturation crop height h and leaf area index lai were monitored in 9 randomly distributed plants in each lysimeter at a 10 days interval using a non destructive method to avoid removing plants from the lysimeters the length l mm and width w mm of all leaves of 9 plants were measured using a ruler and converted to lai using the relationship proposed by montgomery 1911 4 lai 0 75 i n l w the multiplier may vary with the variety development stage and agronomic practices elings 2000 nevertheless similar procedures are commonly used e g mananze et al 2018 table 4 presents the measured h while table 5 lists the lai and the estimated fc values along each crop season a non destructive method was used to monitoring the maize root depth zr m by collecting soil samples in the adjacent areas where experimental conditions were consistent with those in the lysimeters soil samples were taken with an auger down to a depth of 1 0 m at 5 randomly distributed locations at the end of each crop season root depth was then determined by visual analysis of the soil samples according to these observations maize roots were mainly concentrated in the 0 0 4 m layer with the finer roots extending down to 0 8 1 0 m depth the maize yield was assessed by harvesting the entire lysimeter and adjusting the observed values taking into consideration the yield harvested in the surrounding field 2 3 modelling approach 2 3 1 model description the simdualkc computes the daily soil water balance as follows allen et al 1998 rosa et al 2012a 5 d r i d r i 1 p ro i i i cr i et c act i dp i where dr is the root zone depletion mm p is the precipitation mm ro is the surface runoff mm i is the net irrigation mm cr is the capillary rise from the groundwater table mm etc act is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm and dp is the deep percolation from the root zone mm all referring to days i or i 1 in this study p was null because lysimeters were under a rain shelter ro was neglected since the size of lysimeters is small and the soil surface was flat cr was null because no water table was maintained in the lysimeters the simdualkc model adopts the dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 2005 minhas et al 2020 for estimating crop evapotranspiration etc by separately computing its individual components crop transpiration tc and soil evaporation es as follows 6 t c k cb et o 7 e s k e et o where kcb is the is the basal crop coefficient ke is the evaporation coefficient and eto is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm under water and or salt stress conditions tc is not maintained at its potential rate thus there is the need for using a stress coefficient ks 8 t c act k s k cb et o k cb a ct et o where tc act is the actual crop transpiration mm and kcb act represents the actual basal crop coefficient ks ranges from 0

describes the relationship between the relative yield decrease with the relative evapotranspiration deficit stewart et al 1977 doorenbos and kassam 1979 tables containing updated values for the parameters of eq 9 are presented by minhas et al 2020 the first term on the right side of eq 9 represents the water matric stress when dr i rawsalt and is computed daily through the water balance of the entire root zone the second term is used to correct the former for the effects of salinity osmotic stress i e when ece ece threshold relative to the considered crop in this approach following rosa

al 1998 2005 thus 15 k r 1 f o r d e i 1 r e w 16 k r tew d e i 1 tew rew for d e i 1 rew where tew is the maximum depth of water that can be evaporated from the evaporation soil layer when it has

computed through a daily water balance of the evaporation soil layer with the evaporation decreasing beyond rew as the evaporable soil water decreases in the evaporation soil layer few depends upon the fraction of ground covered by the crop fc 17 f ew min 1 f c f w where fw is the fraction of the soil surface wetted by irrigation the fc value for different crop stages can be inserted directly or computed from lai and crop height h allen and pereira 2009 as follows 18 f c 1 e 0 7 lai 1 h when the soil surface is covered by plastic mulch the fc values may increase as follows 19 f c max f c f r mulch where fr mulch is the fraction of soil covered by the plastic sheet or the organic mulch rosa et al 2012a thus in the simdualkc model the use of mulching leads to a reduction of few which then constrains the kc max by limiting the evaporation component adjustments on the mulch conditions along the season may be performed particularly in terms of the materials deterioration further information on the computational approach used for estimation of the effects of mulch in soil evaporation is provided in rosa et al 2012a and application examples relative to organic and plastic mulch are given respectively in martins et al 2013 and zhang et al 2018b the usability of equations described above eqs 5 to 19 is demonstrated in the studies cited in the introduction section 2 3 2 model

salinity data ece values specified for different dates along the crop growing season table 5 and the ece threshold ds m 1 and b ds m 1 parameters characterizing maize tolerance to salinity these parameters are available from maas and hoffman 1977 ayers and westcot 1985 allen et al 1998 and minhas et al 2020 non observed crop parameters values used to initialize the model were based upon allen et al 1998 and the dp parameters were set according to the soil hydraulic characteristics table 1 2 3 3 model calibration validation the simdualkc model was calibrated by adjusting non observed model parameters one at a time within reasonable ranges of values using a trial and error procedure until deviations between observed crop evapotranspiration etc act obs and model predictions of etc act were minimized data collected in lysimeter a in the 2017 growing season was used for this purpose the calibrated parameters corresponded to i the kcb and p values relative to the initial mid and end season crop stages and ii the depth of the evaporative soil layer ze the initial values used for the soil evaporation parameters tew and rew the parameters related to the deep percolation function ad and bd and the salinity parameters ece threshold and b were also assessed during calibration they were found to provide good results and therefore were not modified the calibrated model parameters were validated using independent data sets corresponding to etc act obs measured in lysimeter a during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons and in lysimeter b during the three year period 2017 2019 following pereira et al 2015b it was considered that model performance was acceptable when the goodness of fit indicators relative to the validation were within a range of 20 variation relative to calibration model performance during calibration validation was first assessed through visual analysis of the simulated vs measured crop evapotranspiration values which allowed a fairly perception of trends or bias in modelling when they occurred as commonly used in other applications pereira et al 2015b the following goodness of fit indicators were used a the regression coefficient b0 describing a linear regression forced through the origin eisenhauer 2003 between measured etc act obs and model simulated crop evapotranspiration etc act values 20 b 0 i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i 2 where oi and pi i 1 2 n represent the measured and model simulated values targeted b0 values are close to 1 0 because then the estimated values are statistically close to the measured ones b0 1 suggest an overestimation bias while b0 1 an underestimation bias b the coefficient of determination r2 of the ordinary least squares regression estimated as 21 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 0 5 i 1 n p i p 2 0 5 2 where o and p are the observed and predicted etc act mean values and n is the number of observations r2 values close to 1 0 show that most of the variance of the measured values is well explained by model simulations r2 values above 0 50 are generally considered acceptable moriasi et al 2007 c the root mean square error rmse mm which describes the variance of the residual errors 22 rmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n 0 5 rmse values vary between 0 0 and a positive value and the target is a much smaller value than the mean of observations d the average absolute error aae mm d 1 in alternative

ratio between rmse and the mean of observations o consists of a non dimensional measure of the relative error of estimate computed as follows 24 nrmse 100 rmse o nrmse values vary between the optimum

indicator proposed by nash and sutcliffe 1970 used to assess the magnitude of the mean square error mse rmse2 relative to the observed data variance legates and mccabe jr 1999 26 ef 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 the optimal value for ef is 1 0 then indicating that the variance of residuals is much small than the variance of observations contrarily when the ef value is close to 0 0 or negative then ef indicates that the variance of residuals is similar or larger than the variance of observations 2 4 assessment of experimental irrigation schedules several water productivity wp kg m 3 indicators are used to assess the various irrigation schedules practiced along the experimental years wp is defined as the ratio between the actual crop yield achieved ya kg and the corresponding water use however it may refer to the total water use twu to the irrigation water use iwu to the consumptive use etc act or just to crop transpiration tc act all expressed in m3 pereira et al 2012 2020 thus the various wp indicators are defined as 27 wp total y a twu y a p cr δ sw i 28 wp irrig y a iwu 29 wp et y a et c act 30 wp tc y a t c act where ya is the actual harvestable yield kg p is rainfall cr is capillary rise or groundwater contribution δsw is the variation in soil water storage in the root zone i is the amount of irrigation etc act is the actual crop evapotranspiration and tc act is the actual crop transpiration all expressed in m3 ya values were those observed in the lysimeters after adjustment using the surrounding fields yields etc act and tc act were estimated using the simdualkc model after proper calibration 3 results and discussion 3 1 field experiments the results of monitoring salinity in the soil along the three irrigation seasons are presented in table 5 for all surveyed dates ece 1 7 ds m 1 which is commonly considered as the ece threshold for maize ayers and westcot 1985 minhas et al 2020 higher ece values were observed in 2017 slightly decreasing for 2018 and 2019 which is likely related with the leaching effects for most dates the ece values are higher in lysimeter b which was irrigated with larger deficit than lysimeter a thus indicating that deficit irrigation for maize is less adequate under saline conditions an economic evaluation is advisable to assess the viability of deficit irrigation under saline conditions the scheduled 3 days interval between irrigation events lysimeter b set in 2019 showed to be the most adequate schedule under saline conditions resulting in the lower ece values despite the irrigation water had the highest observed eciw likely this behaviour results from the large number of irrigation events associated with drip irrigation which favoured salts leaching from the root zone as a result of the salinity levels reported in table 5 and the deficit irrigation scheduled adopted the maize crop development expressed in terms of crop height and lai tables 6 and 7 was constraint by water and salts stress this is particularly evident in case of lysimeter b where a higher deficit irrigation was imposed along both 2017 and 2018 season the impacts of the salinity and water stress were large in terms of final grain yield in 2017 the maize yield under the farmers schedule lysimeter a was 13 322 kg ha 1 while lysimeter b under higher water stress yielded only 9546 kg ha 1 in 2018 yields slightly increased in both lysimeters to 14 163 kg ha 1 and 10 826 kg ha 1 respectively but the differences between both lysimeters is similar differently maize yield in 2019 was much large respectively 17 893 kg ha 1 and 17 405 kg ha 1 due to much frequent applications with drip irrigation either when irrigation was set to replace every 20 mm of water used etc or when a 3 day interval between irrigation events was adopted likely the small and frequent applications played a major role when compared with the large and infrequent applications with flooding similar yields were reported by liu et al 2017b for maize cropped under similar saline conditions in hetao the dynamics relative to the maize etc act measured in lysimeters with a 30 minutes time step and cumulated to daily values along the 2017 2019 growing seasons are presented in fig 3 results show that etc act values were relatively high during the initial stage 2 6 mm d 1 with high evaporation rates resulting from the combined effect of high surface soil moisture and high energy available at the soil surface in fact during the initial stage table 2 etc act mainly depends on soil evaporation which was favoured by the pre sowing irrigation events with depths from 45 to 50 mm that increased soil moisture in the top soil thus promoting soil evaporation etc act progressively decreased later when the soil dried out and was progressively covered by the crop that decrease in es was associated with a progressive increase in crop transpiration with tc act becoming the main part of etc act by the mid season from mid july to early september etc act attained maximum values close to 8 mm d 1 when there was enough water in the soil and tc act was maintained relatively high until senescence depending on atmospheric conditions and irrigation events in 2017 and 2018 with high intervals between irrigation events etc act values always increased to a maximum immediately after irrigation but soon dropped to a minimum due to depletion of soil moisture in the upper soil layer because lysimeter b received 30 less water than lysimeter a the et reduction was there more pronounced in 2019 when irrigation was frequent in both lysimeters higher et rates occurred throughout the mid season with variations mostly related to weather variability during crop senescence period there was a progressive reduction of etc act in both lysimeters due to transpiration decreasing and soil evaporation also decreasing due to reduced water in the soil top layer 3 2 model calibration and validation the first step to adequately simulate the actual crop etc act was to parameterize the simdualkc model by inputting the non observed parameters kcb p ze tew rew ad bd as referred in the set up section 2 3 2 the default and calibrated model parameters are presented in table 8 they consist of the calibrated standard potential kcb values which correspond to pristine cropping conditions i e without water or salinity stresses and under optimal agronomic conditions the standard kcb for the initial mid season and end season crop stages were 0 15 1 15 and 0 25 respectively these kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end values matched the standard values for maize proposed by allen et al 1998 and in the recent review by pereira et al 2021 however the kcb end value depends on the crop management and has lower values when maize grain is harvested with low moisture as for the current study the pini and pmid values were not changed from those proposed by allen et al 1998 and pereira et al 2021 but the pend value was set to 0 80 table 8 thus matching the late season value adopted by miao et al 2016 and rosa et al 2016 that high value pend 0 80 is due to assuming that water stress during the late season stage is adequate when low grain moisture at harvest is considered and a long late season occurs no adjustments were made to the default salinity parameters ece threshold and b proposed by minhas et al 2020 nor to the dp parameters ad and bd proposed by liu et al 2006 finally ze was slightly increased from the default value due to the high silt content observed in the soil profile when compared with tabled values by allen et al 1998 results in fig 3 show that after appropriate calibration the simdualkc model adequately simulated the dynamics of the daily etc act in both lysimeters and throughout the three crop growth seasons the goodness of fit indicators relative to the model calibration and validation are presented in table 9 whose results confirmed the good accuracy of the simdualkc in predicting etc act for the calibration set b0 0 99 indicates no trends for under or over estimation tendency and that the estimated etc act values were statistically close to the measured ones associated with a b0 close to 1 0 pbias is quite low 2 5 r2 0 96 indicates that most of the observed variance could be explained by the model the errors of estimates are quite small rmse is 0 42 mm d 1 and nrmse is approximately 12 finally the ef value 0 95 is very high indicating that the variance of residuals is much lower than the variance of the measured data similar results were obtained for the five validation sets the values for b0 ranged 0 96 1 01 so close to the target and pbias values are also small from 6 2 to 0 8 i e no trend exists for under or over estimation r2 values range 0 90 0 96 thus close to the value obtained for the calibration estimation errors were low with rmse ranging from 0 51 to 0 54 mm d 1 and nrmse ranging from 12 4 to 19 8 ef results are high ef 0 87 confirming that the variance of residuals is much lower than the variance of measured data results therefore show that the simdualkc model fitted well the dynamics of maize etc act cropped in a plastic mulched maize irrigated with saline waters results of the present study for fitting etc act are similar or better than those reported in literature for maize cropped in a plastic mulched soil and using the simdualkc model ding et al 2013 using a modification of the fao56 dual kc model reported rmse 0 48 mm d 1 ran et al 2017 reported rmse values from 0 70 mm d 1 to 0 98 mm d 1 when predicting et other studies performed with maize without plastic mulch include zhang et al 2013 that reported rmse ranging 0 43 0 60 mm d 1 higher rmse values ranging from 0 80 mm d 1 to 0 84 mm d 1 were reported by jiang et al 2014 when using the fao56 approach to estimate maize et chen et al 2021 using the bsw soil water balance model for estimating crop etc act of maize cropped with plastic mulch reported mean absolute errors ranging 9 16 9 which are comparable with the nrmse values of the current study based on these results the current application of the simdualkc model can be considered as an adequate tool to estimate maize etc act rates in a plastic mulched maize in a saline environment thus able to support improving irrigation scheduling and salinity control as aimed for the hetao irrigated region 3 3 crop coefficients the fao56 allen et al 1998 segmented kcb curve and the daily dynamics relative to actual kc kcb and ke coefficients in both weighing lysimeters along the three crop seasons are presented in fig 4 the observed kc act kc act obs derived from the ratio between the lysimeter etc act to eto is also depicted there as expected from the previous results fig 3 and table 9 the dynamics of kc act match well those of kc act obs as discussed by pereira et al 2021 under arid conditions like those prevailing in hetao daily kc values may approach 1 30 for a tall and dense crop as it is the case of maize to note that this condition occurred for a few days by 2019 when kc act obs was higher than the upper limit 1 30 in only 3 days the computed standard kcb for the initial mid season and end season crop stages are 0 15 1 15 and 0 25 as shown in table 5 ece values measured in the soil layer of 1 0 m depth during the three crop seasons were always above the ece threshold for maize 1 7 ds m 1 ayers and westcot 1985 minhas et al 2020 as a result the kcb act curves departed from the potential kcb curves in both lysimeters and along the three crop seasons thus reflecting the impact of both salinity and water stresses on reducing transpiration rates relative to their potential values the peaks of kcb mid act in 2017 and 2018 fig 4 are below the kcb mid horizontal line which is due to the effect of saline stress which impedes maize to attain the potential etc the fall of kcb mid act a few days after those peaks are due to water stress differently in 2019 there is no evidence of water stress but only salinity stress therefore this fig 4 shows that the traditional irrigation schedules adopted in lysimeter a in 2017 and 2018 were never able to prevent the occurrence of water and salinity stresses obviously with 30 less water applied the combined effect of both stresses was more severe in lysimeter b the large irrigation depths and intervals between application events to both lysimeters were not sufficient to meet crop water requirements and to leach salts i e those schedules revealed inadequate for a sustainable irrigation in that saline environment during the 2019 growing season when the irrigation in both lysimeters followed the crop water demand maize was not affected by water stress however salinity stress occurred from sowing to harvest in both lysimeters thus the actual kcb mid is about 10 50 smaller than the standard kcb mid with kcb mid act 0 58 1 06 with 0 58 due to combined effects of deficit irrigation salinity and plastic mulch and 1 06 relative to effects of salinity and plastic mulch the plastic mulch helped to reduce soil evaporation and therefore ke values along every maize crop seasons the ke values were always higher at sowing due to the capillary rise favoured by the pre season irrigation events fig 4 thus explaining the higher et rates measured during those periods fig 3 ke values decreased during the following days as the soil dried out also reducing et rates in 2017 and 2018 the ke peaks were coincident with the irrigation events decreasing later to nearly zero since the evaporation from the soil is then decreasing to nearly dry out the evaporation layer of the soil in 2019 season the higher irrigation frequency supported maintaining ke values almost constant along the mid season in both lysimeters differently during the late season due to senescence of leaves transpiration and ground cover reduced thus ke increased because more energy becomes available at the soil surface 3 4 soil water balance components and et partitioning the soil water balance terms for both lysimeters during the three experimental years are presented in table 10 because a rain shelter was used during the maize growing season the water input by precipitation only occurred during the non growing season the fallow period i e from harvesting to sowing the next crop then representing a very low portion of the crop total water use twu p i δsw ranging from 2 5 to 6 2 irrigation was mostly applied during the growing season and represented 50 70 of the total water applied the higher climatic demand condition prevailing by 2017 lead to the highest twu despite the deficit irrigation was practiced by then in lysimeter a the second highest twu was observed in 2019 which corresponds to the lower climatic demand conditions because irrigation was then scheduled for fully satisfying crop water requirements deep percolation dp mainly resulted from the application of the pre irrigation ranging from 5 7 to 9 3 of the sum of precipitation and irrigation depths applied during the non growing season as previously discussed the pre irrigation revealed to be very important to control salt accumulation in the soil table 5 the total etc act values varied from 479 to 673 mm mostly referring to the growing season representing 75 85 of the total etc act the results relative to the estimated etc act along the non growing and the growing season for all studied years and its partitioning are presented in table 11 results show that total tc act ranged from 373 to 541 mm with only a residual amount of tc act during the non growing season that portion mainly consists of the residual diffusive evaporation component supplied by the soil water below the dry soil surface analyzing the tc act results along the three growing seasons they show low tc act values during the initial and late season stages and the highest tc act by the mid season stage when maize is fully developed the ratio tc act tc was lower than the unit in all experimental years due to the impacts of water and salinity stresses table 11 during 2017 both lysimeters showed a reduction of the transpiration rates relative to their potential value of 17 and 34 approximately due to high water and salinity stresses fig 4 the effect of stressors on root water uptake was attenuated by irrigation but the timing and frequency of irrigation events were never adequate for maize to reach its potential tc and maximize crop yields likewise the combined effect of both stressors led to a 20 and 36 reduction of tc values in lysimeters a and b in 2018 contrarily in 2019 fig 4 and table 11 with the increase of irrigation frequency and non limiting applied depths aimed at fulfilling crop water requirements crop transpiration was only affected by soil salinity with the ece measured in both lysimeters ranging from 2 38 to 2 60 ds m 1 with tc act reduced by about 8 relative to tc values es was high during the non growing season when the soil surface was not covered with plastic mulch contrarily due to mulch during the growing season es values were generally low varying from 10 to 47 mm the higher values correspond to 2019 when a large number of irrigation events contributed to es as expected tc act was the main et component during the growing season while es was the main one during the non growing season the limited es contribution to etc act along the initial and development stages was due to using the plastic mulch to control soil evaporation 3 5 assessing the irrigation schedules using water productivity indicators the irrigation scheduling used along the three experimental years were assessed using the water productivity wp indicators eqs 27 to 30 all indicators were estimated using the observed yield and considering both the non growing and the growing season soil water inputs and outputs tables 10 and 11 i e taking in account the autumn and pre sowing irrigations which contributed to both salts leaching soil water storage and use by the crop as well as improving soil structure through the freeze thaw processes li et al 2012 liu et al 2021 and also plays a major role of controlling the groundwater depth unfortunately the majority of studies relative to north china do not include the autumn and pre sowing irrigations as part of the total water use twu or the irrigation water use iwu but these irrigations likely are the for base success of agricultural production in that vast region as reported by ren et al 2018 those two irrigations accounted for more than 50 of annual water diversion from the yellow river which justifies the need for a further in depth optimization study results show that three of the wp indicators so excepting wpirrig have a similar behavior with higher values for the 2019 irrigation schedules table 12 when the highest yields were achieved about 17 900 kg ha 1 however using also the highest twu likewise etc act and tc act were then the largest in both lysimeters wptotal ranged between 1 85 and 2 52 kg m 3 with the lowest value referring to the schedule that led to the highest irrigation deficit which caused the largest water and salinity stresses tables 5 and 11 fig 4 and the smallest yield table 12 wptotal is reported in only one study performed with maize and cropped under saline conditions murad et al 2018 wptotal ranged 1 82 3 02 kg m 3 which are in the range of the current study relative to maize cropped under no saline conditions table 13 reported wptotal values ranged 1 36 2 69 kg m 3 in various studies performed in portugal rodrigues et al 2013 paredes et al 2014 ramos et al 2017 and in china yufeng et al 2021 the latter showing much higher values 3 20 5 80 kg m 3 likely because the non growing season autumn irrigation was not considered wptotal is not commonly found in literature because most authors use wpirrig or to wpet because season iwu and et are easily estimated the wpirrig values ranged from 1 98 to 2 42 kg m 3 table 12 results show that the highest iwu was observed by 2019 when the irrigation schedules were set for no water stress adopting frequent and small water applications to replace around 20 mm of depleted water it happens that iwu and therefore wpirrig values vary much with the climatic demand conditions and mostly with the amount of rainfall available during the crop season thus that indicator should only be used in comparative studies if performed in similar climates to our knowledge no study available in literature took into consideration the autumn irrigation despite as previously commented its common use for salts leaching and soil structure improvement much higher wpirrig values were reported in hetao irrigation district under saline conditions by liu et al 2017b for maize cropped under saline conditions ranging from 4 95 to 8 74 kg m 3 because despite similar yields 14220 17821 kg ha 1 were reported the seasonal irrigation depth applied was low from 186 mm to 357 mm likely due to non accounted groundwater contribution and the autumn irrigation feng et al 2017 relative to hetao reported for maize cropped under salinity conditions wpirrig values comparable with those of the current study ranging 1 73 2 57 kg m 3 but values were computed disregarding non growing season irrigation and achieving much lower yields 5 53 8 21 t ha 1 xue et al 2020 for a maize study performed for the jiefangzha sub district of hetao reported wpirrig values ranging 0 47 4 65 kg m 3 other studies performed for salinity conditions table 13 also report a very wide range of wpirrig values 1 16 4 78 kg m 3 for non saline conditions wpirrig values are in a much wide range from 0 59 to 17 14 kg m 3 fan et al 2014 yan et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 likely due to differences in climate among sites mainly due to precipitation as referred above the wpet values on the current study ranged 1 92 2 67 kg m 3 table 12 with the lowest values observed for severe deficit irrigation schedules these wpet values are comparable with others reported in studies performed with maize cropped under saline conditions 0 66 5 31 kg m 3 as referred before and shown in table 13 these broad ranges of wpet values table 13 likely result from the varied conditions prevailing in respective studies e g plant density irrigation method climate irrigation schedules that variability is well shown by bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 when using the watpro model at the global scale where the average wpet is 2 25 0 94 wptc in the current study ranged from 2 56 to 3 34 kg m 3 where the highest value refers to the largest ya table 12 only a study on maize cropped under saline conditions reported on wptc table 13 it is the case of the study by rosa et al 2016 reporting on the impacts of diverse saline conditions on maize et which show a much lower wptc 1 78 2 11 kg m 3 resulting from lower yields and higher climatic demand conditions thus with higher tc act values 420 636 mm results show that all but wpirrig are appropriate to be used as comparators while wpirrig is adequate for the use of both irrigation water and energy savings however it should be used together with the other wp indicators particularly those that refer to the impacts of the diverse practices on farmers income which appropriately describe the farming performance rodrigues et al 2013 paredes et al 2014 darouich et al 2017 further studies are required to assess the impact of all practices on both an environmental and economic perspective 4 conclusions the experimental data collected in two weighing lysimeters along 2017 2019 allowed to successfully calibrate and validate the water balance simdualkc model for maize cropped under diverse water and salinity levels estimation errors are quite small with nrmse 20 and rmse ranging from 0 42 to 0 55 mm d 1 the model performance confirmed the appropriateness of the simdualkc model for estimating maize et under various water and salinity conditions and therefore supporting the quality of the water balance data the calibration of simdualkc provided for deriving the standard basal crop coefficient values which agree with those tabulated in fao56 allen et al 1998 and in the updated review by pereira et al 2021 resulting standard kcb at the initial mid and end season stages are respectively 0 15 1 15 and 0 20 simulations with the six sets of lysimeter et data provided for computing the actual kcb act and ke data as well as the actual soil water balance terms the actual kcb at the mid season stage varies 0 58 1 06 thus about 10 50 lower than the standard kcb mid 1 15 it results that when planning irrigation a reduced kcb mid 1 00 should be used when both water and salinity stresses occur and 1 06 if water stress is avoided to be noted that those kcb values correspond to the condition of adopting the autumn irrigation for leaching salts out before the growing season the methodology proposed by fao56 and minhas et al 2020 for computing the stress coefficient ks to be applied to compute kcb act under salinity conditions was well tested moreover the calibration and validation of the simdualkc model also confirmed the fao56 dual kc approach when considering impacts of plastic mulch on soil evaporation these results do not oppose to the continuity of studies on plastic mulch effects presently carried out in china which require focusing on the interaction between evaporation and kc or kcb autumn irrigation is a common practice in north china particularly in hetao it refers to large amounts of irrigation water aiming at salt leaching improving the structure of the silty soils through the freeze thaw process and augmenting soil water storage considering its great importance its volume is presently included as part of the total irrigation volume when performing the soil water balance of the lysimeters so relative to the non growing period i e the autumn and pre sowing irrigations shall be included in the total irrigation applied otherwise actual kcb and wp values would be smaller than those computed herein it results that the current study used much more water that customary reported studies in the area which do not consider those irrigations but rarely in the same line the results relative to the surveillance of the soil ece confirmed the adequateness of the irrigations during the non growing period to control salt accumulation in the soil results of modelling and partitioning etc act showed that soil evaporation was the main et component during the initial period while during the crop development mid and late season es was residual es etc act 2 8 due to effects of both the crop shadow and the plastic mulch covering the soil surface as well as the lack of precipitation however due to the plastic degradation its effect on es reduction decreases with time particularly in the late season the higher irrigation frequency adopted during 2019 led to a larger es when compared with the other two experimental years i e 8 vs 4 season average the transpiration ratio tc act tc was always 1 0 due to water and salinity stress in 2017 and 2018 when deficit basin irrigation was adopted so resulting that the ratio tc act tc was low ranging 51 76 results for 2019 were different with tc act tc of 91 and 92 since irrigation strategies were replacing crop water consumption relative to every 3 day interval or when cumulated etc 20 mm thus aiming at avoiding water stress salinity stress could not be avoided but just insufficiently controlled nevertheless frequent water applications may increase es the irrigation schedules were assessed using the wp indicators results revealed that all wp indicators except wpirrig follow a similar tendency with the highest wp value obtained for the drip schedule with many irrigation events and larger yield as tested for drip irrigation in 2019 however drip irrigation is expensive requires a distribution network different of that for surface irrigation and needs desilting the yellow river water used for irrigation moreover because farmers know well surface irrigation but not drip it is required advising farmers relative to control water volumes applied and or on using both surface and sub surface drip to cope with salinity and to enhance yields as well as to impose water stress only during periods when impacts on maize yields can be minimized then water deficit should be avoided during flowering and yield formation and the grain filling periods in addition it is advisable to use a kcb mid act instead of the standard value since that value adjusted to the climate corresponds to the maximum usable value in presence of salt stress and of the plastic mulch water managers should therefore be aware of these limitations when managing water deliveries to farmers thus extension teams should be appropriately trained since aimed water
