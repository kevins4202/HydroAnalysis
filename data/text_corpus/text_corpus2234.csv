11170,understanding the impacts of agricultural activities on drainage is increasingly important element of water resources management in arid regions this study analyzed the effects of recent changes in agricultural activities on drainage water quantity and quality from farmlands in aksu river basin in northwest china based on drainage water analysis for 2003 2010 implementation water saving measures resulted in the reduction of irrigation quota by up to 48 this in turn resulted in a decline in drainage water by up to 44 in 2010 compared with that in 2004 na cl was the main drainage water type driven by the dissolution of soluble salts and cation exchange analysis further showed that while tds total dissolved solids in drainage water increased to 4 7 10 8 g l an average of 7 6 g l in period 2005 2010 that in 2003 2004 was 28 lower in contrast to irrigation water tds in drainage was 6 18 times higher than that in irrigation water yet further analysis showed that while the increase in tds in drainage water was mainly driven by farmland expansion drainage water was as well affected by groundwater exploitation it was therefore recommended to restrict farmland expansion and to intensify water saving operations in order to prevent destructive declines in water flow to downstream ecosystems keywords farmland drainage irrigation water agricultural water saving groundwater tarim river basin total dissolved solids 1 introduction there is a growing concern about water shortage and water quality deterioration in arid and semi arid regions of china feng and cheng 1998 liu et al 2016 wang and cheng 1999 tarim river basin is the largest inland river basin in arid northwest china over the past half century increasing air temperature and precipitation in tarim river basin have resulted in rising river runoff in the headstream regions xu et al 2013 even so flows in the mainstreams have been decreasing this is particularly the case in the downstream region where the lower reaches even got dried up in the 1950s and 1970s hao et al 2008 declining flows in the mainstreams have resulted in degradation of water quality and of riparian ecosystems in the basin feng et al 2005 tao et al 2011 noted that anthropogenic activities such as agricultural irrigation and domestic water use were the main causes of water shortage in the region it is therefore critical to develop rational water resources management strategies in the agricultural sector to ensure ecological sustainability in the whole river basin water is critical for agriculture which is in turn affected by agriculture both in terms of quantity and quality agriculture accounts for some 70 of global freshwater use fao 2013 with the share of agricultural water use reaching 97 in aksu river basin feike et al 2015 in the basin agricultural development has increased agricultural water use from 4 6 109 m3 in the 1950s to 6 7 109 m3 in the 2000s shen et al 2008 xu et al 2005 noted that uncontrolled expansion in irrigated areas resulted in increasing water use in the upper reaches of tarim river at the rate of 16 million m3 yr in the 1950s 2000s since agricultural irrigation is the largest water user developing water saving agriculture could enhance sustainable use of scarce water resources in the region thus the local government enacted a new surface water allocation scheme in 2005 to reduce overall water use and limit cultivated land expansion in the upper reaches of tarim river xinjiang tarim river basin management bureau 2005 the scheme promotes widespread use of water saving irrigation with decreasing irrigation quotas with increasing water scarcity and water demand in arid regions drainage from agricultural lands in the upstream region has become an increasingly critical source of water in the downstream regions li et al 1999 found that agricultural drainage water from aksu oasis accounted for 39 9 of total tarim river runoff the contribution of drainage water to the total river flow in downstream was likely to increase the share of drainage water reached 80 in the lower reaches of amu darya river crosa et al 2002 however the characteristics of drainage water is closely related with agricultural activities drainage water from agricultural fields under water saving irrigation conditions can be drastically reduced by replacing traditional irrigation with drip irrigation hu et al 2017 sinai and jain 2005 vazquez et al 2006 observed that reductions in irrigation amounts resulted in less drainage from agricultural lands along with declining drainage water quantity changes in water quality can limit water availability in downstream regions van vliet et al 2017 lecina et al 2010 noted that while modernized irrigation reduces return flows it increases salt concentration in drainage water using data from alaer monitoring station wang et al 2010 concluded river water salinity increased from 0 67 g l in 1960 to 5 27 g l in 2000 due to expansions of farmlands highly saline drainage water could destroy ecosystems and farmlands in downstream regions the above studies pave the way for further insight into not only the quantity but also quality of drainage water following reductions in irrigation quotas and adoptions of water saving measures critical for developing efficient policies on regional water resources management the specific objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of recent agricultural practices on drainage water quantity and quality the overall goal was to have the best options for balanced regional water management between agriculture and downstream ecosystems 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in aksu oasis which is a typical desert oasis in tarim river basin in northwest china agricultural irrigation in the oasis relies heavily on water from aksu river the largest upstream tributary of tarim river at the middle reaches of aksu river a big flow gate tarim barrage was constructed to apportion and control water flow to different reservoirs for domestic industrial and agricultural uses in the so called tarim irrigation district irrigation water flow to different irrigation units is strictly controlled by gauge stations tabei irrigation district the northern section of tarim irrigation district on the east side of aksu river and the north side of tarim river has five irrigation units with water supply from duolang reservoir the study area 220 8 km2 is one of the five irrigation units of tabei irrigation district it lies between 80 46 80 59 e and 40 30 40 41 n and is 38 km away from alaer city in xinjiang autonomous region fig 1 the study area borders duolang drainage canal on the west duolang reservoir and tabei drainage canal on the north and tarim river on the south the no ii drainage canal flows across from north to south of the study area discharging most of the salt laden drainage water into tarim river thus drainage water quality directly affects water quality in tarim river with a typical continental temperate arid climate average temperature in the study area is 10 7 c and average precipitation is 49 2 mm due to strong evaporation 2044 6 mm yr and intense sunshine 3032 h yr there is severe salt accumulation in the arable soil layer in the region thus large amounts of water are used to flush out the salts from the arable soil layer while the flushing salts makes the land cultivatable it discharges large quantities of salts into tarim river via no ii canal 2 2 statistical data analysis agronomic data including cultivated land areas and cropping patterns were derived from the 2000 2010 agriculture statistical yearbooks issued by the water conservancy administration bureau of tarim irrigation district the bureau collected water samples including irrigation and drainage water in 2003 2010 once every month for water quality analysis irrigation water samples were collected from the s1 and s2 discharge gauge stations of duolang reservoir fig 1 the irrigation water is explained by hydro chemical indices averaged for the two stations drainage water samples were collected from s3 gauge station of no ii drainage canal while the irrigation amount is controlled by sluice gates on the side canals drainage water flow is monitored at 10 day interval at s3 gauge station water samples were analyzed for various chemical compositions water contents of ca2 and mg2 were measured by titration with 0 01 mol l edta using eriochrome black t as indicator the water contents of na and k were determined by flame photometry acidification with 1 3 volume ratio hcl solution was done prior to measuring so4 2 by titration with 0 01 mol l edta using k b acid chrome blue k and naphthol green b mixture as indicator then hco3 and co3 2 were determined by titration with 0 01 mol l h2so4 respectively using 0 5 phenolphthalein and 0 1 methyl orange as indicators cl was titrated in 0 03 mol l agno3 solution using k2cro4 as indicator finally tds was calculated by summing up all major ions identified in the collected water samples salt load was quantified by multiplying monthly volumes of irrigation or drainage water by the respective salt concentrations the difference in salt loads between irrigation and drainage water was analyzed by independent sample t test in spss statistical package for social scientists 2 3 experimental investigation to identify the effects of ion exchange on water type transformation both drip irrigation and flood irrigation were applied on newly cultivated cotton field plots within the study area in 2012 the initial soil salinity within 1 m depth of the soil profile was determined in advance table 1 under drip and flood irrigation conditions the irrigation quotas were respectively 337 mm and 381 mm fully reflecting local irrigation practices in the region soil solution was collected at different depths by ceramic suction samplers two days after every irrigation event all major ions including na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and no3 were analyzed for using ion chromatography 3 results 3 1 changes in cultivated area and water supply in 2000 2010 fig 2 shows the changes in cultivated land area and irrigation water supply in 2000 2010 the total irrigated area was relatively stable in 2000 2004 as it only slightly increasing from 7 27 103 to 8 00 103 ha in 2005 total irrigated area increased by 57 8 to 12 6 103 ha and stayed from then on fig 2a the area under cotton the main cash crop increased from 4 7 103 ha in 2000 to 7 1 103 ha in 2010 accounting for almost 60 of the total irrigated area simultaneously the area under wheat decreased since 2005 suggesting a significant change in the cropping pattern although the area under cotton increased by 51 4 in 2010 over that in 2000 the highest increase was for the other cash crops such as jujube and walnut these crops accounted for 0 6 103 ha in 2000 and 3 1 103 ha in 2010 fig 2a similarly irrigation water steadily increased until 2005 fig 2b before declining in line with government policies on sufficient water delivery in the downstream regions of tarim river therefore 2005 was used as the transition year for analysis of the differences in irrigation and drainage compared with 2004 irrigation quota decreased by 26 in 2005 by 2010 irrigation quota dropped to 524 mm nearly half of that 1013 mm in 2004 the widespread use of drip irrigation under plastic mulch narrowed the gap between water supply and demand in the region cotton was mostly cultivated under drip irrigation fig 2a drip irrigated fraction of the total irrigated area in 2005 was 38 and increased to 45 in 2010 the changes in cultivated land area and irrigation water amount influenced drainage water flow and water quality in the study area 3 2 reduction of drainage water after water saving irrigation in tarim irrigation district is generally in spring summer and winter february to may is spring irrigation season during which period irrigation is done to flush out salt before sowing june to september is the main growing season during which period irrigation is done to ensure water supply for crop growth then october to january is winter irrigation season during which period irrigation is again done to flush out salt for the next cultivation season each irrigation done to flush out salts from the root zone soil profile requires about 250 mm of water which is done once or twice in an irrigation season fig 3 compares monthly irrigation and drainage for 2004 and 2010 to illustrate the changes before and after the implementation of the new surface water allocation scheme the peak drainage flow rates corresponding with spring march and winter november irrigations in 2004 were 1 19 m3 s and 1 34 m3 s respectively the average flow rate of drainage water during the growing season was 0 56 m3 s producing a total of 2 30 107 m3 of drainage water while in 2010 the flow rate of drainage water during the salt flushing and growing seasons decreased dramatically it fluctuated mildly about an average of 0 41 m3 s the total drainage water in 2010 was 1 28 107 m3 suggesting a 44 decline or a one half cut from that in 2003 3 3 deterioration of drainage water quality salt concentration in irrigation and drainage water during 2003 2010 are illustrated in fig 4 no obvious annual variation was noted in irrigation water the average tds was 0 57 g l however results showed increase in drainage water tds in 2005 2010 tds in drainage water was 4 7 10 8 g l in comparison with 4 4 7 9 g l in 2003 2004 the fluctuation of drainage tds was caused by the seasonal recharge from upstream and irrigation then average tds of drainage water was used to reflect the variations in agricultural drainage water on average it suggested an increase of 28 in average tds 7 6 g l in 2005 2010 and 5 9 g l in 2003 2004 in contrast to irrigation water tds of drainage water was 6 18 times higher caused by the strong evaporation effect after water saving and dissolution of soluble salts from newly cultivated land the chemical compositions of irrigation and drainage water are plotted as a piper diagram in fig 5 the water type in duolang reservoir varied seasonally with ca mg na so4 cl in spring mg ca na so4 cl in summer and na mg ca cl so4 in winter in contrast drainage collected at s3 gauge station was mainly of na cl water type while na accounted for 55 of total cations cl accounted for 67 of total anions in drainage water similarly field irrigation experiment in 2012 showed that cation exchange affected water type fig 6 shows the variations of ion concentration in soil solutions along the vertical depth of the soil profile as irrigation water leached through the soil profile na concentration increased and ca2 concentration decreased this suggested that there was replacement of soil na with ca2 as irrigation water percolated through leaching both cl and so4 2 concentrations increased with downward leaching of drainage water indicating high concentrations of the ions in the soil table 1 thus the typical ca mg na so4 cl or mg ca na so4 cl water type which came in as irrigation changed into na cl water type that went out as drainage simultaneously the tds increased from 1 2 g l in irrigation water to 90 1 g l in drainage water which reflected the significant influence of soluble salts dissolution from new farmland 3 4 comparison of discharged salt loads with drainage water salt load was calculated from monthly volumes of irrigation or drainage water and the respective salt concentrations as annual precipitation is very low 49 mm in the region its effect on total salt load is negligible given that the dominant cation and anion in the drainage water were na and cl respectively accounting for 55 and 67 of the total cations and anions the contribution salts due to the use of fertilizers or pesticides to discharged salt loads was also negligible chen et al 2007 yang et al 2007 monthly salt loads in irrigation and drainage water in the study area are plotted in fig 7 the points before and after 2005 above the 1 1 trend line suggested a tremendous increase in effluent salt loads in drainage water based on the results of independent sample t test significant differences p 0 01 were noted in salt loads between drainage and irrigation water in the study area table 2 average monthly salt load of effluent water was 7 38 103 t higher than that of influent water moreover no significant difference p 0 05 existed in effluent salt load before and after 2005 indicating that there was no obvious decline in discharged salt load with the reduction of drainage water after the implementation of the new surface water allocation scheme 4 discussions 4 1 agricultural activity and new water allocation scheme among the three large tributaries aksu river is the only remaining river with perennial flow contributing some 73 2 to total runoff in tarim river chen et al 2003 meng et al 2016 and zhang et al 2012 showed that even though natural annual flow in aksu river increased substantially from 6 67 billion m3 in the 1950s to 8 67 billion m3 in the 1990s and 9 26 billion m3 in the 2000s annual discharge to tarim river decreased from 3 02 billion m3 in the 1950s to 2 68 billion m3 in the 2000s this suggested that water use in aksu oasis increased by 2 93 billion m3 over the same period resulting in the speedy implementation of the new surface water allocation scheme the new scheme stipulates that annual discharge from aksu river to tarim river should reach 3 42 billion m3 in 2005 xinjiang government and ministry of water resources of china xgmwrc 2002 the scheme also simultaneously promotes water saving irrigation in agricultural production in principle no expansion in cultivated area is allowed under the scheme economic interests drive farmers to reclaim new lands for cultivation thus it was not surprising that cultivated land area increased drastically by 57 8 in 2005 before government intervention from then on an effective control was put on cultivated lands in the study area though expansion in cultivated area was stopped irrigation quota declined as irrigation water supply to each irrigation district was reduced irrigation quota in the study area started decreasing in 2005 with only 523 9 mm of water used in 2010 a decline of 48 over that in 2004 water saving irrigation such as drip irrigation with plastic mulch was widely used to ensure high crop yields the area under drip irrigation accounted for 45 of the total cultivated area in 2010 4 2 effect of water saving on drainage water water saving technology increases irrigation efficiency by reducing return flow hu et al 2017 it was noted in this study that drip irrigation as well as reduced traditional irrigation quota limited leaching from farmlands compared with 2004 drainage water decreased by 44 in 2010 meanwhile tds concurrently increased by nearly 30 from 5 4 g l in 2003 to 7 1 g l in 2010 because water saving practices also changed salt dynamics in farmlands salt could not be thoroughly flushed out under drip irrigation this led to the build up of soluble salts in the soil profile and drainage water this is consistent with the findings by causapé et al 2006 that improved irrigation via sprinkler irrigation decreased water quality by increasing tds in drainage water hu et al 2017 also identified the shrinkage of return flow and deterioration of water quality under water saving conditions salt load is mainly driven by the quantity and quality of water several studies have noted that leaching of salts from agricultural fields was highly dependent on leached water amount causapé et al 2004 lecina et al 2010 bahceci and nacar 2009 found a statistically significant linear correlation between cumulative drainage water volume and leached salt as effluent salt load decreased with decreasing drainage aragüés et al 2011 reported that water saving techniques e g drip and sprinkler irrigation were the most efficient ways of reducing discharged salt loads however there was no statistically significant difference between effluent salt loads before and after 2005 p 0 05 total discharged salt loads did not decline with reduction of drainage water volume fig 7 and table 2 water saving irrigation appeared to have a minor effect on the discharged salt loads the much higher tds and salt loads in effluent drainage than in influent irrigation after 2005 suggested that reclaimed new farmland could be the main factor of increasing tds in drainage water in the study area 4 3 effect of reclaimed farmland on drainage water while water saving measures induced water quality change other factors could have as well affected tds load in drainage water one such factor was saline land reclamation for farming fig 2a illustrates that farmland area increased sharply in 2005 before the new water regulation and reallocation policy was enacted while high evaporation and shallow groundwater conditions resulted in high salt accumulation in the top soil layer rapid expansion of farmlands increased leaching of salts into drainage systems for instance meng et al 2011 observed a drainage water salinity of 5 3 12 4 g l in newly reclaimed farmlands studies in weigan oasis near aksu river basin reported 7 8 g l of salt content in drainage water in reclaimed farmlands even under 675 mm of net irrigation chen et al 2011 using filtration and irrigation cropping for land treatment and effluent reuse in severely saline lands jayawardane et al 2001 noted that electrical conductivity of drainage water increased over 10 times for irrigation drainage ratio of 3 1 it was therefore inferred that the significant increase in irrigated area 57 8 in 2005 also greatly increased tds load in drainage water consistent with the conclusion by han et al 2015 thus both expansion of farmlands and aggressive water saving measures caused drainage water quality degradation in the study area it was necessary and also feasible to identify cultivated land area using remote sensing data fig 8 illustrates variations in cultivated and uncultivated land areas in 2013 versus 2000 data were extracted from yang et al 2018 cultivated land area in 2013 was assumed to be similar to that in 2010 because cultivated land area remained stable since 2005 due to government restrictions most of the new farmlands were on both sides of no ii canal fig 8c apparently the newly reclaimed farmlands contributed heavily to the increase in tds in drainage water which could be even higher than the one under water saving farming 4 4 reduced surface water allocation and groundwater exploitation irrigation quotas in fig 2b decreased due to water diversion to downstream regions the decrease in irrigation quota from 1013 mm in 2004 to 524 mm in 2010 influenced crop water supply and leaching of salts out of the root zone soil profile zhao et al 2009 estimated that annual water requirement in cotton fields in tarim irrigation district under drip irrigation with plastic mulch was 543 mm also liu et al 2006 estimated that cotton water requirement in the nearby region was 625 mm yr under drip irrigation with plastic mulch in reference to the above studies irrigation quotas in the study area were close to or even less than water requirement for cotton this was probably the main reason why farmers extracted groundwater for field irrigation considering the fact that irrigation quota decreased by 48 and nearly reached field crop water requirement drainage water should have dropped to a much lower level thus the 44 drop in drainage water indicated that considerable extraction of groundwater had offset the decline in irrigation water hu et al 2017 for instance feike et al 2015 evaluated the percent of groundwater irrigation in aksu river basin and concluded that groundwater irrigated area increased from 2 in 2004 to 7 in 2010 the groundwater depth in aksu river basin dropped gradually due to expansion in irrigated area wang 2018 even fossil groundwater was exploited for irrigation in yingbaza region of tarim river thevs 2011 in the whole tarim river basin the area equipped for groundwater irrigation accounted for 10 20 in the total irrigated farmland siebert et al 2006 it is important to note that groundwater extraction should be strictly controlled within a reasonable amount to maintain natural vegetation growth thevs et al 2015 moreover government should prohibit farmers from drilling wells privately 4 5 implications for regional water management under the limited surface water supply government could seek other reliable policies to further enhance the management of the regional water resources for instance government could control water delivery to reclaimed new farmlands instead of simply decreasing irrigation quotas expansions of cultivated lands could be controlled through land water use regulations or by reducing agricultural subsidies which would affect the economic interests of native farmers it is illustrated in fig 2a that the highest expansion was in cash crops cotton and other cash crops for which the native farmers have obtained the highest economic incentives simultaneously the total amount of irrigation water used to meet water requirements of cash crops has distinctly improved therefore there is the need for compromises between economic interests and conservation of water resources it is very important to strengthen awareness of native farmers about sustainable use of water resources and preventing the endless reclamation of new cultivated farmlands on the other hand food security is critical for the growing population not only water shortage but also the fragile environment in northwest china make it difficult to reclaim more farmlands for food production zhang et al 2010 it is important to enhance land productivity on the existing farmland also improving water use efficiency can be highly critical for increased food production in arid areas deng et al 2006 another area of policy issue was water quality from fig 4 salt concentration in discharged water increased from 5 4 g l in 2003 to 7 1 g l in 2010 even drainage water salinity in 2003 was much higher than the accepted standard of 2 0 g l for irrigation water quality in china china national standadization management committee cnsmc 2006 even up till 2010 drainage water from farmlands was still highly saline 7 0 g l rhoades et al 1992 especially for direct discharge into tarim river cotton is not so tolerant to highly saline water conditions hanson et al 2006 and it is hard for even highly salt tolerant plants e g populus euphratica and tamarix ramosissima to grow well under such high salt water conditions zhang et al 2002 worse more is the fact that the soils irrigated with the saline water were prone to severe erosion and sedimentation ghadiri et al 2007 there was therefore the need to evaluate the implications of direct discharge of highly saline drainage water into tarim river for aquatic life in the downstream ecosystems evaporation ponds are successfully used to dispose saline drainage water in southern australia ahmed et al 2000 which can be fitted to the new drainage canals to discharge saline waters alternatively serial biological concentration systems can be used to manage salinity khan et al 2008 water quality in the study area should be monitored with the utmost vigilance in order to ensure good water availability in tarim river and the connected aquatic ecosystems 5 conclusions agricultural drainage water is an important source of water for downstream regions in arid areas agricultural activities constitute a critical element of drainage water quantity and quality in the study area drainage water decreased with intensification of water saving practices due to expansions in irrigated area by 57 8 and the reduction of irrigation quota by 48 based on the analyzed characteristics of agricultural drainage water in aksu river basin and using 2005 as the transition year drainage water volume dropped by 44 in 2010 over that in 2004 groundwater exploitation can be enhanced after limitations are put on surface water supply simultaneously drainage water quality deteriorated mainly due to expansion of new farmlands in spite of the application of water saving measures average tds in farmland drainage water in 2005 2010 was 7 6 g l as compared with 5 4 g l in 2003 2004 the main drainage water type in the study area was na cl driven by the dissolution of soluble salts and cation exchange the drastic increase in drainage water salinity can endanger the downstream ecosystems we deduced that restriction of reclamation of new farmlands was a rational water management strategy in the study area moreover the discharge of highly saline drainage water into tarim river needed further consideration in terms of the environmental implications it will cause for water supply and ecosystems in the downstream region acknowledgments this research was supported by the strategic priority research program of chinese

river basin in northwest china agricultural irrigation in the oasis relies heavily on water from aksu river the largest upstream tributary of tarim river at the middle reaches of aksu river a big flow gate tarim barrage was constructed to apportion and control water flow to different reservoirs for domestic industrial and agricultural uses in the so called tarim irrigation district irrigation water flow to different irrigation units is strictly controlled by gauge stations tabei irrigation district the northern section of tarim irrigation district on the east side of aksu river and the north

80 59 e and 40 30 40 41 n and is 38 km away from alaer city in xinjiang autonomous region fig 1 the study area borders duolang drainage canal on the west duolang reservoir and tabei drainage canal on the north and tarim river on the south the no ii drainage canal flows across from north to south of the study area discharging most of the salt laden drainage water into tarim river thus drainage water quality directly affects water quality in tarim river with a typical continental temperate arid climate average temperature in the study area is 10 7 c and average precipitation is 49 2 mm due to strong evaporation 2044 6 mm yr and intense sunshine 3032 h yr there is severe salt accumulation in the arable soil layer in the region thus large amounts of water are used to flush out the salts from the arable soil layer while the flushing salts makes the land cultivatable it discharges large quantities of salts into tarim river via no ii canal 2 2 statistical data analysis agronomic data including cultivated land areas and cropping patterns were derived from the 2000 2010 agriculture statistical yearbooks issued by the water conservancy administration bureau of tarim irrigation district the bureau collected water samples including irrigation and drainage water in 2003 2010 once every month for water quality analysis irrigation water samples were collected from the s1 and s2 discharge gauge stations of duolang reservoir fig 1 the irrigation water is explained by hydro chemical indices averaged for the two stations drainage water samples were collected from s3 gauge station of no ii drainage canal while the irrigation amount is controlled by sluice gates on the side canals drainage water flow is monitored at 10 day interval at s3 gauge station water samples were analyzed for various chemical compositions water contents of ca2 and mg2 were measured by titration with 0 01 mol l edta using eriochrome black t as indicator the water contents of na and k were determined by flame photometry acidification with 1 3 volume ratio hcl solution was done prior to measuring so4 2 by titration with 0 01 mol l edta using k b acid chrome blue k and naphthol green b mixture as indicator then hco3 and co3 2 were determined by titration with 0 01 mol l h2so4 respectively using 0 5 phenolphthalein and 0 1 methyl orange as indicators cl was titrated in 0 03 mol l agno3 solution using k2cro4 as indicator finally tds was calculated by summing up all major ions identified in the collected water samples salt load was quantified by multiplying monthly volumes of irrigation or drainage water by the respective salt concentrations the difference in salt loads between irrigation and drainage water was analyzed by independent sample t test in spss statistical package for social scientists 2 3 experimental investigation to identify the effects of ion exchange on water type transformation both drip irrigation and flood irrigation were applied on newly cultivated cotton field plots within the study area in 2012 the initial soil salinity within 1 m depth of the soil profile was determined in advance table 1 under drip and flood irrigation conditions the irrigation quotas were respectively 337 mm and 381 mm fully reflecting local irrigation practices in the region soil solution was collected at different depths by ceramic suction samplers two days after every irrigation event all major ions including na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and no3 were analyzed for using ion chromatography 3 results 3 1 changes in cultivated area and water supply in 2000 2010 fig 2 shows the changes in cultivated land area and irrigation water supply in 2000 2010 the total irrigated area was relatively stable in 2000 2004 as it only slightly increasing from 7 27 103 to 8 00 103 ha in 2005 total irrigated area increased by 57 8 to 12 6 103 ha and stayed from then on fig 2a the area under cotton the main cash crop increased from 4 7 103 ha in 2000 to 7 1 103 ha in 2010 accounting for almost 60 of the total irrigated area simultaneously the area under wheat decreased since 2005 suggesting a significant change in the cropping pattern although the area under cotton increased by 51 4 in 2010 over that in 2000 the highest increase was for the other cash crops such as jujube and walnut these crops accounted for 0 6 103 ha in 2000 and 3 1 103 ha in 2010 fig 2a similarly irrigation water steadily increased until 2005 fig 2b before declining in line with government policies on sufficient water delivery in the downstream regions of tarim river therefore 2005 was used as the transition year for analysis of the differences in irrigation and drainage compared with 2004 irrigation quota decreased by 26 in 2005 by 2010 irrigation quota dropped to 524 mm nearly half of that 1013 mm in 2004 the widespread use of drip irrigation under plastic mulch narrowed the gap between water supply and demand in the region cotton was mostly cultivated under drip irrigation fig 2a drip irrigated fraction of the total irrigated area in 2005 was 38 and increased to 45 in 2010 the changes in cultivated land area and irrigation water amount influenced drainage water flow and water quality in the study area 3 2 reduction of drainage water after water saving irrigation in tarim irrigation district is generally in spring summer and winter february to may is spring irrigation season during which period irrigation is done to flush out salt before sowing june to september is the main growing season during which period irrigation is done to ensure water supply for crop growth then october to january is winter irrigation season during which period irrigation is again done to flush out salt for the next cultivation season each irrigation done to flush out salts from the root zone soil profile requires about 250 mm of water which is done once or twice in an irrigation season fig 3 compares monthly irrigation and drainage for 2004 and 2010 to illustrate the changes before and after the implementation of the new surface water allocation scheme the peak drainage flow rates corresponding with spring march and winter november irrigations in 2004 were 1 19 m3 s and 1 34 m3 s respectively the average flow rate of drainage water during the growing season was 0 56 m3 s producing a total of 2 30 107 m3 of drainage water while in 2010 the flow rate of drainage water during the salt flushing and growing seasons decreased dramatically it fluctuated mildly about an average of 0 41 m3 s the total drainage water in 2010 was 1 28 107 m3 suggesting a 44 decline or a one half cut from that in 2003 3 3 deterioration of drainage water quality salt concentration in irrigation and drainage water during 2003 2010 are illustrated in fig 4 no obvious annual variation was noted in irrigation water the average tds was 0 57 g l however results showed increase in drainage water tds in 2005 2010 tds in drainage water was 4 7 10 8 g l in comparison with 4 4 7 9 g l in 2003 2004 the fluctuation of drainage tds was caused by the seasonal recharge from upstream and irrigation then average tds of drainage water was used to reflect the variations in agricultural drainage water on average it suggested an increase of 28 in average tds 7 6 g l in 2005 2010 and 5 9 g l in 2003 2004 in contrast to irrigation water tds of drainage water was 6 18 times higher caused by the strong evaporation effect after water saving and dissolution of soluble salts from newly cultivated land the chemical compositions of irrigation and drainage water are plotted as a piper diagram in fig 5 the water type in duolang reservoir varied seasonally with ca mg na so4 cl in spring mg ca na so4 cl in summer and na mg ca cl so4 in winter in contrast drainage collected at s3 gauge station was mainly of na cl water type while na accounted for 55 of total cations cl accounted for 67 of total anions in drainage water similarly field irrigation experiment in 2012 showed that cation exchange affected water type fig 6 shows the variations of ion concentration in soil solutions along the vertical depth of the soil profile as irrigation water leached through the soil profile na concentration increased and ca2 concentration decreased this suggested that there was replacement of soil na with ca2 as irrigation water percolated through leaching both cl and so4 2 concentrations increased with downward leaching of drainage water indicating high concentrations of the ions in the soil table 1 thus the typical ca mg na so4 cl or mg ca na so4 cl water type which came in as irrigation changed into na cl water type that went out as drainage simultaneously the tds increased from 1 2 g l in irrigation water to 90 1 g l in drainage water which reflected the significant influence of soluble salts dissolution from new farmland 3 4 comparison of discharged salt loads with drainage water salt load was calculated from monthly volumes of irrigation or drainage water and the respective salt concentrations as annual precipitation is very low 49 mm in the region its effect on total salt load is negligible given that the dominant cation and anion in the drainage water were na and cl respectively accounting for 55 and 67 of the total cations and anions the contribution salts due to the use of fertilizers or pesticides to discharged salt loads was also negligible chen et al 2007 yang et al 2007 monthly salt loads in irrigation and drainage water in the study area are plotted in fig 7 the points before and after 2005 above the 1 1 trend line suggested a tremendous increase in effluent salt loads in drainage water based on the results of independent sample t test significant differences p 0 01 were noted in salt loads between drainage and irrigation water in the study area table 2 average monthly salt load of effluent water was 7 38 103 t higher than that of influent water moreover no significant difference p 0 05 existed in effluent salt load before and after 2005 indicating that there was no obvious decline in discharged salt load with the reduction of drainage water after the implementation of the new surface water allocation scheme 4 discussions 4 1 agricultural activity and new water allocation scheme among the three large tributaries aksu river is the only remaining river with perennial flow contributing some 73 2 to total runoff in tarim river chen et al 2003 meng et al 2016 and zhang et al 2012 showed that even though natural annual flow in aksu river increased substantially from 6 67 billion m3 in the 1950s to 8 67 billion m3 in the 1990s and 9 26 billion m3 in the 2000s annual discharge to tarim river decreased from 3 02 billion m3 in the 1950s to 2 68 billion m3 in the 2000s this suggested that water use in aksu oasis increased by 2 93 billion m3 over the same period resulting in the speedy implementation of the new surface water allocation scheme the new scheme stipulates that annual discharge from aksu river to tarim river should reach 3 42 billion m3 in 2005 xinjiang government and ministry of water resources of china xgmwrc 2002 the scheme also simultaneously promotes water saving irrigation in agricultural production in principle no expansion in cultivated area is allowed under the scheme economic interests drive farmers to reclaim new lands for cultivation thus it was not surprising that cultivated land area increased drastically by 57 8 in 2005 before government intervention from then on an effective control was put on cultivated lands in the study area though expansion in cultivated area was stopped irrigation quota declined as irrigation water supply to each irrigation district was reduced irrigation quota in the study area started decreasing in 2005 with only 523 9 mm of water used in 2010 a decline of 48 over that in 2004 water saving irrigation such as drip irrigation with plastic mulch was widely used to ensure high crop yields the area under drip irrigation accounted for 45 of the total cultivated area in 2010 4 2 effect of water saving on drainage water water saving technology increases irrigation efficiency by reducing return flow hu et al 2017 it was noted in this study that drip irrigation as well as reduced traditional irrigation quota limited leaching from farmlands compared with 2004 drainage water decreased by 44 in 2010 meanwhile tds concurrently increased by nearly 30 from 5 4 g l in 2003 to 7 1 g l in 2010 because water saving practices also changed salt dynamics in farmlands salt could not be thoroughly flushed out under drip irrigation this led to the build up of soluble salts in the soil profile and drainage water this is consistent with the findings by causapé et al 2006 that improved irrigation via sprinkler irrigation decreased water quality by increasing tds in drainage water hu et al 2017 also identified the shrinkage of return flow and deterioration of water quality under water saving conditions salt load is mainly driven by the quantity and quality of water several studies have noted that leaching of salts from agricultural fields was highly dependent on leached water amount causapé et al 2004 lecina et al 2010 bahceci and nacar 2009 found a statistically significant linear correlation between cumulative drainage water volume and leached salt as effluent salt load decreased with decreasing drainage aragüés et al 2011 reported that water saving techniques e g drip and sprinkler irrigation were the most efficient ways of reducing discharged salt loads however there was no statistically significant difference between effluent salt loads before and after 2005 p 0 05 total discharged salt loads did not decline with reduction of drainage water volume fig 7 and table 2 water saving irrigation appeared to have a minor effect on the discharged salt loads the much higher tds and salt loads in effluent drainage than in influent irrigation after 2005 suggested that reclaimed new farmland could be the main factor of increasing tds in drainage water in the study area 4 3 effect of reclaimed farmland on drainage water while water saving measures induced water quality change other factors could have as well affected tds load in drainage water one such factor was saline land reclamation for farming fig 2a illustrates that farmland area increased sharply in 2005 before the new water regulation and reallocation policy was enacted while high evaporation and shallow groundwater conditions resulted in high salt accumulation in the top soil layer rapid expansion of farmlands increased leaching of salts into drainage systems for instance meng et al 2011 observed a drainage water salinity of 5 3 12 4 g l in newly reclaimed farmlands studies in weigan oasis near aksu river basin reported 7 8 g l of salt content in drainage water in reclaimed farmlands even under 675 mm of net irrigation chen et al 2011 using filtration and irrigation cropping for land treatment and effluent reuse in severely saline lands jayawardane et al 2001 noted that electrical conductivity of drainage water increased over 10 times for irrigation drainage ratio of 3 1 it was therefore inferred that the significant increase in irrigated area 57 8 in 2005 also greatly increased tds load in drainage water consistent with the conclusion by han et al 2015 thus both expansion of farmlands and aggressive water saving measures caused drainage water quality degradation in the study area it was necessary and also feasible to identify cultivated land area using remote sensing data fig 8 illustrates variations in cultivated and uncultivated land areas in 2013 versus 2000 data were extracted from yang et al 2018 cultivated land area in 2013 was assumed to be similar to that in 2010 because cultivated land area remained stable since 2005 due to government restrictions most of the new farmlands were on both sides of no ii canal fig 8c apparently the newly reclaimed farmlands contributed heavily to the increase in tds in drainage water which could be even higher than the one under water saving farming 4 4 reduced surface water allocation and groundwater exploitation irrigation quotas in fig 2b decreased due to water diversion to downstream regions the decrease in irrigation quota from 1013 mm in 2004 to 524 mm in 2010 influenced crop water supply and leaching of salts out of the root zone soil profile zhao et al 2009 estimated that annual water requirement in cotton fields in tarim irrigation district under drip irrigation with plastic mulch was 543 mm also liu et al 2006 estimated that cotton water requirement in the nearby region was 625 mm yr under drip irrigation with plastic mulch in reference to the above studies irrigation quotas in the study area were close to or even less than water requirement for cotton this was probably the main reason why farmers extracted groundwater for field irrigation considering the fact that irrigation quota decreased by 48 and nearly reached field crop water requirement drainage water should have dropped to a much lower level thus the 44 drop in drainage water indicated that considerable extraction of groundwater had offset the decline in irrigation water hu et al 2017 for instance feike et al 2015 evaluated the percent of groundwater irrigation in aksu river basin and concluded that groundwater irrigated area increased from 2 in 2004 to 7 in 2010 the groundwater depth in aksu river basin dropped gradually due to expansion in irrigated area wang 2018 even fossil groundwater was exploited for irrigation in yingbaza region of tarim river thevs 2011 in the whole tarim river basin the area equipped for groundwater irrigation accounted for 10 20 in the total irrigated farmland siebert et al 2006 it is important to note that groundwater extraction should be strictly controlled within a reasonable amount to maintain natural vegetation growth thevs et al 2015 moreover government should prohibit farmers from drilling wells privately 4 5 implications for regional water management under the limited surface water supply government could seek other reliable policies to further enhance the management of the regional water resources for instance government could control water delivery to reclaimed new farmlands instead of simply decreasing irrigation quotas expansions of cultivated lands could be controlled through land water use regulations or by reducing agricultural subsidies which would affect the economic interests of native farmers it is illustrated in fig 2a that the highest expansion was in cash crops cotton and other cash crops for which the native farmers have obtained the highest economic incentives simultaneously the total amount of irrigation water used to meet water requirements of cash crops has distinctly improved therefore there is the need for compromises between economic interests and conservation of water resources it is very important to strengthen awareness of native farmers about sustainable use of water resources and preventing the endless reclamation of new cultivated farmlands on the other hand food security is critical for the growing population not only water shortage but also the fragile environment in northwest china make it difficult to reclaim more farmlands for food production zhang et al 2010 it is important to enhance land productivity on the existing farmland also improving water use efficiency can be highly critical for increased food production in arid areas deng et al 2006 another area of policy issue was water quality from fig 4 salt concentration in discharged water increased from 5 4 g l in 2003 to 7 1 g l in 2010 even drainage water salinity in 2003 was much higher than the accepted standard of 2 0 g l for irrigation water quality in china china national standadization management committee cnsmc 2006 even up till 2010 drainage water from farmlands was still highly saline 7 0 g l rhoades et al 1992 especially for direct discharge into tarim river cotton is not so tolerant to highly saline water conditions hanson et al 2006 and it is hard for even highly salt tolerant plants e g populus euphratica and tamarix ramosissima to grow well under such high salt water conditions zhang et al 2002 worse more is the fact that the soils irrigated with the saline water were prone to severe erosion and sedimentation ghadiri et al 2007 there was therefore the need to evaluate the implications of direct discharge of highly saline drainage water into tarim river for aquatic life in the downstream ecosystems evaporation ponds are successfully used to dispose saline drainage water in southern australia ahmed et al 2000 which can be fitted to the new drainage canals to discharge saline waters alternatively serial biological concentration systems can be used to manage salinity khan et al 2008 water quality in the study area should be monitored with the utmost vigilance in order to ensure good water availability in tarim river and the connected aquatic ecosystems 5 conclusions agricultural drainage water is an important source of water for downstream regions in arid areas agricultural activities constitute a critical element of drainage water quantity and quality in the study area drainage water decreased with intensification of water saving practices due to expansions in irrigated area by 57 8 and the reduction of irrigation quota by 48 based on the analyzed characteristics of agricultural drainage water in aksu river basin and using 2005 as the transition year drainage water volume dropped by 44 in 2010 over that in 2004 groundwater exploitation can be enhanced after limitations are put on surface water supply simultaneously drainage water quality deteriorated mainly due to expansion of new farmlands in spite of the application of water saving measures average tds in farmland drainage water in 2005 2010 was 7 6 g l as compared with 5 4 g l in 2003 2004 the main drainage water type in the study area was na cl driven by the dissolution of soluble salts and cation exchange the drastic increase in drainage water salinity can endanger the downstream ecosystems we deduced that restriction of reclamation of new farmlands was a rational water management strategy in the study area moreover the discharge of highly saline drainage water into tarim river needed further consideration in terms of the environmental implications it will cause for water supply and ecosystems in the downstream region acknowledgments this research was supported by the strategic priority research program of chinese

11171,stomatal closure is one of the first plant responses under a water deficit situation this leads to a decline in transpiration but also in the plant photosynthetic activity legume plants grown under symbiosis with rhizobium bacteria present an inhibition of nitrogen fixation that has been shown to occur even before this of photosynthesis one of the hypotheses to explain this rapid inhibition is the accumulation of nitrogen n compounds in nodules due to reduced transpiration which would provoke the n feedback inhibition of nitrogenase activity the current work analyzes the effects of changes in transpiration rates in the regulation of nitrogen fixation through the application of the anti transpirant vapor gard vg to pea pisum sativum l plants subjected to a progressive water deficit vg produced a rapid inhibition of nitrogen fixation upon application this inhibition however did not coincide with the accumulation of either amino acids or soluble carbohydrates observed at later drought stages in nodules results show that the application of vg has a beneficial albeit temporary effect in both maintaining the plant water status and apparent nitrogenase activity of nodulated pea plants under water deficit conditions keywords legume symbiosis water deficit pinolene vapor gard 1 introduction drought stress is one of the environmental factors most limiting crop productivity bray 1997 although there are several climate change scenarios the general consensus is that the frequency of severe drought conditions is likely to increase in the future dai 2012 at the physiological level water deficit is known to reduce the plant photosynthetic activity to activate stomatal closure by the integration of abscisic acid aba and hydraulic signaling as well as to cause metabolic impairment lawlor et al 1999 schroeder et al 2001 comstock 2002 dodd 2013 in legumes grown under symbiotic conditions drought leads to a rapid inhibition of symbiotic nitrogen fixation an inhibition that has been shown to occur before this of photosynthetic activity djekoun and planchon 1991 durand et al 1987 although several hypotheses have been drawn to explain the drought induced decline in nitrogen fixation the exact regulatory mechanisms remain unclear to date regulation based on a nitrogen feedback inhibition of nitrogenase activity has received much attention in the last decades this hypothesis was built on the observation that ureides and amino acids accumulate in leaves and nodules of drought stressed legumes de silva et al 1996 king and purcell 2005 ladrera et al 2007 serraj et al 2001 1998 sulieman et al 2010 2014 sulieman and tran 2013 vadez et al 2000 nonetheless recent works using a split root system have shown that amino acids accumulate in nodules before any measurable decline in nitrogen fixation both in temperate and tropical climate legumes gil quintana et al 2013a b one possible explanation for the observed accumulation of n compounds may involve alterations in long distance transport of metabolites between aerial and underground plant tissues mediated by transpiration serraj et al 2001 walsh 1990 however the influence of transpiration in long distance metabolite transport and its effects on the drought induced inhibition of symbiotic nitrogen fixation have not been formally tested in the current work the effects of the application of the anti transpirant vapor gard vg have been investigated in nodulated pea plants subjected to a gradual water deficit treatment vg is a terpene polymer di 1 p menthene also known as pinolene that forms a thin film on leaves increasing resistance to water vapor loss and therefore reducing plant transpiration bender and lipe 1986 byari and okeefe 1982 and references therein the application of this compound has allowed us to test whether alterations in transpiration rates were associated to reduced long distance transport and consequently could explain the observed accumulation of c and n compounds in leaf and nodule tissue of drought stressed plants additionally we characterized the physiological plant responses to the application of the anti transpirant both under well watered and water deficit conditions results presented here provide insights into the role of transpiration in the regulation of nitrogen fixation and discusses the potential application of these compounds to reduce the negative effects of drought in nodulated legumes 2 material and methods 2 1 plant growth conditions and treatment application pea seeds pisum

and finally seven days after planting plants were watered three times a week with a nitrogen free nutrient solution rigaud and puppo 1975 2 2 application of vg and drought stress four week old plants were separated randomly into two sets the first set of plants was treated with a 0 2 v v solution of biopower bayer germany containing 6 7 w w 3 6 dioxaeicosylsulphate sodium salt and 20 1 w w 3 6

agrichem spain having 96 v v di 1 p menthene as active ingredient and 0 2 v v biopower subsequently each group was further divided into two subsets one of which was maintained under well watered conditions hereafter referred to as control plants while watering was withheld for the other subset of plants drought stressed plants plants were analyzed at day 0 day 1 day 2 day 3 and day 4 after the onset drought all measurements were independent biological replicates and were carried out inside the growth chamber starting three hours after the onset of the photoperiod to minimize day to day variations root leaf and nodule samples were collected snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at 80 c for further determinations 2 3 water relations leaf water potential ψw was measured in the first

subjected to drought stress to characterize the physiological effects of the vg treatment we monitored the levels of transpiration ψw stomatal conductance and water content of both pea plants under well watered and drought stress conditions application of the anti transpirant produced a rapid reduction of transpiration rates in treated plants starting at day 1 fig 1 a this reduction was maintained in vg treated drought stressed plants while in well watered plants the effect of the anti transpirant was partially lost at day 4 in the untreated set drought stress caused a significant drop in transpiration rates by the end of the experiment fig 1a in terms of stomatal aperture the film formed by the application of vg provoked a rapid decline in stomatal conductance that was maintained during the whole experiment in treated plants fig 1b untreated drought stressed plants showed a progressive reduction in stomatal conductance reaching values close to those of vg treated plants at day 4 fig 1b in parallel to the observed decline in stomatal conductance plants experiencing water deficit showed a gradual reduction in both leaf and nodule ψw values fig 1c and d respectively in contrast drought stressed plants treated with vg did not show a reduction in the levels of leaf ψw values until the last day of the drought period fig 1c while maintaining nodule ψw values close or above those of plants without water restriction fig 1d regarding the water content of plants although there was variability at the aerial part level fig 2 a application of vg prevented the drought induced reduction in water content in the underground organs of plants treated with the anti transpirant fig 2b and c 3 2 changes in transpiration rates affect symbiotic nitrogen fixation independently of the accumulation of carbon and nitrogen compounds in different tissues in untreated plants drought stress caused a progressive decline in the levels of apparent nitrogenase activity ana while application of the anti transpirant vg led to early declines in ana rates both in control and drought stressed treated plants fig 3 at day 3 and 4 however this vg induced reduction in ana was reversed and there were no significant differences between the ana values recorded for vg treated plants under water deficit and well watered plants fig 3 transpiration and transport of solutes across the plant are two closely related physiological processes therefore we investigated the changes in the content of soluble carbohydrate in leaves roots and nodules of pea plants treated with vg under drought conditions table 1 both the variations in the content of fructose and glucose presented similar trends in the aerial part showing a progressive accumulation under drought conditions in untreated plants this accumulation of soluble carbohydrates was observed in plants treated with the anti transpirant only at day 4 of drought sucrose levels in contrast did not show a clear trend during the experiment although drought stressed plants presented higher levels of this compound in all the tissues tested in nodules sucrose was found the main soluble carbohydrate with average values of around 50 μmol g 1 dw in well watered plants while fructose and glucose were detected at very low levels drought stress caused a moderate accumulation of sucrose in nodules an accumulation that was less pronounced in nodules of plants treated with the anti transpirant vg to understand whether these variations in the rates of ana could be related to the levels of n metabolites in the plant the content of the total soluble pool of amino acids was measured in different tissues table 2 similarly to the trends observed for carbohydrates water deficit led to the gradual accumulation of amino acids in all the tissue tested in leaves this accumulation was significant from day 3 onwards while in roots amino acids started to accumulate at day 2 nodules in contrast presented significant differences only at the last day of the experiment in samples of plants treated with vg however this accumulation was attenuated being significant only during the last days of the experiment in a parallel series of experiments foliar application of a 15 μm solution of the fungal toxin fusicoccin a well known activator of stomatal opening led to the exacerbation of the severity of drought in most of the parameters tested data not shown application of fusicoccin to plants with limited water availability caused a rapid decline in ana rates as early as day 1 after the onset of drought which occurred even prior to any significant decline in the plant water status parameters checked this early inhibition in nitrogen fixation in fusicoccin treated drought plants however did not correlate to changes either in the concentration of sucrose or soluble amino acids in the different plant tissues tested 4 discussion in the present study we employed the anti transpirant vg as a tool to analyze the effects of reduced transpiration in the regulation of symbiotic nitrogen fixation and long distance metabolite transport in drought stressed pea plants anti transpirant compounds used in agriculture are polymers that form a thin film on the leaf surface to temporarily reduce plant transpiration the application of these compounds received a considerable amount of attention in the 60 70 s due to their potential to save significant amounts of water and reduce plant damage cause by water deficits plaut et al 2004 however the fact that several studies suggested that film forming polymers would inhibit photosynthesis and therefore crop productivity to a greater extent than transpiration partially discouraged investigations in the field kramer and boyer 1995 nonetheless subsequent works have shown increased crop yields and improved plant tolerance to drought upon anti transpirant application under water limiting conditions bender and lipe 1986 brillante et al 2016 byari and okeefe 1982 del amor et al 2010 faralli et al 2017 iriti et al 2009 and references thereafter anti transpirants have been also used to decrease stress associated with other abiotic stresses such as ozone damage francini et al 2011 as well as to enhance plant resistance to physical damage and fungal infections percival and boyle 2009 sutherland and walters 2002 in the current work we observed that drought stressed plants treated with vg were able to maintain water status parameters similar to those of well watered plants in the short term application of the anti transpirant vg provoked a rapid reduction in the levels of transpiration fig 1a and stomatal conductance fig 1b both in well watered and drought stressed plants two way anova analyses indicate that in general only at day 4 there is an effect of the water regimen applied to treated plants a stage at which the anti transpirant effectiveness starts diminishing in terms of reduced transpiration and stomatal conductance thus an improved drought response in vg treated plants experiencing water deficit was observed during the first three days of the experiment with plants that presented ψw and water content values comparable to those of plants under full water availability conditions fig 1c and d fig 2 we further analyzed whether changes in transpiration were associated to an inhibition of symbiotic nitrogen fixation and or to transport of c and n compounds through the plant application of the anti transpirant vg induced an early inhibition of ana at day 1 fig 3 in vg treated plants nitrogen fixation rates were however restored to control values at day 3 both in the set of plants kept under well watered conditions and in those under water deficit fig 3 therefore we observed a beneficial effect of the application of the anti transpirant both in maintaining the plant water status as well as active symbiotic nitrogen fixation rates in drought stressed pea plants in the short term it is worth noting that the observed changes in ana were independent of the plant transpiration rates or the levels of amino acids in the different tissues fig 1a and table 2 respectively these observations are in contrast to earlier works in which reduced transpiration was suggested to provoke an accumulation of n compounds in nodules under drought stress as a consequence of decreased xylem transport serraj et al 2001 and references thereafter therefore the rapid reduction in ana levels upon the application of the anti transpirant vg in the present work could not be explained by the hypothesis of a n feedback regulation of symbiotic nitrogen fixation carbon limitation through inhibition of sucrose synthase activity protein or expression levels has been also discussed as a factor contributing to the observed drought induced inhibition of ana in different legume species gonzález et al 1995 marino et al 2006 ladrera et al 2007 larrainzar et al 2009 as a consequence the inhibition of sucrose synthase has been shown to lead to an accumulation of sucrose in nodules of drought stressed plants however in the present work application of the anti transpirant actually induced a transient decline in the content of sucrose at day 1 discarding a limitation at the level of sucrose synthase in this case furthermore the application of the stomatal opening inducer fusicoccin led to an early inhibition of nitrogen fixation that did not correlate to changes in the levels of sucrose or soluble amino acids in the various plant tissues analyzed data not shown thus using two contrasting pharmacological approaches to manipulate plant transpiration our results suggest that the inhibition of ana is not mediated by c and n transport based regulatory mechanisms previous studies have suggested that vg application at concentrations of 6 v v was effective for a period of 30 40 days as a strategy to extend the cultivation of sweet corn during the dry season in the tropics plaut et al 2004 more recent work however estimates that application of 1 v v vg may be effective for a period of 20 25 days to reduce water stress in oilseed rape under field conditions faralli et al 2016 in order to test for how long we could observe the protective effect of vg under our experimental conditions we also carried out a second experiment extending the drought period for three additional days data not shown this extended experiment showed that the beneficial effects of the anti transpirant in maintaining the plant water status and nitrogen fixation were only temporary parameters such as transpiration and water content of different tissues were significantly reduced from day 5 onwards while ana values of vg treated drought stressed plants were comparable to those of untreated plants by day 6 therefore although treatment with vg can be considered beneficial to temporarily maintain the plant water status and active nitrogen fixation rates in pea plants under water deficit conditions when the drought period is extended the protection of the anti transpirant appears to be lost 5 conclusions in conclusion our work shows that artificial alterations of plant transpiration produce a rapid temporal decline in the rates of nitrogen fixation in pea plants and that this decline could not be explained by earlier proposed n feedback regulation mechanisms in agreement with previous studies gil quintana et al 2013a b the observed accumulation of c and n compounds at later drought stages appears to be a general drought stress response not necessarily related to the regulation of nitrogen fixation or associated with reduced transpiration rates finally application of film forming polymers such as vg partially attenuates the negative effects of drought stress of nodulated pea plants although the protective effect of the anti transpirant is only temporary and it is largely dependent on the experimental conditions in which it is applied acknowledgments this

11171,stomatal closure is one of the first plant responses under a water deficit situation this leads to a decline in transpiration but also in the plant photosynthetic activity legume plants grown under symbiosis with rhizobium bacteria present an inhibition of nitrogen fixation that has been shown to occur even before this of photosynthesis one of the hypotheses to explain this rapid inhibition is the accumulation of nitrogen n compounds in nodules due to reduced transpiration which would provoke the n feedback inhibition of nitrogenase activity the current work analyzes the effects of changes in transpiration rates in the regulation of nitrogen fixation through the application of the anti transpirant vapor gard vg to pea pisum sativum l plants subjected to a progressive water deficit vg produced a rapid inhibition of nitrogen fixation upon application this inhibition however did not coincide with the accumulation of either amino acids or soluble carbohydrates observed at later drought stages in nodules results show that the application of vg has a beneficial albeit temporary effect in both maintaining the plant water status and apparent nitrogenase activity of nodulated pea plants under water deficit conditions keywords legume symbiosis water deficit pinolene vapor gard 1 introduction drought stress is one of the environmental factors most limiting crop productivity bray 1997 although there are several climate change scenarios the general consensus is that the frequency of severe drought conditions is likely to increase in the future dai 2012 at the physiological level water deficit is known to reduce the plant photosynthetic activity to activate stomatal closure by the integration of abscisic acid aba and hydraulic signaling as well as to cause metabolic impairment lawlor et al 1999 schroeder et al 2001 comstock 2002 dodd 2013 in legumes grown under symbiotic conditions drought leads to a rapid inhibition of symbiotic nitrogen fixation an inhibition that has been shown to occur before this of photosynthetic activity djekoun and planchon 1991 durand et al 1987 although several hypotheses have been drawn to explain the drought induced decline in nitrogen fixation the exact regulatory mechanisms remain unclear to date regulation based on a nitrogen feedback inhibition of nitrogenase activity has received much attention in the last decades this hypothesis was built on the observation that ureides and amino acids accumulate in leaves and nodules of drought stressed legumes de silva et al 1996 king and purcell 2005 ladrera et al 2007 serraj et al 2001 1998 sulieman et al 2010 2014 sulieman and tran 2013 vadez et al 2000 nonetheless recent works using a split root system have shown that amino acids accumulate in nodules before any measurable decline in nitrogen fixation both in temperate and tropical climate legumes gil quintana et al 2013a b one possible explanation for the observed accumulation of n compounds may involve alterations in long distance transport of metabolites between aerial and underground plant tissues mediated by transpiration serraj et al 2001 walsh 1990 however the influence of transpiration in long distance metabolite transport and its effects on the drought induced inhibition of symbiotic nitrogen fixation have not been formally tested in the current work the effects of the application of the anti transpirant vapor gard vg have been investigated in nodulated pea plants subjected to a gradual water deficit treatment vg is a terpene polymer di 1 p menthene also known as pinolene that forms a thin film on leaves increasing resistance to water vapor loss and therefore reducing plant transpiration bender and lipe 1986 byari and okeefe 1982 and references therein the application of this compound has allowed us to test whether alterations in transpiration rates were associated to reduced long distance transport and consequently could explain the observed accumulation of c and n compounds in leaf and nodule tissue of drought stressed plants additionally we characterized the physiological plant responses to the application of the anti transpirant both under well watered and water deficit conditions results presented here provide insights into the role of transpiration in the regulation of nitrogen fixation and discusses the potential application of these compounds to reduce the negative effects of drought in nodulated legumes 2 material and methods 2 1 plant growth conditions and treatment application pea seeds pisum

and finally seven days after planting plants were watered three times a week with a nitrogen free nutrient solution rigaud and puppo 1975 2 2 application of vg and drought stress four week old plants were separated randomly into two sets the first set of plants was treated with a 0 2 v v solution of biopower bayer germany containing 6 7 w w 3 6 dioxaeicosylsulphate sodium salt and 20 1 w w 3 6 dioxaoctadecylsulphate sodium salt this set of plants used as a negative control untreated plants the second set of plants was treated with a solution containing 2 5 v v of the anti transpirant vg bio agrichem spain having 96 v v di 1 p menthene as active ingredient and 0 2 v v biopower subsequently each group was further divided into two subsets one of which was maintained under well watered conditions hereafter referred to as control plants while watering was withheld for the other subset of plants drought stressed plants plants were analyzed at day 0 day 1 day 2 day 3 and day 4 after the onset drought all measurements were independent biological replicates and were carried out inside the growth chamber starting three hours after the onset of the photoperiod to minimize day to day variations root leaf and nodule samples were collected snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at 80 c for further determinations 2 3 water relations leaf water potential ψw was measured in the first

subjected to drought stress to characterize the physiological effects of the vg treatment we monitored the levels of transpiration ψw stomatal conductance and water content of both pea plants under well watered and drought stress conditions application of the anti transpirant produced a rapid reduction of transpiration rates in treated plants starting at day 1 fig 1 a this reduction was maintained in vg treated drought stressed plants while in well watered plants the effect of the anti transpirant was partially lost at day 4 in the untreated set drought stress caused a significant drop in transpiration rates by the end of the experiment fig 1a in terms of stomatal aperture the film formed by the application of vg provoked a rapid decline in stomatal conductance that was maintained during the whole experiment in treated plants fig 1b untreated drought stressed plants showed a progressive reduction in stomatal conductance reaching values close to those of vg treated plants at day 4 fig 1b in parallel to the observed decline in stomatal conductance plants experiencing water deficit showed a gradual reduction in both leaf and nodule ψw values fig 1c and d respectively in contrast drought stressed plants treated with vg did not show a reduction in the levels of leaf ψw values until the last day of the drought period fig 1c while maintaining nodule ψw values close or above those of plants without water restriction fig 1d regarding the water content of plants although there was variability at the aerial part level fig 2 a application of vg prevented the drought induced reduction in water content in the underground organs of plants treated with the anti transpirant fig 2b and c 3 2 changes in transpiration rates affect symbiotic nitrogen fixation independently of the accumulation of carbon and nitrogen compounds in different tissues in untreated plants drought stress caused a progressive decline in the levels of apparent nitrogenase activity ana while application of the anti transpirant vg led to early declines in ana rates both in control and drought stressed treated plants fig 3 at day 3 and 4 however this vg induced reduction in ana was reversed and there were no significant differences between the ana values recorded for vg treated plants under water deficit and well watered plants fig 3 transpiration and transport of solutes across the plant are two closely related physiological processes therefore we investigated the changes in the content of soluble carbohydrate in leaves roots and nodules of pea plants treated with vg under drought conditions table 1 both the variations in the content of fructose and glucose presented similar trends in the aerial part showing a progressive accumulation under drought conditions in untreated plants this accumulation of soluble carbohydrates was observed in plants treated with the anti transpirant only at day 4 of drought sucrose levels in contrast did not show a clear trend during the experiment although drought stressed plants presented higher levels of this compound in all the tissues tested in nodules sucrose was found the main soluble carbohydrate with average values of around 50 μmol g 1 dw in well watered plants while fructose and glucose were detected at very low levels drought stress caused a moderate accumulation of sucrose in nodules an accumulation that was less pronounced in nodules of plants treated with the anti transpirant vg to understand whether these variations in the rates of ana could be related to the levels of n metabolites in the plant the content of the total soluble pool of amino acids was measured in different tissues table 2 similarly to the trends observed for carbohydrates water deficit led to the gradual accumulation of amino acids in all the tissue tested in leaves this accumulation was significant from day 3 onwards while in roots amino acids started to accumulate at day 2 nodules in contrast presented significant differences only at the last day of the experiment in samples of plants treated with vg however this accumulation was attenuated being significant only during the last days of the experiment in a parallel series of experiments foliar application of a 15 μm solution of the fungal toxin fusicoccin a well known activator of stomatal opening led to the exacerbation of the severity of drought in most of the parameters tested data not shown application of fusicoccin to plants with limited water availability caused a rapid decline in ana rates as early as day 1 after the onset of drought which occurred even prior to any significant decline in the plant water status parameters checked this early inhibition in nitrogen fixation in fusicoccin treated drought plants however did not correlate to changes either in the concentration of sucrose or soluble amino acids in the different plant tissues tested 4 discussion in the present study we employed the anti transpirant vg as a tool to analyze the effects of reduced transpiration in the regulation of symbiotic nitrogen fixation and long distance metabolite transport in drought stressed pea plants anti transpirant compounds used in agriculture are polymers that form a thin film on the leaf surface to temporarily reduce plant transpiration the application of these compounds received a considerable amount of attention in the 60 70 s due to their potential to save significant amounts of water and reduce plant damage cause by water deficits plaut et al 2004 however the fact that several studies suggested that film forming polymers would inhibit photosynthesis and therefore crop productivity to a greater extent than transpiration partially discouraged investigations in the field kramer and boyer 1995 nonetheless subsequent works have shown increased crop yields and improved plant tolerance to drought upon anti transpirant application under water limiting conditions bender and lipe 1986 brillante et al 2016 byari and okeefe 1982 del amor et al 2010 faralli et al 2017 iriti et al 2009 and references thereafter anti transpirants have been also used to decrease stress associated with other abiotic stresses such as ozone damage francini et al 2011 as well as to enhance plant resistance to physical damage and fungal infections percival and boyle 2009 sutherland and walters 2002 in the current work we

vegetable and fruit plant production yet an efficient practicable and cost effective drip fertigation system is lacking for maize production a two year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the

worldwide barrett 2010 continuing population and consumption growth will mean that the global demand for food will increase for at least another 40 years godfray et al 2010 however agriculture faces great challenges of global climate change resource depletion and environmental degradation chen et al 2014b drought has been one of the world s most widespread climate disasters affecting agricultural production pelling et al 2004 it is reported that area percentages of high and very high agricultural drought hazard zones are approximately 23 57 and 27 19 of the total agricultural area in the world geng et al 2016 in china water resources are also in serious shortage li et al 2009 improving water use efficiency is important to safeguard food security sun et al 2016 because of the enormous contribution to increased crop production fertilizer is used in every region of the world and the application has been enhanced by farmers all over the world motesharezadeh et al 2017 however fertilizer use efficiency is low all over the world in china for example the mean use efficiency of n p k fertilizer is only 27 2 11 1 and 31 1 respectively zhang et al 2008 therefore there is a need for efficient use of water and fertilizer resources to ensure sustainable food production drip irrigation is one of the most efficient methods of watering crops this technique offers improved yields requires less water decreases the cost of tillage and reduces the amount of fertilizers applied to the crop lekakis et al 2011 drip irrigation is widely accepted for crop production in areas of water scarcity fanish et al 2011 numerous reports have summarized the potential advantages of drip irrigation compared to other irrigation methods such as furrow alternate furrow and check basin irrigation methods for example drip irrigation increases water use efficiency crop yields and quality and improves fertilizer and other chemical application hernandez et al 1991 phene et al 1991 camp 1998 pablo et al 2007 sampathkumar and pandian 2011 drip irrigation is often used in the production of high value produce such as fruits nuts and vegetables hebbar et al 2004 rajput and patel 2006 devasirvatham 2009 however there is growing interest in applying drip irrigation to lower value field crops such as cotton and maize hodgson et al 1990 ünlü et al 2011 wan et al 2012 in the united states some farmers use subsurface drip irrigation because the fertigation system can be used for several years lamm and trooien 2003 enciso medina et al 2011 however previous studies indicate that the effect of this technique for maize crops is not stable lamm 2016 summarized the findings of more than a dozen studies which demonstrated that under subsurface drip irrigation crop yields range widely from 51 to 30 with an average positive increase of 4 across all studies drip fertigation is a modern innovative irrigation method by which fertilizers are applied along with irrigation water through a drip system to increase fertilizer use efficiency and boost crop yields bar yosef 1999 solaimalai et al 2005 fanish et al 2011 a properly designed drip fertigation system can maximize crop water and nutrient uptake while minimizing nutrient leaching gardenas et al 2005 drip fertigation can be applied to the soil surface and subsurface in some cold areas in china drip fertigation is used together with plastic mulching ma et al 2004 2007 wei and chen 2011 different drip fertilization methods can have varying effects on nutrient and water distribution in the soil and plant root growth and therefore plant nutrient uptake for example it was found that compared to surface drip fertigation subsurface drip fertigation moved the center of the root density to a deeper depth and increased ear yield hernandez et al 1991 phene et al 1991 however the advantage of subsurface drip fertigation is found to closely relate to soil type in highly permeable coarse textured soils water and nutrients move quickly downwards from the emitter making it difficult to wet the near surface zone if emitters are buried too deep cote et al 2003 recently many research efforts have been aimed at improvement of corn yield liu et al 2014 irrigation water efficiency liu et al 2011 assessment optimal n level n management and yield increasing potential under drip irrigation in the northeast of china sui et al 2018 wang et al 2017 however very little research has been done on the different drip irrigation methods to assess corn yield nutrient and water productivity and nutritional properties under different soil types the northeast china plain is china s major maize production area accounting for 30 35 of the country s production yang et al 2007 zhao and yang 2009 chen et al 2014a maize in this area is rain fed precipitation varies widely between seasons and years and water deficit frequently occurs during the maize growth season dong et al 2011 lu et al 2014 especially in the west part of northeast china where the soil is mostly sandy and the weather is cold in the spring ma et al 2004 zhao and yang 2009 yang et al 2015 fertilizer use efficiency is low in this area because fertilizers are overused and typically all the fertilizers are applied at planting gao et al 2010 to face these challenges the chinese government has encouraged the farmers to adopt various drip irrigation and fertigation methods to increase maize yield while reducing water and fertilizer input nevertheless less research has been done to compare the effect of the different fertigation methods on maize yield and water and nutrient use efficiency under different soil types and weather conditions also it is not clear which of the methods is cost effective and more practicable these information is valuable not only for the farmers to optimize their fertigation system but also for the government to make reasonable subsidy polices supporting the farmers to setup fertigation systems in the present study a two year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of different drip fertigation methods on maize yield and water and nutrient use efficiency in sandy and clay soils in northeast china 2

using urea 46 n and a soluble compound fertilizer n p2o5 k2o 30 6 12 from gap agricultural technology company the fertilizer amount for each application is recorded in table 1 2 3 irrigation system and irrigation scheduling the maize was planted in a twin row pattern fig 1s that is the distance between the two rows is 40 and 80 cm alternately the main pipes were laid vertical to the row direction at the front of the plots the capillary pipes were only placed between the narrow rows for subsurface drip irrigation the drip line was installed at a depth of approximately 30 cm below the soil surface the emitters were spaced along the drip lateral at 30 cm apart and the emitter discharge rate was 1 05 l h 1 a pump was provided for each plot in 2014 the maize hybrid cv liangyu 11 was sown on 6th may and harvested on 30th september whilst in 2015 the maize was sown on 2nd may and harvested 1st october planting density was 70 000 plants ha weeds diseases and pests were well controlled using herbicides and pesticides irrigation amounts and timings were scheduled to supplement rainfall and meet crop water requirements e g crop evapotranspiration detailed irrigation records are shown in table 1 the basic soil physicochemical properties are listed in table 3s 2 4 maize yield yield components and nutrient uptake on physiological maturity of the crop the yield and its components were determined by harvesting an area of 20 m2 grain was oven dried to determine grain moisture at harvest grain yield was standardized to 14 moisture ten plants from each plot were harvested randomly to determine the grain number per cob and 100 grain weight for plant dry matter and nutrient analyses plants were cut at the soil surface and separated into leaves stems comprising the leaf sheath tassels and ear shoots and grains at v8 v12 vt r3 and r6 stages three plants were then randomly taken from each plot the samples were dried in an oven at a temperature of 70 c and were then weighed dry matter accumulation of the plant was calculated then the samples were ground into powder for measuring the nutrient content n concentration was determined by the semi micro kjeldahl method p was measured spectrophotometrically using the molybdo vanadophosphoric acid method k was determined by flame photometry bao 2000 the leaf area index lai refers to the total leaf area per sampling area the leaf area was calculated as leaf length maximum width 0 75 at v8 vt and r3 stages lu et al 2014 2 5 soil nitrate as nitrogen concentration and residue two soil samples from each plot were collected randomly at 0 80 cm beneath the soil surface using an auger at v8 v12 vt r3 grown stages at sowing and final harvest two soil samples were collected randomly from each plot at 0 200 cm below the soil surface using an auger each sample was divided into four layers at 20 cm intervals at v8 v12 vt r3 stages 0 80 cm and was divided into ten layers at 20 cm intervals at sowing and final harvest stages 0 200 cm soil samples were extracted with 0 01 mol l 1 calcium chloride and analyzed for nitrate as nitrogen no3 n using a continuous flow analyzer traacs 2000 bran and luebbe

volumetric water content klute 1988 total water consumption actual crop evapotranspiration under the different irrigation treatments was calculated using the soil water balance equation el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 zhang et al 2017 et p i cr r d δs where et represents seasonal crop evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm i is the amount of irrigation water cr is the capillary rise mm r is the amount of run off mm d is the amount of drainage water below the 200 cm soil layer mm and δs is the difference between soil water content values in 0 200 cm soil depth at planting and at the end of harvesting mm because the soil surface was flat and the groundwater table was 10 m below the soil surface the values of r and cr were considered negligible when the sum of the soil water storage sw in the 0 to 200 cm soil profile and the precipitation was greater than the field capacity fc it was assumed that the excess water percolated into the deeper zones because the rainfall was low in 2014 and 2015 d was also neglected in this study 2 7 fertilizer and water productivity partial fertilizer productivity pfp is calculated as pfp kg kg 1 grain yield nutrient input in which nutrient input

homogeneity of error variances the data yield yield components nutrient accumulation pfp water productivity lai dry matter accumulation nutrient uptake rate and soil no3 n content across soil type year of production and nutrient management strategy were pooled for a variance analysis with a three factor variance analysis program using the anova procedure sas stat sas institute 1988 the soil type year of production and nutrient management were considered as fixed effects the data for n residue total n uptake and apparent n loss across nutrient management strategies and soil type were subjected to a variance analysis with a two factor variance analysis program in sas the means were compared using fisher s protected lsd at a probability level of 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil moisture content previously it was found that the permanent wilting points of the sandy and clay soil in the experimental region is 6 4 and 10 1 respectively which is equivalent to 35 and 40 of the field capacity respectively li et al 2017 in 2014 severe droughts occurred mainly 10 days before and 20 days after vt 20 july under the ck treatment on sandy soil the soil moisture content at the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers was lower than 8 from 1 july v12 to 15 august r3 and the soil water content remained 4 5 6 from mid july to mid august fig 2 in addition the soil water content at the 40 60 cm and 60 80 cm layers decreased gradually for the di sdf ssdf and sdfp treatments under which water was supplemented via drip irrigation the soil moisture content at the 0 80 cm soil layer remained at 7 12 from mid july vt to late september r6 however for the ssdf treatment soil moisture content at the0 20 cm soil layer was lower than under di sdf and sdfp during the vt and late filling stages in 2015 rainfall was very low during the maize growth season except for mid august the soil moisture content was lower under the ck treatment than the other treatments throughout the maize growth period the clay soil had a high field water capacity ranging from 24 to 28 in the 0 80 cm soil layer table 1s under the ck treatment in 2014 the soil moisture content remained above 12 at 0 20 cm soil depth above 14 at 20 40 cm soil depth and above 16 at 40 80 cm soil depth under the same treatment in 2015 the soil moisture content was lower at 0 20 cm deep than that observed in 2014 at 9 18 during the whole growth period the soil moisture content under the di sdf ssdf and sdfp treatments was higher than for the ck treatment at the vt and late filling stage especially at 0 40 cm depth soil moisture content was lowest under the ssdf treatment at 0 20 cm soil depth compared to the other treatments 3 2 soil no3 n content soil no3 n was affected by soil type year of production and management strategy during the various growth stages the interactive effect between soil year and management strategy was mostly not significant table 2s so the effect of different management methods was analyzed by the average value across two years fig 3 in sandy soil soil no3 n content under ck and di was higher than under sdf ssdf and sdfp in 0 80 cm soil depth at v8 stage and in 0 20 cm soil depth at vt stage but soil no3 n content under sdf ssdf and sdfp was slightly or significantly higher than under ck and di in 0 40 cm soil depth from filling r3 to maturity r6 stage in clay soil soil no3 n content under ck and di was higher than under sdf ssdf and sdfp in 0 60 cm soil depth at v8 stage and there was no significant difference between treatments in most soil depths at vt r3 and r6 stage except that ssdf was higher than ck and di in 20 40 cm soil depth at r3 and r6 stage 3 3 nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k uptake rate and accumulation in the plant total aboveground accumulation of n p and k was affected by soil type year of production management strategy and soil management except for nitrogen but not by the interaction of year management or year soil management table 2s so the two years data were averaged to analyze the dynamic nutrient uptake rate through the growth season and nutrient accumulation in pre and post silking stages in the two soils figs 4 6 and table 2 in the sandy soil compared to sdf ssdf and sdfp n uptake rate under ck and di was higher from v8 to v12 stage but lower from vt to r3 stage fig 4 therefore n accumulation in sdf ssdf and sdfp was lower at the pre silking stage and higher at the post silking stage table 2 the n uptake rate of di was higher than that of ck from vt to r3 stage fig 4 resulting greater post silking n accumulation under di compared to ck there was no difference in total n accumulation between the di sdf ssdf sdfp treatments all were higher than that of ck in clay soil the n uptake rate was similar under all treatments at the pre silking stage but was lower under ck and di compared to sdf ssdf and sdfp from vt to r3 stage as a result post silking n accumulation was greater under sdf ssdf and sdfp than in di and ck di also increased post silking n accumulation compared to ck for both soil types total n accumulation was similar among the di sdf ssdf and sdfp treatments all higher than under ck in both soil types there was no significant difference in phosphorus uptake rate among the treatments except for vt to r3 stage under the ck treatment phosphorus uptake rate from vt to r3 stage was significantly lower than under the di sdf ssdf and sdfp treatments fig 5 as a result the total phosphorus accumulation levels of the di sdf ssdf and sdfp treatments were all higher than that of ck table 2 in sandy soil the phosphorus uptake rate of ssdf was slightly lower than sdf and sdfp from v12 to r6 stage and the total phosphorus accumulation at harvest was significantly lower than sdf and sdfp there was no significant difference in phosphorus uptake rate at whole growth period and phosphorus accumulation at harvest between the di sdf ssdf and sdfp treatments in clay soil potassium was mainly taken up before vt and the net potassium uptake rate was negative at late r3 stage suggesting potassium loss from the plants at this late stage generally potassium loss from the plants occurred earlier under the ck treatment than in the other treatments potassium was lost from the plants by leaching and or biomass loss fig 6 in both soil types di and sdf increased potassium uptake rate from vt to r3 stage and the total potassium accumulation at harvest compared to ck but no significant difference between sdf and di in sandy soil ssdf did not increase the total potassium accumulation compared to ck and significantly reduced the total potassium accumulation compared to sdf in clay soil ssdf significantly increased the total potassium accumulation compared to ck but significantly reduced the total potassium accumulation compared to sdfp table 2 3 4 leaf area index lai and dry matter accumulation there was no significant difference in lai between two years in clay soil but the lai in 2014 was significantly lower than that in 2015 in sandy soil table 5s lai was no affected by the interaction of management year and soil year management table 2s therefore the data of lai in 2014 and 2015 were averaged to evaluate the effect of managements in two soils fig 7 in sandy soil sdfp increased lai at the v8 stage di and all the fertigation treatments increased lai at r3 but had similar lai as ck at vt fig 7 lai under ssdf was lower than that of sdf at r3 in clay soil lai under di and ck was the same throughout the maize growth season lower than that of all the drip fertigation treatments at r3 but not at the vegetative stage in sandy soil compared to the other treatments dry matter accumulation under ck was lower during the post silking stage but not during the pre silking stage fig 8 post silking dry matter accumulation in sdf and sdfp was greater than that in ssdf and di similarly in clay soil no difference in dry matter accumulation was observed at the pre silking stage among all treatments either during the post silking stage dry matter accumulation under ck was lower than under all other treatments in 2014 no difference in final dry matter accumulation was found between di sdf ssdf and sdfp in 2015 the dry matter accumulation in di was significantly lower than that of sdfp but similar as that of sdf and ssdf the difference between the three fertigation treatments was not significant 3 5 maize yield and yield components grain yield was affected by all treatments and all variable interactions except for year management and soil year management there was no significant difference in yields between two years in sandy soil but the yield in 2014 was significantly higher than that in 2015 in clay soil table 5s the two years data was averaged to analyze the management effect in the two soils table 3 in sandy soil di increased grain yields by 28 sdf ssdf and sdfp further increased grain yields compared to ck by 41 36 and 41 respectively table 3 under di 100 grain weight and the number of grains per ear were increased by 10 and 12 compared to ck no difference was found in the number of ears per hectare under sdf 100 grain weight the number of grains per ear and the number of ears per hectare were significantly increased by 21 11 and 5 compared to ck the average maize yield under sdf and sdfp were significantly increased by 10 and 10 compared to di mainly due to the higher 100 grain weight but no significant difference between ssdf and di there were no significant differences in yield and yield components between sdf ssdf and sdfp in clay soil di sdf ssdf and sdfp significantly increased grain yield with an average increase of 12 17 13 and 18 compared to ck table 3 the number of ears per hectare under di was slightly greater and the 100 grain weight and the number of grains per ear were significantly higher than ck by 6 and 4 the number of ears per hectare and the 100 grain weight under sdf were higher than those under ck by 6 and 10 and the number of grains per ear was slightly greater there were no significant differences in yield between di sdf and ssdf grain yield under sdfp was greater than under di by 6 however no difference in yields was found between sdf ssdf and sdfp 3 6 pfp and water productivity pfp and water productivity were affected by soil type year management strategy and soil management but not by the interaction of year management and soil year management table 2s in sandy soil the pfp in 2015 was significantly higher than that in 2014 while there was no significant difference in pfp between the two years in clay soil table 5s for different fertigation treatments because the fertilizer amount for each treatment was the same the difference in pfp between treatments was similar to that of yield table 4 the values of pfp in the two years were averaged to analyze the management effect in two soil types table 4 in sandy soil di increased pfp by 28 compared to ck and sdf ssdf and sdfp increased pfp by 41 36 and 41 respectively compared with ck there was no significant difference in pfp between the three drip fertigation methods in clay soil di sdf ssdf and sdfp significantly increased pfp by12 18 13 and 19 compared to ck respectively there was no significant difference in pfp between the three drip fertigation methods in sandy soil there was no difference in water consumption between the di sdf ssdf and sdfp treatments all had higher values than that of ck water productivity under di was the same as under ck water productivity under sdf ssdf and sdfp was higher than under ck by 17 8 and 14 respectively there was no significant difference in water productivity between the three drip fertigation methods in clay soil water consumption under di and sdf was higher than under ck but there was no difference in water consumption between ssdf sdfp and ck there was no difference in water productivity between di and ck however water productivity under sdf ssdf and sdfp was higher than under ck by 11 8 and 14 respectively furthermore water productivity under sdfp was higher than ssdf in both soil types the water productivity in 2015 is significantly higher than in 2014 table 5s mainly due to the decrease in rainfall in 2015 and the decrease in total water consumption 3 7 soil no3 n residue and apparent n loss in both soils compared to ck di reduced apparent n loss fertigation treatments reduced apparent n loss at greater extent than di table 5 in general di and drip fertigation treatment did not affect soil no3 n residue in the soil at the end of the experiment 3 8 cost benefit analysis of different management methods in sandy soil the net profit of di sdf ssdf and sdfp was 13 28 31 and 10 higher than that of ck respectively table 6 in spite of the high input of the drip irrigation system sdfp management had lowest benefit because its highest costs which comes from the additional inputs for buying the plastic film machinery laying of the plastic film as well as the cleaning of the residual plastic film each year in clay soil there is essentially no advantage in net profit for either di or fertigation managements compared to the ck for sdfp even a 9 reduction in net benefit was observed 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of drip irrigation and drip fertigation management water optimization via di increased maize yield significantly the yield increase in di was mainly due to the increase of grain number per ear and 100 grain weight which is most likely explained by the increasing soil humidity from v12 through to maturity fig 2 rainfall from 1 july v12 to 13 august r3 was only 21 mm in 2014 and 42 mm in 2015 fig 1 and soil moisture content was very low in both years fig 2 during this period water supply is crucial for seed setting pollination and early grain development water deficiency during this stage increases the interval between flowering and vt and reduces the number of grains per ear bai et al 2004 2009 nutrient availability and leaf longevity in the soil was closely related to water conditions more grain number per ear and heavier grain weight in di should be related to the increase in the uptake of n p and k table 2 and also lai at r3 stages as well due to increase in yield di increased fertilizer productivity of n p and k significantly table 4 di did not increase the water productivity of maize because water consumption increased with the increase of grain yield compared to ck and di sdf provides a tool for synchronous improvement of water and nutrient management in sandy soil sdf increased maize yield to a greater extent than di did table 3 one possible reason is that the post silking uptake of n and p was higher in sdf compared to di figs 4 and 5 similarly sdf greatly improved soil water supply and also soil n supply at later growth as indicated by the higher soil no3 n content under sdf compared to ck and di in 0 40 cm soil depth from filling r3 to maturity r6 stage figs 2 and 3 more post silking nutrient uptake and reasonable water supply under sdf may have resulted in the longer leaf longevity and therefore greater post silking dry matter accumulation so sdf had higher grain weight than di especially in sandy soil under high planting density like that in this experiment 70 000 plants ha 1 the severe plant to plant competition for water nutrient and high frequently resulted in barren plants in which no fertile grains developed compared to di the ear number per ha at harvest generally increased in sdf suggesting that the synchronous improvement of water and nutrient management is essential to reduce inter plant competition most interestingly the advantage of sdf over di on plant growth and yield formation was not dependent on more water consumption table 4 therefore water productivity in sdf was higher than that of di finally the apparent n loss was lower and soil no3 n residue was higher for sdf than di suggesting that the split application of n may have reduced downward no3 n leaching the lower no3 n residue in di should not be due to the possible leaching after growth season because the soil is often frozen in the northeast from the harvest to the second year of sowing and the rainfall is very low e g 33 mm in 2014 55 mm in 2015 also the immobilization of nitrate n should be very little because the negative charge of nitrate water capacity and nutrient buffering ability are higher in clay soils compared to sandy soils nyvall 2002 warrick 2018 there was less advantage of sdf over di on grain yield nutrient accumulation except for post silking n uptake dry matter accumulation pfp or water productivity no3 n leaching into deeper soil is lower in clay soil compared to sandy soil types sogbedji et al 2000 beaudoin et al 2005 van es et al 2006 therefore optimized water management via di may be sufficient to maintain nutrient supply to meet maize growth demand and the split application via sdf may not be so important nevertheless in comparison to di sdf slightly increased soil no3 n content at r3 stages and r6 stages fig 3 and then lai was significantly increased at r3 stages fig 7 and further sdf increased post silking n uptake table 2 and greatly reduced n apparent loss table 5 both rainfall amount and its distribution affected corn growth the rainfall amount in 2014 was higher in 2014 than in 2015 however there was a severe short term drought around silking stage in 2014 this short term drought had a great negative effect on corn growth in sandy soil but not in clay soil as shown in lai grain number per ear and grain yield table 5s the possible reason should be that the clay soil had better water retention capacity so as to resist the short term drought in 2015 when there was less rainfall during the whole growth period grain yield in clay soil was reduced compared to that in 2014 table 5s 4 2 ssdf and sdfp in comparison to sdf surface drip irrigation installations can have a long economic life when properly designed and managed long system life allows for amortizing investment costs over many years lamm 2005 generally the effect of surface and subsurface drip irrigation on maize yield was similar camp 1998 howell et al 1997 camp et al 1989 in the review of sinobas and rodríguez 2012 the efficiency of subsurface drip irrigation is similar to drip irrigation but it uses less water it is also found that subsurface drip fertigation moved the center of the root density to a deeper depth improve p use efficiency and increased maize yield hernandez et al 1991 phene et al 1991 however lamm 2014 reported that under drought conditions the dry surface layer makes the pre plant surface applied n positionally unavailable to the crop which lead to a yield reduction by 5 10 the present study suggested that ssdf had similar effect as sdf in increasing grain yield and pfp tables 3 and 4 in sandy soil the total accumulation of p and k in ssdf was less than that of sdf the reason might be that the soil moisture content of the 0 20 cm soil layer was relatively lower under ssdf compared to sdf in some growth stage fig 2 and also reduced the lai at r3 stages fig 7 soil nutrients and maize roots are mostly distributed in the top 20 cm of the soil therefore lack of water in this layer could affect soil nutrient mineralization and availability lamm 2014 especially for p and k whose movements occur mostly via diffusion bar yosef et al 1989 hernandez et al 1991 cote et al 2003 suggest that ssdf is not suitable forcoarse textured soils further scholberg and dukes 2005 reported that the drip line depth of ssdf at 33 cm was too deep on sweet maize under sandy soil nevertheless ssdf had similar grain yield compared to sdf suggesting the less uptake of phosphorus and potassium in ssdf in the present study is not essential for maize growth plastic mulch is widely used in crop cultivation in china it has dual functions increasing soil temperature and maintaining soil moisture ma et al 2007 there are reports indicating that sdfp can increase lai dry matter accumulation n uptake and maize grain yield liu et al 2011 wei and chen 2011 liu et al 2014 mainly in the regions where thermal resources are limiting for maize growth ma et al 2007 in the present study it was shown that there was no significant difference in the yield between the three types of drip fertilization methods in both sandy and clay soil table 3 in clay soil sdfp tended to had higher grain yield and pfp and wp compared to sdf and ssdf possibly because soil temperature at early spring is much lower in clay soil than sandy soil and mulching with the transparent plastic film can increase soil temperature and improve early seedling growth in clay soil as shown in fig 7 however this effect seems quitted limited in the experimental area and the advantage of sdfp over sdf gradually disappeared at late growth stage as shown in leaf area dry matter accumulation and yield for formation 4 3 economic consideration drip irrigation system is costly although drip irrigation or drip fertigation increased maize yield and fertilizer and water productivity their feasibility depends on whether the net income is increased or not in the sandy soil di and all the fertigation methods increased maize yield greatly compared to the ck as a result they also increased the net income especially sdf and ssdf management had the highest net income and therefore can be recommended in maize production in sandy soil although sdfp had the highest maize yield its cost was much higher than the other management methods as a result the net income of sdfp was lower than sdf and ssdf in addition the residual plastic film can cause environmental problem therefore sdfp should not be recommended in clay soil the high costs for drip irrigation system was hardly balanced by the yield increase by either di or drip fertigation managements the net income even reduced in di and sdfp in comparison to the ck therefore either di or any drip fertigation system is not recommended in the clay soil 5 conclusion in conclusion compared with the rain fed maize water optimization by drip irrigation improved maize growth and nutrient uptake especially during post silking stage as a result grain yield and fertilizer productivity were increased without sacrifice in water productivity synchronous water and nutrient optimization via drip fertigation increased maize yield and pfp to a larger extent than drip irrigation does in addition drip fertigation increased water productivity as well no significant difference in grain yield fertilizer productivity and water productivity was found between sdf ssdf and sdfp management the yield increase by di and all the drip fertigation managements was much higher in sandy soil than in clay soil in sandy soil sdf and ssdf resulted in the highest net income and therefore should be recommended to the farmers in clay soil however the high costs for drip irrigation system was hardly balanced by the yield increase by either di or drip fertigation managements therefore di and drip fertigation management is not recommended in clay soil acknowledgements this project is financially supported by international potash institute ipi and the key national research

vegetable and fruit plant production yet an efficient practicable and cost effective drip fertigation system is lacking for maize production a two year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the potential of different drip fertigation methods for increasing maize yield and water and nutrient use efficiency in sandy and clay soil five irrigation methods were applied in each soil conventional rain fed ck drip irrigation di surface drip fertigation sdf fertigation plus plastic film mulching sdfp and subsurface fertigation ssdf compared with rain fed method ck water optimization by di

soils the optimization of both water and nutrient management by sdf increased grain yield by 41 in sandy soil and 17 in clay soil pfp and npk uptake at greater extent than di furthermore sdf also increased the water productivity in both soils compared with di sdf increased post silking n in both soil and k accumulation in sandy soil there was no significant difference in yield and pfp between sdf ssdf and sdfp methods in both soils in sandy soil the net profit of di sdf ssdf and sdfp was 13 28 31 and 10 higher than that of ck respectively in clay soil however no obvious advantage in net income was found in either di or fertigation treatments sdf and ssdf are recommended to increase maize yield water and nutrient use efficiency as well as economic benefit synchronously in sandy soil

worldwide barrett 2010 continuing population and consumption growth will mean that the global demand for food will increase for at least another 40 years godfray et al 2010 however agriculture faces great challenges of global climate change resource depletion and environmental degradation chen et al 2014b drought has been one of the world s most widespread climate disasters affecting agricultural production pelling et al 2004 it is reported that area percentages of high and very high agricultural drought hazard zones are approximately 23 57 and 27 19 of the total agricultural area in the world geng et al 2016 in china water resources are also in serious shortage li et al 2009 improving water use efficiency is important to safeguard food security sun et al 2016 because of the enormous contribution to increased crop production fertilizer is used in every region of the world and the application has been enhanced by farmers all over the world motesharezadeh et al 2017 however fertilizer use efficiency is low all over the world in china for example the mean use efficiency of n p k fertilizer is only 27 2 11 1 and 31 1 respectively zhang et al 2008 therefore there is a need for efficient use of water and fertilizer resources to ensure sustainable food production drip irrigation is one of the most efficient methods of watering crops this technique offers improved yields requires less water decreases the cost of tillage and reduces the amount of fertilizers applied to the crop lekakis et al 2011 drip irrigation is widely accepted for crop production in areas of water scarcity fanish et al 2011 numerous reports have summarized the potential advantages of drip irrigation compared to other irrigation methods such as furrow alternate furrow and check basin irrigation methods for example drip irrigation increases water use efficiency crop yields and quality and improves fertilizer and other chemical application hernandez et al 1991 phene et al 1991 camp 1998 pablo et al 2007 sampathkumar and pandian 2011 drip irrigation is often used in the production of high value produce such as fruits nuts and vegetables hebbar et al 2004 rajput and patel 2006 devasirvatham 2009 however there is growing interest in applying drip irrigation to lower value field crops such as cotton and maize hodgson et al 1990 ünlü et al 2011 wan et al 2012 in the united states some farmers use subsurface drip irrigation because the fertigation system can be used for several years lamm and trooien 2003 enciso medina et al 2011 however previous studies indicate that the effect of this technique for maize crops is not stable lamm 2016 summarized the findings of more than a dozen studies which demonstrated that under subsurface drip irrigation crop yields range widely from 51 to 30 with an average positive increase of 4 across all studies drip fertigation is a modern innovative irrigation method by which fertilizers are applied along with irrigation water through a drip system to increase fertilizer use efficiency and boost crop yields bar yosef 1999 solaimalai et al 2005 fanish et al 2011 a properly designed drip fertigation system can maximize crop water and nutrient uptake while minimizing nutrient leaching gardenas et al 2005 drip fertigation can be applied to the soil surface and subsurface in some cold areas in china drip fertigation is used together with plastic mulching ma et al 2004 2007 wei and chen 2011 different drip fertilization methods can have varying effects on nutrient and water distribution in the soil and plant root growth and therefore plant nutrient uptake for example it was found that compared to surface drip fertigation subsurface drip fertigation moved the center of the root density to a deeper depth and increased ear yield hernandez et al 1991 phene et al 1991 however the advantage of subsurface drip fertigation is found to closely relate to soil type in highly permeable coarse textured soils water and nutrients move quickly downwards from the emitter making it difficult to wet the near surface zone if emitters are buried too deep cote et al 2003 recently many research efforts have been aimed at improvement

2018 wang et al 2017 however very little research has been done on the different drip irrigation methods to assess corn yield nutrient and water productivity and nutritional properties under different soil types the northeast china plain is china s major maize production area accounting for 30 35 of the country s production yang et al 2007 zhao and yang 2009 chen et al 2014a maize in this area is rain fed precipitation varies widely between seasons and years and water deficit frequently occurs during the maize growth season dong et al 2011 lu et al 2014 especially in the west part of northeast china where the soil is mostly sandy and the weather is cold in the spring ma et al 2004 zhao and yang 2009 yang et al 2015 fertilizer use efficiency is low in this area because fertilizers are overused and typically all the fertilizers are applied at planting gao et al 2010 to face these challenges the chinese government has encouraged the farmers to adopt various drip irrigation and fertigation methods to increase maize yield while reducing water and fertilizer input nevertheless less research has been done to compare the effect of the different fertigation methods on maize yield and water and nutrient use efficiency under different soil types and weather conditions also it is not clear which of the methods is cost effective and more practicable these information is valuable not only for the farmers to optimize their fertigation system but also for the government to make reasonable subsidy polices supporting the farmers to setup fertigation systems in the present study a two year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of different drip fertigation methods on maize yield and water and nutrient use efficiency in sandy and clay soils in northeast china 2 materials and methods 2 1 location and weather field experiments were conducted in 2014 and 2015 at two sites fu jia jie and san ke shu li shu country 43 21 n 124 05 e 171 m above sea level jilin

39 42 and 77 mm for the same periods the rainfall from v8 to v12 and v12 to grain filling stage r3 in 2014 was lower than that observed in 2015 while the rainfall from r3 to r6 was 66 mm higher in 2014 than in 2015 the soil type is loamy sand in fu jia jie whereas in san ke shu the soil type is clay loam according to the united states department of agriculture soil taxonomy system soil survey staff 1998 the bulk density and field capacity of these soil types are presented in table 1s 2 2 field design and experimental treatments the field experiment was conducted using a randomized complete block design with five fertigation treatments in two soil type sandy and clay soil each treatment was replicated four times the plots were 25 m 6 m in size with ten rows in each plot the treatments applied were as follows 1 conventional ck all fertilizers were applied as basal fertilizer and the field was not irrigated 2 drip irrigation di all fertilizers were applied as basal fertilizer and the field was irrigated by drip irrigation 3 surface drip fertigation sdf fertilizers were applied as basal application plus top dressing during the maize growth period using a drip irrigation system 4 subsurface drip fertigation ssdf the capillary pipes were laid 30 cm below the soil surface and the fertilizer application method was the same as in the sdf treatment 5 surface drip fertigation and plastic mulch sdfp in addition to fertigation a plastic film was used to cover the soil surface before sowing a hole was made in the plastic to let the seedling grow out and the fertilizer application method was the same as in the sdf treatment fertilizers were applied according to a target yield level of 12 ton ha 1 the fertilizer input amounts for the 2014 treatments were 240 kg n ha 1 122 kg phosphorus pentoxide p2o5 ha 1 and 119 kg potassium oxide k2o ha 1 in 2015 the amounts were 240 kg n ha 1 100 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 113 kg k2o ha 1 for the ck and di treatments all the n p k was supplied at sowing as basal application using a compound fertilizer n p2o5 k2o 28 12 12 potassium chloride and super calcium phosphate for drip fertigation treatments a compound fertilizer of 15 15 15 was applied as basal fertilizer which included 30 82 and 76 of the total n p and k inputs in 2014 and 30 72 and 64 in 2015 the remaining n p k was supplied by a fertigation system at eight growth stages using urea 46 n and a soluble compound fertilizer n p2o5 k2o 30 6 12 from gap agricultural technology company the fertilizer amount for each application is recorded in table 1 2 3 irrigation system and irrigation scheduling the maize was planted in a twin row pattern fig 1s that is the distance between the two rows is 40 and 80 cm alternately the main pipes were laid vertical to the row direction at the front of the plots the capillary pipes were only placed between the narrow rows for subsurface drip irrigation the drip line was installed at a depth of approximately 30 cm below the soil surface the emitters were spaced along the drip lateral at 30 cm apart and the emitter discharge rate was 1 05 l h 1 a pump was provided for each plot in 2014 the maize hybrid cv liangyu 11 was sown on 6th may and harvested on 30th september whilst in 2015 the maize was sown on 2nd may and harvested 1st october planting density was 70 000 plants ha weeds diseases and pests were well controlled using herbicides and pesticides irrigation amounts and timings were scheduled to supplement rainfall and meet crop water requirements e g crop evapotranspiration detailed irrigation records are shown in table 1 the basic soil physicochemical properties are listed in table 3s 2 4 maize yield yield components and nutrient uptake on physiological maturity of the crop the yield and its components were determined by harvesting an area of 20 m2 grain was oven dried to determine grain moisture at harvest grain yield was standardized to 14 moisture ten plants from each plot were harvested randomly to determine the grain number per cob and 100 grain weight for plant dry matter and nutrient analyses plants were cut at the soil surface and separated into leaves stems comprising the leaf sheath tassels and ear shoots and grains at v8 v12 vt r3 and r6 stages three plants were then randomly taken from each plot the samples were dried in an oven at a temperature of 70 c and were then weighed dry matter accumulation of the plant was calculated then the samples were ground into powder for measuring the nutrient content n concentration was determined by the semi micro kjeldahl method p was measured spectrophotometrically using the molybdo vanadophosphoric acid method k was determined by flame photometry bao 2000 the leaf area index lai refers to the total leaf area per sampling area the leaf area was calculated as leaf length maximum width 0 75 at v8 vt and r3 stages lu et al 2014 2 5 soil nitrate as nitrogen concentration and residue two soil samples from each plot were collected randomly at 0 80 cm beneath the soil surface using an auger at v8 v12 vt r3 grown stages at sowing and final harvest two soil samples were collected randomly from each plot at 0 200 cm below the soil surface using an auger each sample was divided into four layers at 20 cm intervals at v8 v12 vt r3 stages 0 80 cm and was divided into ten layers at 20 cm intervals at sowing and final harvest stages 0 200 cm soil samples were extracted with 0 01 mol l 1 calcium chloride and analyzed for nitrate as nitrogen no3 n using a continuous flow analyzer traacs 2000 bran and luebbe

volumetric water content klute 1988 total water consumption actual crop evapotranspiration under the different irrigation treatments was calculated using the soil water balance equation el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 zhang et al 2017 et p i cr r d δs where et represents seasonal crop evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm i is the amount of irrigation water cr is the capillary rise mm r is the amount of run off mm d is the amount of drainage water below the 200 cm soil layer mm and δs is the difference between soil water content values in 0 200 cm soil depth at planting and at the end of harvesting mm because the soil surface was flat and the groundwater table was 10 m below the soil surface the values of r and cr were considered negligible when the sum of the soil water storage sw in the 0 to 200 cm soil profile and the precipitation was greater than the field capacity fc it was assumed that the excess water percolated into the deeper zones because the rainfall was low in 2014 and 2015 d was also neglected in this study 2 7 fertilizer and water productivity partial fertilizer productivity pfp is calculated as pfp kg kg 1 grain yield nutrient input in which nutrient input

year of production and nutrient management strategy were pooled for a variance analysis with a three factor variance analysis program using the anova procedure sas stat sas institute 1988 the soil type year of production and nutrient management were considered as fixed effects the data for n residue total n uptake and apparent n loss across nutrient management strategies and soil type were subjected to a variance analysis with a two factor variance analysis program in sas the means were compared using fisher s protected lsd at a probability level of 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil moisture content previously it was found that the permanent wilting points of the sandy and clay soil in the experimental region is 6 4 and 10 1 respectively which is equivalent to 35 and 40 of the field capacity respectively li et al 2017 in 2014 severe droughts occurred mainly 10 days before and 20 days after vt 20 july under the ck treatment on sandy soil the soil moisture content at the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers was lower than 8 from 1 july v12 to 15 august r3 and the soil water content remained 4 5 6 from mid july to mid august fig 2 in addition the soil water content at the 40 60 cm and 60 80 cm layers decreased gradually for the di sdf ssdf and sdfp treatments under which water was supplemented via drip irrigation the soil moisture content at the 0 80 cm soil layer remained at 7 12 from mid july vt to late september r6 however for the ssdf treatment soil moisture content at the0 20 cm soil layer was lower than under di sdf and sdfp during the vt and late filling stages in 2015 rainfall was very low during the maize growth season except for mid august the soil moisture content was lower under the ck treatment than the other treatments throughout the maize growth period the clay soil had a high field water capacity ranging from 24 to 28 in the 0 80 cm soil layer table 1s under the ck treatment in 2014 the soil moisture content remained above 12 at 0 20 cm soil depth above 14 at 20 40 cm soil depth and above 16 at 40 80 cm soil depth under the same treatment in 2015 the soil moisture content was lower at 0 20 cm deep than that observed in 2014 at 9 18 during the whole growth period the soil moisture content under the di sdf ssdf and sdfp treatments was higher than for the ck treatment at the vt and late filling stage especially at 0 40 cm depth soil moisture content was lowest under the ssdf treatment at 0 20 cm soil depth compared to the other treatments 3 2 soil no3 n content soil no3 n was affected by soil type year of production and management strategy during the various growth stages the interactive effect between soil year and management strategy was mostly not significant table 2s so the effect of different management methods was analyzed by the average value across two years fig 3 in sandy soil soil no3 n content under ck and di was higher than under sdf ssdf and sdfp in 0 80 cm soil depth at v8 stage and in 0 20 cm soil depth at vt stage but soil no3 n content under sdf ssdf and sdfp was slightly or significantly higher than under ck and di in 0 40 cm soil depth from filling r3 to maturity r6 stage in clay soil soil no3 n content under ck and di was higher than under sdf ssdf and sdfp in 0 60 cm soil depth at v8 stage and there was no significant difference between treatments in most soil depths at vt r3 and r6 stage except that ssdf was higher than ck and di in 20 40 cm soil depth at r3 and r6 stage 3 3 nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k uptake rate and accumulation in the plant total aboveground accumulation of n p and k was affected by soil type year of production management strategy and soil management except for nitrogen but not by the interaction of year management or year soil management table 2s so the two years data were averaged to analyze the dynamic nutrient uptake rate through the growth season and nutrient accumulation in pre and post silking stages in the two soils figs 4 6 and table 2 in the sandy soil compared to sdf ssdf and sdfp n uptake rate under ck and di was higher from v8 to v12 stage but lower from vt to r3 stage fig 4 therefore n accumulation in sdf ssdf and sdfp was lower at the pre silking stage and higher at the post silking stage table 2 the n uptake rate of di was higher than that of ck from vt to r3 stage fig 4 resulting greater post silking n accumulation under di compared to ck there was no difference in total n accumulation between the di sdf ssdf sdfp treatments all were higher than that of ck in clay soil the n uptake rate was similar under all treatments at the pre silking stage but was lower under ck and di compared to sdf ssdf and sdfp from vt to r3 stage as a result post silking n accumulation was greater under sdf ssdf and sdfp than in di and ck di also increased post silking n accumulation compared to ck for both soil types total n accumulation was similar among the di sdf ssdf and sdfp treatments all higher than under ck in both soil types there was no significant difference in phosphorus uptake rate among the treatments except for vt to r3 stage under the ck treatment phosphorus uptake rate from vt to r3 stage was significantly lower than under the di sdf ssdf and sdfp treatments fig 5 as a result the total phosphorus accumulation levels of the di sdf ssdf and sdfp treatments were all higher than that of ck table 2 in sandy soil the phosphorus uptake rate of ssdf was slightly lower than sdf and sdfp from v12 to r6 stage and the total phosphorus accumulation at harvest was significantly lower than sdf and sdfp there was no significant difference in phosphorus uptake rate at whole growth period and phosphorus accumulation at harvest between the di sdf ssdf and sdfp treatments in clay soil potassium was mainly taken up before vt and the net potassium uptake rate was negative at late r3 stage suggesting potassium loss from the plants at this late stage generally potassium loss from the plants occurred earlier under the ck treatment than in the other treatments potassium was lost from the plants by leaching and or biomass loss fig 6 in both soil types di and sdf increased potassium uptake rate from vt to r3 stage and the total potassium accumulation at harvest compared to ck but no significant difference between sdf and di in sandy soil ssdf did not increase the total potassium accumulation compared to ck and significantly reduced the total potassium accumulation compared to sdf in clay soil ssdf significantly increased the total potassium accumulation compared to ck but significantly reduced the total potassium accumulation compared to sdfp table 2 3 4 leaf area index lai and dry matter accumulation there was no significant difference in lai between two years in clay soil but the lai in 2014 was significantly lower than that in 2015 in sandy soil table 5s lai was no affected by the interaction of management year and soil year management table 2s therefore the data of lai in 2014 and 2015 were averaged to evaluate the effect of managements in two soils fig 7 in sandy soil sdfp increased lai at the v8 stage di and all the fertigation treatments increased lai at r3 but had similar lai as ck at vt fig 7 lai under ssdf was lower than that of sdf at r3 in clay soil lai under di and ck was the same throughout the maize growth season lower than that of all the drip fertigation treatments at r3 but not at the vegetative stage in sandy soil compared to the other treatments dry matter accumulation under ck was lower during the post silking stage but not during the pre silking stage fig 8 post silking dry matter accumulation in sdf and sdfp was greater than that in ssdf and di similarly in clay soil no difference in dry matter accumulation was observed at the pre silking stage among all treatments either during the post silking stage dry matter accumulation under ck was lower than under all other treatments in 2014 no difference in final dry matter accumulation was found between di sdf ssdf and sdfp in 2015 the dry matter accumulation in di was significantly lower than that of sdfp but similar as that of sdf and ssdf the difference between the three fertigation treatments was not significant 3 5 maize yield and yield components grain yield was affected by all treatments and all variable interactions except for year management and soil year management there was no significant difference in yields between two years in sandy soil but the yield in 2014 was significantly higher than that in 2015 in clay soil table 5s the two years data was averaged to analyze the management effect in the two soils table 3 in sandy soil di increased grain yields by 28 sdf ssdf and sdfp further increased grain yields compared to ck by 41 36 and 41 respectively table 3 under di 100 grain weight and the number of grains per ear were increased by 10 and 12 compared to ck no difference was found in the number of ears per hectare under sdf 100 grain weight the number of grains per ear and the number of ears per hectare were significantly increased by 21 11 and 5 compared to ck the average maize yield under sdf and sdfp were significantly increased by 10 and 10 compared to di mainly due to the higher 100 grain weight but no significant difference between ssdf and di there were no significant differences in yield and yield components between sdf ssdf and sdfp in clay soil di sdf ssdf and sdfp significantly increased grain yield with an average increase of 12 17 13 and 18 compared to ck table 3 the number of ears per hectare under di was slightly greater and the 100 grain weight and the number of grains per ear were significantly higher than ck by 6 and 4 the number of ears per hectare and the 100 grain weight under sdf were higher than those under ck by 6 and 10 and the number of grains per ear was slightly greater there were no significant differences in yield between di sdf and ssdf grain yield under sdfp was greater than under di by 6 however no difference in yields was found between sdf ssdf and sdfp 3 6 pfp and water productivity pfp and water productivity were affected by soil type year management strategy and soil management but not by the interaction of year management and soil year management table 2s in sandy soil the pfp in 2015 was significantly higher than that in 2014 while there was no significant difference in pfp between the two years in clay soil table 5s for different fertigation treatments because the fertilizer amount for each treatment was the same the difference in pfp between treatments was similar to that of yield table 4 the values of pfp in the two years were averaged to analyze the management effect in two soil types table 4 in sandy soil di increased pfp by 28 compared to ck and sdf ssdf and sdfp increased pfp by 41 36 and 41 respectively compared with ck there was no significant difference in pfp between the three drip fertigation methods in clay soil di sdf ssdf and sdfp significantly increased pfp by12 18 13 and 19 compared to ck respectively there was no significant difference in pfp between the three drip fertigation methods in sandy soil there was no difference in water consumption between the di sdf ssdf and sdfp treatments all had higher values than that of ck water productivity under di was the same as under ck water productivity under sdf ssdf and sdfp was higher than under ck by 17 8 and 14 respectively there was no significant difference in water productivity between the three drip fertigation methods in clay soil water consumption under di and sdf was higher than under ck but there was no difference in water consumption between ssdf sdfp and ck there was no difference in water productivity between di and ck however water productivity under sdf ssdf and sdfp was higher than under ck by 11 8 and 14 respectively furthermore water productivity under sdfp was higher than ssdf in both soil types the water productivity in 2015 is significantly higher than in 2014 table 5s mainly due to the decrease in rainfall in 2015 and the decrease in total water consumption 3 7 soil no3 n residue and apparent n loss in both soils compared to ck di reduced apparent n loss fertigation treatments reduced apparent n loss at greater extent than di table 5 in general di and drip fertigation treatment did not affect soil no3 n residue in the soil at the end of the experiment 3 8 cost benefit analysis of different management methods in sandy soil the net profit of di sdf ssdf and sdfp was 13 28 31 and 10 higher than that of ck respectively table 6 in spite of the high input of the drip irrigation system sdfp management had lowest benefit because its highest costs which comes from the additional inputs for buying the plastic film machinery laying of the plastic film as well as the cleaning of the residual plastic film each year in clay soil there is essentially no advantage in net profit for either di or fertigation managements compared to the ck for sdfp even a 9 reduction in net benefit was observed 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of drip irrigation and drip fertigation management water optimization via di increased maize yield significantly the yield increase in di was mainly due to the increase of grain number per ear and 100 grain weight which is most likely explained by the increasing soil humidity from v12 through to maturity fig 2 rainfall from 1 july v12 to 13 august r3 was only 21 mm in 2014 and 42 mm in 2015 fig 1 and soil moisture content was very low in both years fig 2 during this period water supply is crucial for seed setting pollination and early grain development water deficiency during this stage increases the interval between flowering and vt and reduces the number of grains per ear bai et al 2004 2009 nutrient availability and leaf longevity in the soil was closely related to water conditions more grain number per ear and heavier grain weight in di should be related to the increase in the uptake of n p and k table 2 and also lai at r3 stages as well due to increase in yield di increased fertilizer productivity of n p and k significantly table 4 di did not increase the water productivity of maize because water consumption increased with the increase of grain yield compared to ck and di sdf provides a tool for synchronous improvement of water and nutrient management in sandy soil sdf increased maize yield to a greater extent than di did table 3 one possible reason is that the post silking uptake of n and p was higher in sdf compared to di figs 4 and 5 similarly sdf greatly improved soil water supply and also soil n supply at later growth as indicated by the higher soil no3 n content under sdf compared to ck and di in 0 40 cm soil depth from filling r3 to maturity r6 stage figs 2 and 3 more post silking nutrient uptake and reasonable water supply under sdf may have resulted in the longer leaf longevity and therefore greater post silking dry matter accumulation so sdf had higher grain weight than di especially in sandy soil under high planting density like that in this experiment 70 000 plants ha 1 the severe plant to plant competition for water nutrient and high frequently resulted in barren plants in which no fertile grains developed compared to di the ear number per ha at harvest generally increased in sdf suggesting that the synchronous improvement of water and nutrient management is essential to reduce inter plant competition most interestingly the advantage of sdf over di on plant growth and yield formation was not dependent on more water consumption table 4 therefore water productivity in sdf was higher than that of di finally the apparent n loss was lower and soil no3 n residue was higher for sdf than di suggesting that the split application of n may have reduced downward no3 n leaching the lower no3 n residue in di should not be due to the possible leaching after growth season because the soil is often frozen in the northeast from the harvest to the second year of sowing and the rainfall is very low e g 33 mm in 2014 55 mm in 2015 also the immobilization of nitrate n should be very little because the negative charge of nitrate water capacity and nutrient buffering ability are higher in clay soils compared to sandy soils nyvall 2002 warrick 2018 there was less advantage of sdf over di on grain yield nutrient accumulation except for post silking n uptake dry matter accumulation pfp or water productivity no3 n leaching into deeper soil is lower in clay soil compared to sandy soil types sogbedji et al 2000 beaudoin et al 2005 van es et al 2006 therefore optimized water management via di may be sufficient to maintain nutrient supply to meet maize growth demand and the split application via sdf may not be so important nevertheless in comparison to di sdf slightly increased soil no3 n content at r3 stages and r6 stages fig 3 and then lai was significantly increased at r3 stages fig 7 and further sdf increased post silking n uptake table 2 and greatly reduced n apparent loss table 5 both rainfall amount and its distribution affected corn growth the rainfall amount in 2014 was higher in 2014 than in 2015 however there was a severe short term drought around silking stage in 2014 this short term drought had a great negative effect on corn growth in sandy soil but not in clay soil as shown in lai grain number per ear and grain yield table 5s the possible reason should be that the clay soil had better water retention capacity so as to resist the short term drought in 2015 when there was less rainfall during the whole growth period grain yield in clay soil was reduced compared to that in 2014 table 5s 4 2 ssdf and sdfp in comparison to sdf surface drip irrigation installations can have a long economic life when properly designed and managed long system life allows for amortizing investment costs over many years lamm 2005 generally the effect of surface and subsurface drip irrigation on maize yield was similar camp 1998 howell et al 1997 camp et al 1989 in the review of sinobas and rodríguez 2012 the efficiency of subsurface drip irrigation is similar to drip irrigation but it uses less water it is also found that subsurface drip fertigation moved the center of the root density to a deeper depth improve p use efficiency and increased maize yield hernandez et al 1991 phene et al 1991 however lamm 2014 reported that under drought conditions the dry surface layer makes the pre plant surface applied n positionally unavailable to the crop which lead to a yield reduction by 5 10 the present study suggested that ssdf had similar effect as sdf in increasing grain yield and pfp tables 3 and 4 in sandy soil the total accumulation of p and k in ssdf was less than that of sdf the reason might be that the soil moisture content of the 0 20 cm soil layer was relatively lower under ssdf compared to sdf in some growth stage fig 2 and also reduced the lai at r3 stages fig 7 soil nutrients and maize roots are mostly distributed in the top 20 cm of the soil therefore lack of water in this layer could affect soil nutrient mineralization and availability lamm 2014 especially for p and k whose movements occur mostly via diffusion bar yosef et al 1989 hernandez et al 1991 cote et al 2003 suggest that ssdf is not suitable forcoarse textured soils further scholberg and dukes 2005 reported that the drip line depth of ssdf at 33 cm was too deep on sweet maize under sandy soil nevertheless ssdf had similar grain yield compared to sdf suggesting the less uptake of phosphorus and potassium in ssdf in the present study is not essential for maize growth plastic mulch is widely used in crop cultivation in china it has dual functions increasing soil temperature and maintaining soil moisture ma et al 2007 there are reports indicating that sdfp can increase lai dry matter accumulation n uptake and maize grain yield liu et al 2011 wei and chen 2011 liu et al 2014 mainly in the regions where thermal resources are limiting for maize growth ma et al 2007 in the present study it was shown that there was no significant difference in the yield between the three types of drip fertilization methods in both sandy and clay soil table 3 in clay soil sdfp tended to had higher grain yield and pfp and wp compared to sdf and ssdf possibly because soil temperature at early spring is much lower in clay soil than sandy soil and mulching with the transparent plastic film can increase soil temperature and improve early seedling growth in clay soil as shown in fig 7 however this effect seems quitted limited in the experimental area and the advantage of sdfp over sdf gradually disappeared at late growth stage as shown in leaf area dry matter accumulation and yield for formation 4 3 economic consideration drip irrigation system is costly although drip irrigation or drip fertigation increased maize yield and fertilizer and water productivity their feasibility depends on whether the net income is increased or not in the sandy soil di and all the fertigation methods increased maize yield greatly compared to the ck as a result they also increased the net income especially sdf and ssdf management had the highest net income and therefore can be recommended in maize production in sandy soil although sdfp had the highest maize yield its cost was much higher than the other management methods as a result the net income of sdfp was lower than sdf and ssdf in addition the residual plastic film can cause environmental problem therefore sdfp should not be recommended in clay soil the high costs for drip irrigation system was hardly balanced by the yield increase by either di or drip fertigation managements the net income even reduced in di and sdfp in comparison to the ck therefore either di or any drip fertigation system is not recommended in the clay soil 5 conclusion in conclusion compared with the rain fed maize water optimization by drip irrigation improved maize growth and nutrient uptake especially during post silking stage as a result grain yield and fertilizer productivity were increased without sacrifice in water productivity synchronous water and nutrient optimization via drip fertigation increased maize yield and pfp to a larger extent than drip irrigation does in addition drip fertigation increased water productivity as well no significant difference in grain yield fertilizer productivity and water productivity was found between sdf ssdf and sdfp management the yield increase by di and all the drip fertigation managements was much higher in sandy soil than in clay soil in sandy soil sdf and ssdf resulted in the highest net income and therefore should be recommended to the farmers in clay soil however the high costs for drip irrigation system was hardly balanced by the yield increase by either di or drip fertigation managements therefore di and drip fertigation management is not recommended in clay soil acknowledgements this project is financially supported by international potash institute ipi and the key national research

11173,to develop a micro sprinkler method with treated effluent for tall fescue festuca arundinacea cultivation in sea reclamation land and test its effect on soil physical and chemical properties a field experiment with five treatments of water quality was conducted in 2015 2016 the five treatments of water quality were created with a mixture of treated effluent ec 4 2 6 9 ds m and fresh groundwater and the percentage of treated effluent was 0 25 50 75 and 100 saline soil contained a gravel sand layer imbedded at depth of 60 cm irrigation management was divided into three stages enhanced salt leaching stage continuous irrigation water salt regulation stage irrigation based on the soil matric potential smp at 5 kpa and normal irrigation stage irrigation based on the smp at 20

second stage 3 5 months the ece in the 0 60 cm soil layer dropped to 1 42 3 16 ds m during these stages treatment with 50 treated effluent led to relatively good infiltration and lower salinity and was therefore good at enhancing the salt leaching efficiency in the third stage the observed ece of the 0 60 cm changed slightly but 75 treated effluent could maintain the soil salinity below the threshold salinity of tall fescue even in the rainless season during the process soil sodium adsorption ratio decreased while soil ph increased first and then decreased soil available phosphorus content showed a close correlation with treated effluent and the biomass of tall fescue moreover the tall fescue maintained normal growth therefore it is possible to use treated effluent to micro sprinkler irrigation on tall fescue in sea reclamation land keywords salt leaching irrigation management tall fescue saline soil 1 introduction sea reclamation has been a common approach to increase the land area for living and developing along the coastal areas in many parts of the world in china a total reclamation area of 2469 km2 was approved by the state council in 2011 2020 for economic development wang et al 2014 in sea reclamation land bare ground is exposed which not only affects the landscape but also leads to sandstorms landscape construction is required to meet the demands of living and developing environments sea reclamation land is usually very saline for example the mean electrical conductivity of saturated soil extracts ece is more than 30 ds m in our study area li et al 2015a moreover the salt composition in the study area is similar to that of seawater with chlorine and sodium being the main ions accounting for 60 80 of the total respectively there is also a high water table at 0 5 3 m and the aquifer contains saline water traditional reclamation methods such as applying gypsum combining surface irrigation and water drainage technologies have made it difficult to improve saline soil for plants although some halophyte plants such as tamarix chinensis can survive under such conditions they are not sufficient to create a better landscape replacing saline soil with non saline soil is the most popular method used in our research area but this is limited by high economic input and the increasing difficulty in identifying large amounts of non saline soil resources recently several studies have been conducted in the bohai gulf region east china sun et al 2013 found that a gravel sand layer at depth of 80 cm was effective at preventing the upward movement of salt into the surface soil from shallow saline groundwater during winter li et al 2015b found that the technology of surface drip irrigation with phased irrigation management could enhance salt leaching and maintain good plant growth the drip irrigation was started based on the soil matric potential smp at 20 cm and the smp target value was adjusted according to the process of salt leaching irrigation water quality and plant growth li et al 2015a found that when the smp was controlled at above 5 and 10 kpa in the two irrigation stages drip irrigation with 4 01 ds m saline water could maintain a 50 survival rate for salt sensitive plants in a study investigating drip irrigation with freshwater chen et al 2015a controlled the smp threshold into three stages of 5 10 and 20 kpa in addition micro sprinkler irrigation of tall fescue festuca arundinacea with freshwater was also conducted when the smp was controlled above 5 15 and 20 kpa chu et al 2014 the freshwater supply of the bohai gulf region including the research area is very limited with only 660 m3 per capita sun 2007 moreover there were about 3 9 billion m3 of treated effluent in the coastal cities of the bohai gulf region in 2015 li 2016 liu 2016 wei 2016 wu and peng 2016 while the utilization rate was only 8 3 li 2016 which is far lower than the 80 in israel oecd 2015 there has been a great deal of research on irrigation with treated effluent and the results of these studies have identified potential salinity as a restriction to the use of treated effluent the characteristics of treated effluent such as the salt content and concentration of specific chemical elements may cause soil salt accumulation plant damage or soil permeability problems al hamaiedeh and bino 2010 asano and pettygrove 1987 oster 1994 toze 2006 furthermore spraying plants with saline water may cause foliar damage because many plants absorb salts directly through their leaves shalhevet 1994 tanji 1990 tall fescue is a plant widely used in landscapes that has a salt tolerance threshold of 3 9 ds m maas and hoffman 1977 the present study was conducted to develop a micro sprinkler irrigation for application of treated effluent to tall fescue in sea reclamation land the specific goals were 1 to test the process and effect of soil salinity leaching during irrigation with different levels of treated effluent and 2 to find the correct percentage of treated effluent for use as long term irrigation water and to maintain normal growth of plants and soil health 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site experiments were conducted in 2015 2016 at the industrial zone 39 03 n 118 48 e located in the caofeidian district in the south of tangshan city east china this region is located in the northern portion of the bohai gulf which borders the pacific ocean the station has a typical semi humid monsoon climate and annual precipitation of approximately 555 mm most of which occurs from july to september the soil of the study area is sandy loam soil and the region was reclaimed from the sea in 2007 the soil salt composition was similar to that of seawater with chlorine and sodium comprising the main ions the average electrical conductivity ph phe and sodium adsorption ratio sare of the saturated soil extracts above a soil depth of 60 cm were ece 38 3 ds m phe 7 68 and sare 69 4 mmol l 0 5 water table 0 8 1 2 m the average soil bulk density of the initial saline soils was 1 69 g cm3 in the 0 60 cm soil layers which was reduced to 1 55 g cm3 after soil tillage the soil nutrient characteristics for 0 60 cm soil layers were organic matter content 11 4 g kg total n 0 24 g kg available phosphorus 8 1 mg kg available potassium 464 mg kg 2 2 experimental design 2 2 1 plot layout and experiment design based on the successful reclamation of the coastal saline soil chen et al 2015a 2015b chu et al 2014 li et al 2016 2015a 2015b sun et al 2012 the soil treatments before planting were as follows soil was removed to a depth of about 60 cm a 10 cm thick gravel layer and a 5 cm thick sand layer were laid in the bottom to cut off the capillary porosity fig 1 several polyvinyl chloride tubes were placed at the low edge of the gravel sand layer with spacings of 10 m to allow the leaching water to flow out after which the saline sodic soil was backfilled and levelled the irrigation water was a mixture of treated effluent and fresh water the treated effluent which was from the caofeidian district sewage treatment plant maintained by the tangshan caofeidian drainage operating companies was transported and stored in a small reservoir the quality of treated effluent met the first grade national standard for wastewater discharge gb18918 2002 2003 fresh water was pumped from a deep layer groundwater well located at the experimental site there were five irrigation water treatments with percentages of treated effluent were 0 gg1 25 gg2 50 gg3 75 gg4 and 100 gg5 all treatments were replicated three times with the experimental plots arranged in a complete randomized block design the area of each plot was 9 0 by 6 0 m and the distance between the plots was 2 5 m each plot contained 6 micro sprinklers with a 3 0 m space between them according to chu et al 2013 a micro sprinkler beijing luckrain plastic industry ltd china with a flow rate of 120 l h at 0 2 mpa operating pressure and a wetted diameter of about 3 1 m was selected the tall fescue houndog v turf sod covered over the saline sodic soil directly the irrigation water quality and its degree of restriction on permeability are presented in tables 1 and 2 the salt concentration of the treated effluent electrical conductivity of irrigation water eciw 4 2 6 9 ds m was several times higher than that of the fresh water eciw 1 0 ds m similar to the nutrient concentration the eciw and sodium adsorption ratio of irrigation water sariw increased and the ph of the irrigation water phiw decreased as the percentage of treated effluent increased according to the evaluation of permeability using eciw and sariw proposed by ayers and westcot 1976 the irrigation water of the gg1 treatment posed a severe degree while the gg2 and gg3 treatments posed a slight to moderate degree and a slight degree respectively there was no restriction on permeability of gg4 and gg5 treatments the number of fecal coliforms in treated effluent was 130 1700 cfu l while the heavy metals levels were suitable for irrigation except for se which was present at 0 029 mg l ayers and westcot 1976 the irrigation management was divided into three stages including enhanced salt leaching stage 1st stage water salt regulation stage 2nd stage and normal irrigation stage 3rd stage the first two stages were the two main salt leaching periods the 1st stage was designed to leach salt from the 0 10 cm layer of the soil with continuous irrigation during which time about 10 20 mm of water was applied per day the stage ended when the soil ece of the 0 10 cm layer was close to or less than 6 ds m during the 2nd stage salt was leached from the soil above the gravel sand layer by ensuring the net downward movement of water asano and pettygrove 1987 according to the successful reclamation of drip irrigation with saline water in coastal saline soil li et al 2015a the irrigation was based on the smp at a depth of 0 2 m which was controlled at 5 kpa the stage terminated when the average soil ece was 4 ds m above the gravel sand layer since the salinity tolerance threshold of tall fescue was about 3 9 ds m the 3rd stage was normal irrigation during which irrigation was applied when the smp reached the target value 20 kpa during the second and last stages the depth of water for each irrigation event was 10 mm and the target value could be adjusted uniformly according to the tall fescue growth and the soil salinity fertilizer was applied uniformly to each treatment in early october 2015 and july 2016 respectively the rates of n p2o5 and k2o application were 20 g m2 y 5 g m2 y and 10 g m2 y respectively in addition tall fescue was trimmed and weeded regularly 2 2 2 observation and measurements there was one tensiometer installed in one plot for each treatment for observation of smp at a depth of 0 2 m fig 1 and observations were made daily at 8 00 and 16 00 soil samples of each plot above the gravel layer were collected in mid july mid september and early november 2015 as well as in mid march early july and early november 2016 the soil was obtained horizontally at 0 50 100 150 cm from the micro sprinkler and all sample depths in the vertical apart were the same 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 and 50 60 cm the soil ece phe inorganic nitrogen nmin and soluble cations were based on extracts of saturated soil the ece and phe were determined by a conductivity meter dds 307 rex shanghai china and a ph meter phs 3c rex shanghai china respectively nmin included nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen which were measured by means of colorimetry bao 2000 respectively soluble cations such as na k ca2 and mg2 were measured with icp oes optima 5300dv usa available phosphorus was extracted with 0 5 mol l nahco3 bao 2000 the sar was calculated as follows 1 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 0 5 where the concentration of each cation was in mmol l in this experiment average ece phe sare and

which t represents the time when soil samples were obtained j the four horizontal distances n from the micro sprinkler where soil samples were obtained k the depth m of the soil sample and s j k the depth interval of the soil layer the growth biomass of tall fescue was determined when it has sufficient height for harvesting 20 cm all the plots were trimmed at the same time there was five times harvest during the study period the fresh biomass in each plot was weighted and some was used to determine the water content the growth biomass q g r was calculated as follows 3 q g r t q f r e t 1 w where q f r e is the weight of the fresh tall fescue kg ha w is the water content of the fresh tall fescue and t is the moving time 2 3 statistical procedures data were analyzed using ibm spss statistics ver 19 0 ibm co armonk ny usa the differences in growth biomass of tall fescue among treatments were compared using one way analyses of variance anova the least significant difference test at a significance level of 0 05 the figures were prepared using sigma plot 10 0 systat software inc chicago il usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation irrigation amount and soil matric potential 3 1 1 precipitation fig 2 shows the precipitation for the area during the study period from july to november 2015 about 120 days after planting the total precipitation was 395 mm there was no rain during the 1st stage and almost all of the rain was concentrated in the 2nd stage during the 3rd stage march november 2016 the total precipitation was 539 mm the rainfall events mainly occurred from mid july to september 2015 mid late june 2016 and late july to early september 2016 there is no rain data for the period from november to march but the average amount was 32 mm in the same period during the past 30 years 3 1 2 irrigation the irrigation for each treatment during the tall fescue growing season is shown in table 3 the 1st stage and 2nd stage lasted for 10 days and 3 5 months respectively a total of approximately 410 500 mm irrigation water was applied and no obvious patterns were obtained among treatments during the 3rd stage the irrigation amount ranged from 280 to 400 mm for treatments gg1 gg5 over the growing season about 7 5 months and the irrigation amount increased with the increasing percentage of treated effluent except for gg3 3 1 3 soil matric potential fig 3 presents the change in smp at a depth of 20 cm during the study period in the 2nd stage the smp threshold was controlled well above 5 kpa then adjusted to 10 kpa in the later period of 2015 to promote root growth to the deep layer for winter survival during most of this stage the smp changed above the controlled values but some smp values were beyond the controlled threshold this was likely because the twice daily monitoring data from the tensiometer showed a bit of a lag in the 3rd stage the smp threshold was mostly controlled at 20 kpa except for one period that was controlled at 10 kpa to alleviate the salt damage to plants in a rainless season the smp fluctuated increasingly because the soil water changed greatly as water consumption and evapotranspiration increased on hot days 3 2 effect of treated effluent irrigation on soil salinity ece ece is the electrical conductivity of a saturated soil extract at the experimental site the soil ece in the 0 60 cm soil layer before planting tall fescue turf was relatively uniform with an average of 38 29 ds m 3 2 1 effect of treated effluent on soil salt leaching fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of ece in the vertical transects for each treatment at different soil sampling times the salinity changed significantly in the 1st stage and the 2nd stage fig 4a c the 1st stage lasted for 10 d and the salinity of upper soil was well leached the average ece in the 0 10 cm soil profile for the gg1 gg5 treatments decreased to 3 73 4 09 3 81 4 91 and 6 28 ds m respectively the corresponding reductions were 90 27 89 32 90 04 87 17 and 83 61 of the initial soil ece fig 4a the 2nd stage lasted for 3 5 months as the soil salinity above the gravel layer continued to decline in november of 2015 fig 4c the average ece values of the 0 40 cm soil layer for the gg1 gg5 treatments decreased to 0 66 1 44 1 57 1 91 and 2 22 ds m with an average value of 1 56 ds m for 0 60 cm the values decreased to 1 42 2 46 2 25 2 72 and 3 01 ds m respectively although the ultimate soil salinity increased with increasing percentages of treated effluent the ece values were lower than the salt tolerance threshold for tall fescue indicating that the 2nd stage was completed the 1st stage and the 2nd stage were two main soil salt leaching periods based on the ultimate soil salinity at the end of each stage the 1st stage was the fastest desalination period with an average decrease in ece of 2 40 ds m per day in the 0 60 cm soil layer in addition the salt leaching efficiency of the five treatments was different even when they were irrigated with an equivalent amount of water 110 mm table 3 at the end of the 1st stage the average ece in the 0 60 cm soil profile for the gg1 gg5 treatments was 14 48 14 02 13 25 13 59 and 15 87 ds m the salt leaching efficiency increased as the percentage of treated effluent increased to 50 then decreased while for the surface soil the gg1 and gg3 treatments leached salinity faster than the other treatments these results suggested that irrigation with 50 treated effluent could enhance the desalting process in the experimental region and that using freshwater tend to rapidly reduce the salinity of the surface soil oster 1994 based on the information presented above lower water salinity and good infiltration capacity of the irrigation water were likely to be the main factors that clearly affected the salt leaching efficiency a lower eciw means that less salinity is inputted into the soil via the irrigation water while more salinity enters the soil when the irrigation water has a higher eciw a high infiltration rate means that more water can move into the soil and be used for leaching salt especially in the deeper layers because the infiltration rate decreased with increasing sar and decreasing total cation concentration oster and schroer 1979 non linear regression equations were used to describe the relationship of the salt leaching rate sl ds m d sariw mmol l 0 5 and eciw ds m in the soil profiles of 0 20 cm and 0 60 cm the regression equations were as follows sl0 20 cm 1 722 0 135 sariw 0 646 eciw 0 054 sariw eciw r2 0 982 and sl0 60 cm 0 065 0 183 sariw 1 105 eciw 0 084 sariw eciw r2 0 990 respectively 3 2 2 change in distribution of soil salt after winter from november march there were almost no irrigation events except for 30 mm of winter water when compared with the average ece value of the surface soil 0 20 cm in november of 2015 it increased by 0 30 0 50 ds m in the five treatments in march of 2016 fig 4d the increase in ece was most likely because of the upward movement of soil salinity with water from the lower layer to the upper layer however the average ece value at 0 60 cm for treatments gg1 gg5 was 1 54 2 23 2 33 2 81 and 2 79 ds m respectively fig 5 c these results suggest that there was almost no salts leaching or accumulation in the soil above the gravel sand layer during winter and indicated that little salt moved into the upper soil from the groundwater below the gravel sand layer similar to the results found in previous reports chen et al 2015a 2015b chu et al 2014 li et al 2016 2015a 2015b sun et al 2012 2013 moreover the average soil ece in the 0 60 cm layer was still below 4 ds m which indicated that the irrigation management entered into the 3rd stage 3 2 3 effect of treated effluent on soil salinity in the normal irrigation stage in the 3rd stage the irrigation was applied to maintain soil health and ensure the normal growth of tall fescue the soil ece in july 2016 increased as the percentage of treated effluent increased and there were significant positive linear correlations between the soil ece and the percentage of treated effluent at 0 20 cm p 0 01 0 40 cm p 0 01 and 0 60 cm p 0 05 fig 6 a which was similar to the results observed during long term irrigation with recycled wastewater in a previous study qian and mecham 2005 fig 4e shows the spatial distribution of the soil salinity in early july 2016 during which time the ece value in all soil layers except for the surface soil was higher than that in march of 2016 the average ece value at 0 60 cm was 2 27 3 17 2 83 3 38 and 4 01 ds m for gg1 gg5 respectively representing an increase of 0 50 1 22 ds m fig 5c moreover the ece value in the profiles of 0 40 cm ranged from 1 53 to 2 96 ds m representing an increase of 0 10 0 68 ds m fig 5b the increased soil salinity may be attributed to the irrigation water quality in the rainless season yao et al 2017 from march to june there was a total rainfall of 182 mm but approximately 120 mm of which fell in mid late june in truth the average ece at 0 40 cm in late may had been increased to 1 32 2 82 3 35 3 34 and 4 44 ds m for gg1 gg5 respectively fig 5b it should be noted that for the gg5 treatment the average soil salinity exceeded the salt tolerance threshold of tall fescue after the precipitation in june the soil salinity especially in the surface soil was well leached and decreased but the total amount above the gravel layer was still higher than that in march of 2016 the accumulated soil salinity was leached during the rainy season with a total of 358 mm rainfall occurring from july to november 2016 fig 4f and fig 5 show the spatial distribution of soil salinity in november of 2016 the average ece values ranged from 1 98 to 2 60 ds m at depths of 0 to 60 cm for the five treatments representing decreases of 0 29 1 41 ds m when compared with those observed in july of 2016 similar to the soil profiles of 0 40 and 0 20 cm the average ece decreased to 0 98 2 16 ds m and 0 66 2 40 ds m respectively moreover the linear growth in soil salinity was highly correlated with the increasing percentage of treated effluent p 0 05 fig 6b when compared to the average ece in march of 2016 the soil salinity of the five treatments sampled in november 2016 also declined except for gg1 at 0 60 cm the ece values changed by 0 44 0 42 0 16 0 37 and 0 19 ds m fig 5c for the gg1 gg5 treatments at 0 20 cm only the ece value of the gg5 treatment was 0 36 ds m higher than that in march fig 5a throughout one year of water management during the 3rd stage the soil salinity changed slightly or declined continually during the rainless season temporary salt accumulation was found in all treatments and the average ece of gg5 was likely beyond the salt tolerance threshold of the tall fescue however the accumulated salt was well leached during the rainy season therefore micro sprinkler irrigation with eciw in the range of 4 21 6 89 ds m is possible for sea reclamation land but periodic examination of the soil salinity may be needed especially for periods in which there is less rainfall to mitigate the risk of soil salinity accumulation it is suggested that 75 treated effluent i e the eciw should be maintained below 3 5 5 5 ds m be used to irrigate tall fescue in the bohai bay coastal region 3 3 effect of treated effluent irrigation on soil sare the sare is the sodium adsorption ratio of a saturated soil extract at the experimental site the average soil sare in the 0 60 cm soil profile before planting tall fescue was 69 4 mmol l 0 5 at the end of the 1st stage the average sare value of the five treatments decreased by 57 8 29 3 mmol l 0 5 fig 7 a while at the end of the 2nd stage the sare values for gg1 gg5 decreased by 81 1 88 0 of the initial value fig 7b after which they changed slightly in early july of 2016 the sare values were 9 36 7 12 10 86 10 75 and 13 74 mmol l 0 5 for the five treatments fig 7c there was also a significant positive regression between the soil sare and the sariw in the soil layers of 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm respectively p 0 05 fig 8 these findings are similar to those reported by ayers and westcot 1976 and may indicate that the quality of the irrigation water clearly affected the soil salinity and the relative concentration of some specific ions 3 4 effect of treated effluent irrigation on soil phe the soil original phe was 7 68 as the salt leached out an alkalizing phenomenon occurred fig 9 a in the 2nd stage september 2015 the phe of gg1 gg5 was in the range of 8 06 8 20 in the surface soil the increased phe may be attributed to the high ph of irrigation water the hydrolysis of exchangeable sodium beek and breemen 1973 or that the soil calcium carbonate was partially dissolved to increase the hco3 content in the solution because the soil ca2 was leached with water chen et al 2000 however the phe decreased at the end of the 2nd stage to 7 71 7 56 7 76 7 29 and 7 44 for gg1 gg5 in the 0 60 cm of soil profile respectively fig 9b these findings are similar to the results reported in previous studies li et al 2015a sun et al 2012 wang et al 2011 the decreased ph may be attributed to the soil cation exchange precipitation evaporation and addition of fertilizers beek and breemen 1973 during the 3rd stage the phe varied noticeably after one year of water management the average phe was 7 40 while that in the gg1 gg2 gg3 gg4 and gg5 treatments was 7 54 7 47 7 39 7 37 and 7 25 respectively in 0 60 cm soil profile fig 9c as shown in fig 10 the soil phe decreased with the increasing percentage of treated effluent and significant correlations were observed at 0 20 cm p 0 01 20 40 cm p 0 05 and 40 60 cm p 0 05 these results were different from those reported by qian and mecham 2005 who found that irrigation with treated effluent led to a 0 3 unit increase in ph this difference may have been the result of the characteristics of the irrigation water such as the bicarbonate level in the study by qian and mecham 2005 the ph and bicarbonate concentration of treated effluent were higher than those of surface water which was the opposite of the water applied in the present study 3 5 effect of treated effluent irrigation on soil inorganic nitrogen and available phosphorus table 4 shows the spatial distribution of inorganic nitrogen and available phosphorus in the root zone soil during the 3rd stage before fertilizing the inorganic nitrogen content of saturated soil extract at 0 40 cm for gg1 gg5 was 2 75 3 69 3 31 2 99 and 2 91 mg l and the available phosphorus content of soil was 4 85 5 69 7 16 5 07 and 5 90 mg kg respectively from a multiple linear regression analysis the available phosphorus content had a positive correlation with the treated effluent p 0 01 and a negative correlation with the biomass of tall fescue p 0 01 while the nitrogen content had no significant correlation with the treated effluent and the biomass this result may be explained by the facts that the total phosphorus content of the treated effluent was 3 times that of the fresh water while the total nitrogen was only 1 14 times table 1 and phosphorus is easily fixed in the soil the growth of tall fescue affects the soil nutrient content with more biomass absorbing more nutrients from the soil however further study is needed to evaluate the long term effects of treated effluent irrigation on soil nutrient content 3 6 response of tall fescue to treated effluent irrigation fig 11 shows the biomass of tall fescue for each treatment during the study period in general the biomass of tall fescue increased by 11 80 when micro sprinkler irrigated with treated effluent instead of freshwater this finding is similar to those observed in other studies al lahham et al 2003 al nakshabandi et al 1997 chakrabarti 1995 and likely occurred because nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate in treated effluent provide fertilizer value to plants toze 2006 as fig 11 shows the biomass of gg1 gg5 sampled in september 2015 august 2016 and november 2011 increased with the increasing percentage of treated effluent during these period nutrients of treated effluent promoted the growth of the plant during the november 2015 sampling there was no significant differences in biomass between the five treatments fig 11a during this time tall fescue grew slowly because of the low temperature and adding fertilizer may have offset the effects of the nutrient value of the applied water in june of 2016 the growth biomass of different treatments followed the order of gg4 gg5 gg1 gg2 gg3 fig 11b from march to june of 2016 there was a high evaporation rate and rainless season resulting in increased soil salinity in the rootzone in fact the soil salinity can delay the reviving time of tall fescue which may affect the visual attractiveness and decrease the yield of the gg5 treatment 4 conclusions the present study showed that micro sprinkler irrigation worked well in combination with different levels of treated effluent when applied to tall fescue in sea reclamation land the irrigation management included an enhanced salt leaching stage water salt regulation stage and normal irrigation stage the enhanced salt leaching stage and water salt regulation stage were two main soil salt leaching periods in which the first stage leached the soil salinity of the 0 10 cm layer well within 10 days while the second stage leached the soil salinity above the gravel layer drop to less than 4 ds m in the next 3 5 months during the normal irrigation stage the observed average ece in the 0 60 cm soil layer mainly changed within the range of 1 80 4 01 ds m therefore it is feasible to use treated effluent to leach soil salinity by micro sprinkler irrigation in sea reclamation land the soil salinity increased as the percentage of treated effluent increased during the enhanced salt leaching stage and water salt regulation stage irrigation with 50 treated effluent can rapidly leach into the soil because of its relatively higher infiltration property and lower salinity however during the normal irrigation stage 75 treated effluent i e irrigation water with an ec below 3 5 5 5 ds m is suggested to better control soil salinity in the sea reclamation land because it can keep the soil salinity below the salt tolerance threshold of tall fescue even in the rainless season of the bohai gulf region with soil salt leaching the soil ece and sare both decreased while the soil phe increased first and then decreased their performances depended on the quality of irrigation water moreover a positive correlation existed between soil available phosphorus content with treated effluent and a negative correlation with biomass of tall fescue in addition irrigation with higher percentage of treated effluent generally increased the biomass of tall fescue overall a method of micro sprinkler irrigation with treated effluent and three stages of irrigation management enhanced salt leaching water salt regulation and normal irrigation stage could be used for tall fescue turf planting in sea reclamation land with a gravel sand layer but periodic examination of soil salinity may be needed especially for years with less rainfall acknowledgements this study was supported by the key research program of frontier sciences of the chinese academy of sciences grant no

11173,to develop a micro sprinkler method with treated effluent for tall fescue festuca arundinacea cultivation in sea reclamation land and test its effect on soil physical and chemical properties a field experiment with five treatments of water quality was conducted in 2015 2016 the five treatments of water quality were created with a mixture of treated effluent ec 4 2 6 9 ds m and fresh groundwater and the percentage of treated effluent was 0 25 50 75 and 100 saline soil contained a gravel sand layer imbedded at depth of 60 cm irrigation management was divided into three stages enhanced salt leaching stage continuous irrigation water salt regulation stage irrigation based on the soil matric potential smp at 5 kpa and normal irrigation stage irrigation based on the smp at 20 kpa the results indicated that the first stage lasted for 10 days while the electrical conductivity of saturated extracts ece of the surface 10 cm from 38 29 ds m dropped to 4 23 6 28 ds m after the second stage 3 5 months the ece in the 0 60 cm soil layer dropped to 1 42 3 16 ds m during these stages treatment with 50 treated effluent led to relatively good infiltration and lower salinity and was therefore good at enhancing the salt leaching efficiency in the third stage the observed ece of the 0 60 cm changed slightly but 75 treated effluent could maintain the soil salinity below the threshold salinity of tall fescue even in the rainless season during the process soil sodium adsorption ratio decreased while soil ph increased first and then decreased soil available phosphorus content showed a close correlation with treated effluent and the biomass of tall fescue moreover the tall fescue maintained normal growth therefore it is possible to use treated effluent to micro sprinkler irrigation on tall fescue in sea reclamation land keywords salt leaching irrigation management tall fescue saline soil 1 introduction sea reclamation has been a common approach to increase the land area for living and developing along the coastal areas in many parts of the world in china a total reclamation area of 2469 km2 was approved by the state council in 2011 2020 for economic development wang et al 2014 in sea reclamation land bare ground is exposed which not only affects the landscape but also leads to sandstorms landscape construction is required to meet the demands of living and developing environments sea reclamation land is usually very saline for example the mean electrical conductivity of saturated soil extracts ece is more than 30 ds m in our study area li et al 2015a moreover the salt composition in the study area is similar to that of seawater with chlorine and sodium being the main ions accounting for 60 80 of the total respectively there is also a high water table at 0 5 3 m and the aquifer contains saline water traditional reclamation methods such as applying gypsum combining surface irrigation and water drainage technologies have made it difficult to improve saline soil for plants although some halophyte plants such as tamarix chinensis can survive under such conditions they are not sufficient to create a better landscape replacing saline soil with non saline soil is the most popular method used in our research area but this is limited by high economic input and the increasing difficulty in identifying large amounts of non saline soil resources recently several studies have been conducted in the bohai gulf region east china sun et al 2013 found that a gravel sand layer at depth of 80 cm was effective at preventing the upward movement of salt into the surface soil from shallow saline groundwater during winter li et al 2015b found that the technology of surface drip irrigation with phased irrigation management could enhance salt leaching and maintain good plant growth the drip irrigation was started based on the soil matric potential smp at 20 cm and the smp target value was adjusted according to the process of salt leaching irrigation water quality and plant growth li et al 2015a found that when the smp was controlled at above 5 and 10 kpa in the two irrigation stages drip irrigation with 4 01 ds m saline water could maintain a 50 survival rate for salt sensitive plants in a study investigating drip irrigation with freshwater chen et al 2015a controlled the smp threshold into three stages of 5 10 and 20 kpa in addition micro sprinkler irrigation of tall fescue festuca arundinacea with freshwater was also conducted when the smp was controlled above 5 15 and 20 kpa chu et al 2014 the freshwater supply of the bohai gulf region including the research area is very limited with only 660 m3 per capita sun 2007 moreover there were about 3 9 billion m3 of treated effluent in the coastal cities of the bohai gulf region in 2015 li 2016 liu 2016 wei 2016 wu and peng 2016 while the utilization rate was only 8 3 li 2016 which is far lower than the 80 in israel oecd 2015 there has been a great deal of research on irrigation with treated effluent and the results of these studies have identified potential salinity as a restriction to the use of treated effluent the characteristics of treated effluent such as the salt content and concentration of specific chemical elements may cause soil salt accumulation plant damage or soil permeability problems al hamaiedeh and bino 2010 asano and pettygrove 1987 oster 1994 toze 2006 furthermore spraying plants with saline water may cause foliar damage because many plants absorb salts directly through their leaves shalhevet 1994 tanji 1990 tall fescue is a plant widely used in landscapes that has a salt tolerance threshold of 3 9 ds m maas and hoffman 1977 the present study was conducted to develop a micro sprinkler irrigation for application of treated effluent to tall fescue in sea reclamation land the specific goals were 1 to test the process and effect of soil salinity leaching during irrigation with different levels of treated effluent and 2 to find the correct percentage of treated effluent for use as long term irrigation water and to maintain normal growth of plants and soil health 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site experiments were conducted in 2015 2016 at the industrial zone 39 03 n 118 48 e located in the caofeidian district in the south of tangshan city east china this region is located in the northern portion of the bohai gulf which borders the pacific ocean the station has a typical semi humid monsoon climate and annual precipitation of approximately 555 mm most of which occurs from july to september the soil of the study area is sandy loam soil and the region was reclaimed from the sea in 2007 the soil salt composition was similar to that of seawater with chlorine and sodium comprising the main ions the average electrical conductivity ph phe and sodium adsorption ratio sare of the saturated soil extracts above a soil depth of 60 cm were ece 38 3 ds m phe 7 68 and sare 69 4 mmol l 0 5 water table 0 8 1 2 m the average soil bulk density of the initial saline soils was 1 69 g cm3 in the 0 60 cm soil layers which was reduced to 1 55 g cm3 after soil tillage the soil nutrient characteristics for 0 60 cm soil layers were organic matter content 11 4 g kg total n 0 24 g kg available phosphorus 8 1 mg kg available potassium 464 mg kg 2 2 experimental design 2 2 1 plot layout and experiment design based on the successful reclamation of the coastal saline soil chen et al 2015a 2015b chu et al 2014 li et al 2016 2015a 2015b sun et al 2012 the soil treatments before planting were as follows soil was removed to a depth of about 60 cm a 10 cm thick gravel layer and a 5 cm thick sand layer were laid in the bottom to cut off the capillary porosity fig 1 several polyvinyl chloride tubes were placed at the low edge of the gravel sand layer with spacings of 10 m to allow the leaching water to flow out after which the saline sodic soil was backfilled and levelled the irrigation water was a mixture of treated effluent and fresh water the treated effluent which was from the caofeidian district sewage treatment plant maintained by the tangshan caofeidian drainage operating companies was transported and stored in a small reservoir the quality of treated effluent met the first grade national standard for wastewater discharge gb18918 2002 2003 fresh water was pumped from a deep layer groundwater well located at the experimental site there were five irrigation water treatments with percentages of treated effluent were 0 gg1 25 gg2 50 gg3 75 gg4 and 100 gg5 all treatments were replicated three times with the experimental plots arranged in a complete randomized block design the area of each plot was 9 0 by 6 0 m and the distance between the plots was 2 5 m each plot contained 6 micro sprinklers with a 3 0 m space between them according to chu et al 2013 a micro sprinkler beijing luckrain plastic industry ltd china with a flow rate of 120 l h at 0 2 mpa operating pressure and a wetted diameter of about 3 1 m was selected the tall fescue houndog v turf sod covered over the saline sodic soil directly the irrigation water quality and its degree of restriction on permeability are presented in tables 1 and 2 the salt concentration of the treated effluent electrical conductivity of irrigation water eciw 4 2 6 9 ds m was several times higher than that of the fresh water eciw 1 0 ds m similar to the nutrient concentration the eciw and sodium adsorption ratio of irrigation water sariw increased and the ph of the irrigation water phiw decreased as the percentage of treated effluent increased according to the evaluation of permeability using eciw and sariw proposed by ayers and westcot 1976 the irrigation water of the gg1 treatment posed a severe degree while the gg2 and gg3 treatments posed a slight to moderate degree and a slight degree respectively there was no restriction on permeability of gg4 and gg5 treatments the number of fecal coliforms in treated effluent was 130 1700 cfu l while the heavy metals levels were suitable for irrigation except for se which was present at 0 029 mg l ayers and westcot 1976 the irrigation management was divided into three stages including enhanced salt leaching stage 1st stage water salt regulation stage 2nd stage and normal irrigation stage 3rd stage the first two stages were the two main salt leaching periods the 1st stage was designed to leach salt from the 0 10 cm layer of the soil with continuous irrigation during which time about 10 20 mm of water was applied per day the stage ended when the soil ece of the 0 10 cm layer was close to or less than 6 ds m during the 2nd stage salt was leached from the soil above the gravel sand layer by ensuring the net downward movement of water asano and pettygrove 1987 according to the successful reclamation of drip irrigation with saline water in coastal saline soil li et al 2015a the irrigation was based on the smp at a depth of 0 2 m which was controlled at 5 kpa the stage terminated when the average soil ece was 4 ds m above the gravel sand layer since the salinity tolerance threshold of tall fescue was about 3 9 ds m the 3rd stage was normal irrigation during which irrigation was applied when the smp reached the target value 20 kpa during the second and last stages the depth of water for each irrigation event was 10 mm and the target value could be adjusted uniformly according to the tall fescue growth and the soil salinity fertilizer was applied uniformly to each treatment in early october 2015 and july 2016 respectively the rates of n p2o5 and k2o application were 20 g m2 y 5 g m2 y and 10 g m2 y respectively in addition tall fescue was trimmed and weeded regularly 2 2 2 observation and measurements there was one tensiometer installed in one plot for each treatment for observation of smp at a depth of 0 2 m fig 1 and observations were made daily at 8 00 and 16 00 soil samples of each plot above the gravel layer were collected in mid july mid september and early november 2015 as well as in mid march early july and early november 2016 the soil was obtained horizontally at 0 50 100 150 cm from the micro sprinkler and all sample depths in the vertical apart were the same 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 and 50 60 cm the soil ece phe inorganic nitrogen nmin and soluble cations were based on extracts of saturated soil the ece and phe were determined by a conductivity meter dds 307 rex shanghai china and a ph meter phs 3c rex shanghai china respectively nmin included nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen which were measured by means of colorimetry bao 2000 respectively soluble cations such as na k ca2 and mg2 were measured with icp oes optima 5300dv usa available phosphorus was extracted with 0 5 mol l nahco3 bao 2000 the sar was calculated as follows 1 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 0 5 where the concentration of each cation was in mmol l in this experiment average ece phe sare and

which t represents the time when soil samples were obtained j the four horizontal distances n from the micro sprinkler where soil samples were obtained k the depth m of the soil sample and s j k the depth interval of the soil layer the growth biomass of tall fescue was determined when it has sufficient height for harvesting 20 cm all the plots were trimmed at the same time there was five times harvest during the study period the fresh biomass in each plot was weighted and some was used to determine the water content the growth biomass q g r was calculated as follows 3 q g r t q f r e t 1 w where q f r e is the weight of the fresh tall fescue kg ha w is the water content of the fresh tall fescue and t is the moving time 2 3 statistical procedures data were analyzed using ibm spss statistics ver 19 0 ibm co armonk ny usa the differences in growth biomass of tall fescue among treatments were compared using one way analyses of variance anova the least significant difference test at a significance level of 0 05 the figures were prepared using sigma plot 10 0 systat software inc chicago il usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation irrigation amount and soil matric potential 3 1 1 precipitation fig 2 shows the precipitation for the area during the study period from july to november 2015 about 120 days after planting the total precipitation was 395 mm there was no rain during the 1st stage and almost all of the rain was concentrated in the 2nd stage during the 3rd stage march november 2016 the total precipitation was 539 mm the rainfall events mainly occurred from mid july to september 2015 mid late june 2016 and late july to early september 2016 there is no rain data for the period from november to march but the average amount was 32 mm in the same period during the past 30 years 3 1 2 irrigation the irrigation for each treatment during the tall fescue growing season is shown in table 3 the 1st stage and 2nd stage lasted for 10 days and 3 5 months respectively a total of approximately 410 500 mm irrigation water was applied and no obvious patterns were obtained among treatments during the 3rd stage the irrigation amount ranged from 280 to 400 mm for treatments gg1 gg5 over the growing season about 7 5 months and the irrigation amount increased with the increasing percentage of treated effluent except for gg3 3 1 3 soil matric potential fig 3 presents the change in smp at a depth of 20 cm during the study period in the 2nd stage the smp threshold was controlled well above 5 kpa then adjusted to 10 kpa in the later period of 2015 to promote root growth to the deep layer for winter survival during most of this stage the smp changed above the controlled values but some smp values were beyond the controlled threshold this was likely because the twice daily monitoring data from the tensiometer showed a bit of a lag in the 3rd stage the smp threshold was mostly controlled at 20 kpa except for one period that was controlled at 10 kpa to alleviate the salt damage to plants in a rainless season the smp fluctuated increasingly because the soil water changed greatly as water consumption and evapotranspiration increased on hot days 3 2 effect of treated effluent irrigation on soil salinity ece ece is the electrical conductivity of a saturated soil extract at the experimental site the soil ece in the 0 60 cm soil layer before planting tall fescue turf was relatively uniform with an average of 38 29 ds m 3 2 1 effect of treated effluent on soil salt leaching fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of ece in the vertical transects for each treatment at different soil sampling times the salinity changed significantly in the 1st stage and the 2nd stage fig 4a c the 1st stage lasted for 10 d and the salinity of upper soil was well leached the average ece in the 0 10 cm soil profile for the gg1 gg5 treatments decreased to 3 73 4 09 3 81 4 91 and 6 28 ds m respectively the corresponding reductions were 90 27 89 32 90 04 87 17 and 83 61 of the initial soil ece fig 4a the 2nd stage lasted for 3 5 months as the soil salinity above the gravel layer continued to decline in november of 2015 fig 4c the average ece values of the 0 40 cm soil layer for the gg1 gg5 treatments decreased to 0 66 1 44 1 57 1 91 and 2 22 ds m with an average value of 1 56 ds m for 0 60 cm the values decreased to 1 42 2 46 2 25 2 72 and 3 01 ds m respectively although the ultimate soil salinity increased with increasing percentages of treated effluent the ece values were lower than the salt tolerance threshold for tall fescue indicating that the 2nd stage was completed the 1st stage and the 2nd stage were two main soil salt leaching periods based on the ultimate soil salinity at the end of each stage the 1st stage was the fastest desalination period with an average decrease in ece of 2 40 ds m per day in the 0 60 cm soil layer in addition the salt leaching efficiency of the five treatments was different even when they were irrigated with an equivalent amount of water 110 mm table 3 at the end of the 1st stage the average ece in the 0 60 cm soil profile for the gg1 gg5 treatments was 14 48 14 02 13 25 13 59 and 15 87 ds m the salt leaching efficiency increased as the percentage of treated effluent increased to 50 then decreased while for the surface soil the gg1 and gg3 treatments leached salinity faster than the other treatments these results suggested that irrigation with 50 treated effluent could enhance the desalting process in the experimental region and that using freshwater tend to rapidly reduce the salinity of the surface soil oster 1994 based on the information presented above lower water salinity and good infiltration capacity of the irrigation water were likely to be the main factors that clearly affected the salt leaching efficiency a lower eciw means that less salinity is inputted into the soil via the irrigation water while more salinity enters the soil when the irrigation water has a higher eciw a high infiltration rate means that more water can move into the soil and be used for leaching salt especially in the deeper layers because the infiltration rate decreased with increasing sar and decreasing total cation concentration oster and schroer 1979 non linear regression equations were used to describe the relationship of the salt leaching rate sl ds m d sariw mmol l 0 5 and eciw ds m in the soil profiles of 0 20 cm and 0 60 cm the regression equations were as follows sl0 20 cm 1 722 0 135 sariw 0 646 eciw 0 054 sariw eciw r2 0 982 and sl0 60 cm 0 065 0 183 sariw 1 105 eciw 0 084 sariw eciw r2 0 990 respectively 3 2 2 change in distribution of soil salt after winter from november march there were almost no irrigation events except for 30 mm of winter water when compared with the average ece value of the surface soil 0 20 cm in november of 2015 it increased by 0 30 0 50 ds m in the five treatments in march of 2016 fig 4d the increase in ece was most likely because of the upward movement of soil salinity with water from the lower layer to the upper layer however the average ece value at 0 60 cm for treatments gg1 gg5 was 1 54 2 23 2 33 2 81 and 2 79 ds m respectively fig 5 c these results suggest that there was almost no salts leaching or accumulation in the soil above the gravel sand layer during winter and indicated that little salt moved into the upper soil from the groundwater below the gravel sand layer similar to the results found in previous reports chen et al 2015a 2015b chu et al 2014 li et al 2016 2015a 2015b sun et al 2012 2013 moreover the average soil ece in the 0 60 cm layer was still below 4 ds m which indicated that the irrigation management entered into the 3rd stage 3 2 3 effect of treated effluent on soil salinity in the normal irrigation stage in the 3rd stage the irrigation was applied to maintain soil health and ensure the normal growth of tall fescue the soil ece in july 2016 increased as the percentage of treated effluent increased and there were significant positive linear correlations between the soil ece and the percentage of treated effluent at 0 20 cm p 0 01 0 40 cm p 0 01 and 0 60 cm p 0 05 fig 6 a which was similar to the results observed during long term irrigation with recycled wastewater in a previous study qian and mecham 2005 fig 4e shows the spatial distribution of the soil salinity in early july 2016 during which time the ece value in all soil layers except for the surface soil was higher than that in march of 2016 the average ece value at 0 60 cm was 2 27 3 17 2 83 3 38 and 4 01 ds m for gg1 gg5 respectively representing an increase of 0 50 1 22 ds m fig 5c moreover the ece value in the profiles of 0 40 cm ranged from 1 53 to 2 96 ds m representing an increase of 0 10 0 68 ds m fig 5b the increased soil salinity may be attributed to the irrigation water quality in the rainless season yao et al 2017 from march to june there was a total rainfall of 182 mm but approximately 120 mm of which fell in mid late june in truth the average ece at 0 40 cm in late may had been increased to 1 32 2 82 3 35 3 34 and 4 44 ds m for gg1 gg5 respectively fig 5b it should be noted that for the gg5 treatment the average soil salinity exceeded the salt tolerance threshold of tall fescue after the precipitation in june the soil salinity especially in the surface soil was well leached and decreased but the total amount above the gravel layer was still higher than that in march of 2016 the accumulated soil salinity was leached during the rainy season with a total of 358 mm rainfall occurring from july to november 2016 fig 4f and fig 5 show the spatial distribution of soil salinity in november of 2016 the average ece values ranged from 1 98 to 2 60 ds m at depths of 0 to 60 cm for the five treatments representing decreases of 0 29 1 41 ds m when compared with those observed in july of 2016 similar to the soil profiles of 0 40 and 0 20 cm the average ece decreased to 0 98 2 16 ds m and 0 66 2 40 ds m respectively moreover the linear growth in soil salinity was highly correlated with the increasing percentage of treated effluent p 0 05 fig 6b when compared to the average ece in march of 2016 the soil salinity of the five treatments sampled in november 2016 also declined except for gg1 at 0 60 cm the ece values changed by 0 44 0 42 0 16 0 37 and 0 19 ds m fig 5c for the gg1 gg5 treatments at 0 20 cm only the ece value of the gg5 treatment was 0 36 ds m higher than that in march fig 5a throughout one year of water management during the 3rd stage the soil salinity changed slightly or declined continually during the rainless season temporary salt accumulation was found in all treatments and the average ece of gg5 was likely beyond the salt tolerance threshold of the tall fescue however the accumulated salt was well leached during the rainy season therefore micro sprinkler irrigation with eciw in the range of 4 21 6 89 ds m is possible for sea reclamation land but periodic examination of the soil salinity may be needed especially for periods in which there is less rainfall to mitigate the risk of soil salinity accumulation it is suggested that 75 treated effluent i e the eciw should be maintained below 3 5 5 5 ds m be used to irrigate tall fescue in the bohai bay coastal region 3 3 effect of treated effluent irrigation on soil sare the sare is the sodium adsorption ratio of a saturated soil extract at the experimental site the average soil sare in the 0 60 cm soil profile before planting tall fescue was 69 4 mmol l 0 5 at the end of the 1st stage the average sare value of the five treatments decreased by 57 8 29 3 mmol l 0 5 fig 7 a while at the end of the 2nd stage the sare values for gg1 gg5 decreased by 81 1 88 0 of the initial value fig 7b after which they changed slightly in early july of 2016 the sare values were 9 36 7 12 10 86 10 75 and 13 74 mmol l 0 5 for the five treatments fig 7c there was also a significant positive regression between the soil sare and the sariw in the soil layers of 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm respectively p 0 05 fig 8 these findings are similar to those reported by ayers and westcot 1976 and may indicate that the quality of the irrigation water clearly affected the soil salinity and the relative concentration of some specific ions 3 4 effect of treated effluent irrigation on soil phe the soil original phe was 7 68 as the salt leached out an alkalizing phenomenon occurred fig 9 a in the 2nd stage september 2015 the phe of gg1 gg5 was in the range of 8 06 8 20 in the surface soil the increased phe may be attributed to the high ph of irrigation water the hydrolysis of exchangeable sodium beek and breemen 1973 or that the soil calcium carbonate was partially dissolved to increase the hco3 content in the solution because the soil ca2 was leached with water chen et al 2000 however the phe decreased at the end of the 2nd stage to 7 71 7 56 7 76 7 29 and 7 44 for gg1 gg5 in the 0 60 cm of soil profile respectively fig 9b these findings are similar to the results reported in previous studies li et al 2015a sun et al 2012 wang et al 2011 the decreased ph may be attributed to the soil cation exchange precipitation evaporation and addition of fertilizers beek and breemen 1973 during the 3rd stage the phe varied noticeably after one year of water management the average phe was 7 40 while that in the gg1 gg2 gg3 gg4 and gg5 treatments was 7 54 7 47 7 39 7 37 and 7 25 respectively in 0 60 cm soil profile fig 9c as shown in fig 10 the soil phe decreased with the increasing percentage of treated effluent and significant correlations were observed at 0 20 cm p 0 01 20 40 cm p 0 05 and 40 60 cm p 0 05 these results were different from those reported by qian and mecham 2005 who found that irrigation with treated effluent led to a 0 3 unit increase in ph this difference may have been the result of the characteristics of the irrigation water such as the bicarbonate level in the study by qian and mecham 2005 the ph and bicarbonate concentration of treated effluent were higher than those of surface water which was the opposite of the water applied in the present study 3 5 effect of treated effluent irrigation on soil inorganic nitrogen and available phosphorus table 4 shows the spatial distribution of inorganic nitrogen and available phosphorus in the root zone soil during the 3rd stage before fertilizing the inorganic nitrogen content of saturated soil extract at 0 40 cm for gg1 gg5 was 2 75 3 69 3 31 2 99 and 2 91 mg l and the available phosphorus content of soil was 4 85 5 69 7 16 5 07 and 5 90 mg kg respectively from a multiple linear regression analysis the available phosphorus content had a positive correlation with the treated effluent p 0 01 and a negative correlation with the biomass of tall fescue p 0 01 while the nitrogen content had no significant correlation with the treated effluent and the biomass this result may be explained by the facts that the total phosphorus content of the treated effluent was 3 times that of the fresh water while the total nitrogen was only 1 14 times table 1 and phosphorus is easily fixed in the soil the growth of tall fescue affects the soil nutrient content with more biomass absorbing more nutrients from the soil however further study is needed to evaluate the long term effects of treated effluent irrigation on soil nutrient content 3 6 response of tall fescue to treated effluent irrigation fig 11 shows the biomass of tall fescue for each treatment during the study period in general the biomass of tall fescue increased by 11 80 when micro sprinkler irrigated with treated effluent instead of freshwater this finding is similar to those observed in other studies al lahham et al 2003 al nakshabandi et al 1997 chakrabarti 1995 and likely occurred because nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate in treated effluent provide fertilizer value to plants toze 2006 as fig 11 shows the biomass of gg1 gg5 sampled in september 2015 august 2016 and november 2011 increased with the increasing percentage of treated effluent during these period nutrients of treated effluent promoted the growth of the plant during the november 2015 sampling there was no significant differences in biomass between the five treatments fig 11a during this time tall fescue grew slowly because of the low temperature and adding fertilizer may have offset the effects of the nutrient value of the applied water in june of 2016 the growth biomass of different treatments followed the order of gg4 gg5 gg1 gg2 gg3 fig 11b from march to june of 2016 there was a high evaporation rate and rainless season resulting in increased soil salinity in the rootzone in fact the soil salinity can delay the reviving time of tall fescue which may affect the visual attractiveness and decrease the yield of the gg5 treatment 4 conclusions the present study showed that micro sprinkler irrigation worked well in combination with different levels of treated effluent when applied to tall fescue in sea reclamation land the irrigation management included an enhanced salt leaching stage water salt regulation stage and normal irrigation stage the enhanced salt leaching stage and water salt regulation stage were two main soil salt leaching periods in which the first stage leached the soil salinity of the 0 10 cm layer well within 10 days while the second stage leached the soil salinity above the gravel layer drop to less than 4 ds m in the next 3 5 months during the normal irrigation stage the observed average ece in the 0 60 cm soil layer mainly changed within the range of 1 80 4 01 ds m therefore it is feasible to use treated effluent to leach soil salinity by micro sprinkler irrigation in sea reclamation land the soil salinity increased as the percentage of treated effluent increased during the enhanced salt leaching stage and water salt regulation stage irrigation with 50 treated effluent can rapidly leach into the soil because of its relatively higher infiltration property and lower salinity however during the normal irrigation stage 75 treated effluent i e irrigation water with an ec below 3 5 5 5 ds m is suggested to better control soil salinity in the sea reclamation land because it can keep the soil salinity below the salt tolerance threshold of tall fescue even in the rainless season of the bohai gulf region with soil salt leaching the soil ece and sare both decreased while the soil phe increased first and then decreased their performances depended on the quality of irrigation water moreover a positive correlation existed between soil available phosphorus content with treated effluent and a negative correlation with biomass of tall fescue in addition irrigation with higher percentage of treated effluent generally increased the biomass of tall fescue overall a method of micro sprinkler irrigation with treated effluent and three stages of irrigation management

11174,this study was conducted to understand the behaviour of ten rice genotypes for different water deficit stress levels the spectroscopic hyperspectral reflectance data in the range of 350 2500 nm was recorded and relative water content rwc of plants was measured at different stress levels the optimal wavebands were identified through spectral indices multivariate techniques and neural network technique and prediction models were developed the new water sensitive spectral indices were developed and existing water band spectral indices were also evaluated with respect to rwc these indices based models were efficient in predicting rwc with r2 values ranging from 0 73 to 0 94 the contour plotting using the ratio spectral indices rsi and normalized difference spectral indices ndsi was done in all possible combinations within 350 2500 nm and their correlations with rwc were quantified to identify the best index spectral reflectance data was also used to develop partial least squares regression plsr followed by multiple linear regression mlr and artificial neural networks ann support vector machine regression svr and random forest rf models to calculate plant rwc among these multivariate models plsr mlr was found to be the best model for prediction of rwc with r2 as 0 98 and 0 97 for calibration and validation respectively and root mean square error of prediction rmsep as 5 06 the results indicate that plsr is a robust technique for identification of water deficit stress in the crop although the plsr is robust technique if plsr extracted optimum wavebands are fed into mlr the results are found to be improved significantly the ann model was developed with all spectral reflectance bands the 43 developed model didn t produce satisfactory results therefore the model was developed 44 with plsr selected optimum wavebands as independent x variables and plsr ann model 45 was found better than the ann model alone the study successfully conducts a comparative 46 analysis among various modelling approaches to quantify water deficit stress the methodology developed would help to identify water deficit stress more accurately by predicting rwc in the crops

element for the successful deployment of remote sensing in crop condition monitoring accurate estimation of biophysical parameters from remote sensing can assist in the determination of vegetation physiological status carter 1994 estimation of one of the most important biochemical constituent crop water content through remote sensing has important significances in agriculture and forestry zarco tejada et al 2003 gao and goetz 1995 determination of plant water status plays a significant role in assessing drought stress predicting susceptibility to wildfire ustin et al 1998 pyne et al 1996 and monitoring the general physiological status of crops datt 1999 cheng et al 2011 the determination of water content in plants is very crucial for drought assessment because the insufficient amount of water in crop hampers the production of the food grains negatively the remote sensing is very widely used for accurate retrieval of leaf water content hunt and rock 1989 peñuelas et al 1997 the leaf water content is commonly expressed as equivalent water thickness ewt gravimetric water content gwc and relative water content rwc datt 1999 cheng et al 2010 the ewt is mass per unit leaf area g cm2 whereas the gwc expresses leaf water content as the gravimetric proportions of water relative to other plant material the rwc can be expressed as the ratio of the difference between fresh weight and dry weight to that of the difference of turgid weight and dry weight the rwc serves as a key leaf parameter to determine leaf water content ullah et al 2014 das et al 2017 although the remote sensing technique is widely used for timely detection of variations in the spectral response of plants to changing levels of plant water status over large areas peñuelas et al 1997 ustin et al 1998 pu et al 2003 stimson et al 2005 eitel et al 2006 the multispectral satellite remote sensors exhibit serious limitations to accurately detect changes in plant water status due to coarse spectral resolution and larger revisit time therefore the need of high spectral and spatial resolution remote sensing instruments and sensors was experienced this contributed for the advent of highly precise spectroradiometers for detection of spectral changes the field spectroradiometers and hyperspectral sensors has the capability to detect the electromagnetic spectrum in very narrow contiguous bands which allows the development of spectral indices using minor fluctuations of wavelengths due to change in water status horler et al 1983 gao 1996 peñuelas et al 1993 eitel et al 2006 several previous studies have demonstrated the utilization of spectral reflectance in 350 2500 nm range to assess water content in plants through spectral indices regression analysis and radiative transfer modeling féret et al 2011 zarco tejada et al 2003 in the earlier studies the primary and secondary effects of water content on the spectral response of leaf were evaluated by carter 1994 and it was concluded that 1450 nm 1940 nm and 2500 nm are the most optimal wavebands showing sensitivity to water content the wavelength 400 nm and 700 nm red edge position were also found to be sensitive to plant water content filella and peñuelas 1994 roberts et al 1997 reported the ndvi as a water content sensitive index several studies demonstrated a good relationship between spectral indices developed through nir region 700 1300 nm and plant water content peñuelas et al 1997 serrano et al 2000 ceccato et al 2002 asner et al 2003 imanishi et al 2004 stimson et al 2005 few studies have also indicated that nir region is the less sensitive region of the spectrum compared to swir 1300 2500 nm to establish a relationship between indices and water content danson et al 1992 ceccato et al 2002 eitel et al 2006 most of the indices are two band simple ratio indices utilizing two spectral wavebands mostly one of the wavelengths is found within strong absorption region of water and another is found outside the absorption region of water sims and gamon 2003 eitel et al 2006 to extract larger information on crop water status investigation of entire spectrum is essential use of multivariate regression techniques machine learning methods and artificial neural network approach can utilize the entire spectrum for detection of crop water stress however the high dimensionality and contiguity of hyperspectral data is a problem vaiphasa et al 2005 when utilizing entire spectrum 350 2500 nm range the reason is that the regression techniques like multiple linear regression mlr may suffer from multi collinearity and are often prone to over fitting as numbers of observations could be equal or lesser than the predictors curran 1989 contrary to mlr the partial least square regression technique plsr is a robust technique for development of prediction models the plsr is a combination of principal component analysis pca mlr techniques the concept behind pls is to find a few eigenvectors of spectral matrices that will produce score values that both summarize the variance of spectral reflectance well and are highly correlated with response variables li et al 2007 several researches indicate that plsr can effectively decrease complexity and the multi collinearity of spectral responses by performing simple projection operations in a vector space araújo et al 2001 galvão et al 2001 2008 mahmood et al 2012 consequently reducing the over fitting the plsr combines the most useful information from hundreds of contiguous spectral bands into several principal components to develop a calibration model several studies have highlighted that plsr is a robust prediction model development technique and researchers have used plsr successfully to establish a relationship between spectral reflectance and leaf biochemical and biophysical properties under varying canopy structures asner and martin 2008 the pls regression has been successfully used with spectral data to predict chlorophyll content zhao et al 2016 ji et al 2012 estimation of carotenoid content zhao et al 2015 estimation of relative water content ullah et al 2014 estimation of protein lignin and cellulose thulin et al 2014 estimation of leaf nitrogen content ecarnot et al 2013 estimation of leaf area index and chlorophyll content darvishzadeh et al 2008 estimation of soil organic carbon peng et al 2014 prediction of soil properties mahmood et al 2012 and retrieval of leaf fuel moisture content li et al 2007 though plsr is the most robust technique for prediction model development few researchers have reported that there is a possibility of over fitting that would lead to inaccurate results when testing the developed model on a very different dataset to the calibration one féret et al 2011 therefore optimum wavebands extracted from plsr were fed into mlr and ann techniques separately to check whether the outcome of the combined models is better or not neural networks technique has also been evaluated for development of water content prediction models dawson et al 1998 developed the ann model for prediction of leaf water content and reported a satisfactory coefficient of determination as 0 86 with low rmse 1 3 there are several researches which evaluate multivariate techniques for estimation of crop biochemical and biophysical parameters using spectral reflectance data but very few studies have demonstrated the comparison among efficiency and accuracy of various multivariate models to estimate water content of crop from hyperspectral observations this study bridges this gap by comparing models developed from plsr mlr rf and svr multivariate techniques and ann too the present investigation was done with the following objectives i evaluation of existing water bands indices as well as development of new efficacious water band indices ii identification of the most optimum wavebands sensitive to predict rwc in crops iii development of various rwc prediction models using multivariate techniques and neural networks and their comparison with each other iv evaluation of plsr mlr model to test its efficacy over model developed through only pls

were drought tolerant sahbhagidhan cr 143 nerica l44 moroberekan apo 2 2 data used four leaves sample per genotype for above mentioned 10 genotypes were collected from the field experiment site the plots were in randomized block design and were well irrigated leaves were quickly placed in plastic bags in an airtight container and immediately transferred to the laboratory for spectroscopic measurements at predetermined time intervals in the laboratory the spectroscopic data of above mentioned 10 genotypes were collected using an asd field spec 3 spectroradiometer this instrument collects data into 350 to 2500 nm wavelength at resampled wavelength interval of 1 nm approximately 3 g of fresh leaves for each genotype were put into capped glass tubes filled with distilled water and kept at room temperature to attain full turgidity 2 3 collection of spectroscopic data from leaves the spectral measurements of fresh leaves were recorded in the lab immediately after first spectral reading leaves were allowed to dry at room temperature and spectral measurements were again recorded after 2 3 4 5 6 8 and 10 h from the time of first spectral observation collection for all 10 genotypes 8 spectral observations were recorded for each genotype four spectral observations were recorded for above mentioned hours therefore total 320 spectral observations 10 genotypes x4 replication in observations x8 different hours were recorded the spectral observations were recorded in a dark room having 25 c by using an asd contact probe analytical spectral devices boulder co this contact probe touches the surface of the leaf and has its own constant light source inside it for illumination a black surface has been given which comes underside of the leaf while collecting spectra to minimise the electromagnetic radiation transmitted through the leaf this contact probe is calibrated using a spectralon this contact probe is an accessory of asd field spec 3 spectroradiometer which records spectral reflectance in the 350 to 2500 nm range at sampling intervals of 1 4 nm in the 350 1050 nm range and of 2 nm in the 1000 2500 nm and it provides data after resampling at the 1 nm interval the spectral observations were taken from leaf sample consisted of an overlapping pile of 3 4 leaves to eliminate the background effect 2 4 relative water content rwc computation the water content in the leaves was analyzed using rwc computation for rwc computation the fresh weight fw turgid weight tw and dry weight dw were determined for all genotypes turgid weight was determined after placing the leaves in deionised water for 2 h to obtain dry weight leaves were oven dried at 70 c temperature for 3 days until constant weight was obtained the rwc was calculated using following equation r w c f w d w t w d w 100 2 5 spectral indices computation the plant water status spectral indices utilize simple ratios between the reflectance of a wavelength located within an range of the electromagnetic spectrum strongly absorption by water described as water absorption bands and another wavelength located outside the water absorption band typically used as a control sims and gamon 2003 eitel et al 2006 in this study indices related to plant water status only were evaluated spectral indices evaluated are given in table 1 2 6 correlation analysis between narrow band indices and rwc through contour plotting two narrow band indices were computed and the correlation between computed indices with rwc was determined the coefficient of determination r2 was plotted with wavelengths by a predefined matrix scheme this plotting the contour plotting lambda versus lambda plotting approach exhibits a specific pattern where highest r2 can be seen as hot spots many studies have reported this plotting as the best approach for identification of wavelength having maximum r2 sahoo et al 2015 the highest r2 value was extracted from the hot spot area the optimal indices were selected by choosing the wavelength combination that portrayed the highest r2 value in the contour plot for the implementation of contour plotting a program was written in matlab 2 7 multivariate analysis to perform multivariate analysis the data was split into the training set and the test set for calibration and validation respectively the training set of data was 2 3 sample and test data was 1 3 sample of the whole dataset the overall performance and robustness of the models were appraised by the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error of cross validation rmsecv root mean square error of prediction rmsep and ratio of prediction deviation rpd and upper lower confidence intervals of regression at 95 confidence level the rpd is computed as the ratio between standard deviation and rmse excellent calibrations were those with r2 0 95 rpd 4 nduwamungu et al 2009b the ratio of prediction deviation rpd is considered as a parameter of strength for the prediction model a model having rpd value 0 2 3 is considered as very poor 2 4 3 0 is considered as poor 3 1 4 9 is considered as fair and prediction are considered as reliable 5 0 6 4 is considered as good 6 5 8 0 is considered as very good with very reliable predictions and model with rpd above 8 1 is considered as excellent for prediction williams and sobering 1993 the detailed schematic diagram of methodology is given in fig 1 2 7 1 multivariate techniques evaluated support vector regression svr artificial neural networks ann random forest rf and the partial least square regression plsr plsr followed by multiple linear regression mlr and plsr followed by ann were evaluated to determine the best suitable multivariate model for regression between spectral reflectance and rwc 2 7 2 the partial least square regression plsr the plsr multivariate analysis was performed on spectral reflectance data and rwc other multivariate regression models based on hyperspectral data shows a high degree of collinearity especially when the numbers of predictors are equal or higher in number than sample observations and the input data lead to a high r2 curran 1989 the plsr has proved as the robust technique which can handle high dimensionality of hyperspectral data many researchers have successfully used plsr for estimation of various leaf biochemicals asner and martin 2008 huang et al 2004 ramoelo et al 2011 and leaf water status ullah et al 2014 plsr is very popular and has been extensively used in remote sensing asner and martin 2008 darvishzadeh et al 2008 li et al 2007 ramoelo et al 2011 the reason behind its extensive use is the fact that plsr has the capability to process multi collinear hyperspectral data by inputting all spectral bands simultaneously and select uncorrelated variables from a matrix of explanatory variables geladi and kowalski 1986 the plsr analysis was implemented through a program written using pls library mevik and wehrens 2007 in r studio the plsr analysis selected 30 optimum wavebands which were highly sensitive to water deficit stress the selected wavebands were then fed into multiple linear regression mlr model 2 7 3 the multiple linear regression mlr multiple linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two or more explanatory variables and a response variable by fitting a linear equation to observed data and every value of the independent variable x is associated with a value of the dependent variable y lattin et al 2003 krishna et al 2014 the multiple linear regression mlr model was used to account for the relationship between rice crops reflectance and rwc data the band used as input were retrieved from plsr selected optimum wavebands this approach of using plsr selected optimum wavebands was applied because previous studies show that mlr has several shortcomings such as leading to negative and extremely large estimates zhu et al 2017 2 7 4 the support vector regression svr support vector regression system is based on support vector machines cortes and vapnik 1995 that is derived from statistical learning theory svm separates the classes with a decision surface that maximizes the margin between the classes the surface is called the optimal hyperplane and the data points closest to the hyperplane are called support vectors among the separating hyperplanes the one for which the distance to the closest point is maximal is called optimal separating hyperplane chapelle et al 1999 the support vectors are the critical elements of the training set the key idea of using svm is map points with a mapping function to a space of sufficiently high dimension so that they will be separable by a hyperplane svr is the implementation of the svm method for regression and function approximation smola and schölkopf 2004 das et al 2017 in this study the svm regression was performed using package e1071 meyer et al 2015 in r language 2 7 5 the artificial neural networks ann the neural networks are based on backpropagation algorithm and structure is inspired by the brain the backpropagation is a fast algorithm and at the heart of backpropagation is an expression for the partial derivative c w of the cost function c with respect to any weight w or bias b in the network nielsen 2015 for predicting nonlinear system problems a nonlinear neural network with additional intermediate or hidden processing layers is very much useful to handle the nonlinearity and complexity problems subasi and erçelebi 2005 a model with very few nodes would be incapable of differentiating between complex patterns while too many nodes may lead to over parameterization the determination of hidden intermediate layers is by trial and error too many hidden layers make the process very much time consuming the neural network regression was performed in r language with neuralnet package fritsch and guenther 2016 using the neuralnet function 2 7 6 the random forest rf the random forest regression technique is an addition to the bagging breiman 1994 of classification trees the classification using bagging is different from the boosting because in bagging successive trees do not depend on earlier trees and each is independently constructed using a bootstrap sample of the data set liaw and wiener 2002 the final result is predicted using a simple majority vote in the process of random forest each node is split using the best among a subset of predictors randomly chosen at that node this process of somewhat immoderate splitting of node provides very good results compared to other regression and classification techniques like support vector regression discriminant analysis and neural networks and is robust against overfitting breiman 2001 this regression technique was implemented using randomforest breiman 2001 package of r language 3 results and discussions 3 1 changes in spectral reflectance pattern due to water deficit stress normally the plants of a particular crop show a similar pattern of reflectance spectra but water deficit stress conditions bring noticeable changes in reflectance spectra the study shows the reflectance patterns of plants with different water deficit stress conditions i e decline in relative water content the water content varies from 96 5 to 0 7 the reflectance of the fresh plant was less whereas the reflectance of the dry plant was high the reflectance in swir region increases as the rwc decreases from the highest to lowest the reason behind the increase in reflectance is weakening of the water absorption features at 1400 nm and 1900 nm a similar pattern of increasing reflectance with a decrease in water content was observed at 350 to 700 nm wavelength region the spectrum in the blue and red region chlorophyll a b absorption ranges was showing a trend of higher reflectance with decreasing water content due to loss of chlorophyll a shift of 1400 1925 nm wavelength range towards shorter wavelengths was observed with the drying of leaves and increase in spectral reflectance is also visible with the decrease in relative water content the absorption features in 1400 to 1500 nm and 1850 to 1900 nm were seen as becoming shallow the reason behind the decrease in absorption is weakening of water absorption features due to the decrease in water content the scattering in spongy mesophyll at 810 to 1350 nm was also reflected a similar trend of increasing reflectance with the decrease in water content in addition absorption at the middle infrared 1100 2500 nm is also a zone of strong absorption primarily by water in a fresh leaf and secondarily by dry matter e g protein lignin and cellulose when the leaf wilts jacquemoud and ustin 2001 become more visible with decrease in rwc 3 2 change in relative water content rwc the genotypes showed a significant variation over time in rwc the calibration data shows variation of rwc between 95 4 to 1 0 whereas validation subset data shows 97 0 2 0 the standard deviation for calibration subset was 27 5 whereas 29 8 the mtu 1010 fig 2 genotype showed the highest variation and petchaperumal showed the least variation in rwc the boxplots show the distribution of measured rwc where median values are depicted by horizontal dark lines fig 3 the length of boxes indicates spread of water content and corresponds to interquartile range q3 75 q1 25 the lines attached to the dotted line and situated above below boxes represent the upper and lower limit of rwc for a particular genotype fig 2 the points indicate the mean values the relationship between conventional water band indices with rwc was evaluated table 2 the mdwi exhibits the strongest correlation with r2 as 0 92 for both calibration and validation sets fig 4 the moisture stress index msi and normalized difference infra red index ndii also showed a strong correlation the mdwi is computed using the maximum reflectance value from max1500 1750 nm and minimum reflectance value from min1500 1750 nm located at the atmospheric window between 1500 and 1750 nm both msi and ndii performed the correlation with r2 as 0 89 and 0 92 for correlation and validation respectively the lowest correlation was observed for simple ratio index with r2 as 0 73 calibration and 0 80 validation the mdwi performed well because it allows the best combination of numerator and denominator from 1500 and 1750 nm wavelength range this dynamism of choosing better absorption feature under varying plant water deficit stress conditions provides better results eitel et al 2006 peñuelas et al 1997 3 3 contour mapping approach for exploring new useful water band spectral indices the contour mapping approach has the advantage of providing an efficient selection of the optimal combination of wavebands for development of the effective spectral indices the contour maps of r2 values from linear regression between rwc and all possible combinations of rsi ratio spectral index ratio approach and ndsi normalized difference spectral index normalized difference approach reveal hotspot positions that have high correlation values fig 5 the contour mapping was performed at 1 nm interval and all of the hotspots were analyzed consequently one highest r2 value each for rsi and ndsi was extracted from the hotspots which were found at 1233 and 1305 nm combination therefore on the basis of highest r2 the best combinations selected were ratio index r1233 r1305 and normalized difference ratio index r1233 r1305 for rwc the linear polynomial exponential and logarithmic regression functions were evaluated for establishing regression equation between rwc ratio index and rwc normalized difference ratio index table 3 the 2nd order polynomial equation was found to be the best in predicting rwc with both ratio index and normalized difference ratio index r2 cal 0 94 rmsep 4 27 r2 cal 0 94 rmsep 4 28 respectively figs 6 and 7 3 4 validation of the rsi and ndsi models the validation results of regression models from ratio index and normalized difference ratio index to predicted rwc exhibit the r2 as 0 93 for both indices the rmsep was 4 27 and 4 28 for ratio index and normalized difference ratio index respectively the newly proposed indices yield better results compared to previous conventional indices the rmsep was found low compared to rmsep of other indices thus the newly proposed indices can be reliably used for accurate estimation of changes in rwc caused by water deficit stress in plants the rpd values of both the proposed indices were found significantly reliable compared to existing indices 3 5 multivariate models 3 5 1 the plsr the plsr model provides reasonable explanations for independent variables using fewer latent variables compared to principal component regression pls regression was computed considering independent x variables as spectral reflectance observations and relative water content as dependent y variable increasing the number of latent variables lv in the pls regression model tended to decrease the rmse however the inclusion of too many latent variables led to over fitting ecarnot et al 2013 therefore the model with 3 components was considered as optimum the number of components was determined using percent variation explained by components and cross validated rmsecv the component one explained 94 4 variation second component explained 2 7 whereas component 3 explained 0 2 variation the optimum wavebands were selected from the peaks and troughs of loading weight values latent variables in the spectral region 350 2500 nm these optimum wavebands were 357 415 511 549 691 713 766 770 815 960 1053 1057 1154 1155 1244 1255 1402 1404 1690 1705 1870 1885 1930 1996 2042 2219 2222 2261 2267 and 2411 nm fig 8 the model was both cross validated and validated with separate set of test data the cross validation was performed with loo leave one out method in the calibration model the r2 was 0 96 with rmse as 5 63 and rpd as 4 89 and in the validation the r2 was 0 96 with rmse as 5 37 and rpd as 5 55 fig 9 3 5 2 the mlr the plsr is an extension of mlr technique with improved and robust regression approach but in plsr equation every coefficient has a rmse associated with it which makes it more susceptible to the deviation therefore the optimum wavebands extracted from plsr were used as independent x variables in a stepwise mlr model the mlr model equation is given below y 80 47 351 r357 241 r511 1395 r770 1791 r815 2225 r1154 1447 r1255 14 612 r1402 13 988 r1404 3069 r1690 2475 r1705 367 r1930 472 r1996 12 005 r2261 11 584 r2267 this model was evaluated as the best one among all the techniques evaluated in this study the developed mlr model demonstrated the highest r2 values lower rmsep values and the highest rpd values for both calibration and prediction data sets r2 0 98 rmsec 3 19 and rpd 8 62 for calibration and in validation r2 0 97 rmsep 5 06 and rpd 5 89 fig 10 a b this combination of two multivariate techniques proved the best one because the mlr model used the plsr selected optimum reflectance wavebands rather than the whole 2151 spectral reflectance wavebands use of optimum wavebands as independent variables removed data redundancy and minimized the susceptibility to the deviation therefore provided the best results the wavelengths used by mlr model equation are the most prominent wavelengths for prediction of relative water content in plants the shorter wavelengths of visible region 356 and 511 nm are related to chlorophyll and other pigment contents of the plant which exhibits changes during the water deficit stress condition the 510 to 530 nm shows absorption for zeaxanthin pigment which modulates chlorophyll for photosynthesis dall osto et al 2012 and shows changes during water deficit stress condition the 770 nm is related to red edge position the red edge position starts from 710 nm in healthy plants and gets shifted towards 800 nm if water stress is prevalent in the plant the 1154 and 1255 nm are related with cell structure of leaf and canopy which show higher reflectance if the plant is facing water deficit stress the wavelengths 1402 1404 1930 and 1996 nm are related to water absorption in the spectrum and are therefore directly related to water deficit stress the selected wavebands in the swir region near 1400 nm and 1600 nm are related to the absorption features associated with moisture cellulose and starch in plant leaves curran 1989 thenkabail et al 2004 ullah et al 2014 the 2261 and 2267 nm are sensitive to leaf biochemicals protein cellulose lignin etc which tend to be in higher proportion in the condition of water deficit stress thulin et al 2014 kokaly 1999 elvidge 1990 3 5 3 the ann the ann model was developed with all spectral reflectance bands the developed model didn t produce satisfactory results therefore the model was developed with plsr selected optimum wavebands as independent x variables the ann model with all spectral reflectance bands was developed with 1 hidden layer use of two or more hidden layers produced a large mean square error mse compared to one hidden layer in calibration r2 was 0 97 rmsec was 5 62 and rpd was also 5 62 whereas in validation r2 was 0 85 rmsep was 13 06 and rpd was 2 28 fig 12e f the ann model predicted the rwc values poorly compared to other techniques because the model has a rmse value associated with every coefficient which makes it more susceptible to the deviation another reason is that the accuracy of ann technique is affected by the outliers in the data set compared to least squares based regression methods clrovic 1997 the ann model developed with plsr selected optimum wavebands as x variables produced better results compared to above ann model the architecture of this ann model is given in fig 11 for this model two hidden layers were considered as sufficient on the basis of mse this ann model displayed the r2 as 0 98 rmsec as 3 19 and rpd as 8 61 for calibration data set whereas in validation the r2 was 0 96 rmsep was 5 67 and rpd was also 5 25 fig 10c d this model was found to be the second best multivariate model as evident from model accuracy statistics use of plsr selected optimum wavebands as x variables enabled to use two hidden layers consequently the prediction ability of the model was improved apart from the use of two hidden layers in this ann model the data redundancy and outliers were already removed by plsr technique therefore the model was able to perform better 3 5 4 the svr the svr technique was also evaluated to develop a rwc prediction model the model performed well with all independent variables the model displayed a strong combination of higher r2 and low rmsec with excellent level of rpd r2 0 98 rmsec 3 53 rpd 7 79 for calibration in validation r2 0 97 rmsep 5 75 and rpd 5 18 fig 12a b 3 5 5 the rf the ensemble regression technique random forest provided intermediate results with r2 0 97 rmsec 5 05 and rpd 5 67 for validation data set the r2 was 0 96 rmsep 5 26 and rpd was 5 45 fig 12c d the plsr followed by mlr was proved as the best technique for rwc prediction model development out of all multivariate techniques evaluated through this study the model equation developed through plsr mlr techniques is also useful in monitoring water content in plants all the wavelengths included in the model equation are highly relevant with respect to water stress prediction the second best model developed was the combination of plsr and ann the support vector regression was also proved to be a useful technique with satisfactory results the svr determines maximum margin hyperplane therefore it reduces the prediction error the ann is vulnerable to outliers therefore when applied on the whole dataset its prediction was very poor the random forest is an ensemble tree classifier and has the goodness of decision tree system the rf proved as an intermediate classifier compared to others it was proved slightly better over plsr in this study in the plsr equation every coefficient has a rmse error associated with it which makes it more susceptible to deviation krishna et al 2014 therefore plsr model developed through all of the x variables produced intermediate results compared to plsr mlr combination the order of performance of the multivariate models with respect to r2 and rmsep is as follows plsr mlr plsr ann svr rf plsr ann fig 13 this order of performance is also supported by the value of rpd for all models this study evaluated multivariate techniques and indices based approach including contour plotting the comparison of results clearly reflects that use of multivariate techniques enhances the prediction capability of models significantly the multivariate techniques have many positive approaches compared to conventional indices based approach like self identification and removal of outliers use of principal components ability to deal with multi collinearity use of decision tree approach etc multivariate techniques all utilize all the water absorption related bands which increase model s accuracy considerably by unveiling improved sensitivity to changes in the rwc whereas index based approaches use only two or three prominent water absorption bands several researches in the past have used multivariate techniques for determination of various plant biochemical contents i e chlorophyll schlerf et al 2010 daughtry et al 2000 atzberger et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 carotenoids zhao et al 2016 and nitrogen ecarnot et al 2013 schlerf et al 2010 atzberger et al 2010 ryu et al 2011 as well as rwc ullah et al 2014 and leaf ewt colombo et al 2008 ullah et al 2014 utilized various parts of the spectrum using plsr to predict rwc the leaf nitrogen content and leaf mass per unit area of wheat were also assessed using pls regression technique ecarnot et al 2013 zhang and zhou 2015 estimated the canopy water content using indices based approach and successfully developed a model for estimation of canopy water content and leaf equivalent water thickness for maize crop colombo et al 2008 evaluated the performance of different hyperspectral indices for estimation of leaf equivalent water thickness and leaf water content using the plsr model the plsr also displayed considerably good results in this study this study has successfully applied the mlr and ann models on plsr selected optimum wavebands which increased the accuracy of model significantly use of plsr selected optimum wavebands as input removed the multi collinearity problem in mlr and provided outliers free x variables to ann consequently improving the efficiency of the plsr model 4 conclusion this study successfully evaluates the indices based multivariate techniques based and neural networks based approaches to predict relative water content rwc under water deficit stress condition of rice genotypes with significant accuracy existing water band indices were evaluated and new water band indices sensitive to water stress were proposed the mdwi was found to be the best index among all conventional existing indices the newly proposed indices outperformed all other indices the multivariate model developed through plsr and mlr techniques plsr mlr model proved to be the best yielded high r2 and low rmsep followed by the model developed through plsr and ann techniques plsr ann model for estimation of rwc in rice crop thus from this study it may be concluded that timely detection of water deficit stress is quite important for precision agriculture the model and indices developed through this study can be effectively used to detect water deficit induced stress measurement of the relative water content rwc at different stages of crop using hyperspectral reflectance may provide timely detection of the water deficit stress use of hyperspectral images may provide large area coverage and will be more suitable compared to ground based spectroradiometer data unavailability of hyperspectral images over the study area poses a limitation to assess water deficit stress at regional scale use of airborne satellite borne hyperspectral data in future studies may considerably enhance the utility of such research studies the methodology developed for prediction of rwc would help to identify water deficit stress more accurately using crop reflectance spectra and may prove useful in developing drought resistant varieties funding icar national agricultural science fund grant code nasf phen 6005 2016 17 conflicts of

11174,this study was conducted to understand the behaviour of ten rice genotypes for different water deficit stress levels the spectroscopic hyperspectral reflectance data in the range of 350 2500 nm was recorded and relative water content rwc of plants was measured at different stress levels the optimal wavebands were identified through spectral indices multivariate techniques and neural network technique and prediction models were developed the new water sensitive spectral indices were developed and existing water band spectral indices were also evaluated with respect to rwc these indices based models were efficient in predicting rwc with r2 values ranging from 0 73 to 0 94 the contour plotting using the ratio spectral indices rsi and normalized difference spectral indices ndsi was done in all possible combinations within 350 2500 nm and their correlations with rwc were quantified to identify the best index spectral reflectance data was also used to develop partial least squares regression plsr followed by multiple linear regression mlr and artificial neural networks ann support vector machine regression svr and random forest rf models to calculate plant rwc among these multivariate models plsr mlr was found to be the best model for prediction of rwc with r2 as 0 98 and 0 97 for calibration and validation respectively and root mean square error of prediction rmsep as 5 06 the results indicate that plsr is a robust technique for identification of water deficit stress in the crop although the plsr is robust technique if plsr extracted optimum wavebands are fed into mlr the results are found to be improved significantly the ann model was developed with all spectral reflectance bands the 43 developed model didn t produce satisfactory results therefore the model was developed 44 with plsr selected optimum wavebands as independent x variables and plsr ann model 45 was found better than the ann model alone the study successfully conducts a comparative 46 analysis among various modelling approaches to quantify water deficit stress the methodology developed would help to identify water deficit stress more accurately by predicting rwc in the crops

element for the successful deployment of remote sensing in crop condition monitoring accurate estimation of biophysical parameters from remote sensing can assist in the determination of vegetation physiological status carter 1994 estimation of one of the most important biochemical constituent crop water content through remote sensing has important significances in agriculture and forestry zarco tejada et al 2003 gao and goetz 1995 determination of plant water status plays a significant role in assessing drought stress predicting susceptibility to wildfire ustin et al 1998 pyne et al 1996 and monitoring the general physiological status of crops datt 1999 cheng et al 2011 the determination of water content in plants is very crucial for drought assessment because the insufficient amount of water in crop hampers the production of the food grains negatively the remote sensing is very widely used for accurate retrieval of leaf water content hunt and rock 1989 peñuelas et al 1997 the leaf water content is commonly expressed as equivalent water thickness ewt gravimetric water content gwc and relative water content rwc datt 1999 cheng et al 2010 the ewt is mass per unit leaf area g cm2 whereas the gwc expresses leaf water content as the gravimetric proportions of water relative to other plant material the rwc can be expressed as the ratio of the difference between fresh weight and dry weight to that of the difference of turgid weight and dry weight the rwc serves as a key leaf parameter to determine leaf water content ullah et al 2014 das et al 2017 although the remote sensing technique is widely used for timely detection of variations in the spectral response of plants to changing levels of plant water status over large areas peñuelas et al 1997 ustin et al 1998 pu et al 2003 stimson et al 2005 eitel et al 2006 the multispectral satellite remote sensors exhibit serious limitations to accurately detect changes in plant water status due to coarse spectral resolution and larger revisit time therefore the need of high spectral and spatial resolution remote sensing instruments and sensors was experienced this contributed for the advent of highly precise spectroradiometers for detection of spectral changes the field spectroradiometers and hyperspectral sensors has the capability to detect the electromagnetic spectrum in very narrow contiguous bands which allows the development of spectral indices using minor fluctuations of wavelengths due to change in water status horler et al 1983 gao 1996 peñuelas et al 1993 eitel et al 2006 several previous studies have demonstrated the utilization of spectral reflectance in 350 2500 nm range to assess water content in plants through spectral indices regression analysis and radiative transfer modeling féret et al 2011 zarco tejada et al 2003 in the earlier studies the primary and secondary effects of water content on the spectral response of leaf were evaluated by carter 1994 and it was concluded that 1450 nm 1940 nm and 2500 nm are the most optimal wavebands showing sensitivity to water content the wavelength 400 nm and 700 nm red edge position were also found to be sensitive to plant water content filella and peñuelas 1994 roberts et al 1997 reported the ndvi as a water content sensitive index several studies demonstrated a good relationship between spectral indices developed through nir region 700 1300 nm and plant water content peñuelas et al 1997 serrano et al 2000 ceccato et al 2002 asner et al 2003 imanishi et al 2004 stimson et al 2005 few studies have also indicated that nir region is the less sensitive region of the spectrum compared to swir 1300 2500 nm to establish a relationship between indices and water content danson et al 1992 ceccato et al 2002 eitel et al 2006 most of the indices are two band simple ratio indices utilizing two spectral wavebands mostly one of the wavelengths is found within strong absorption region of water and another is found outside the absorption region of water sims and gamon 2003 eitel et al 2006 to extract larger information on crop water status investigation of entire spectrum is essential use of multivariate regression techniques machine learning methods and artificial neural network approach can utilize the entire spectrum for detection of crop water stress however the high dimensionality and contiguity of hyperspectral data is a problem vaiphasa et al 2005 when utilizing entire spectrum 350 2500 nm range the reason is that the regression techniques like multiple linear regression mlr may suffer from multi collinearity and are often prone to over fitting as numbers of observations could be equal or lesser than the predictors curran 1989 contrary to mlr the partial least square regression technique plsr is a robust technique for development of prediction models the plsr is a combination of principal component analysis pca mlr techniques the concept behind pls is to find a few eigenvectors of spectral matrices that will produce score values that both summarize the variance of spectral reflectance well and are highly correlated with response variables li et al 2007 several researches indicate that plsr can effectively decrease complexity and the multi collinearity of spectral responses by performing simple projection operations in a vector space araújo et al 2001 galvão et al 2001 2008 mahmood et al 2012 consequently reducing the over fitting the plsr combines the most useful information from hundreds of contiguous spectral bands into several principal components to develop a calibration model several studies have highlighted that plsr is a robust prediction model development technique and researchers have used plsr successfully to establish a relationship between spectral reflectance and leaf biochemical and biophysical properties under varying canopy structures asner and martin 2008 the pls regression has been successfully used with spectral data to predict chlorophyll content zhao et al 2016 ji et al 2012 estimation of carotenoid content zhao et al 2015 estimation of relative water content ullah et al 2014 estimation of protein lignin and cellulose thulin et al 2014 estimation of leaf nitrogen content ecarnot et al 2013 estimation of leaf area index and chlorophyll content darvishzadeh et al 2008 estimation of soil organic carbon peng et al 2014 prediction of soil properties mahmood et al 2012 and retrieval of leaf fuel moisture content li et al 2007 though plsr is the most robust technique for prediction model development few researchers have reported that there is a possibility of over fitting that would lead to inaccurate results when testing the developed model on a very different dataset to the calibration one féret et al 2011 therefore optimum wavebands extracted from plsr were fed into mlr and ann techniques separately to check whether the outcome of the combined models is better or not neural networks technique has also been evaluated for development of water content prediction models dawson et al 1998 developed the ann model for prediction of leaf water content and reported a satisfactory coefficient of determination as 0 86 with low rmse 1 3 there are several researches which evaluate multivariate techniques for estimation of crop biochemical and biophysical parameters using spectral reflectance data but very few studies have demonstrated the comparison among efficiency and accuracy of various multivariate models to estimate water content of crop from hyperspectral observations this study bridges this gap by comparing models developed from plsr mlr rf and svr multivariate techniques and ann too the present investigation was done with the following objectives i evaluation of existing water bands indices as well as development of new efficacious water band indices ii identification of the most optimum wavebands sensitive to predict rwc in crops iii development of various rwc prediction models using multivariate techniques and neural networks and their comparison with each other iv evaluation of plsr mlr model to test its efficacy over model developed through only pls

plots were in randomized block design and were well irrigated leaves were quickly placed in plastic bags in an airtight container and immediately transferred to the laboratory for spectroscopic measurements at predetermined time intervals in the laboratory the spectroscopic data of above mentioned 10 genotypes were collected using an asd field spec 3 spectroradiometer this instrument collects data into 350 to 2500 nm wavelength at resampled wavelength interval of 1 nm approximately 3 g of fresh leaves for each genotype were put into capped glass tubes filled with distilled water and kept at room temperature to attain full turgidity 2 3 collection of spectroscopic data from leaves the spectral measurements of fresh leaves were recorded in the lab immediately after first spectral reading leaves were allowed to dry at room temperature and spectral measurements were again recorded after 2 3 4 5 6 8 and 10 h from the time of first spectral observation collection for all 10 genotypes 8 spectral observations were recorded for each genotype four spectral observations were recorded for above mentioned hours therefore total 320 spectral observations 10 genotypes x4 replication in observations x8 different hours were recorded the spectral observations were recorded in a dark room having 25 c by using an asd contact probe analytical spectral devices boulder co this contact probe touches the surface of the leaf and has its own constant light source inside it for illumination a black surface has been given which comes underside of the leaf while collecting spectra to minimise the electromagnetic radiation transmitted through the leaf this contact probe is calibrated using a spectralon this contact probe is an accessory of asd field spec 3 spectroradiometer which records spectral reflectance in the 350 to 2500 nm range at sampling intervals of 1 4 nm in the 350 1050 nm range and of 2 nm in the 1000 2500 nm and it provides data after resampling at the 1 nm interval the spectral observations were taken from leaf sample consisted of an overlapping pile of 3 4 leaves to eliminate the background effect 2 4 relative water content rwc computation the water content in the leaves was analyzed using rwc computation for rwc computation the fresh weight fw turgid weight tw and dry weight dw were determined for all genotypes turgid weight was determined after placing the leaves in deionised water for 2 h to obtain dry weight leaves were oven dried at 70 c temperature for 3 days until constant weight was obtained the rwc was calculated using following equation r w c f w d w t w d w 100 2 5 spectral indices computation the plant water status spectral indices utilize simple ratios between the reflectance of a wavelength located within an range of the electromagnetic spectrum strongly absorption by water described as water absorption bands and another wavelength located outside the water absorption band typically used as a control sims and gamon 2003 eitel et al 2006 in this study indices related to plant water status only were evaluated spectral indices evaluated are given in table 1 2 6 correlation analysis between narrow band indices and rwc through contour plotting two narrow band indices were computed and the correlation between computed indices with rwc was determined the coefficient of determination r2 was plotted with wavelengths by a predefined matrix scheme this plotting the contour plotting lambda versus lambda plotting approach exhibits a specific pattern where highest r2 can be seen as hot spots many studies have reported this plotting as the best approach for identification of wavelength having maximum r2 sahoo et al 2015 the highest r2 value was extracted from the hot spot area the optimal indices were selected by choosing the wavelength combination that portrayed the highest r2 value in the contour plot for the implementation of contour plotting a program was written in matlab 2 7 multivariate analysis to perform multivariate analysis the data was split into the training set and the test set for calibration and validation respectively the training set of data was 2 3 sample and test data was 1 3 sample of the whole dataset the overall performance and robustness of the models were appraised by the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error of cross validation rmsecv root mean square error of prediction rmsep and ratio of prediction deviation rpd and upper lower confidence intervals of regression at 95 confidence level the rpd is computed as the ratio between standard deviation and rmse excellent calibrations were those with r2 0 95 rpd 4 nduwamungu et al 2009b the ratio of prediction deviation rpd is considered as a parameter of strength for the prediction model a model having rpd value 0 2 3 is considered as very poor 2 4 3 0 is considered as poor 3 1 4 9 is considered as fair and prediction are considered as reliable 5 0 6 4 is considered as good 6 5 8 0 is considered as very good with very reliable predictions and model with rpd above 8 1 is considered as excellent for prediction williams and sobering 1993 the detailed schematic diagram of methodology is given in fig 1 2 7 1 multivariate techniques evaluated support vector regression svr artificial neural networks ann random forest rf and the partial least square regression plsr plsr followed by multiple linear regression mlr and plsr followed by ann were evaluated to determine the best suitable multivariate model for regression between spectral reflectance and rwc 2 7 2 the partial least square regression plsr the plsr multivariate analysis was performed on spectral reflectance data and rwc other multivariate regression models based on hyperspectral data shows a high degree of collinearity especially when the numbers of predictors are equal or higher in number than sample observations and the input data lead to a high r2 curran 1989 the plsr has proved as the robust technique which can handle high dimensionality of hyperspectral data many researchers have successfully used plsr for estimation of various leaf biochemicals asner and martin 2008 huang et al 2004 ramoelo et al 2011 and leaf water status ullah et al 2014 plsr is very popular and has been extensively used in remote sensing asner and martin 2008 darvishzadeh et al 2008 li et al 2007 ramoelo et al 2011 the reason behind its extensive use is the fact that plsr has the capability to process multi collinear hyperspectral data by inputting all spectral bands simultaneously and select uncorrelated variables from a matrix of explanatory variables geladi and kowalski 1986 the plsr analysis was implemented through a program written using pls library mevik and wehrens 2007 in r studio the plsr analysis selected 30 optimum wavebands which were highly sensitive to water deficit stress the selected wavebands were then fed into multiple linear regression mlr model 2 7 3 the multiple linear regression mlr multiple linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two or more explanatory variables and a response variable by fitting a linear equation to observed data and every value of the independent variable x is associated with a value of the dependent variable y lattin et al 2003 krishna et al 2014 the multiple linear regression mlr model was used to account for the relationship between rice crops reflectance and rwc data the band used as input were retrieved from plsr selected optimum wavebands this approach of using plsr selected optimum wavebands was applied because previous studies show that mlr has several shortcomings such as leading to negative and extremely large estimates zhu et al 2017 2 7 4 the support vector regression svr support vector regression system is based on support vector machines cortes and vapnik 1995 that is derived from statistical learning theory svm separates the classes with a decision surface that maximizes the margin between the classes the surface is called the optimal hyperplane and the data points closest to the hyperplane are called support vectors among the separating hyperplanes the one for which the distance to the closest point is maximal is called optimal separating hyperplane chapelle et al 1999 the support vectors are the critical elements of the training set the key idea of using svm is map points with a mapping function to a space of sufficiently high dimension so that they will be separable by a hyperplane svr is the implementation of the svm method for regression and function approximation smola and schölkopf 2004 das et al 2017 in this study the svm regression was performed using package e1071 meyer et al 2015 in r language 2 7 5 the artificial neural networks ann the neural networks are based on backpropagation algorithm and structure is inspired by the brain the backpropagation is a fast algorithm and at the heart of backpropagation is an expression for the partial derivative c w of the cost function c with respect to any weight w or bias b in the network nielsen 2015 for predicting nonlinear system problems a nonlinear neural network with additional intermediate or hidden processing layers is very much useful to handle the nonlinearity and complexity problems subasi and erçelebi 2005 a model with very few nodes would be incapable of differentiating between complex patterns while too many nodes may lead to over parameterization the determination of hidden intermediate layers is by trial and error too many hidden layers make the process very much time consuming the neural network regression was performed in r language with neuralnet package fritsch and guenther 2016 using the neuralnet function 2 7 6 the random forest rf the random forest regression technique is an addition to the bagging breiman 1994 of classification trees the classification using bagging is different from the boosting because in bagging successive trees do not depend on earlier trees and each is independently constructed using a bootstrap sample of the data set liaw and wiener 2002 the final result is predicted using a simple majority vote in the process of random forest each node is split using the best among a subset of predictors randomly chosen at that node this process of somewhat immoderate splitting of node provides very good results compared to other regression and classification techniques like support vector regression discriminant analysis and neural networks and is robust against overfitting breiman 2001 this regression technique was implemented using randomforest breiman 2001 package of r language 3 results and discussions 3 1 changes in spectral reflectance pattern due to water deficit stress normally the plants of a particular crop show a similar pattern of reflectance spectra but water deficit stress conditions bring noticeable changes in reflectance spectra the study shows the reflectance patterns of plants with different water deficit stress conditions i e decline in relative water content the water content varies from 96 5 to 0 7 the reflectance of the fresh plant was less whereas the reflectance of the dry plant was high the reflectance in swir region increases as the rwc decreases from the highest to lowest the reason behind the increase in reflectance is weakening of the water absorption features at 1400 nm and 1900 nm a similar pattern of increasing reflectance with a decrease in water content was observed at 350 to 700 nm wavelength region the spectrum in the blue and red region chlorophyll a b absorption ranges was showing a trend of higher reflectance with decreasing water content due to loss of chlorophyll a shift of 1400 1925 nm wavelength range towards shorter wavelengths was observed with the drying of leaves and increase in spectral reflectance is also visible with the decrease in relative water content the absorption features in 1400 to 1500 nm and 1850 to 1900 nm were seen as becoming shallow the reason behind the decrease in absorption is weakening of water absorption features due to the decrease in water content the scattering in spongy mesophyll at 810 to 1350 nm was also reflected a similar trend of increasing reflectance with the decrease in water content in addition absorption at the middle infrared 1100 2500 nm is also a zone of strong absorption primarily by water in a fresh leaf and secondarily by dry matter e g protein lignin and cellulose when the leaf wilts jacquemoud and ustin 2001 become more visible with decrease in rwc 3 2 change in relative water content rwc the genotypes showed a significant variation over time in rwc the calibration data shows variation of rwc between 95 4 to 1 0 whereas validation subset data shows 97 0 2 0 the standard deviation for calibration subset was 27 5 whereas 29 8 the mtu 1010 fig 2 genotype showed the highest variation and petchaperumal showed the least variation in rwc the boxplots show the distribution of measured rwc where median values are depicted by horizontal dark lines fig 3 the length of boxes indicates spread of water content and corresponds to interquartile range q3 75 q1 25 the lines attached to the dotted line and situated above below boxes represent the upper and lower limit of rwc for a particular genotype fig 2 the points indicate the mean values the relationship between conventional water band indices with rwc was evaluated table 2 the mdwi exhibits the strongest correlation with r2 as 0 92 for both calibration and validation sets fig 4 the moisture stress index msi and normalized difference infra red index ndii also showed a strong correlation the mdwi is computed using the maximum reflectance value from max1500 1750 nm and minimum reflectance value from min1500 1750 nm located at the atmospheric window between 1500 and 1750 nm both msi and ndii performed the correlation with r2 as 0 89 and 0 92 for correlation and validation respectively the lowest correlation was observed for simple ratio index with r2 as 0 73 calibration and 0 80 validation the mdwi performed well because it allows the best combination of numerator and denominator from 1500 and 1750 nm wavelength range this dynamism of choosing better absorption feature under varying plant water deficit stress conditions provides better results eitel et al 2006 peñuelas et al 1997 3 3 contour mapping approach for exploring new useful water band spectral indices the contour mapping approach has the advantage of providing an efficient selection of the optimal combination of wavebands for development of the effective spectral indices the contour maps of r2 values from linear regression between rwc and all possible combinations of rsi ratio spectral index ratio approach and ndsi normalized difference spectral index normalized difference approach reveal hotspot positions that have high correlation values fig 5 the contour mapping was performed at 1 nm interval and all of the hotspots were analyzed consequently one highest r2 value each for rsi and ndsi was extracted from the hotspots which were found at 1233 and 1305 nm combination therefore on the basis of highest r2 the best combinations selected were ratio index r1233 r1305 and normalized difference ratio index r1233 r1305 for rwc the linear polynomial exponential and logarithmic regression functions were evaluated for establishing regression equation between rwc ratio index and rwc normalized difference ratio index table 3 the 2nd order polynomial equation was found to be the best in predicting rwc with both ratio index and normalized difference ratio index r2 cal 0 94 rmsep 4 27 r2 cal 0 94 rmsep 4 28 respectively figs 6 and 7 3 4 validation of the rsi and ndsi models the validation results of regression models from ratio index and normalized difference ratio index to predicted rwc exhibit the r2 as 0 93 for both indices the rmsep was 4 27 and 4 28 for ratio index and normalized difference ratio index respectively the newly proposed indices yield better results compared to previous conventional indices the rmsep was found low compared to rmsep of other indices thus the newly proposed indices can be reliably used for accurate estimation of changes in rwc caused by water deficit stress in plants the rpd values of both the proposed indices were found significantly reliable compared to existing indices 3 5 multivariate models 3 5 1 the plsr the plsr model provides reasonable explanations for independent variables using fewer latent variables compared to principal component regression pls regression was computed considering independent x variables as spectral reflectance observations and relative water content as dependent y variable increasing the number of latent variables lv in the pls regression model tended to decrease the rmse however the inclusion of too many latent variables led to over fitting ecarnot et al 2013 therefore the model with 3 components was considered as optimum the number of components was determined using percent variation explained by components and cross validated rmsecv the component one explained 94 4 variation second component explained 2 7 whereas component 3 explained 0 2 variation the optimum wavebands were selected from the peaks and troughs of loading weight values latent variables in the spectral region 350 2500 nm these optimum wavebands were 357 415 511 549 691 713 766 770 815 960 1053 1057 1154 1155 1244 1255 1402 1404 1690 1705 1870 1885 1930 1996 2042 2219 2222 2261 2267 and 2411 nm fig 8 the model was both cross validated and validated with separate set of test data the cross validation was performed with loo leave one out method in the calibration model the r2 was 0 96 with rmse as 5 63 and rpd as 4 89 and in the validation the r2 was 0 96 with rmse as 5 37 and rpd as 5 55 fig 9 3 5 2 the mlr the plsr is an extension of mlr technique with improved and robust regression approach but in plsr equation every coefficient has a rmse associated with it which makes it more susceptible to the deviation therefore the optimum wavebands extracted from plsr were used as independent x variables in a stepwise mlr model the mlr model equation is given below y 80 47 351 r357 241 r511 1395 r770 1791 r815 2225 r1154 1447 r1255 14 612 r1402 13 988 r1404 3069 r1690 2475 r1705 367 r1930 472 r1996 12 005 r2261 11 584 r2267 this model was evaluated as the best one among all the techniques evaluated in this study the developed mlr model demonstrated the highest r2 values lower rmsep values and the highest rpd values for both calibration and prediction data sets r2 0 98 rmsec 3 19 and rpd 8 62 for calibration and in validation r2 0 97 rmsep 5 06 and rpd 5 89 fig 10 a b this combination of two multivariate techniques proved the best one because the mlr model used the plsr selected optimum reflectance wavebands rather than the whole 2151 spectral reflectance wavebands use of optimum wavebands as independent variables removed data redundancy and minimized the susceptibility to the deviation therefore provided the best results the wavelengths used by mlr model equation are the most prominent wavelengths for prediction of relative water content in plants the shorter wavelengths of visible region 356 and 511 nm are related to chlorophyll and other pigment contents of the plant which exhibits changes during the water deficit stress condition the 510 to 530 nm shows absorption for zeaxanthin pigment which modulates chlorophyll for photosynthesis dall osto et al 2012 and shows changes during water deficit stress condition the 770 nm is related to red edge position the red edge position starts from 710 nm in healthy plants and gets shifted towards 800 nm if water stress is prevalent in the plant the 1154 and 1255 nm are related with cell structure of leaf and canopy which show higher reflectance if the plant is facing water deficit stress the wavelengths 1402 1404 1930 and 1996 nm are related to water absorption in the spectrum and are therefore directly related to water deficit stress the selected wavebands in the swir region near 1400 nm and 1600 nm are related to the absorption features associated with moisture cellulose and starch in plant leaves curran 1989 thenkabail et al 2004 ullah et al 2014 the 2261 and 2267 nm are sensitive to leaf biochemicals protein cellulose lignin etc which tend to be in higher proportion in the condition of water deficit stress thulin et al 2014 kokaly 1999 elvidge 1990 3 5 3 the ann the ann model was developed with all spectral reflectance bands the developed model didn t produce satisfactory results therefore the model was developed with plsr selected optimum wavebands as independent x variables the ann model with all spectral reflectance bands was developed with 1 hidden layer use of two or more hidden layers produced a large mean square error mse compared to one hidden layer in calibration r2 was 0 97 rmsec was 5 62 and rpd was also 5 62 whereas in validation r2 was 0 85 rmsep was 13 06 and rpd was 2 28 fig 12e f the ann model predicted the rwc values poorly compared to other techniques because the model has a rmse value associated with every coefficient which makes it more susceptible to the deviation another reason is that the accuracy of ann technique is affected by the outliers in the data set compared to least squares based regression methods clrovic 1997 the ann model developed with plsr selected optimum wavebands as x variables produced better results compared to above ann model the architecture of this ann model is given in fig 11 for this model two hidden layers were considered as sufficient on the basis of mse this ann model displayed the r2 as 0 98 rmsec as 3 19 and rpd as 8 61 for calibration data set whereas in validation the r2 was 0 96 rmsep was 5 67 and rpd was also 5 25 fig 10c d this model was found to be the second best multivariate model as evident from model accuracy statistics use of plsr selected optimum wavebands as x variables enabled to use two hidden layers consequently the prediction ability of the model was improved apart from the use of two hidden layers in this ann model the data redundancy and outliers were already removed by plsr technique therefore the model was able to perform better 3 5 4 the svr the svr technique was also evaluated to develop a rwc prediction model the model performed well with all independent variables the model displayed a strong combination of higher r2 and low rmsec with excellent level of rpd r2 0 98 rmsec 3 53 rpd 7 79 for calibration in validation r2 0 97 rmsep 5 75 and rpd 5 18 fig 12a b 3 5 5 the rf the ensemble regression technique random forest provided intermediate results with r2 0 97 rmsec 5 05 and rpd 5 67 for validation data set the r2 was 0 96 rmsep 5 26 and rpd was 5 45 fig 12c d the plsr followed by mlr was proved as the best technique for rwc prediction model development out of all multivariate techniques evaluated through this study the model equation developed through plsr mlr techniques is also useful in monitoring water content in plants all the wavelengths included in the model equation are highly relevant with respect to water stress prediction the second best model developed was the combination of plsr and ann the support vector regression was also proved to be a useful technique with satisfactory results the svr determines maximum margin hyperplane therefore it reduces the prediction error the ann is vulnerable to outliers therefore when applied on the whole dataset its prediction was very poor the random forest is an ensemble tree classifier and has the goodness of decision tree system the rf proved as an intermediate classifier compared to others it was proved slightly better over plsr in this study in the plsr equation every coefficient has a rmse error associated with it which makes it more susceptible to deviation krishna et al 2014 therefore plsr model developed through all of the x variables produced intermediate results compared to plsr mlr combination the order of performance of the multivariate models with respect to r2 and rmsep is as follows plsr mlr plsr ann svr rf plsr ann fig 13 this order of performance is also supported by the value of rpd for all models this study evaluated multivariate techniques and indices based approach including contour plotting the comparison of results clearly reflects that use of multivariate techniques enhances the prediction capability of models significantly the multivariate techniques have many positive approaches compared to conventional indices based approach like self identification and removal of outliers use of principal components ability to deal with multi collinearity use of decision tree approach etc multivariate techniques all utilize all the water absorption related bands which increase model s accuracy considerably by unveiling improved sensitivity to changes in the rwc whereas index based approaches use only two or three prominent water absorption bands several researches in the past have used multivariate techniques for determination of various plant biochemical contents i e chlorophyll schlerf et al 2010 daughtry et al 2000 atzberger et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 carotenoids zhao et al 2016 and nitrogen ecarnot et al 2013 schlerf et al 2010 atzberger et al 2010 ryu et al 2011 as well as rwc ullah et al 2014 and leaf ewt colombo et al 2008 ullah et al 2014 utilized various parts of the spectrum using plsr to predict rwc the leaf nitrogen content and leaf mass per unit area of wheat were also assessed using pls regression technique ecarnot et al 2013 zhang and zhou 2015 estimated the canopy water content using indices based approach and successfully developed a model for estimation of canopy water content and leaf equivalent water thickness for maize crop colombo et al 2008 evaluated the performance of different hyperspectral indices for estimation of leaf equivalent water thickness and leaf water content using the plsr model the plsr also displayed considerably good results in this study this study has successfully applied the mlr and ann models on plsr selected optimum wavebands which increased the accuracy of model significantly use of plsr selected optimum wavebands as input removed the multi collinearity problem in mlr and provided outliers free x variables to ann consequently improving the efficiency of the plsr model 4 conclusion this study successfully evaluates the indices based multivariate techniques based and neural networks based approaches to predict relative water content rwc under water deficit stress condition of rice genotypes with significant accuracy existing water band indices were evaluated and new water band indices sensitive to water stress were proposed the mdwi was found to be the best index among all conventional existing indices the newly proposed indices outperformed all other indices the multivariate model developed through plsr and mlr techniques plsr mlr model proved to be the best yielded high r2 and low rmsep followed by the model developed through plsr and ann techniques plsr ann model for estimation of rwc in rice crop thus from this study it may be concluded that timely detection of water deficit stress is quite important for precision agriculture the model and indices developed through this study can be effectively used to detect water deficit induced stress measurement of the relative water content rwc at different stages of crop using hyperspectral reflectance may provide timely detection of the water deficit stress use of hyperspectral images may provide large area coverage and will be more suitable compared to ground based spectroradiometer data unavailability of hyperspectral images over the study area poses a limitation to assess water deficit stress at regional scale use of airborne satellite borne hyperspectral data in future studies may considerably enhance the utility of such research studies the methodology developed for prediction of rwc would help to identify water deficit stress more accurately using crop reflectance spectra and may prove useful in developing drought resistant varieties funding icar national agricultural science fund grant code nasf phen 6005 2016 17 conflicts of
