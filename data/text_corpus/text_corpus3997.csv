19985,in nature based treatment systems such as constructed wetlands plant uptake of nutrients can be a significant removal pathway current methods for quantifying plant uptake of nitrogen in constructed wetlands which often involve harvesting biomass and assuming that all nitrogen stored in plants was derived from wastewater are inappropriate in pilot and full scale systems where other sources of nitrogen are available to improve our understanding of nitrogen cycling in constructed wetlands we developed a new method to quantify plant uptake of nitrogen by using stable isotopes and a mixing model to distinguish between nitrogen sources we applied this new method to a pilot scale horizontal levee system i e a subsurface constructed wetland over a two year monitoring period during which 14 of nitrogen in plants was wastewater derived on average and the remaining plant nitrogen was obtained from the soil analysis of nitrogen isotopes indicated substantial spatial variability in the wetland 82 of nitrogen in plants within the first 2 m of the slope came from wastewater while less than 12 of plant nitrogen in the remainder of the wetland originated from wastewater by combining these source contributions with remote sensing derived total biomass measurements we calculated that 150 kg n 95 ci 50 kg n 330 kg n was taken up and retained by plants during the two year monitoring period which corresponded to approximately 8 of nitrogen removed in the wetland nitrogen uptake followed seasonal trends increased as plants matured and varied based on design parameters e g plant types suggesting that design decisions can impact this removal pathway this new method can help inform efforts to understand nitrogen cycling and optimize the design of nature based nutrient control systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords nature based treatment nitrogen removal plant uptake stable isotopes mixing models remote sensing 1 introduction humans have extensively modified the nitrogen cycle galloway et al 2008 which has caused widespread damage to aquatic ecosystems such as eutrophication sutton and bleeker 2013 freeman et al 2019 these impacts have been exacerbated by the loss of coastal wetlands li et al 2018 that historically have reduced the export of nutrients from terrestrial systems megonigal and neubauer 2019 despite past attempts to control anthropogenic nutrient inputs using conventional management methods eutrophication has frequently persisted thornton et al 2013 as an alternative to conventional approaches engineers have begun to consider the use of constructed wetlands to manage nutrient discharges horizontal levees are a new type of subsurface constructed wetland that can protect coastal urban areas against flooding while treating wastewater effluent in managed wetland habitats cecchetti et al 2020a these new types of constructed wetlands can also provide restored habitat and a suite of additional benefits kadlec and wallace 2009 cecchetti et al 2020a their low cost and resource requirements relative to conventional single benefit solutions make constructed wetlands particularly attractive to utility managers kadlec and wallace 2009 harris lovett et al 2019 despite these benefits there remain many uncertainties about the performance of horizontal levees and the exact processes by which they remove nutrients in subsurface wetlands nitrogen is often removed or immobilized by plant uptake as well as a suite of microbial processes including assimilation denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation kadlec and wallace 2009 javanaud et al 2011 wu et al 2017 due to the complex nature of these processes past assessments of plant uptake in nature based systems have varied widely with reported fractions of nitrogen removal attributable to plant uptake spanning three orders of magnitude i e 0 5 90 meers et al 2008 saeed and sun 2012 though these differences may partly be explained by variations in plant maturation plant types and nitrogen loading rates rather than attempting to discriminate among mechanisms researchers often make simplifying assumptions that can lead to large errors when quantifying nitrogen uptake rates in particular researchers often assume that all nitrogen in plants is derived from wastewater in these systems healy and cawley 2002 geng et al 2019 chen et al 2014 du et al 2018 this is a reasonable assumption if other sources of nitrogen e g soil are absent however uptake will be overestimated if wetland plants have access to other nitrogen sources differences between nitrogen removal in planted and unplanted control wetlands have also been used to estimate plant uptake of nitrogen drizo et al 1997 kantawanichkul et al 2009 paranychiankis et al 2016 but this comparison ignores the importance of plant roots in stimulating microbial nitrogen removal in the rhizosphere zhai et al 2013 to overcome these limitations researchers have also quantified plant uptake in bench scale wetland microcosms using 15n tracers zhang et al 2016 messer et al 2017 hu et al 2016 which have also been widely used to characterize microbial nitrogen cycling in natural ecosystems song et al 2013 salk et al 2017 and constructed wetlands erler et al 2008 rambags et al 2019 however in pilot scale to full scale wetlands materials costs associated with 15n tracers alone could be prohibitively expensive natural abundance stable isotope mixing models provide an alternative approach for estimating plant uptake of nitrogen stable isotopes have been widely used at natural abundance levels to study biogeochemical processes dawson et al 2002 fry 2006 and nitrogen cycling in aquatic ecosystems mcclelland and valiela 1998 cole et al 2004 reinhardt et al 2006 bannon and roman 2008 kohzu et al 2008 søvik and mørkved 2007 erler et al 2010 kaushal et al 2011 chen et al 2014 however despite their versatility the application of natural abundance stable isotopes to assess nitrogen uptake in constructed wetlands has been limited fair and heikoop 2006 in nature based systems like the horizontal levee the primary sources of nitrogen are wastewater and soil with isotope fingerprinting measurements of nitrogen isotopes in plants can be used to identify their sources of nitrogen because isotope ratios in plant tissues typically match their source of nitrogen craine et al 2015 furthermore wastewater derived nitrogen is frequently enriched in 15n δ15n 25 35 as a result its isotopic signature i e δ15n or nitrogen isotope ratio is distinguishable from other nitrogen sources such as soils δ15n 0 10 the atmosphere δ15n 15 to 15 or nitrogen derived from fixation δ15n 0 heaton 1986 kendall 1998 the isotopic signatures which are commonly termed end members of these different sources can be used in mixing models to determine the relative contribution of those sources to the nitrogen found in plants in this study we present a new method for quantifying plant uptake of nitrogen in nature based treatment systems using a stable isotope mixing model in a pilot scale horizontal levee we developed this method in a horizontal levee by coupling 1 isotopic analysis of plants wastewater and soils 2 remote sensing derived biomass measurements and 3 water quality data we used this information to assess the contribution of plant uptake to nitrogen removal in this system this approach is a promising tool for understanding nitrogen fate and managing nitrogen species in both nature based treatment systems and in natural ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site nitrogen uptake was studied at a demonstration scale horizontal levee system at the oro loma sanitary district wastewater treatment plant in san lorenzo ca cecchetti et al 2020a the subsurface wetland contained 12 gently sloped 1 30 parallel treatment cells 1 m deep 12 m wide and 46 m long that were hydraulically isolated from each other the cells were used to test four treatments i e swale depression cells wet meadows with fine and coarse topsoil and riparian willow cells that varied in terms of their topography soil type and native plant community type underlaying the 60 cm of topsoil were two 15 cm deep layers of sand and gravel that were amended with organic carbon i e wood chips to promote microbial denitrification influent samples were collected from a pump station that delivered nitrified secondary municipal wastewater effluent into 12 wetland cells approximately 5 cm below the surface at the top of the slope the effluent from each cell flowed into a gravel trench spanning the end of the cell and was collected in perforated pvc pipes at the bottom of the trench from where effluent samples were collected native plants mainly of the families cyperaceae sedges juncaceae rushes and salicaceae willows were planted between september 2015 and february 2016 approximately 15 months before nitrified wastewater effluent was first introduced into the subsurface prior to this time the cells were irrigated with shallow groundwater obtained from a well located approximately 50 m from the wetland additional details regarding the hydraulics design and wetland treatments including the plant species and the number of individuals of each species planted in the wetland are available elsewhere cecchetti et al 2020a 2 2 solid sample collection and processing δ15n and δ34s were measured in foliar and soil samples before and after wastewater effluent was introduced into the horizontal levee to assess isotopic discrimination during uptake prior to wastewater introduction and as inputs for source contribution models after introduction of wastewater fig 1 samples of new growth plant leaves were collected from baltic rushes j balticus syn j arcticus in cells a g i and k and arroyo willows s lasiolepis in cells h j and l every 3 6 months between august 2016 and june 2019 these species were chosen due to their dominance in the plant community i e s lasiolepis in willow cells and j balticus in wet meadow cells the δ15n values for these samples were indistinguishable p 0 71 wilcoxon signed rank test from composite biomass samples as in fig s1 j balticus of the supporting information si samples were collected at various distances along the wetland slope in riparian type cells foliar samples from s lasiolepis were collected at 7 10 locations along three transects that were parallel to water flow in each cell a total of 332 foliar samples of s lasiolepis were collected on 8 sampling dates in all other cells samples of j balticus were collected and pooled into 7 distance resolved samples per cell from transects perpendicular to the direction of flow along the slope a total of 158 pooled foliar samples of j balticus were collected on 5 sampling dates leaves were separated from their petioles at sampling when appropriate and placed in paper envelopes the envelopes were placed inside of plastic bags and stored on ice prior to returning to the lab leaf samples were dried at 65 c for 48 h immediately upon returning to the lab soil samples were collected for isotope analysis from the top 10 cm of the soil in 2016 these samples were collected from 9 randomly selected locations per cell additional soil samples were collected in 2017 and 2018 for comparison soil samples were stored on ice prior to returning to

quality parameters e g ph and concentrations of anions and cations e g no3 as described previously cecchetti et al 2020a to investigate δ15n and δ18o in nitrate spatially porewater samples from throughout the entire wetland and on transects along the flow path within the first 10 m of the wetland were collected as described previously cecchetti et al 2020a briefly 25 100 ml samples were collected from depths between 0 1 and 0 9 m into syringes using steel sediment porewater samplers and were filtered directly through 0 2 μm nylon syringe filters into 60 ml or 120 ml polypropylene nalgene bottles sigma aldrich st louis mo usa samples were stored on ice for transport and frozen within 4 h prior to isotopic analysis samples were processed according to the procedure detailed by granger and sigman 2009 for removing nitrite to limit interferences during nitrate isotope measurements after thawing 10 30 ml subsamples were transferred to acid washed 60 ml hdpe bottles 20 μl per

being adjusted back to a circumneutral ph with 10 μl of a 2m naoh solution per ml sample nitrate concentrations in processed samples were quantified using ion chromatography processed samples were refrozen prior to being shipped on ice to the analytical facility 2 4 analytical methods the stable isotope composition of soil samples and plant tissue samples was determined according to previously

plant nitrogen source contribution models we used mixing models to calculate the fraction of nitrogen in plant biomass derived from soil and wastewater nitrogen respectively of mixing model types available linear and bayesian mixing models each have their own set of strengths and weaknesses see section s1 of the si we developed both linear and bayesian mixing models evaristo et al 2017 to test the utility and flexibility of these two methods for calculating plant uptake of nitrogen soil nitrogen and wastewater derived nitrate were the main sources of nitrogen available to wetland plants contributions of nitrogen from atmospheric deposition 0 1 of total nitrogen inputs and fixation of n2 by wetland plants 0 5 of total nitrogen inputs were considered negligible based on upper bound estimates found in the literature for similar locations schwede and lear 2014 nadp 2019 or natural wetland systems bowden 1987 discrimination between nitrogen isotopes during plant uptake was assumed to be negligible based on similarities between δ15n in baseline soil and plant tissue samples e g samples collected prior to the introduction of wastewater to the subsurface in april 2017 fig 2 which was consistent with past findings craine et al 2015 mixing model assumptions are discussed in section s1 of the si a two source bayesian mixing model was developed using mixsiar r package stock and semmens 2013 with three factors subsurface concentrations of wastewater derived nitrate continuous distance of sampling locations along the slope continuous and wetland cell random soil and wastewater nitrogen were input as model end members a dirichlet distribution was used as the prior distribution in all bayesian mixing models a two source linear mixing model was applied to our data according to eqs 1 and 2 1 δ 15 n p l a n t s δ 15 n s o i l f s o i l δ 15 n w w f w w 2 1 f s o i l f w w where δ 15 n p l a n t s δ 15 n s o i l and δ 15 n w w are the nitrogen isotope signatures of plants soil and wastewater nitrogen the fractional contributions of soil nitrogen and wastewater nitrogen to plants are represented by f s o i l and f w w respectively the linear mixing model ultimately used to calculate plant uptake in this study underwent multiple iterations that are described in section s1 of the si in the final iteration of the mixing model section s1 2 3 we used end member values as described in section s4 of the si for δ 15 n s o i l we used average δ 15 n values for soil derived porewater nitrate section s4 3 and for δ 15 n w w we used spatially resolved changes in the δ 15 n of wastewater derived nitrate in porewater section s4 2 this model was applied to individual plant samples allowing us to calculate means medians and confidence intervals for f s o i l and f w w by cell cell type and distance along the slope phillips and gregg 2001 2 6 biomass measurements above ground biomass was estimated using a regression developed from temporally resolved total biomass samples and high resolution 4 band remote sensing imagery planet team 2017 over 40 geolocated biomass samples were collected by harvesting all living plant biomass above the ground surface in 0 25 m2 quadrats on two dates dead biomass was collected to facilitate estimates of turnover rates section s2 6 of the si biomass samples were stored in plastic bags on ice before returning to the laboratory where they were weighed before and after being dried at 65 c for at least 48 h the difference in weight was used to calculate moisture content on each biomass sampling date we used remote sensing data to compute three vegetation indices normalized difference vegetation index ndvi green normalized difference vegetation index gndvi and simple ratio sr as described in section s2 of the si we used these vegetation indices to develop three separate regressions between vegetation index and biomass the sr based regression was selected for further analyses because it explained the most variance and had the smallest error dry weights of below ground plant biomass primarily composed of roots were calculated using relationships between mean annual temperature and below ground biomass reported in the literature gill et al 2002 to calculate total above ground and below ground biomass production i e net primary production peak live biomass measurements were multiplied by biomass turnover rates separately for above ground and below ground biomass details are provided in section s2 of the si 2 7 plant uptake calculations plant uptake of wastewater derived nitrogen was quantified by multiplying the total production of above ground and below ground biomass over time by 1 the elemental composition of biomass n to determine the total amount of nitrogen stored in plant biomass and 2 the fraction of biomass nitrogen derived from wastewater f w w from the linear mixing model to determine the mass of that nitrogen obtained from wastewater these calculations were performed on individual plant samples to produce spatial distributions of plant uptake total and from wastewater over the wetland slope spatial distributions were then integrated over the length of the wetland in each cell to produce weighted average values of plant uptake over the entire wetland slope for each cell 2 8 statistical analyses statistical analyses were performed in excel microsoft corporation redmond wa usa using the real statistics resource pack software release 5 4 zaiontz 2018 the collected data typically were not distributed normally and reported p values were therefore derived from non parametric analyses i e wilcoxon signed rank test for paired samples and mann whitney tests for independent samples unless otherwise specified for data that were not normally distributed reported values represent the median with confidence intervals presented according to 95 ci lower confidence interval upper confidence interval unless specified otherwise when data were normally distributed i

mean the standard deviation of the mean 3 results and discussion over the two year monitoring period 6 2017 6 2019 3570 kg of nitrogen were applied to the horizontal levee the 1660 kg of nitrogen that left the system in wetland effluent was mainly due to overland flow fig 1 these values were calculated based on aqueous nitrogen concentrations and average flow rates reported previously cecchetti et al 2020a as summarized in the dataset on mendeley data cecchetti et al 2020b as described by cecchetti et al 2020a there were three operational phases during this period 6 2017 11 2017 11 2017 7 2018 and 7 2018 6 2019 in which flow within the horizontal levee was progressively adjusted to improve system performance nitrogen removal increased from 48 of the influent nitrogen mass during the first two monitoring phases to 62 in the final monitoring phase with 96 removal of nitrogen in the 9 cells operated without overland flow during the final monitoring phase cecchetti et al 2020a when overland flow was eliminated nitrogen removal in the horizontal levee was significantly more efficient than has typically been reported for other constructed wetland systems cecchetti et al 2020a kadlec and wallace 2009 approximately 81 of the applied nitrogen consisted of nitrate the remainder was comprised of dissolved organic nitrogen 7 nitrite 3 and ammonium 9 therefore the most significant nitrogen removal processes in this system were those related to nitrate removal i e microbial assimilation denitrification and plant uptake the full dataset can be found on mendeley data cecchetti et al 2020b 3 1 nitrogen isotope signatures of plants data collected throughout the monitoring period were consistent with previous findings that nitrogen in municipal wastewater tends to be enriched isotopically relative to other sources heaton 1986 kendall 1998 δ15n values measured in wastewater had a median value of 9 8 ranging from 3 5 to 35 9 compared to δ15n values of 5 7 0 5 observed in soil samples prior to introduction of wastewater into the subsurface in april 2017 fig 1a new growth foliar plant samples were statistically indistinguishable from soil in terms of δ15n p 0 59 and 0 41 from two tailed t tests for j balticus and s lasiolepis and also in terms of δ34s for j balticus p 0 12 fig 2 which was consistent with past findings tcherkez and tea 2013 craine et al 2015 in terms of δ34s s lasiolepis was only offset by 1 p 0 01 from the soil as expected after wastewater effluent was introduced into the subsurface in april 2017 fig 1b shifts in the values of δ15n were observed in foliar samples fig 2 after april 2017 δ15n in foliar samples of all types had a median value of 13 8 with 95 of measured values falling between 7 4 and 23 7 this sample distribution was significantly higher p 0 001 than δ15n values in plants and soils prior to the introduction of wastewater despite large variations among individual measurements more details on the distributions of δ15n values from different sample types are included in section s3 of the si and fig s6 δ34s measured in j balticus did not change significantly p 0 51 after wastewater was introduced though δ34s values in s lasiolepis increased significantly p 0 001 suggesting these plants were accessing different sources of sulfur 3 2 mixing models despite the advantages associated with bayesian mixing models section s1 1 2 of the si phillips et al 2014 we used a linear mixing model to calculate plant uptake of wastewater derived nitrogen because it was computationally simpler could be applied flexibly to individual data points and avoided bias observed in bayesian models section s1 2 of the si during method development we progressively optimized our linear mixing models to reflect the conditions at the horizontal levee field site more accurately as described in section s1 of the si 3 2 1 endmember values throughout the monitoring period soil nitrogen values were normally distributed with average δ15n values of 5 7 0 5 and a range from 3 8 to 6 8 section s4 of the si conversely there were wide variations in δ15n values in wastewater nitrate applied to the system which were log normally distributed with a median value of 9 8 and a range from 3 5 to 35 9 histograms of soil and wastewater δ15n are presented in fig s6 although there was some overlap differences in δ15n from the two sources were significant p 0 001 the range of observed values for wastewater derived nitrogen was also consistent with previous findings kendall 1998 measurements that fell outside of the range of previously reported values likely were caused by operational conditions occurring during the first 6 months of the monitoring period when influent passed through a surface flow wetland prior to entering the subsurface cecchetti et al 2020a in the surface flow wetland nitrate was partially denitrified and the residual nitrate pool became enriched in 15n section s4 1 of the si we also observed progressive enrichment of δ15n and δ18o values as nitrate was removed in the subsurface this phenomenon was consistent with the results of past studies of denitrification kendall 1998 kendall et al 2007 suggesting that denitrification was important in the subsurface specifically values of δ15n and δ18o increased according to a tightly coupled trend as concentrations of nitrate decreased section s4 2 of the si additionally enrichment factors section s4 2 1 of the si for both δ15n and δ18o were consistent with past research on denitrification in subsurface and groundwater systems böttcher et al 1990 aravena and robertson 1998 mengis et al 1999 enrichment of nitrate in 15n due to denitrification likely explains why some foliar δ15n values were higher than the values of δ15n measured in wastewater nitrate collected on preceding sampling dates which should have reflected the wastewater nitrogen supplied to those foliar samples section s3 2 of the si progressive depletion of nitrate and enrichment in 15n was observed consistently across wetland cell types and all four dates when porewater samples were collected figures s4 1 and s4 2 within the subsurface wastewater derived nitrate was denitrified in the first 5 m of the slope changes in concentrations of wastewater nitrate in this region were best approximated by a zero order removal process fitted zero order equations were used to model nitrate concentrations at distances less than 5 m and were paired with enrichment factors section s4 2 1 of the si to model spatially resolved wastewater endmember values that could be used to apply the linear mixing model to individual plant samples section s4 of the si at distances beyond 5 m porewater nitrate concentrations were below 0 4 mg n l 1 and did not exhibit significant trends fig s8e the coupling of δ15n and δ18o values observed in the majority approximately 75 of samples collected within the first 5 m was not observed in other parts of the wetland ratios of δ18o to δ15n were significantly p 0 001 higher δ18o δ15n 1 8 relative to the first 5 m of the slope δ18o δ15n 0 8 fig s12 when porewater nitrate δ15n and δ18o were plotted in dual isotope space i e δ18o v δ15n fig s13 values from these two parts of the wetland clustered in distinct regions suggesting the presence of two sources of nitrate in the porewater porewater nitrate with this second isotopic signature i e higher δ18o δ15n ratios were considered to be attributable to a separate source of nitrate from wastewater derived nitrate and were used as the second endmember in the mixing model as described in section s1 of the si similar to wastewater derived nitrate we observed increasing δ18o and δ15n values as nitrate concentrations decreased within this nitrate pool however significant spatial trends were not observed suggesting formation of nitrate from this source occurred across the entire wetland r2 0 01 for all regression types tested fig s14 based on their significantly greater δ18o values we hypothesized that this second source of nitrate was derived from soil nitrogen and or decay of plant biomass see section s4 3 of the si for additional information we used an adapted version of a keeling plot pataki et al 2003 to identify the source isotope signature of this second nitrate pool which was approximately 3 2 fig s15 this value was offset by approximately 2 from values of δ15n measured in soil which was consistent with the expectation that processes converting soil nitrogen to nitrate i e ammonification and nitrification will discriminate against heavier isotopes for example fractionation of 1 4 to 2 3 was observed during mineralization of organic nitrogen in saturated sediments möbius 2013 additionally this source of nitrate was only observed after wastewater was introduced to the subsurface which then became saturated with water cecchetti et al 2020a prior to that point the wetland was only periodically irrigated with well water saturated conditions were favorable to denitrifiers that consumed nitrate and enriched the δ15n values in the residual soil nitrate pool available to plants this may explain our observation that even plants located in portions of the wetland without contact with wastewater derived nitrate i e plants located more than 5 m from the inlet to the wetland in cells without overland flow became enriched in δ15n after introduction of wastewater the signal for these plants tended to match this second isotopic signature alternatively because the first year of monitoring included extended periods of substantial overland flow e g 40 80 of applied wastewater flowed over the wetland surface cecchetti et al 2020a it is also possible that a fraction of the wastewater derived nitrogen was taken up into plant biomass at distances beyond 5 m and then cycled back into the subsurface through decomposition of organic matter if so this would further justify the use of this second nitrate pool as an endmember as opposed to solid phase soil δ15n values to avoid inflated plant uptake estimates in subsequent years caused by retention of enriched wastewater nitrogen through internal nitrogen cycling 3 2 2 mixing model results according to the model predictions throughout the monitoring period 14 of the nitrogen incorporated into plant biomass came from wastewater the remaining 86 was most likely derived from the soil which was rich in nitrogen phosphorus and organic carbon cecchetti et al in prep the fraction of plant nitrogen coming from wastewater varied with distance along the wetland slope approximately 81 of plant nitrogen was derived from wastewater within the first 2 m of the wetland which was significantly more p 0 001 than the 13 that was derived from wastewater in the last two thirds of the wetland fig 3 there were no significant differences in the fraction of biomass nitrogen coming from wastewater among cells with different planting regimes p 0 16 or sediment types p 0 48 and no seasonal trends in the fraction of nitrogen uptake from wastewater though this may have been partly due to the temporal resolution of sampling fig s16 we estimated that a low but measurable fraction of plant nitrogen came from wastewater at distances beyond 5 m approximately 5 10 for wet meadow cells and 10 20 for willow cells despite the fact that wastewater nitrogen was not detected in porewater beyond the first 10 m of the cells it is possible that this was caused by 1 intermittent periods of overland flow that supplied enriched wastewater nitrogen farther along the slope or 2 internal cycling of wastewater nitrogen that had been taken up into biomass beyond 5 m during early parts of the monitoring period for these reasons it is essential to characterize end member values continuously when applying mixing models to plant uptake calculations in multi year studies because mixing model results were sensitive to small changes in endmember values e g a change of 2 in the soil endmember isotope value shifted average mixing model outputs by 25 using direct measurements of δ15n from soil 5 7 as opposed to the δ15n from the soil nitrate source in porewater 10 6 would have nearly doubled the estimated mass of wastewater nitrogen taken up by biomass i e 300 kg n v 150 kg n a detailed comparison of mixing model results including sensitivity to endmember values and biomass measurements is provided in section s1 3 3 plant uptake measurements total above ground biomass in the wetland varied among wetland cells and increased throughout the monitoring period the median dry weight dw of above ground standing biomass was 0 7 kg dw m 2 95 ci 0 3 kg dw m 2 1 7 kg dw m 2 for the entire site the median annual peak above ground biomass which typically occurred between the middle of may and late july was 0 7 kg dw m 2 throughout the monitoring period ranging from 0 5 0 1 kg dw m 2 in 2017 to 1 5 0 3 kg dw m 2 in 2019 a significant increase p 0 001 below ground biomass also increased throughout the monitoring period gill et al 2002 from 0 5 0 1 kg dw m 2 in 2017 to 1 0 0 1 kg dw m 2 in 2019 below ground biomass values modeled in this study as well as distributions between above ground and below ground biomass in the horizontal levee were consistent with past studies of plants at constructed wetlands kadlec and wallace 2009 where below ground biomass was often similar to or less than above ground biomass by the end of the monitoring period june 2019 the peak above ground standing biomass i e the maximum amount of standing biomass observed annually was significantly p 0 03 greater in cells planted with willows i e 1 8 0 1 kg dw m 2 than wet meadow cells i e 1 4 0 2 kg dw m 2 however due to significantly higher turnover rates in wet meadow cells the annual above ground net primary production i e total mass of plant biomass produced annually was significantly lower p 0 01 in cells planted with willows e g 2 0 0 1 kg dw m 2 yr 1 on average versus 5 7 1 0 kg dw m 2 yr 1 in those cells planted with wet meadows this has important implications with respect to the amount of nitrogen incorporated into plant biomass our sensitivity analyses revealed that even small changes in average standing biomass can have a significant impact on the amount of nitrogen taken up by plants particularly in species with high biomass turnover rates a greater than 10 increase in the modeled mass of nitrogen taken up into plant biomass was observed on average when peak standing biomass increased by 0 1 kg dw m 2 over the range of observed biomass values i e 0 3 2 0 kg dw m 2 using peak annual biomass measurements b peak in kg dw m 2 section s2 7 of the si and turnover rates θ b in yr 1 section s2 6 of the si the total mass of nitrogen taken up into plant biomass was calculated according to the equation n uptake b peak θ b f n over the two year monitoring period the mass fraction of nitrogen in biomass f n kg n kg dw 1 had median values of 4 0 2 2 and 2 8 for willows s lasiolepis baltic rush j balticus and composite samples from wet meadow cells respectively this corresponded to a total mass of nitrogen taken up into plant biomass of 1100 kg n 95 ci 340 kg n 2400 kg n over the monitoring period based on the results of the mixing model this yielded a mass of 150 kg n 95 ci 50 kg n 330 kg n of wastewater derived nitrate removed via plant uptake over the monitoring period which corresponded to 10 95 ci 3 22 of the nitrate and 8 95 ci 2 17 of total nitrogen removed from wastewater during the two year monitoring period more than a third of wastewater derived nitrogen taken up by plants e g 51 kg n or 34 went into willows which covered close to a quarter of the site plant uptake calculated using this new method differed significantly from estimates made using the approaches applied in previous studies for example if all of the nitrogen stored in plant biomass were assumed to be derived from wastewater in the horizontal levee plant uptake would have accounted for nearly 60 of the removal of applied wastewater nitrogen rather than the roughly 8 removal calculated using the new methods outlined here conversely if increasing fractional nitrogen content n of plant biomass were assumed to be the derived from wastewater we would have significantly overestimated uptake of nitrogen from wastewater by willows e g 150 kg n v the 60 kg n calculated by our method while underestimating uptake of nitrogen by other plants e g 0 kg n due to insignificant changes in the n of composite biomass samples during the monitoring period v 90 kg n by our method despite yielding a similar estimate of uptake over the entire pilot system e g 8 the amount of wastewater derived nitrogen taken up by plants only represented a fraction of their total nitrogen requirements of the 1100 kg n taken up by plants during the monitoring period 980 kg n came from the soil on the basis of the nitrogen content of the soil at the start of this study i e approximately 0 15 of the soil or 10 000 kg n and measured nitrogen removal rates we estimate that this rate of extraction would only be sustainable for approximately 10 years assuming that all of the soil nitrogen was accessible and none of the plant biomass nitrogen was returned to the soil however a large fraction of the nitrogen taken up into plants was deposited as residues annually for example although above ground standing biomass in the wet meadow cells peaked on average at 1 4 kg dw m 2 in 2019 the total biomass produced during that year was 6 2 kg dw m 2 roughly 80 of the produced biomass deposited onto the wetland surface or was consumed by organisms if the nitrogen stored within those residues was released through decomposition and became available to plants to support subsequent growth soils could supply sufficient nitrogen for plant growth for nearly 120 years without nitrogen inputs from other sources this is more consistent with the nitrogen budgets of natural wetlands in which internal cycling frequently satisfies the majority plant nitrogen demands bowden 1987 bowden et al 1991 3 3 1 variations in plant uptake rates the amount of wastewater derived nitrate removed through plant uptake increased throughout the monitoring period varied seasonally and among cell types and decreased with distance along the wetland uptake rates were on average 29 higher in the second year of monitoring 6 2018 6 2019 compared to the first 6 2017 6 2018 for example average uptake rates per cell were 30 g n d 1 8 of applied nitrogen in the spring of 2018 3 2018 6 2018 versus 46 g n d 1in the spring of 2019 3 2019 6 2019 moreover the fraction of wastewater n removed by plant uptake was nearly three times higher in the spring of 2019 23 of removal than in the preceding spring 8 of removal this was partly due to lower mass loading rates of wastewater nitrogen in 2019 which were 50 lower than the preceding year and also due to higher biomass production which more than doubled between 2017 and 2019 as plants matured there were also clear seasonal trends in both plant uptake and the fraction of wastewater nitrogen removed by uptake fig 4 which were both highest in the spring when plant growth was the greatest and lowest in the fall when plants were senescing removal of applied wastewater nitrate via plant uptake per cell was significantly p 0 001 one tailed paired t test greater for cells planted with willows i e 23 g n d 1 than for cells dominanted by wet weadow i e 13 g n d 1 fig 4b despite lower primary production rates in willow cells the extensive rooting zones of willows likely gave them greater access than other plants to wastewater nitrate that flowed primarily in the deeper subsurface layers cecchetti et al 2020a additionally as mentioned previously the majority of nitrogen was removed at the beginning of the slope cecchetti et al 2020a our mixing model indicated that of the 150 kg of nitrogen removed via plant uptake 63 97 kg n was taken up by plants within the first third 15 m of the slope with 45 70 kg n removed by plants in the first 2 m alone these uptake trends were consistent across cells throughout the monitoring period 3 4 implications for horizontal levee design there are a variety of design features that could be incorporated into horizontal levees to optimize both nutrient removal and plant uptake of nitrogen in the pilot scale horizontal levee the majority of applied nitrogen 96 was removed at the beginning of the wetland before wastewater effluent came into contact with the plants that occupied the remaining 90 of the levee slope if cells were constructed to increase contact of wastewater nitrogen with plant roots along the entire horizontal levee the fraction of wastewater nitrogen taken up by plants could increase substantially some of the design features proposed previously for optimizing hydraulics cecchetti et al 2020a such as using granular media with a higher hydraulic conductivity could also increase contact of wastewater nitrate with plant roots by spreading nitrate from wastewater throughout the subsurface however rapid denitrification rates still might limit plant uptake alternatively designers could consider using multiple water inlet points with subsurface piping manifolds located at regular intervals along the slope to increase the fraction of wastewater nitrogen taken up by biomass despite significant denitrification rates this design feature would increase average subsurface nitrate concentrations further along the slope increasing the potential for plant uptake in portions of horizontal levees that would not be exposed to wastewater nitrogen loads in systems with a single inlet ideally these manifolds would be spaced every 10 20 m to achieve the greatest possible contact between wastewater nitrogen and plant roots other applications such as batch application of wastewater or systems relying on percolation via surface application of water may also be useful in increasing plant uptake of effluent nitrogen additionally past research has shown that willows increase the subsurface flow capacity of horizontal levees which could increase the mass of solutes removed by uptake cecchetti et al 2020a when combined with our findings that willows have higher nitrogen uptake rates than other wetland plants it is clear that willows have a significant capacity to promote nitrogen removal in horizontal levees through multiple mechanisms it is important to note that nitrogen uptake into plant biomass constitutes a storage mechanism rather than a permanent sink however it is likely that the release of nitrogen into the subsurface from decaying plant residues will either be 1 taken up by plants again or 2 denitrified by microorganisms using organic carbon from plant residues as an electron donor before nitrogen leaves in the system effluent for example if just 10 of the approximately 18 000 kg yr 1 of organic carbon from plant biomass decomposed each year a conservative estimate based on reported litter decomposition rates aké castillo et al 2006 review of past studies this additional input of organic carbon would be sufficient to denitrify 1600 kg n yr 1 which is greater than annual uptake of nitrogen from all sources in this system and more than 10 times the amount of nitrogen taken up from wastewater alone 150 kg n a discussion of the relative importance of denitrification and other microbial nitrogen removal mechanisms as well as the biogeochemical cycling of other redox active species in horizontal levees is provided elsewhere cecchetti et al in prep 4 conclusions in this study isotope fingerprinting and mixing models were used to evaluate the uptake of nitrogen in a horizontal levee a new nature based system for improving water quality which also protects coastal infrastructure from the effects of sea level rise our findings indicate that plant uptake can be responsible for removal of a significant fraction of nitrogen entering the system with more than 20 of nitrogen removed by plant uptake in the spring of 2019 the exact mechanisms by which the remainder of nitrogen was removed is still unknown however on the basis of site biogeochemistry cecchetti et al in prep and isotope fractionation observed in porewater in the first 5 m of the system it appears that a majority of this remaining nitrogen was removed by microbial denitrification the new isotope methods detailed in this study are promising techniques for quantifying plant uptake of wastewater derived nitrogen in natural treatment systems mixing models based on isotope fingerprinting provide a more robust means of measuring plant uptake because they do not rely on assumptions that were necessary in previous methods isotope methods can improve understanding of nitrogen uptake mechanisms and resolve the wide discrepancies in reported values of nitrogen uptake by plants in other nature based treatment systems more precise estimation of the relative contribution of plant uptake to nitrogen removal is important in multi benefit treatment systems because it can help designers to prioritize objectives for example if plant uptake were found to be insignificant designers could consider objectives related to habitat creation and planting regimes separately from water quality improvement objectives additionally our results demonstrate that willows have a significant capacity through multiple mechanisms to promote nitrogen removal in horizontal levees finally although plant uptake constitutes a storage mechanism rather than an ultimate removal in systems like the horizontal levee i e where plants are not harvested and removed labile organic carbon inputs from decaying biomass appear to be sufficient to denitrify the amount of nitrogen reintegrated in the subsurface from senesced biomass author statements aidan cecchetti conceptualization methodology

19985,in nature based treatment systems such as constructed wetlands plant uptake of nutrients can be a significant removal pathway current methods for quantifying plant uptake of nitrogen in constructed wetlands which often involve harvesting biomass and assuming that all nitrogen stored in plants was derived from wastewater are inappropriate in pilot and full scale systems where other sources of nitrogen are available to improve our understanding of nitrogen cycling in constructed wetlands we developed a new method to quantify plant uptake of nitrogen by using stable isotopes and a mixing model to distinguish between nitrogen sources we applied this new method to a pilot scale horizontal levee system i e a subsurface constructed wetland over a two year monitoring period during which 14 of nitrogen in plants was wastewater derived on average and the remaining plant nitrogen was obtained from the soil analysis of nitrogen isotopes indicated substantial spatial variability in the wetland 82 of nitrogen in plants within the first 2 m of the slope came from wastewater while less than 12 of plant nitrogen in the remainder of the wetland originated from wastewater by combining these source contributions with remote sensing derived total biomass measurements we calculated that 150 kg n 95 ci 50 kg n 330 kg n was taken up and retained by plants during the two year monitoring period which corresponded to approximately 8 of nitrogen removed in the wetland nitrogen uptake followed seasonal trends increased as plants matured and varied based on design parameters e g plant types suggesting that design decisions can impact this removal pathway this new method can help inform efforts to understand nitrogen cycling and optimize the design of nature based nutrient control systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords nature based treatment nitrogen removal plant uptake stable isotopes mixing models remote sensing 1 introduction humans have extensively modified the nitrogen cycle galloway et al 2008 which has caused widespread damage to aquatic ecosystems such as eutrophication sutton and bleeker 2013 freeman et al 2019 these impacts have been exacerbated by the loss of coastal wetlands li et al 2018 that historically have reduced the export of nutrients from terrestrial systems megonigal and neubauer 2019 despite past attempts to control anthropogenic nutrient inputs using conventional management methods eutrophication has frequently persisted thornton et al 2013 as an alternative to conventional approaches engineers have begun to consider the use of constructed wetlands to manage nutrient discharges horizontal levees are a new type of subsurface constructed wetland that can protect coastal urban areas against flooding while treating wastewater effluent in managed wetland habitats cecchetti et al 2020a these new types of constructed wetlands can also provide restored habitat and a suite of additional benefits kadlec and wallace 2009 cecchetti et al 2020a their low cost and resource requirements relative to conventional single benefit solutions make constructed wetlands particularly attractive to utility managers kadlec and wallace 2009 harris lovett et al 2019 despite these benefits there remain many uncertainties about the performance of horizontal levees and the exact processes by which they remove nutrients in subsurface wetlands nitrogen is often removed or immobilized by plant uptake as well as a suite of microbial processes including assimilation denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation kadlec and wallace 2009 javanaud et al 2011 wu et al 2017 due to the complex nature of these processes past assessments of plant uptake in nature based systems have varied widely with reported fractions of nitrogen removal attributable to plant uptake spanning three orders of magnitude i e 0 5 90 meers et al 2008 saeed and sun 2012 though these differences may partly be explained by variations in plant maturation plant types and nitrogen loading rates rather than attempting to discriminate among mechanisms researchers often make simplifying assumptions that can lead to large errors when quantifying nitrogen uptake rates in particular researchers often assume that all nitrogen in plants is derived from wastewater in these systems healy and cawley 2002 geng et al 2019 chen et al 2014 du et al 2018 this is a reasonable assumption if other sources of nitrogen e g soil are absent however uptake will be overestimated if wetland plants have access to other nitrogen sources differences between nitrogen removal in planted and unplanted control wetlands have also been used to estimate plant uptake of nitrogen drizo et al 1997 kantawanichkul et al 2009 paranychiankis et al 2016 but this comparison ignores the importance of plant roots in stimulating microbial nitrogen removal in the rhizosphere zhai et al 2013 to overcome these limitations researchers have also quantified plant uptake in bench scale wetland microcosms using 15n tracers zhang et al 2016 messer et al 2017 hu et al 2016 which have also been widely used to characterize microbial nitrogen cycling in natural ecosystems song et al 2013 salk et al 2017 and constructed wetlands erler et al 2008 rambags et al 2019 however in pilot scale to full scale wetlands materials costs associated with 15n tracers alone could be prohibitively expensive natural abundance stable isotope mixing models provide an alternative approach for estimating plant uptake of nitrogen stable isotopes have been widely used at natural abundance levels to study biogeochemical processes dawson et al 2002 fry 2006 and nitrogen cycling in aquatic ecosystems mcclelland and valiela 1998 cole et al 2004 reinhardt et al 2006 bannon and roman 2008 kohzu et al 2008 søvik and mørkved 2007 erler et al 2010 kaushal et al 2011 chen et al 2014 however despite their versatility the application of natural abundance stable isotopes to assess nitrogen uptake in constructed wetlands has been limited fair and heikoop 2006 in nature based systems like the horizontal levee the primary sources of nitrogen are wastewater and soil with isotope fingerprinting measurements of nitrogen isotopes in plants can be used to identify their sources of nitrogen because isotope ratios in plant tissues typically match their source of nitrogen craine et al 2015 furthermore wastewater derived nitrogen is frequently enriched in 15n δ15n 25 35 as a result its isotopic signature i e δ15n or nitrogen isotope ratio is distinguishable from other nitrogen sources such as soils δ15n 0 10 the atmosphere δ15n 15 to 15 or nitrogen derived from fixation δ15n 0 heaton 1986 kendall 1998 the isotopic signatures which are commonly termed end members of these different sources can be used in mixing models to determine the relative contribution of those sources to the nitrogen found in plants in this study we present a new method for quantifying plant uptake of nitrogen in nature based treatment systems using a stable isotope mixing model in a pilot scale horizontal levee we developed this method in a horizontal levee by coupling 1 isotopic analysis of plants wastewater and soils 2 remote sensing derived biomass measurements and 3 water quality data we used this information to assess the contribution of plant uptake to nitrogen removal in this system this approach is a promising tool for understanding nitrogen fate and managing nitrogen species in both nature based treatment systems and in natural ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site nitrogen uptake was studied at a demonstration scale horizontal levee system at the oro loma sanitary district wastewater treatment plant in san lorenzo ca cecchetti et al 2020a the subsurface wetland contained 12 gently sloped 1 30 parallel treatment cells 1 m deep 12 m wide and 46 m long that were hydraulically isolated from each other the cells were used to test four treatments i e swale depression cells wet meadows with fine and coarse topsoil and riparian willow cells that varied in terms of their topography soil type and native plant community type underlaying the 60 cm of topsoil were two 15 cm deep layers of sand and gravel that were amended with organic carbon i e wood chips to promote microbial denitrification influent samples were collected from a pump station that delivered nitrified secondary municipal wastewater effluent into 12 wetland cells approximately 5 cm below the surface at the top of the slope the effluent from each cell flowed into a gravel trench spanning the end of the cell and was collected in perforated pvc pipes at the bottom of the trench from where effluent samples were collected native plants mainly of the families cyperaceae sedges juncaceae rushes and salicaceae willows were planted between september 2015 and february 2016 approximately 15 months before nitrified wastewater effluent was first introduced into the subsurface prior to this time the cells were irrigated with shallow groundwater obtained from a well located approximately 50 m from the wetland additional details regarding the hydraulics design and wetland treatments including the plant species and the number of individuals of each species planted in the wetland are available elsewhere cecchetti et al 2020a 2 2 solid sample collection and processing δ15n and δ34s were measured in foliar and soil samples before and after wastewater effluent was introduced into the horizontal levee to assess isotopic discrimination during uptake prior to wastewater introduction and as inputs for source contribution models after introduction of wastewater fig 1 samples of new growth plant leaves were collected from baltic rushes j balticus syn j

as in fig s1 j balticus of the supporting information si samples were collected at various distances along the wetland slope in riparian type cells foliar samples from s lasiolepis were collected at 7 10 locations along three transects that were parallel to water flow in each cell a total of 332 foliar samples of s lasiolepis were collected on 8 sampling dates in all other cells samples of j balticus were collected and pooled into 7 distance resolved samples per cell from transects perpendicular to the direction of flow along the slope a total of 158 pooled foliar samples of j balticus were collected on 5 sampling dates leaves were separated from their petioles at sampling when appropriate and placed in paper envelopes the envelopes were placed inside of plastic bags and stored on ice prior to returning to the lab leaf samples were dried at 65 c for 48 h immediately upon returning to the lab soil samples were collected for isotope analysis from the top 10 cm of the soil in 2016

nalgene bottles sigma aldrich st louis mo usa samples were stored on ice for transport and frozen within 4 h prior to isotopic analysis samples were processed according to the procedure detailed by granger and sigman 2009 for removing nitrite to limit interferences during nitrate isotope measurements after thawing 10 30 ml subsamples were transferred to acid washed 60 ml hdpe bottles 20 μl per

plant nitrogen source contribution models we used mixing models to calculate the fraction of nitrogen in plant biomass derived from soil and wastewater nitrogen respectively of mixing model types available linear and bayesian mixing models each have their own set of strengths and weaknesses see section s1 of the si we developed both linear and bayesian mixing models evaristo et al 2017 to test the utility and flexibility of these two methods for calculating plant uptake of nitrogen soil nitrogen and wastewater derived nitrate were the main sources of nitrogen available to wetland plants contributions of nitrogen from atmospheric deposition 0 1 of total nitrogen inputs and fixation of n2 by wetland plants 0 5 of total nitrogen inputs were considered negligible based on upper bound estimates found in the literature for similar locations schwede and lear 2014 nadp 2019 or natural wetland systems bowden 1987 discrimination between nitrogen isotopes during plant uptake was assumed to be negligible based on similarities between δ15n in baseline soil and plant tissue samples e g samples collected prior to the introduction of wastewater to the subsurface in april 2017 fig 2 which was consistent with past findings craine et al 2015 mixing model assumptions are discussed in section s1 of the si a two source bayesian mixing model was developed using mixsiar r package stock and semmens 2013 with three factors subsurface concentrations of wastewater derived nitrate continuous distance of sampling locations along the slope continuous and wetland cell random soil and wastewater nitrogen were input as model end members a dirichlet distribution was used as the prior distribution in all bayesian mixing models a two source linear mixing model was applied to our data according to eqs 1 and 2 1 δ 15 n p l a n t s δ 15 n s o i l f s o i l δ 15 n w w f w w 2 1 f s o i l f w w where δ 15 n p l a n t s δ 15 n s o i l and δ 15 n w w are the nitrogen isotope signatures of plants soil and wastewater nitrogen the fractional contributions of soil nitrogen and wastewater nitrogen to plants are represented by f s o i l and f w w respectively the linear mixing model ultimately used to calculate plant uptake in this study underwent multiple iterations that are described in section s1 of the si in the final iteration of the mixing model section s1 2 3 we used end member values as described in section s4 of the si for δ 15 n s o i l we used average δ 15 n values for soil derived porewater nitrate section s4 3 and for δ 15 n w w we used spatially resolved changes in the δ 15 n of wastewater derived nitrate in porewater section s4 2 this model was applied to individual plant samples allowing us to calculate means medians and confidence intervals for f s o i l and f w w by cell cell type and distance along the slope phillips and gregg 2001 2 6 biomass measurements above ground biomass was estimated using a regression developed from temporally resolved total biomass samples and high resolution 4 band remote sensing imagery planet team 2017 over 40 geolocated biomass samples were collected by harvesting all living plant biomass above the ground surface in 0 25 m2 quadrats on two dates dead biomass was collected to facilitate estimates of turnover rates section s2 6 of the si biomass samples were stored in plastic bags on ice before returning to the laboratory where they were weighed before and after being dried at 65 c for at least 48 h the difference in weight was used to calculate moisture content on each biomass sampling date we used remote sensing data to compute three vegetation indices normalized difference vegetation index ndvi green normalized difference vegetation index gndvi and simple ratio sr as described in section s2 of the si we used these vegetation indices to develop three separate regressions between vegetation index and biomass the sr based regression was selected for further analyses because it explained the most variance and had the smallest error dry weights of below ground plant biomass primarily composed of roots were calculated using relationships between mean annual temperature and below ground biomass reported in the literature gill et al 2002 to calculate total above ground and below ground biomass production i e net primary production peak live biomass measurements were multiplied by biomass turnover rates separately for above ground and below ground biomass details are provided in section s2 of the si 2 7 plant uptake calculations plant uptake of wastewater derived nitrogen was quantified by multiplying the total production of above ground and below ground biomass over time by 1 the elemental composition of biomass n to determine the total amount of nitrogen stored in plant biomass and 2 the fraction of biomass nitrogen derived from wastewater f w w from the linear mixing model to determine the mass of that nitrogen obtained from wastewater these calculations were performed on individual plant samples to produce spatial distributions of plant uptake total and from wastewater over the wetland slope spatial distributions were then integrated over the length of the wetland in each cell to produce weighted average values of plant uptake over the entire wetland slope for each cell 2 8 statistical analyses statistical analyses were performed in excel microsoft corporation

left the system in wetland effluent was mainly due to overland flow fig 1 these values were calculated based on aqueous nitrogen concentrations and average flow rates reported previously cecchetti et al 2020a as summarized in the dataset on mendeley data cecchetti et al 2020b as described by cecchetti et al 2020a there were three operational phases during this period 6 2017 11 2017 11 2017 7 2018 and 7 2018 6 2019 in which flow within the horizontal levee was progressively adjusted to improve system performance nitrogen removal increased from 48 of the influent nitrogen mass during the first two monitoring phases to 62 in the final monitoring phase with 96 removal of nitrogen in the 9 cells operated without overland flow during the final monitoring phase cecchetti et al 2020a when overland flow was eliminated nitrogen removal in the horizontal levee was significantly more efficient than has typically been reported for other constructed wetland systems cecchetti et al 2020a kadlec and wallace 2009 approximately 81 of the applied nitrogen consisted of nitrate the remainder was comprised of dissolved organic nitrogen 7 nitrite 3 and ammonium 9 therefore the most significant nitrogen removal processes in this system were those related to nitrate removal i e microbial assimilation denitrification and plant uptake the full dataset can be found on mendeley data cecchetti et al 2020b 3 1 nitrogen isotope signatures of plants data collected throughout the monitoring period were consistent with previous findings that nitrogen in municipal wastewater tends to be enriched isotopically relative to other sources heaton 1986 kendall 1998 δ15n values measured in wastewater had a median value of 9 8 ranging from 3 5 to 35 9 compared to δ15n values of 5 7 0 5 observed in soil samples prior to introduction of wastewater into the subsurface in april 2017 fig 1a new growth foliar plant samples were statistically indistinguishable from soil in terms of δ15n p 0 59 and 0 41 from two tailed t tests for j balticus and s lasiolepis and also in terms of δ34s for j balticus p 0 12 fig 2 which was consistent with past findings tcherkez and tea 2013 craine et al 2015 in terms of δ34s s lasiolepis was only offset by 1 p 0 01 from the soil as expected after wastewater effluent was introduced into the subsurface in april 2017 fig 1b shifts in the values of δ15n were observed in foliar samples fig 2 after april 2017 δ15n in foliar samples of all types had a median value of 13 8 with 95 of measured values falling between 7 4 and 23 7 this sample distribution was significantly higher p 0 001 than δ15n values in plants and soils prior to the introduction of wastewater despite large variations among individual measurements more details on the distributions of δ15n values from different sample types are included in section s3 of the si and fig s6 δ34s measured in j balticus did not change significantly p 0 51 after wastewater was introduced though δ34s values in s lasiolepis increased significantly p 0 001 suggesting these plants were accessing different sources of sulfur 3 2 mixing models despite the advantages associated with bayesian mixing models section s1 1 2 of the si phillips et al 2014 we used a linear mixing model to calculate plant uptake of wastewater derived nitrogen because it was computationally simpler could be applied flexibly to individual data points and avoided bias observed in bayesian models section s1 2 of the si during method development we progressively optimized our linear mixing models to reflect the conditions at the horizontal levee field site more accurately as described in section s1 of the si 3 2 1 endmember values throughout the monitoring period soil nitrogen values were normally distributed with average δ15n values of 5 7 0 5 and a range from 3 8 to 6 8 section s4 of the si conversely there were wide variations in δ15n values in wastewater nitrate applied to the system which were log normally distributed with a median value of 9 8 and a range from 3 5 to 35 9 histograms of soil and wastewater δ15n are presented in fig s6 although there was some overlap differences in δ15n from the two sources were significant p 0 001 the range of observed values for wastewater derived nitrogen was also consistent with previous findings kendall 1998 measurements that fell outside of the range of previously reported values likely were caused by operational conditions occurring during the first 6 months of the monitoring period when influent passed through a surface flow wetland prior to entering the subsurface cecchetti et al 2020a in the surface flow wetland nitrate was partially denitrified and the residual nitrate pool became enriched in 15n section s4 1 of the si we also observed progressive enrichment of δ15n and δ18o values as nitrate was removed in the subsurface this phenomenon was consistent with the results of past studies of denitrification kendall 1998 kendall et al 2007 suggesting that denitrification was important in the subsurface specifically values of δ15n and δ18o increased according to a tightly coupled trend as concentrations of nitrate decreased section s4 2 of the si additionally enrichment factors section s4 2 1 of the si for both δ15n and δ18o were consistent with past research on denitrification in subsurface and groundwater systems böttcher et al 1990 aravena and robertson 1998 mengis et al 1999 enrichment of nitrate in 15n due to denitrification likely explains why some foliar δ15n values were higher than the values of δ15n measured in wastewater nitrate collected on preceding sampling dates which should have reflected the wastewater nitrogen supplied to those foliar samples section s3 2 of the si progressive depletion of nitrate and enrichment in 15n was observed consistently across wetland cell types and all four dates when porewater samples were collected figures s4 1 and s4 2 within the subsurface wastewater derived nitrate was denitrified in the first 5 m of the slope changes in concentrations of wastewater nitrate in this region were best approximated by a zero order removal process fitted zero order equations were used to model nitrate concentrations at distances less than 5 m and were paired with enrichment factors section s4 2 1 of the si to model spatially resolved wastewater endmember values that could be used to apply the linear mixing model to individual plant samples section s4 of the si at distances beyond 5 m porewater nitrate concentrations were below 0 4 mg n l 1 and did not exhibit significant trends fig s8e the coupling of δ15n and δ18o values observed in the majority approximately 75 of samples collected within the first 5 m was not observed in other parts of the wetland ratios of δ18o to δ15n were significantly p 0 001 higher δ18o δ15n 1 8 relative to the first 5 m of the slope δ18o δ15n 0 8 fig s12 when porewater nitrate δ15n and δ18o were plotted in dual isotope space i e δ18o v δ15n fig s13 values from these two parts of the wetland clustered in distinct regions suggesting the presence of two sources of nitrate in the porewater porewater nitrate with this second isotopic signature i e higher δ18o δ15n ratios were considered to be attributable to a separate source of nitrate from wastewater derived nitrate and were used as the second endmember in the mixing model as described in section s1 of the si similar to wastewater derived nitrate we observed increasing δ18o and δ15n values as nitrate concentrations decreased within this nitrate pool however significant spatial trends were not observed suggesting formation of nitrate from this source occurred across the entire wetland r2 0 01 for all regression types tested fig s14 based on their significantly greater δ18o values we hypothesized that this second source of nitrate was derived from soil nitrogen and or decay of plant biomass see section s4 3 of the si for additional information we used an adapted version of a keeling plot pataki et al 2003 to identify the source isotope signature of this second nitrate pool which was approximately 3 2 fig s15 this value was offset by approximately 2 from values of δ15n measured in soil which was consistent with the expectation that processes converting soil nitrogen to nitrate i e ammonification and nitrification will discriminate against heavier isotopes for example fractionation of 1 4 to 2 3 was observed during mineralization of organic nitrogen in saturated sediments möbius 2013 additionally this source of nitrate was only observed after wastewater was introduced to the subsurface which then became saturated with water cecchetti et al 2020a prior to that point the wetland was only periodically irrigated with well water saturated conditions were favorable to denitrifiers that consumed nitrate and enriched the δ15n values in the residual soil nitrate pool available to plants this may explain our observation that even plants located in portions of the wetland without contact with wastewater derived nitrate i e plants located more than 5 m from the inlet to the wetland in cells without overland flow became enriched in δ15n after introduction of wastewater the signal for these plants tended to match this second isotopic signature alternatively because the first year of monitoring included extended periods of substantial overland flow e g 40 80 of applied wastewater flowed over the wetland surface cecchetti et al 2020a it is also possible that a fraction of the wastewater derived nitrogen was taken up into plant biomass at distances beyond 5 m and then cycled back into the subsurface through decomposition of organic matter if so this would further justify the use of this second nitrate pool as an endmember as opposed to solid phase soil δ15n values to avoid inflated plant uptake estimates in subsequent years caused by retention of enriched wastewater nitrogen through internal nitrogen cycling 3 2 2 mixing model results according to the model predictions throughout the monitoring period 14 of the nitrogen incorporated into plant biomass came from wastewater the remaining 86 was most likely derived from the soil which was rich in nitrogen phosphorus and organic carbon cecchetti et al in prep the fraction of plant nitrogen coming from wastewater varied with distance along the wetland slope approximately 81 of plant nitrogen was derived from wastewater within the first 2 m of the wetland which was significantly more p 0 001 than the 13 that was derived from wastewater in the last two thirds of the wetland fig 3 there were no significant differences in the fraction of biomass nitrogen coming from wastewater among cells with different planting regimes p 0 16 or sediment types p 0 48 and no seasonal trends in the fraction of nitrogen uptake from wastewater though this may have been partly due to the temporal resolution of sampling fig s16 we estimated that a low but measurable fraction of plant nitrogen came from wastewater at distances beyond 5 m approximately 5 10 for wet meadow cells and 10 20 for willow cells despite the fact that wastewater nitrogen was not detected in porewater beyond the first 10 m of the cells it is possible that this was caused by 1 intermittent periods of overland flow that supplied enriched wastewater nitrogen farther along the slope or 2 internal cycling of wastewater nitrogen that had been taken up into biomass beyond 5 m during early parts of the monitoring period for these reasons it is essential to characterize end member values continuously when applying mixing models to plant uptake calculations in multi year studies because mixing model results were sensitive to small changes in endmember values e g a change of 2 in the soil endmember isotope value shifted average mixing model outputs by 25 using direct measurements of δ15n from soil 5 7 as opposed to the δ15n from the soil nitrate source in porewater 10 6 would have nearly doubled the estimated mass of wastewater nitrogen taken up by biomass i e 300 kg n v 150 kg n a detailed comparison of mixing model results including sensitivity to endmember values and biomass measurements is provided in section s1 3 3 plant uptake measurements total above ground biomass in the wetland varied among wetland cells and increased throughout the monitoring period the median dry weight dw of above ground standing biomass was 0 7 kg dw m 2 95 ci 0 3 kg dw m 2 1 7 kg dw m 2 for the entire site the median annual peak above ground biomass which typically occurred between the middle of may and late july was 0 7 kg dw m 2 throughout the monitoring period ranging from 0 5 0 1 kg dw m 2 in 2017 to 1 5 0 3 kg dw m 2 in 2019 a significant increase p 0 001 below ground biomass also increased throughout the monitoring period gill et al 2002 from 0 5 0 1 kg dw m 2 in 2017 to 1 0 0 1 kg dw m 2 in 2019 below ground biomass values modeled in this study as well as distributions between above ground and below ground biomass in the horizontal levee were consistent with past studies of plants at constructed wetlands kadlec and wallace 2009 where below ground biomass was often similar to or less than above ground biomass by the end of the monitoring period june 2019 the peak above ground standing biomass i e the maximum amount of standing biomass observed annually was significantly p 0 03 greater in cells planted with willows i e 1 8 0 1 kg dw m 2 than wet meadow cells i e 1 4 0 2 kg dw m 2 however due to significantly higher turnover rates in wet meadow cells the annual above ground net primary production i e total mass of plant biomass produced annually was significantly lower p 0 01 in cells planted with willows e g 2 0 0 1 kg dw m 2 yr 1 on average versus 5 7 1 0 kg dw m 2 yr 1 in those cells planted with wet meadows this has important implications with respect to the amount of nitrogen incorporated into plant biomass our sensitivity analyses revealed that even small changes in average standing biomass can have a significant impact on the amount of nitrogen taken up by plants particularly in species with high biomass turnover rates a greater than 10 increase in the modeled mass of nitrogen taken up into plant biomass was observed on average when peak standing biomass increased by 0 1 kg dw m 2 over the range of observed biomass values i e 0 3 2 0 kg dw m 2 using peak annual biomass measurements b peak in kg dw m 2 section s2 7 of the si and turnover rates θ b in yr 1 section s2 6 of the si the total mass of nitrogen taken up into plant biomass was calculated according to the equation n uptake b peak θ b f n over the two year monitoring period the mass fraction of nitrogen in biomass f n kg n kg dw 1 had median values of 4 0 2 2 and 2 8 for willows s lasiolepis baltic rush j balticus and composite samples from wet meadow cells respectively this corresponded to a total mass of nitrogen taken up into plant biomass of 1100 kg n 95 ci 340 kg n 2400 kg n over the monitoring period based on the results of the mixing model this yielded a mass of 150 kg n 95 ci 50 kg n 330 kg n of wastewater derived nitrate removed via plant uptake over the monitoring period which corresponded to 10 95 ci 3 22 of the nitrate and 8 95 ci 2 17 of total nitrogen removed from wastewater during the two year monitoring period more than a third of wastewater derived nitrogen taken up by plants e g 51 kg n or 34 went into willows which covered close to a quarter of the site plant uptake calculated using this new method differed significantly from estimates made using the approaches applied in previous studies for example if all of the nitrogen stored in plant biomass were assumed to be derived from wastewater in the horizontal levee plant uptake would have accounted for nearly 60 of the removal of applied wastewater nitrogen rather than the roughly 8 removal calculated using the new methods outlined here conversely if increasing fractional nitrogen content n of plant biomass were assumed to be the derived from wastewater we would have significantly overestimated uptake of nitrogen from wastewater by willows e g 150 kg n v the 60 kg n calculated by our method while underestimating uptake of nitrogen by other plants e g 0 kg n due to insignificant changes in the n of composite biomass samples during the monitoring period v 90 kg n by our method despite yielding a similar estimate of uptake over the entire pilot system e g 8 the amount of wastewater derived nitrogen taken up by plants only represented a fraction of their total nitrogen requirements of the 1100 kg n taken up by plants during the monitoring period 980 kg n came from the soil on the basis of the nitrogen content of the soil at the start of this study i e approximately 0 15 of the soil or 10 000 kg n and measured nitrogen removal rates we estimate that this rate of extraction would only be sustainable for approximately 10 years assuming that all of the soil nitrogen was accessible and none of the plant biomass nitrogen was returned to the soil however a large fraction of the nitrogen taken up into plants was deposited as residues annually for example although above ground standing biomass in the wet meadow cells peaked on average at 1 4 kg dw m 2 in 2019 the total biomass produced during that year was 6 2 kg dw m 2 roughly 80 of the produced biomass deposited onto the wetland surface or was consumed by organisms if the nitrogen stored within those residues was released through decomposition and became available to plants to support subsequent growth soils could supply sufficient nitrogen for plant growth for nearly 120 years without nitrogen inputs from other sources this is more consistent with the nitrogen budgets of natural wetlands in which internal cycling frequently satisfies the majority plant nitrogen demands bowden 1987 bowden et al 1991 3 3 1 variations in plant uptake rates the amount of wastewater derived nitrate removed through plant uptake increased throughout the monitoring period varied seasonally and among cell types and decreased with distance along the wetland uptake rates were on average 29 higher in the second year of monitoring 6 2018 6 2019 compared to the first 6 2017 6 2018 for example average uptake rates per cell were 30 g n d 1 8 of applied nitrogen in the spring of 2018 3 2018 6 2018 versus 46 g n d 1in the spring of 2019 3 2019 6 2019 moreover the fraction of wastewater n removed by plant uptake was nearly three times higher in the spring of 2019 23 of removal than in the preceding spring 8 of removal this was partly due to lower mass loading rates of wastewater nitrogen in 2019 which were 50 lower than the preceding year and also due to higher biomass production which more than doubled between 2017 and 2019 as plants matured there were also clear seasonal trends in both plant uptake and the fraction of wastewater nitrogen removed by uptake fig 4 which were both highest in the spring when plant growth was the greatest and lowest in the fall when plants were senescing removal of applied wastewater nitrate via plant uptake per cell was significantly p 0 001 one tailed paired t test greater for cells planted with willows i e 23 g n d 1 than for cells dominanted by wet weadow i e 13 g n d 1 fig 4b despite lower primary production rates in willow cells the extensive rooting zones of willows likely gave them greater access than other plants to wastewater nitrate that flowed primarily in the deeper subsurface layers cecchetti et al 2020a additionally as mentioned previously the majority of nitrogen was removed at the beginning of the slope cecchetti et al 2020a our mixing model indicated that of the 150 kg of nitrogen removed via plant uptake 63 97 kg n was taken up by plants within the first third 15 m of the slope with 45 70 kg n removed by plants in the first 2 m alone these uptake trends were consistent across cells throughout the monitoring period 3 4 implications for horizontal levee design there are a variety of design features that could be incorporated into horizontal levees to optimize both nutrient removal and plant uptake of nitrogen in the pilot scale horizontal levee the majority of applied nitrogen 96 was removed at the beginning of the wetland before wastewater effluent came into contact with the plants that occupied the remaining 90 of the levee slope if cells were constructed to increase contact of wastewater nitrogen with plant roots along the entire horizontal levee the fraction of wastewater nitrogen taken up by plants could increase substantially some of the design features proposed previously for optimizing hydraulics cecchetti et al 2020a such as using granular media with a higher hydraulic conductivity could also increase contact of wastewater nitrate with plant roots by spreading nitrate from wastewater throughout the subsurface however rapid denitrification rates still might limit plant uptake alternatively designers could consider using multiple water inlet points with subsurface piping manifolds located at regular intervals along the slope to increase the fraction of wastewater nitrogen taken up by biomass despite significant denitrification rates this design feature would increase average subsurface nitrate concentrations further along the slope increasing the potential for plant uptake in portions of horizontal levees that would not be exposed to wastewater nitrogen loads in systems with a single inlet ideally these manifolds would be spaced every 10 20 m to achieve the greatest possible contact between wastewater nitrogen and plant roots other applications such as batch application of wastewater or systems relying on percolation via surface application of water may also be useful in increasing plant uptake of effluent nitrogen additionally past research has shown that willows increase the subsurface flow capacity of horizontal levees which could increase the mass of solutes removed by uptake cecchetti et al 2020a when combined with our findings that willows have higher nitrogen uptake rates than other wetland plants it is clear that willows have a significant capacity to promote nitrogen removal in horizontal levees through multiple mechanisms it is important to note that nitrogen uptake into plant biomass constitutes a storage mechanism rather than a permanent sink however it is likely that the release of nitrogen into the subsurface from decaying plant residues will either be 1 taken up by plants again or 2 denitrified by microorganisms using organic carbon from plant residues as an electron donor before nitrogen leaves in the system effluent for example if just 10 of the approximately 18 000 kg yr 1 of organic carbon from plant biomass decomposed each year a conservative estimate based on reported litter decomposition rates aké castillo et al 2006 review of past studies this additional input of organic carbon would be sufficient to denitrify 1600 kg n yr 1 which is greater than annual uptake of nitrogen from all sources in this system and more than 10 times the amount of nitrogen taken up from wastewater alone 150 kg n a discussion of the relative importance of denitrification and other microbial nitrogen removal mechanisms as well as the biogeochemical cycling of other redox active species in horizontal levees is provided elsewhere cecchetti et al in prep 4 conclusions in this study isotope fingerprinting and mixing models were used to evaluate the uptake of nitrogen in a horizontal levee a new nature based system for improving water quality which also protects coastal infrastructure from the effects of sea level rise our findings indicate that plant uptake can be responsible for removal of a significant fraction of nitrogen entering the system with more than 20 of nitrogen removed by plant uptake in the spring of 2019 the exact mechanisms by which the remainder of nitrogen was removed is still unknown however on the basis of site biogeochemistry cecchetti et al in prep and isotope fractionation observed in porewater in the first 5 m of the system it appears that a majority of this remaining nitrogen was removed by microbial denitrification the new isotope methods detailed in this study are promising techniques for quantifying plant uptake of wastewater derived nitrogen in natural treatment systems mixing models based on isotope fingerprinting provide a more robust means of measuring plant uptake because they do not rely on assumptions that were necessary in previous methods isotope methods can improve understanding of nitrogen uptake mechanisms and resolve the wide discrepancies in reported values of nitrogen uptake by plants in other nature based treatment systems more precise estimation of the relative contribution of plant uptake to nitrogen removal is important in multi benefit treatment systems because it can help designers to prioritize objectives for example if plant uptake were found to be insignificant designers could consider objectives related to habitat creation and planting regimes separately from water quality improvement objectives additionally our results demonstrate that willows have a significant capacity through multiple mechanisms to promote nitrogen removal in horizontal levees finally although plant uptake constitutes a storage mechanism rather than an ultimate removal in systems like the horizontal levee i e where plants are not harvested and removed labile organic carbon inputs from decaying biomass appear to be sufficient to denitrify the amount of nitrogen reintegrated in the subsurface from senesced biomass author statements aidan cecchetti conceptualization methodology

byproducts dbps in tertiary filtered wastewater before and after pilot scale granular activated carbon gac adsorption using breakthrough of precursor concentration and of concentration associated calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity by correlating known lethal concentrations reported elsewhere the performance of three parallel gac treatment trains were compared against tertiary filtered wastewater ozone gac chlorine gac and gac alone results show gac alone was the primary process versus ozone or chlorine alone to remove the largest fraction of total chlorine and chloramine reactive dbp precursors and calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity potencies gac with pre ozonation removed the most chlorine and chloramine reactive dbp precursors followed by gac with pre chlorination and lastly gac without pre treatment gac with pre ozonation produced an effluent with cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of dbps from fp that generally matched that of gac without pre oxidation meanwhile removal of toxicity was greater by gac with pre chlorination the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of dbps from fp tests did not scale with dbp concentration for example more than 90 of the calculated cytotoxicity resulted from 20 of the dbps principally from haloacetaldehydes haloacetamides and haloacetonitriles the calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity from dbps associated with fp chloramination were at times higher than with fp chlorination though the concentration of dbps was five times higher with fp chlorination the removal of dbp precursors using gac based treatment was at least as effective as removal of doc except for halonitromethanes for gac without pre oxidation and with pre chlorination indicating doc can be used as an indicator for dbp precursor adsorption efficacy however the doc was not a good surrogate for total cytotoxicity and genotoxicity breakthrough behavior therefore unregulated dbps could have negative health implications that are disconnected from general water quality parameters such as doc and regulated classes of dbps instead cytotoxicity and genotoxicity correlate with the concentration of specific classes of unregulated dbps graphical

five halonitromethanes hnms and seven haloacetaldehydes hals in addition to the regulated trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas in surface water and wastewater effluent treated with gac they determined that gac was not effective at reducing the calculated genotoxic potencies of unregulated dbps produced by chlorination of water containing high levels of bromide and dissolved organic nitrogen calculated genotoxic potency was calculated by multiplying the concentration of a specific disinfection byproduct with its reported 50 tail dna values from genomic dna damage assays wagner and plewa 2017 an approach for controlling dbp concentration in the plant effluent is the use of upstream oxidation to form dbps and oxidize dbp precursors followed by gac adsorption of the preformed dbps and remaining dbp precursors ozone followed by gac can more efficiently remove regulated dbp precursors than gac alone liu et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 demonstrated that total organic halogen thms and haas concentrations and developmental toxicity were lower in effluents when chlorination preceded gac as opposed to after gac for drinking water they also observed lower aromatic halogenated dbps when pre chlorination was used however another study showed that thms and haas chlorination precursors broke through gac faster than doc babi et al 2007 pre chlorination has recently been shown to enhance the efficacy of gac for controlling thms fischer et al 2019 however the impact of pre oxidation on gac performance for controlling dbps both regulated and nonregulated has not been evaluated for potable reuse in which the bromide and nitrogen rich organic matter levels are much higher besides adsorption biological activity on gac can achieve microbial mediated degradation for efficient and consistent dbp precursor removal liu et al 2017 a few studies at pilot scale have focused on biofiltration that employed biologically activated carbon bac along with pre ozonation for drinking water liu et al 2017 without pre ozonation for drinking water fu et al 2017 and pre ozonation for treated wastewater chuang and mitch 2017 for attenuating regulated and unregulated dbps and their

dechlorination by gaccl2 occurred as follows chlorine residual decreased from 0 5 to 0 2 mg cl2 l in the first 15 cm of column and from 0 2 to 0 02 mg cl2 l detection limit after an additional 40 6 cm of column chlorine exposure of 11 mg min l was determined by calculating the area under the curve of a chlorine decay time series fig s1b when the dose was 3 mg cl2 l all three columns operated at a 4

hydrodarco 3000 gac has a manufacturer reported particle size of 10 outside of 8 30 mesh iodine of 650 mg g and molasses of 450 additionally the gac has been previously characterized for specific surface area 676 m2 g and pore volume 0 711 cm3 g hanigan et al 2012 the pilot plant operated continuously from june 2016 to december 2016 7 month period maintenance shutdowns occurred at least weekly or as needed for backwashing of the gac columns backwashing was done concurrently on all columns to prevent excessive head loss i e 0 6 bar of pressure and used raw water at a flow rate of 11 l min 37 m h loading rate for a total duration of 15 min the six sampling locations included pilot plant influent pre ozonated pre chlorinated gacraw effluent gaco3 effluent and gaccl2 effluent throughput was calculated by dividing the volume of treated water by the volume occupied by the gac because columns did not have matching throughputs as a function of operating time due to irregular maintenance shutdowns each of the three sets of samples that were taken on the same day corresponded to different throughputs an additional column operated in parallel and was filled with biological activated carbon bac 10 year old exhausted gac with an attached active biofilm to serve as a control for biological performance the bac column received raw water for the first half of the 7 month period and pre ozonated water for the second half to serve as a control for both gacraw and gaco3 this control column operated at an ebct of 10 min but at a slightly reduced flowrate of 2 65 l min 2 2 sample collection and processing samples for ambient dbps bulk parameters and dbp precursors were collected every 2 weeks at the beginning of the project and gradually limited to once every month bromate was analyzed in the raw water and before and after gaco3 only bromate was not expected to form during chlorination and was not measured fang et al 2014 also selected bulk parameters that are known

chlorination or chloramination distribution conditions ndma ufc chloramination experiments were conducted according to previous studies by shah and mitch 2012b and zeng and mitch 2015 and thm and haa ufc chlorination experiments were conducted according to summers et al 1996 briefly to determine ufc chloramination ph controlled at ph 8 with borate buffer water samples were reacted with enough chloramine to result in at least 1 0 mg cl2 l residual after 3 days of reaction similarly for ufc chlorination ph controlled at ph 8 using borate buffer water samples were reacted with enough chlorine to give a residual of 1 0 0 4 mg cl2 l after 24 h as reported above quenching was dbp specific ambient dbps those that were pre formed during pilot treatment and were present in the samples before ufc

bromine substitution factor the lethal concentrations lcs of various types of dbps including thms haas hnms hams hans hals and ndma in chinese hamster ovary cells cho wagner and plewa 2017 were used to calculate cytotoxicity associated with the dbp fp as reported in various studies allard et al 2015 chuang and mitch 2017 krasner et al 2016 plewa et al 2017 smith et al 2010 the calculation involved dividing the dbp molar concentration by its lc at which 50 of the cho cells were killed lc50 in m it should be noted that hks and tribromoacetonitrile were not included in these calculations as their cho cytotoxicities have not yet been reported similarly the genotoxic contributions of various dbps were calculated similarly using reported 50 tail dna values in m from cho single cell gel electrophoresis acute genomic dna damage assays wagner and plewa 2017 with the assumption that genotoxicity and cytotoxicity is additive total toxicity was calculated by adding together the calculated toxicity of individual dbp species it is noted this toxicity calculation approach might be limited by not considering synergistic effects differences between human and animal cells and association with human health risk mckenna et al 2019 though lau et al 2020 validated using the sum of cytotoxic potency weighted dbp concentrations as an estimate of the cho cell cytotoxicity associated with known dbps in real disinfected waters including potable reuse waters this approach is useful to identify dbps for additional toxicity testing and potential trade offs in treatment the bromine substitution factor bsf was calculated as reported in hua and reckhow 2012 where the scale for bsfs ranged from 0 fully chlorinated to 1 fully brominated for all dbp classes so that comparisons can be made within classes of mono di and tri halogenated dbps see equation s1 in the si bsf was only calculated for dbp classes for which all chlorinated and brominated analogues were measured i e tri hals tri hams tri hnms thm4 di hals di hams and di hnms 3 results and discussion 3 1 bromate figure s2 shows bromate as a function of throughput in bed volumes bvs during ozonation and gac the raw water had low but detectable levels of bromate 4 3 μg l bromate formed at an average of 26 μg l due to the reaction of 153 μg l of bromide with 0 8 mg o3 mg doc of ozone a 10 molar yield relative to bromide only a single observation at the start of the run 450 bvs suggested removal of about 28 of bromate with gac while gac had been determined to be effective at removing bromate in pristine waters the presence of organic matter greatly inhibits bromate adsorption kirisits et al 2000 therefore it is unsurprising that bromate was poorly removed by gac in treated wastewater containing 5 mg l of doc table 1 see additional discussion on bulk parameters in the si bromate mitigation strategies e g ph depression ammonia chloramines and hydrogen peroxide involving bromide sequestration or manipulating the ozone hydroxyl radical pathways have been studied for decades in drinking water applications buffle et al 2004 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 and wert et al 2007 however these bromate mitigation strategies have only been limitedly studied in wastewater matrices soltermann et al 2017 which generally have much higher ozone demand 3 2 thm4 and haa5 3 2 1 gac treatment of prechlorine formed thms and haas ambient concentrations of thm4 and haa5 are shown in fig s3 a and b respectively the concentration of thms in the raw water was low 0 6 0 1 μg l of thm4 n 10 and below the mrl for haa5 1 μg l table s6 thms and haas were formed during pilot pre chlorination generating an average 9 μg l of each thm4 n 3 and haa5 n 3 when 1 mg cl2 l dose was used for pre chlorination 0 1540 bvs and 24 3 μg l of thm4 n 6 and 16 5 μg l of haa5 n 7 when 3 mg cl2 l dose was used 1540 bvs complete removal of thm4 by gaccl2 was observed in the beginning 2000 bvs and less removal occurred with increasing throughput indicative of breakthrough thm4 breakthrough of 50 occurred at 3000 bvs fig s3 compared to 2200 bvs for bulk doc table 1 see additional discussion on bulk parameters in the si after 5000 bvs the concentration of thms in the effluent was greater than in the influent which is a behavior that has been observed in other gac studies babi et al 2007 this behavior suggests that adsorbed thms were either displaced and desorbing in exchange with more favorably adsorbing compounds formed chemically from chlorine reacting with adsorbed organic matter on gac during dechlorination or via a decarboxylation process that converts haas to thms zhang and minear 2002 or some combination of the three gaccl2 removed ambient haa5 completely during the initial stages of the pilot bvs 2000 and only allowed as much as 1 6 μg l of haa5 during 4000 to 8000 bvs into the effluent before haa5 was removed to below their mrls after 10 000 bvs fig s3b likely due to biological degradation babi et al 2007 kim and kang 2008 3 2 2 preozone gac treatment of fp chlorine reactive precursors molar concentrations of thm4 and haa5 precursors determined after fp cl in gac influent samples are presented in fig s4 pre ozonation slightly reduced thm4 fp cl and haa5 fp cl in the influent stream 11 and 20 removal average respectively indicating that the reaction with ozone reduced the total number of precursors through oxidation and transformation to lower molecular weight compounds consistent with previous work amy et al 1991 de vera et al 2015 deeudomwongsa et al 2017 showed that thm formation was reduced not from direct reaction of precursors with ozone but from the reaction with hydroxyl radicals as in o3 h2o2 in drinking water which can be generated from the reaction of ozone and natural organic matter while in the same study deeudomwongsa et al 2017 the authors showed haa5 formation was promoted via ozone oxidation other studies reported similar findings to those reported herein in that haa precursors were removed during ozonation de vera et al 2015 gaco3 had a small but noticeable improvement to breakthrough of haa5 precursors during higher throughputs compared to other gac processes which could be linked to the reduced concentration of haa5 precursors in the influent shown in table 1 and fig s4 for thm4 precursors gaco3 showed similar breakthrough performance compared to the other two gac processes 3 2 3 prechlorine gac treatment of fp chlorine reactive precursors pre chlorination was expected to reduce thm4 fp cl by converting thm precursors into ambient thms or intermediate chlorinated aromatic products prior to gac jiang et al 2017 while a 6 and 7 transformation of precursors to ambient thm4 and haa5 occurred respectively it did not play any appreciable role in subsequent gac treatment rather all gac columns pre oxidation or not reduced thm4 and haa5 fp cl to a similar degree it is likely that the chlorine exposure during pilot pre chlorination was not enough 11 mgcl2 min l compared to 100 mgcl2 min l in jiang et al 2017 to influence gac performance for removal of thm4 fp cl further information on the individual species of thm4 and haa5 fp cl in gac effluents is provided in the thm4 and haa5 section in the support information si document 3 2 4 preoxidation gac treatment of ufc chlorine reactive precursors ufc experiments were conducted on gac effluent samples to determine dbp formation under chlorine exposures representative of conventional disinfection and distribution results of ufc experiments are shown in fig 1 and compared with doc breakthrough concentrations distinguishable from the literature fischer et al 2019 all three gac pilots performed similarly with breakthroughs to the u s epa mcl regulatory limits 80 μg l for thm4 and 60 μg l for haa5 occurring at 3000 bvs for thm4 ufc cl but never captured for haa5 suggesting breakthrough 18 000 bvs gaco3 effluent stabilized at the lowest thm4 ufc cl at most 25 lower than gacraw effluent and haa5 ufc cl at most 40 lower than gacraw effluent in practice this wastewater could be subjected to blending prior to introducing it to drinking water distribution systems and could result in a substantially lower level of regulated dbp formation 3 3 ndma 3 3 1 gac treatment of ozone formed ndma ambient ndma concentration as a function of throughput is shown in fig s5 the ambient ndma concentration increased from 3 0 0 5 ng l n 6 raw to 17 3 ng l n 11 gaco3 influent during ozonation taking the concentration above the california environmental protection agency ca epa notification level nl of 10 ng l subsequent gaco3 filtration removed 59 of ndma to produce an effluent with 7 3 ng l n 11 of ndma on average with only one sample above the ca epa nl gac adsorption of ndma has been previously proven to be an ineffective mitigation technique due to the hydrophilic nature of ndma mitch et al 2003 however the removal of ndma with gaco3 increased as throughput increased from 32 to 78 ndma removal in the span of 5 months 20 000 bvs likely due to increase in biological degradation chuang and mitch 2017 gerrity et al 2015 zeng et al 2016 3 3 2 ozone treatment of fp chloramine reactive precursors concentrations of ndma chloramine reactive precursors fp clm through pre oxidation and gac treatment are shown in fig s6 pilot pre chlorination and pre ozonation removed a large component of the total amount of ndma fp clm from the influent 56 and 88 respectively pre ozonation formed 14 ng l of ndma and removed 486 ng l on average of ndma fp clm 35 ng of precursors destroyed per 1 ng of ndma formed this reinforces that ozone reactive ndma precursors are distinctive from those reactive towards monochloramine farré et al 2011 marti et al 2015 pisarenko et al 2012 meanwhile pre chlorination did not form ndma 3 3 3 preoxidation gac treatment of fp chloramine reactive precursors the removal of ndma fp clm by gacraw and gaco3 approached steady state values of 80 and 50 respectively indicating biodegradation of precursors while gaccl2 removal efficiency decreased with time indicating adsorption breakthrough fig s6 considering oxidation and sorption together the ndma fp clm of gaco3 effluent was lowest stabilizing at 36 7 ng l compared to gacraw and gaccl2 effluents with values of 100 ng l each as shown in fig s6 the removal of ndma fp clm during gacraw exceeded that of doc and uva254 as determined from a comparison of the results shown in figs s6 and s7 this relatively high performance is likely associated with the trace contaminants e g ranitidine diphenhydramine and tetracycline which are ndma precursors and are removed effectively with gac hanigan et al 2012 marti et al 2017 mulhern et al 2017 3 3 4 preoxidation gac treatment of ufc chloramine reactive precursors using ufc conditions we determined that ndma ufc clm was considerably lower in gaco3 effluent than in the effluent of the other two gacs fig 2 unfortunately ndma ufc clm still measured above the ca epa nl of 10 ng l for all gacs throughout the full length of the run however because ndma in gaco3 effluent was only 1 6 times the nl blending with another source water could be done to meet compliance ndma ufc clm for gaccl2 effluent was lower than gacraw effluent throughout most of the column run but their difference can be deemed insignificant since it was less than the variability due to error the breakthrough of ndma ufc clm during gaco3 occurred quickly and could not be captured because most precursors that remained after pre ozonation were recalcitrant towards gac adsorption 3 4 other unregulated dbps 3 4 1 influent fp chloramine and chlorine reactive precursors the molar sums of regulated and unregulated dbps formed during fp conditions with chlorine and chloramine are shown in fig 3 a and b respectively more species of unregulated dbps formed from fp with chloramine compared to chlorine table s6 for example unlike unregulated dbps formed with fp cl fp clm produced diiodoacetamide diam dichloroacetonitrile dcan and tcal in appreciable amounts between 10 and 25 μg l in influent samples also the total concentration of ham fp clm 173 15 nm was greater than ham fp cl 38 32 nm the major classes of dbps formed during fp cl were thm4 haa5 and hals fig 3 matching the order of what has been observed for other water sources chuang and mitch 2017 fu et al 2017 krasner et al 2006 3 4 2 preoxidation of fp chlorine reactive precursors pre ozonation produced hal 32 18 hk 36 29 and hnm 610 200 and removed han 25 12 chlorine reactive precursors while pre oxidation did not alter the total concentration of total fp cl table 1 removal it did systematically change the concentration of certain unregulated dbp chlorine reactive precursors it was thought based on the thm4 and haa5 fp cl data as well as data from unregulated dbps that the pre chlorination dose was not sufficiently high to alter the precursors prior to fp cl experiments however it did increase the concentration of hal han and hk fp clm by 55 19 36 17 36 12 respectively 3 4 3 preoxidation of fp chloramine reactive precursors pre ozonation increased hal 90 86 hk 44 24 and hnm 175 68 and removed han 53 15 chloramine reactive precursors ham precursors were neither formed nor removed during pre ozonation because ozonation can produce low molecular weight aldehydes and ketones hal and hk precursors increased during ozonation de vera et al 2015 richardson et al 1999 weinberg et al 1993 also hnm precursors increased after ozonation because they have an oxidized n functional group nitro that can form from the reaction of amines particularly secondary amines with ozone mccurry et al 2016 furthermore both ham and han precursors are likely oxidized to form hnm precursors since the nitrogen moiety on both ham and han precursors are susceptible to ozone oxidation de vera et al 2015 3 4 4 gac treatment of fp chloramine and chlorine reactive precursors after gac adsorption unregulated dbp fp with cl and clm in the gac effluent approached that of the influent with increasing throughput indicative of adsorption breakthrough see fig s8 for normalized concentration as a function of throughput throughput estimated using linear interpolation at 50 breakthrough is shown in table 1 and compared in fig s9 breakthrough of chlorine reactive precursors through gacraw was in the order of hnms doc thm4 hams hans uva254 hks haa5 hals chloramine reactive precursors followed a distinctive removal pattern with breakthrough in the order of hnms doc uva254 hals hans hams hks ndma 3 4 5 preoxidation gac treatment fp chloramine and chlorine reactive precursors pre oxidation with chlorine and ozone impacted the breakthrough of precursors pre chlorination delayed the gac breakthrough of hal han ham and hk chloramine reactive precursors fp clm but increased chlorine reactive hal precursors fp cl table 1 fig s9 though hal han and hk chloramine reactive precursors increased after pre chlorination table 1 the formed precursors were more adsorbable than those in the raw water as was deduced from the observation of breakthrough of gaccl2 compared to gacraw though ham fp clm did not change during pre chlorination the chemical nature of these precursors was altered during pre chlorination since again they were more susceptible to gac adsorption than in their raw form pre ozonation delayed the gac breakthrough of hnm han and hal fp cl and hnm hal hk fp clm table 1 because ozonation increased hnm fp and hk fp cl and clm their presence was higher in the effluent of gaco3 compared to gacraw and gaccl2 still the combined process of o3 gac produced an effluent with the lowest total dbp precursor levels fig 3 compared to cl2 gac and raw gac the order of breakthrough for each individual class of dbp contrasted with reported removals from pre ozonated biofiltration that used gac media in wastewater chuang and mitch 2017 and drinking water de vera et al 2016 fu et al 2017 for example gac with pre ozonation followed breakthrough performance table 1 in the order hnms hals haa5 hans hks hams thms while chuang and mitch 2017 reported biofiltration removals in the order hnms hams hals hks thms haas though thm4 and haa5 are commonly used as surrogates for dbp formation a lack of correlation between regulated and unregulated dbps has been reported in wastewater effluents krasner et al 2009 here we demonstrated that gac adsorption does not remove all classes of dbp precursors by the same degree rather all unregulated dbp classes with the exception of hnms were removed more effectively table 1 than thms and doc in wastewater precursors containing nitrogen are highly abundant chen et al 2011 as a result there is increased likelihood to form hnms during chlorination and chloramination in treated wastewater although hnm fp cl increased with pre ozonation the ozone produced hnm precursors were highly adsorbable by gac in fact hnm fp cl in the effluent of gaco3 resembled that of gaccl2 and gacraw see fig s10 for a comparison of dbps that were limitedly formed 1 μm the bromine substitution factor bsf for dbp fp is shown in fig s11 the aggregated average bsf was higher after gac treatment compared to the influent as expected due to removal of doc and no removal of bromide ion i e increased br to doc ratio this increase in bsf was more noticeable for fp clm fig s11b than for fp cl and for raw gac and o3 gac than for cl2 gac for raw pilot influent trihalonitromethane fp cl and clm had the highest bsf compared to other dbp classes 3 5 estimated toxicity of dbps because the calculated toxicity corresponds to dbps formed during much higher oxidant exposures i e fp than what is typical for water treatment disinfection e g ufc calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were used only to indicate relative performance of gac adsorbents 3 5 1 influent cytotoxicity from fp chloramine and chlorine reactive precursors the calculated cytotoxicity associated with dbps formed during fp cl and clm are displayed in fig 4 a and b respectively the calculated cytotoxicity of the nine classes of dbps according to their concentrations after fp cl and cytotoxic potencies wagner and plewa 2017 were consistent across throughput and rank in the order of i thms i haas thms haas hams hnms hals hans with hks tribromoacetonitrile and ndma not determined in the raw tertiary filtered wastewater calculated cytotoxicity of dbps formed after fp clm in raw tertiary filtered wastewater were not consistent across throughput but rank in the order of i thms ndma i haas hnms hams hans hals based on averages the calculated cytotoxicity induced by the dbps formed in fp experiments is drastically different from their molar concentrations i e compared to fig 3a the two dominating classes of dbps on a molar basis in the raw tertiary filtered wastewater formed after fp cl thm4 and haa5 were 80 of the total concentration but represented less than 5 of the total summed calculated cytotoxicity see fig 4 rather more than 90 of the calculated cytotoxicity was due to hals hnms hams and hans which accounted for 20 of the total molar concentration similarly krasner et al 2016 found hans and hnms contributed the most to the overall calculated cytotoxicity in a bench scale study even though their concentrations were limited compared to regulated dbps 3 5 2 influent genotoxicity from fp chloramine and chlorine reactive precursors the calculated genotoxicity of dbps formed during fp cl and clm are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively the calculated genotoxicity of the six classes of dbps according to their concentrations after fp cl were not consistent across throughput but ranked in the order of i thm i haas haas hals hams hans hnms with hks thms and ndma not determined based on averages in the raw tertiary filtered wastewater calculated genotoxicity after fp clm were not consistent across throughput and ranked in the order of ndma i haas hans hals hams hnms based on averages specifically the calculated genotoxicity associated with hnms after fp cl was 43 of the total of the six species for which genotoxicity was available though it only amounted to 13 in terms of concentration meanwhile haa5 after fp cl accounted for 65 of the sum concentration of the six genotoxic dbp species yet were less than 2 of the total calculated genotoxicity 3 5 3 gac treatment of toxicity from fp chloramine and chlorine reactive precursors doc breakthrough behavior followed more closely with total dbp fp cl molar concentrations than with total calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity as shown in fig s12 for example in the beginning of the breakthrough curve in fig s12 calculated cytotoxicity underwent 40 breakthrough by the first sampling campaign 1000 bvs whereas 20 breakthrough occurred for doc it was found that hal and hnm after fp cl were responsible for the fast cytotoxicity breakthrough since both were not mitigated during gac in the first sampling campaign see fig s13 therefore unregulated dbps could have negative health implications that are disconnected from general water quality parameters such as doc and regulated classes of dbps this was also found true in studies assessing calculated cytotoxicity in other treated wastewaters and in drinking waters chuang and mitch 2017 plewa et al 2017 the removal of calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity was lower for all throughputs than the removal of molar concentrations because there was higher calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity from the more gac recalcitrant set of precursors e g hnm ham and han precursors when compared to those that are found at high concentration and are removed effectively e g hal and haa5 precursors see figs 4 and 5 3 5 4 preoxidation gac treatment of toxicity from fp chloramine and chlorine reactive precursors pre ozonation increased the total calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of dbps formed after fp cl and clm primarily due to the increases in hnm precursors but it also had a synergistic effect with gac where gaco3 removed hnms to a greater degree when compared to gacraw pre chlorination was not consistent in the effect it had on cytotoxicity and genotoxicity but it did consistently yield a gaccl2 effluent with lower calculated toxicity than gacraw effluent while pre chlorination has been shown to improve dbp attenuation during gac jiang et al 2017 improving toxicity without notable reduction in total concentration is unique to this study in the first two sets of samples 363 450 and 5100 6700 bvs the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity calculated from dbps formed during fp clm was higher than from fp cl though the concentration of dbps was five times higher for fp cl figs 4 and 5 respectively this was contrasting to studies with a similar cytotoxicity calculation approach chuang and mitch 2017 zeng et al 2016 chuang and mitch 2017 found chloramination under simulated distribution system conditions comparable to ufc herein produced lower calculated cytotoxicity 3 80 fold compared to chlorination in treated municipal wastewater before and after ozone and biofiltration in this study the calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were higher for chloramination formed dbps because of the unique oxidation conditions for example we observed formation of dichloroacetamide which is orders of magnitude more toxic e g cytotoxicity of dichloroacetamide lc50 1 9 10 6 m than those that are more prominent such as thms and haas e g cytotoxicity of chloroform lc50 9 2 10 3 m richardson et al 2008 wagner and plewa 2017 the calculated cytotoxicity was drastically lower during the last sampling 18 400 21 000 bvs of fp clm even though the total concentration of dbp fp clm was not considerably reduced this occurred because highly cytotoxic chloroacetaldehyde cytotoxicity of chloroacetaldehyde lc50 3 6 10 6 m and dibromoacetaldehyde cytotoxicity of dibromoacetaldehyde lc50 4 4 10 6 m jeong et al 2015 were below detection in the final round of samples though they were the primary source of calculated cytotoxicity in the tens of nm for the first two sample campaigns 4 conclusions this study measured chlorine and chloramine reactive dbp precursors of nine regulated and 57 unregulated dbps in tertiary treated wastewater before and after treatment with pilot scale pre oxidation followed by gac adsorption these results indicate gac employed in a potable reuse application has the potential to reduce chlorine and chloramine reactive dbp precursors compared to no gac application also gac employed with pre ozonation can produce an effluent with lower haa5 ufc thm4 ufc ndma ufc and the sum of regulated and emerging dbp precursors under fp cl and clm than gac with pre chlorination gac with pre chlorination produced an effluent with less sum of regulated and emerging dbp precursors under fp cl than without pretreatment however bromate mitigation strategies are likely warranted when gac with pre ozone is used to treat wastewater though dbp precursors under fp conditions can be reduced to a greater extent by gac with pre oxidation when compared to gac with no pre oxidation gac with pre ozonation can potentially produce an effluent with calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity that are similar to gac with no pre oxidation while gac with pre chlorination can potentially yield an effluent with the lowest calculated toxicity caution is warranted if chloramines alone are to be used post disinfection since chloramines can potentially produce more species of unregulated dbps and the calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity from dbps formed during fp clm can be potentially higher than from fp cl even though the concentration of dbps can be five times higher for fp cl this study suggests that doc can be used as an indicator for dbp treatment efficacy however the doc breakthrough behavior did not correlate with the total sum of calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity therefore for potable reuse applications unregulated dbps could have negative health implications that are disconnected from doc and regulated classes of dbps which could be verified under simulated disinfection conditions declaration of competing interest

19986,this study measured chlorine and chloramine reactive precursors using formation potential fp tests of nine u s environmental protection agency epa regulated and 57 unregulated disinfection byproducts dbps in tertiary filtered wastewater before and after pilot scale granular activated carbon gac adsorption using breakthrough of precursor concentration and of concentration associated calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity by correlating known lethal concentrations reported elsewhere the performance of three parallel gac treatment trains were compared against tertiary filtered wastewater ozone gac chlorine gac and gac alone results show gac alone was the primary process versus ozone or chlorine alone to remove the largest fraction of total chlorine and chloramine reactive dbp precursors and calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity potencies gac with pre ozonation removed the most chlorine and chloramine reactive dbp precursors followed by gac with pre chlorination and lastly gac without pre treatment gac with pre ozonation produced an effluent with cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of dbps from fp that generally matched that of gac without pre oxidation meanwhile removal of toxicity was greater by gac with pre chlorination the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of dbps from fp tests did not scale with dbp concentration for example more than 90 of the calculated cytotoxicity resulted from 20 of the dbps principally from haloacetaldehydes haloacetamides and haloacetonitriles the calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity from dbps associated with fp chloramination were at times higher than with fp chlorination though the concentration of dbps was five times higher with fp chlorination the removal of dbp precursors using gac based treatment was at least as effective as removal of doc except for halonitromethanes for gac without pre oxidation and with pre chlorination indicating doc can be used as an indicator for dbp precursor adsorption efficacy however the doc was not a good surrogate for total cytotoxicity and genotoxicity breakthrough behavior therefore unregulated dbps could have negative health implications that are disconnected from general water quality parameters such as doc and regulated classes of dbps instead cytotoxicity and genotoxicity correlate with the concentration of specific classes of unregulated dbps graphical abstract image 1 keywords granular activated carbon adsorption chlorine and chloramine disinfection byproducts potable reuse preoxidation cytotoxicity genotoxicity 1 introduction disinfection with chemical oxidants has been used to combat waterborne diseases since the late 19th century crittenden et al 2012 however the uses of chemical oxidants such as chlorine has led to an unintended health hazard through the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps richardson 2011 richardson et al 2007 while the u s environmental protection agency epa currently regulates 11 dbps four trihalomethanes thm4 five haloacetic acids haa5 bromate and chlorite usepa 2019 research has shown that there are over 600 dbps that have the potential to cause adverse health effects in humans richardson 2011 chemical disinfectants react with background organic matter and halides i e bromide and iodide that are ubiquitously present in natural and waste waters to form halogenated dbps richardson and postigo 2015 nitrogen containing organic matter such as proteinaceous material associated with wastewater effluent and nitrogen containing disinfectants like chloramine can serve as precursors for nitrogenous dbps schreiber and mitch 2006 shah and mitch 2012a controlling dbp formation may be one of the design and operation constraints for adoption of potable reuse treatment technologies usepa 2012 arnold et al 2018 so a deeper understanding of their behavior through treatment is critical adsorption with granular activated carbon gac has been extensively studied in drinking water treatment applications for the removal of organic substances including organic matter roberts and summers 1982 regulated dbp precursors glaze and wallace 1984 rodriguez fuentes et al 2005 singer 1999 and micropollutants corwin and summers 2012 however limited research has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of gac for the removal of regulated and especially unregulated dbp precursors in treated wastewaters under potable reuse conditions recent studies regarding the treatment of regulated and emerging dbp precursors using gac have focused on drinking water applications cuthbertson et al 2019 2020 most potable reuse pertaining research on controlling unregulated dbps with gac has focused on nitrosamines e g n nitrosodimethylamine ndma and their precursors gerrity et al 2015 sgroi et al 2018 zeng et al 2016 some wastewater derived ndma precursors are removed better by gac than bulk organic matter including dissolved organic carbon doc and ultraviolet absorbing organics hanigan et al 2012 mulhern et al 2017 additionally ndma precursor removal by gac adsorption resembles that of micropollutant adsorption mulhern et al 2017 a set of pharmaceuticals has been discovered that generates ndma upon chloramination hanigan et al 2015 le roux et al 2011 shen and andrews 2013 these involve compounds with tertiary amines such as ranitidine ndma precursors chloramine reactive are also destroyed effectively via ozonation pisarenko et al 2012 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 meanwhile pre formed ndma is highly hydrophilic and therefore poorly adsorbed by gac fleming et al 1996 when it comes to the effect of gac treatment on the formation of other carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbps of concern research is much more limited krasner et al 2016 tested the formation of six haloacetonitriles hans five halonitromethanes hnms and seven haloacetaldehydes hals in addition to the regulated trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas in surface water and wastewater effluent treated with gac they determined that gac was not effective at reducing the calculated genotoxic potencies of unregulated dbps produced by chlorination of water containing high levels of bromide and dissolved organic nitrogen calculated genotoxic potency was calculated by multiplying the concentration of a specific disinfection byproduct with its reported 50 tail dna values from genomic dna damage assays wagner and plewa 2017 an approach for controlling dbp concentration in the plant effluent is the use of upstream oxidation to form dbps and oxidize dbp precursors followed by gac adsorption of the preformed dbps and remaining dbp precursors ozone followed by gac can more efficiently remove regulated dbp precursors than gac alone liu et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 demonstrated that total organic halogen thms and haas concentrations and developmental toxicity were lower in effluents when chlorination preceded gac as opposed to after gac for drinking water they also observed lower aromatic halogenated dbps when pre chlorination was used however another study showed that thms and haas chlorination precursors broke through gac faster than doc babi et al 2007 pre chlorination has recently been shown to enhance the efficacy of gac for controlling thms fischer et al 2019 however the impact of pre oxidation on gac performance for controlling dbps both regulated and nonregulated has not been evaluated for potable reuse in which the bromide and nitrogen rich organic matter levels are much higher besides adsorption biological activity on gac can achieve microbial mediated degradation for efficient and consistent dbp precursor removal liu et al 2017 a few studies at pilot scale have focused on biofiltration that employed biologically activated carbon bac along with pre ozonation for drinking water liu et al 2017 without pre ozonation for drinking water fu et al 2017 and pre ozonation for treated wastewater chuang and mitch 2017 for attenuating regulated and unregulated dbps and their precursors these studies did not evaluate adsorption breakthrough behavior given that monitoring for constituents began after gac was spent and acclimated to biological growth the objective of this study was to systematically evaluate the gac breakthrough of an extensive list of dbp precursors and their calculated toxicities during parallel pre oxidation no pre oxidation pre ozonation and pre chlorination gac under a practical potable reuse scenario this study is the first to measure chlorine and chloramine reactive dbp precursors of nine epa regulated and 57 unregulated dbps in tertiary filtered wastewater before and after treatment with pilot scale adsorption with gac the impact of pre chlorinating and side by side comparison with pre ozonating prior to gac adsorption has not been evaluated before using treated wastewater ambient bromate ndma thm4 and haa5 were also measured and monitored throughout the treatment train to assess pre oxidation implications on dbp formation the study utilizes calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity quantities from methods reported elsewhere to identify and provide comparisons of the pre oxidiation gac treatment options allard et al 2015 chuang and mitch 2017 krasner et al 2016 lau et al 2020 plewa et al 2017 smith et al 2010 specifically the toxic potencies of dbps formed during formation potential experiments were calculated by normalizing measured concentrations to published cytotoxicity and genotoxicity lethal concentrations of individual dbps wagner and plewa 2017 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot treatment the pilot plant influent was tertiary filtered municipal wastewater from a wastewater treatment plant located in las vegas nevada at full scale the municipal wastewater is treated with primary treatment bar screen ferric chloride coagulant grit removal anionic polymer primary clarification secondary treatment johannesburg process for biological nitrogen and phosphorous removal and biologically active dual media anthracite and sand filtration water quality parameters of the pilot plant influent are listed in table s1 the pilot plant utilized three identical gac columns module f300 intuitech inc salt lake city ut usa in parallel one column adsorber received raw tertiary filtered wastewater from a full scale wastewater plant gacraw another received ozonated raw water gaco3 and a third received chlorinated raw water gaccl2 during ozonation with an sgc 21 ozone generator pacific ozone benicia ca usa the ozone dose was consistent at 3 9 0 6 mg l n 14 0 78 0 11 mg o3 mg doc a representative ozone contact curve is shown in fig s1a which has a calculated ozone exposure of 0 8 mg min l pilot chlorination operated with a chlorine pure bright bleach 6 60 sodium hypochlorite kik custom products ontario canada dose of 1 mg cl2 l during the first 2000 bvs and 3 mg cl2 l thereafter with a 15 min contact time the chlorinated stream was dechlorinated on the gac specifically dechlorination by gaccl2 occurred as follows chlorine residual decreased from 0 5 to 0 2 mg cl2 l in the first 15 cm of column and from 0 2 to 0 02 mg cl2 l detection limit after an additional 40 6 cm of column chlorine exposure of 11 mg min l was determined by calculating the area under the curve of a chlorine decay time series fig s1b when the dose was 3 mg cl2 l all three columns operated at a 4 l min flowrate corresponding to a loading rate of 12 m h and were packed with 2 m of lignite gac hydrodarco 3000 cabot corporation boston ma usa to operate at an empty bed contact time ebct of 10 min hydrodarco 3000 gac has a manufacturer reported particle size of 10 outside of 8 30 mesh iodine of 650 mg g and molasses of 450 additionally the gac has been previously characterized for specific surface area 676 m2 g and pore volume 0 711 cm3 g hanigan et al 2012 the pilot plant operated continuously from june 2016 to december 2016 7 month period maintenance shutdowns occurred at least weekly or as needed for backwashing of the gac columns backwashing was done concurrently on all columns to prevent excessive head loss i e 0 6 bar of pressure and used raw water at a flow rate of 11 l min 37 m h loading rate for a total duration of 15 min the six sampling locations included pilot plant influent pre ozonated pre chlorinated gacraw effluent gaco3 effluent and gaccl2 effluent throughput was calculated by dividing the volume of treated water by the volume occupied by the gac because columns did not have matching throughputs as a function of operating time due to irregular maintenance shutdowns each of the three sets of samples that were taken on the same day corresponded to different throughputs an additional column operated in parallel and was filled with biological activated carbon bac 10 year old exhausted gac with an attached active biofilm to serve as a control for biological performance the bac column received raw water for the first half of the 7 month period and pre ozonated water for the second half to serve as a control for both gacraw and gaco3 this control column operated at an ebct of 10 min but at a slightly reduced flowrate of 2 65 l min 2 2 sample collection and processing samples for ambient dbps bulk parameters and dbp precursors were collected every 2 weeks at the beginning of the project and gradually limited to once every month bromate was analyzed in the raw water and before and after gaco3 only bromate was not expected to form during chlorination and was not measured fang et al 2014 also selected bulk parameters that are known indicators of dbp precursors doc reckhow et al 1990 ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm wavelength uva254 white et al 2003 and specific ultraviolet absorbance suva uva254 divided by doc in au l mg m hua

quantified with formation potential fp chlorination experiments fp chlorination fp cl experiments were conducted as described in standard methods sm 5710 briefly ph controlled at ph 7 using phosphate buffer water samples were reacted with enough free chlorine to result in a 3 5 mg cl2 l residual after 7 days of reaction ndma precursors were measured using fp chloramination fp clm experimental conditions mitch and sedlak 2004 briefly fp clm experiments were done by reacting ph controlled at ph 7 using phosphate buffer water samples with 140 mg cl2 l of freshly prepared monochloramine for 10 days ndma and thm samples were quenched with 25 mg l of thiosulfate and haa samples were quenched with 100 mg l ammonium chloride uniform formation conditions ufcs were used to simulate conventional chlorination or chloramination distribution conditions ndma ufc chloramination experiments were conducted according to previous studies by shah and mitch 2012b and zeng and mitch 2015 and thm and haa ufc chlorination experiments were conducted according to summers et al 1996 briefly to determine ufc chloramination ph controlled at ph 8 with borate buffer water samples were reacted with enough chloramine to result in at least 1 0 mg cl2 l residual after 3 days of reaction similarly for ufc chlorination ph controlled at ph 8 using borate buffer water samples were reacted with enough chlorine to give a residual of 1 0 0 4 mg cl2 l after 24 h as reported above quenching was dbp specific ambient dbps those that were pre formed during pilot treatment and were present in the samples before ufc

trihalomethanes i thms fp assays were conducted using both chlorination and chloramination conditions as stated above two sets of acidified ph to 3 5 4 with h2so4 samples were generated for each fp experiment one quenched with ascorbic acid and the other with ammonium chloride at a molar stoichiometric ratio of 1 1 3 for chlorination experiments and one with ascorbic acid and another without a quencher for chloramination experiments samples from the fp assay were chilled and shipped in coolers overnight from the southern nevada water authority applied research development center henderson

bromine substitution factor the lethal concentrations lcs of various types of dbps including thms haas hnms hams hans hals and ndma in chinese hamster ovary cells cho wagner and plewa 2017 were used to calculate cytotoxicity associated with the dbp fp as reported in various studies allard et al 2015 chuang and mitch 2017 krasner et al 2016 plewa et al 2017 smith et al 2010 the calculation involved dividing the dbp molar concentration by its lc at which 50 of the cho cells were killed lc50 in m it should be noted that hks and tribromoacetonitrile were not included in these calculations as their cho cytotoxicities have not yet been reported similarly the genotoxic contributions of various dbps were calculated similarly using reported 50 tail dna values in m from cho single cell gel electrophoresis acute genomic dna damage assays wagner and plewa 2017 with the assumption that genotoxicity and cytotoxicity is additive total toxicity was calculated by adding together the calculated toxicity of individual dbp species it is noted this toxicity calculation approach might be limited by not considering synergistic effects differences between human and animal cells and association with human health risk mckenna et al 2019 though lau et al 2020 validated using the sum of cytotoxic potency weighted dbp concentrations as an estimate of the cho cell cytotoxicity associated with known dbps in real disinfected waters including potable reuse waters this approach is useful to identify dbps for additional toxicity testing and potential trade offs in treatment the bromine substitution factor bsf was calculated as reported in hua and reckhow 2012 where the scale for bsfs ranged from 0 fully chlorinated to 1 fully brominated for all dbp classes so that comparisons can be made within classes of mono di and tri halogenated dbps see equation s1 in the si bsf was only calculated for dbp classes for which all chlorinated and brominated analogues were measured i e tri hals tri hams tri hnms thm4 di hals di hams and di hnms 3 results and discussion 3 1 bromate figure s2 shows bromate as a function of throughput in bed volumes bvs during ozonation and gac the raw water had low but detectable levels of bromate 4 3 μg l bromate formed at an average of 26 μg l due to the reaction of 153 μg l of bromide with 0 8 mg o3 mg doc of ozone a 10 molar yield relative to bromide only a single observation at the start of the run 450 bvs suggested removal of about 28 of bromate with gac while gac had been determined to be effective at removing bromate in pristine waters the presence of organic matter greatly inhibits bromate adsorption kirisits et al 2000 therefore it is unsurprising that bromate was poorly removed by gac in treated wastewater containing 5 mg l of doc table 1 see additional discussion on bulk parameters in the si bromate mitigation strategies e g ph depression ammonia chloramines and hydrogen peroxide involving bromide sequestration or manipulating the ozone hydroxyl radical pathways have been studied for decades in drinking water applications buffle et al 2004 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 and wert et al 2007 however these bromate mitigation strategies have only been limitedly studied in wastewater matrices soltermann et al 2017 which generally have much higher ozone demand 3 2 thm4 and haa5 3 2 1 gac treatment of prechlorine formed thms and haas ambient concentrations of thm4 and haa5 are shown in fig s3 a and b respectively the concentration of thms in the raw water was low 0 6 0 1 μg l of thm4 n 10 and below the mrl for haa5 1 μg l table s6 thms and haas were formed during pilot pre chlorination generating an average 9 μg l of each thm4 n 3 and haa5 n 3 when 1 mg cl2 l dose was used for pre chlorination 0 1540 bvs and 24 3 μg l of thm4 n 6 and 16 5 μg l of haa5 n 7 when 3 mg cl2 l dose was used 1540 bvs complete removal of thm4 by gaccl2 was observed in the beginning 2000 bvs and less removal occurred with increasing throughput indicative of breakthrough thm4 breakthrough of 50 occurred at 3000 bvs fig s3 compared to 2200 bvs for bulk doc table 1 see additional discussion on bulk parameters in the si after 5000 bvs the concentration of thms in the effluent was greater than in the influent which is a behavior that has been observed in other gac studies babi et al 2007 this behavior suggests that adsorbed thms were either displaced and desorbing in exchange with more favorably adsorbing compounds formed chemically from chlorine reacting with adsorbed organic matter on gac during dechlorination or via a decarboxylation process that converts haas to thms zhang and minear 2002 or some combination of the three gaccl2 removed ambient haa5 completely during the initial stages of the pilot bvs 2000 and only allowed as much as 1 6 μg l of haa5 during 4000 to 8000 bvs into the effluent before haa5 was removed to below their mrls after 10 000 bvs fig s3b likely due to biological degradation babi et al 2007 kim and kang 2008 3 2 2 preozone gac treatment of fp chlorine reactive precursors molar concentrations of thm4 and haa5 precursors determined after fp cl in gac influent samples are presented in fig s4 pre ozonation slightly reduced thm4 fp cl and haa5 fp cl in the influent stream 11 and 20 removal average respectively indicating that the reaction with ozone reduced the total number of precursors through oxidation and transformation to lower molecular weight compounds consistent with previous work amy et al 1991 de vera et al 2015 deeudomwongsa et al 2017 showed that thm formation was reduced not from direct reaction of precursors with ozone but from the reaction with hydroxyl radicals as in o3 h2o2 in drinking water which can be generated from the reaction of ozone and natural organic matter while in the same study deeudomwongsa et al 2017 the authors showed haa5 formation was promoted via ozone oxidation other studies reported similar findings to those reported herein in that haa precursors were removed during ozonation de vera et al 2015 gaco3 had a small but noticeable improvement to breakthrough of haa5 precursors during higher throughputs compared to other gac processes which could be linked to the reduced concentration of haa5 precursors in the influent shown in table 1 and fig s4 for thm4 precursors gaco3 showed similar breakthrough performance compared to the other two gac processes 3 2 3 prechlorine gac treatment of fp chlorine reactive precursors pre chlorination was expected to reduce thm4 fp cl by converting thm precursors into ambient thms or intermediate chlorinated aromatic products prior to gac jiang et al 2017 while a 6 and 7 transformation of precursors to ambient thm4 and haa5 occurred respectively it did not play any appreciable role in subsequent gac treatment rather all gac columns pre oxidation or not reduced thm4 and haa5 fp cl to a similar degree it is likely that the chlorine exposure during pilot pre chlorination was not enough 11 mgcl2 min l compared to 100 mgcl2 min l in jiang et al 2017 to influence gac performance for removal of thm4 fp cl further information on the individual species of thm4 and haa5 fp cl in gac effluents is provided in the thm4 and haa5 section in the support information si document 3 2 4 preoxidation gac treatment of ufc chlorine reactive precursors ufc experiments were conducted on gac effluent samples to determine dbp formation under chlorine exposures representative of conventional disinfection and distribution results of ufc experiments are shown in fig 1 and compared with doc breakthrough concentrations distinguishable from the literature fischer et al 2019 all three gac pilots performed similarly with breakthroughs to the u s epa mcl regulatory limits 80 μg l for thm4 and 60 μg l for haa5 occurring at 3000 bvs for thm4 ufc cl but never captured for haa5 suggesting breakthrough 18 000 bvs gaco3 effluent stabilized at the lowest thm4 ufc cl at most 25 lower than gacraw effluent and haa5 ufc cl at most 40 lower than gacraw effluent in practice this wastewater could be subjected to blending prior to introducing it to drinking water distribution systems and could result in a substantially lower level of regulated dbp formation 3 3 ndma 3 3 1 gac treatment of ozone formed ndma ambient ndma concentration as a function of throughput is shown in fig s5 the ambient ndma concentration increased from 3 0 0 5 ng l n 6 raw to 17 3 ng l n 11 gaco3 influent during ozonation taking the concentration above the california environmental protection agency ca epa notification level nl of 10 ng l subsequent gaco3 filtration removed 59 of ndma to produce an effluent with 7 3 ng l n 11 of ndma on average with only one sample above the ca epa nl gac adsorption of ndma has been previously proven to be an ineffective mitigation technique due to the hydrophilic nature of ndma mitch et al 2003 however the removal of ndma with gaco3 increased as throughput increased from 32 to 78 ndma removal in the span of 5 months 20 000 bvs likely due to increase in biological degradation chuang and mitch 2017 gerrity et al 2015 zeng et al 2016 3 3 2 ozone treatment of fp chloramine reactive precursors concentrations of ndma chloramine reactive precursors fp clm through pre oxidation and gac treatment are shown in fig s6 pilot pre chlorination and pre ozonation removed a large component of the total amount of ndma fp clm from the influent 56 and 88 respectively pre ozonation formed 14 ng l of ndma and removed 486 ng l on average of ndma fp clm 35 ng of precursors destroyed per 1 ng of ndma formed this reinforces that ozone reactive ndma precursors are distinctive from those reactive towards monochloramine farré et al 2011 marti et al 2015 pisarenko et al 2012 meanwhile pre chlorination did not form ndma 3 3 3 preoxidation gac treatment of fp chloramine reactive precursors the removal of ndma fp clm by gacraw and gaco3 approached steady state values of 80 and 50 respectively indicating biodegradation of precursors while gaccl2 removal efficiency decreased with time indicating adsorption breakthrough fig s6 considering oxidation and sorption together the ndma fp clm of gaco3 effluent was lowest stabilizing at 36 7 ng l compared to gacraw and gaccl2 effluents with values of 100 ng l each as shown in fig s6 the removal of ndma fp clm during gacraw exceeded that of doc and uva254 as determined from a comparison of the results shown in figs s6 and s7 this relatively high performance is likely associated with the trace contaminants e g ranitidine diphenhydramine and tetracycline which are ndma precursors and are removed effectively with gac hanigan et al 2012 marti et al 2017 mulhern et al 2017 3 3 4 preoxidation gac treatment of ufc chloramine reactive precursors using ufc conditions we determined that ndma ufc clm was considerably lower in gaco3 effluent than in the effluent of the other two gacs fig 2 unfortunately ndma ufc clm still measured above the ca epa nl of 10 ng l for all gacs throughout the full length of the run however because ndma in gaco3 effluent was only 1 6 times the nl blending with another source water could be done to meet compliance ndma ufc clm for gaccl2 effluent was lower than gacraw effluent throughout most of the column run but their difference can be deemed insignificant since it was less than the variability due to error the breakthrough of ndma ufc clm during gaco3 occurred quickly and could not be captured because most precursors that remained after pre ozonation were recalcitrant towards gac adsorption 3 4 other unregulated dbps 3 4 1 influent fp chloramine and chlorine reactive precursors the molar sums of regulated and unregulated dbps formed during fp conditions with chlorine and chloramine are shown in fig 3 a and b respectively more species of unregulated dbps formed from fp with chloramine compared to chlorine table s6 for example unlike unregulated dbps formed with fp cl fp clm produced diiodoacetamide diam dichloroacetonitrile dcan and tcal in appreciable amounts between 10 and 25 μg l in influent samples also the total concentration of ham fp clm 173 15 nm was greater than ham fp cl 38 32 nm the major classes of dbps formed during fp cl were thm4 haa5 and hals fig 3 matching the order of what has been observed for other water sources chuang and mitch 2017 fu et al 2017 krasner et al 2006 3 4 2 preoxidation of fp chlorine reactive precursors pre ozonation produced hal 32 18 hk 36 29 and hnm 610 200 and removed han 25 12 chlorine reactive precursors while pre oxidation did not alter the total concentration of total fp cl table 1 removal it did systematically change the concentration of certain unregulated dbp chlorine reactive precursors it was thought based on the thm4 and haa5 fp cl data as well as data from unregulated dbps that the pre chlorination dose was not sufficiently high to alter the precursors prior to fp cl experiments however it did increase the concentration of hal han and hk fp clm by 55 19 36 17 36 12 respectively 3 4 3 preoxidation of fp chloramine reactive precursors pre ozonation increased hal 90 86 hk 44 24 and hnm 175 68 and removed han 53 15 chloramine reactive precursors ham precursors were neither formed nor removed during pre ozonation because ozonation can produce low molecular weight aldehydes and ketones hal and hk precursors increased during ozonation de vera et al 2015 richardson et al 1999 weinberg et al 1993 also hnm precursors increased after ozonation because they have an oxidized n functional group nitro that can form from the reaction of amines particularly secondary amines with ozone mccurry et al 2016 furthermore both ham and han precursors are likely oxidized to form hnm precursors since the nitrogen moiety on both ham and han precursors are susceptible to ozone oxidation de vera et al 2015 3 4 4 gac treatment of fp chloramine and chlorine reactive precursors after gac adsorption unregulated dbp fp with cl and clm in the gac effluent approached that of the influent with increasing throughput indicative of adsorption breakthrough see fig s8 for normalized concentration as a function of throughput throughput estimated using linear interpolation at 50 breakthrough is shown in table 1 and compared in fig s9 breakthrough of chlorine reactive precursors through gacraw was in the order of hnms doc thm4 hams hans uva254 hks haa5 hals chloramine reactive precursors followed a distinctive removal pattern with breakthrough in the order of hnms doc uva254 hals hans hams hks ndma 3 4 5 preoxidation gac treatment fp chloramine and chlorine reactive precursors pre oxidation with chlorine and ozone impacted the breakthrough of precursors pre chlorination delayed the gac breakthrough of hal han ham and hk chloramine reactive precursors fp clm but increased chlorine reactive hal precursors fp cl table 1 fig s9 though hal han and hk chloramine reactive precursors increased after pre chlorination table 1 the formed precursors were more adsorbable than those in the raw water as was deduced from the observation of breakthrough of gaccl2 compared to gacraw though ham fp clm did not change during pre chlorination the chemical nature of these precursors was altered during pre chlorination since again they were more susceptible to gac adsorption than in their raw form pre ozonation delayed the gac breakthrough of hnm han and hal fp cl and hnm hal hk fp clm table 1 because ozonation increased hnm fp and hk fp cl and clm their presence was higher in the effluent of gaco3 compared to gacraw and gaccl2 still the combined process of o3 gac produced an effluent with the lowest total dbp precursor levels fig 3 compared to cl2 gac and raw gac the order of breakthrough for each individual class of dbp contrasted with reported removals from pre ozonated biofiltration that used gac media in wastewater chuang and mitch 2017 and drinking water de vera et al 2016 fu et al 2017 for example gac with pre ozonation followed breakthrough performance table 1 in the order hnms hals haa5 hans hks hams thms while chuang and mitch 2017 reported biofiltration removals in the order hnms hams hals hks thms haas though thm4 and haa5 are commonly used as surrogates for dbp formation a lack of correlation between regulated and unregulated dbps has been reported in wastewater effluents krasner et al 2009 here we demonstrated that gac adsorption does not remove all classes of dbp precursors by the same degree rather all unregulated dbp classes with the exception of hnms were removed more effectively table 1 than thms and doc in wastewater precursors containing nitrogen are highly abundant chen et al 2011 as a result there is increased likelihood to form hnms during chlorination and chloramination in treated wastewater although hnm fp cl increased with pre ozonation the ozone produced hnm precursors were highly adsorbable by gac in fact hnm fp cl in the effluent of gaco3 resembled that of gaccl2 and gacraw see fig s10 for a comparison of dbps that were limitedly formed 1 μm the bromine substitution factor bsf for dbp fp is shown in fig s11 the aggregated average bsf was higher after gac treatment compared to the influent as expected due to removal of doc and no removal of bromide ion i e increased br to doc ratio this increase in bsf was more noticeable for fp clm fig s11b than for fp cl and for raw gac and o3 gac than for cl2 gac for raw pilot influent trihalonitromethane fp cl and clm had the highest bsf compared to other dbp classes 3 5 estimated toxicity of dbps because the calculated toxicity corresponds to dbps formed during much higher oxidant exposures i e fp than what is typical for water treatment disinfection e g ufc calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were used only to indicate relative performance of gac adsorbents 3 5 1 influent cytotoxicity from fp chloramine and chlorine reactive precursors the calculated cytotoxicity associated with dbps formed during fp cl and clm are displayed in fig 4 a and b respectively the calculated cytotoxicity of the nine classes of dbps according to their concentrations after fp cl and cytotoxic potencies wagner and plewa 2017 were consistent across throughput and rank in the order of i thms i haas thms haas hams hnms hals hans with hks tribromoacetonitrile and ndma not determined in the raw tertiary filtered wastewater calculated cytotoxicity of dbps formed after fp clm in raw tertiary filtered wastewater were not consistent across throughput but rank in the order of i thms ndma i haas hnms hams hans hals based on averages the calculated cytotoxicity induced by the dbps formed in fp experiments is drastically different from their molar concentrations i e compared to fig 3a the two dominating classes of dbps on a molar basis in the raw tertiary filtered wastewater formed after fp cl thm4 and haa5 were 80 of the total concentration but represented less than 5 of the total summed calculated cytotoxicity see fig 4 rather more than 90 of the calculated cytotoxicity was due to hals hnms hams and hans which accounted for 20 of the total molar concentration similarly krasner et al 2016 found hans and hnms contributed the most to the overall calculated cytotoxicity in a bench scale study even though their concentrations were limited compared to regulated dbps 3 5 2 influent genotoxicity from fp chloramine and chlorine reactive precursors the calculated genotoxicity of dbps formed during fp cl and clm are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively the calculated genotoxicity of the six classes of dbps according to their concentrations after fp cl were not consistent across throughput but ranked in the order of i thm i haas haas hals hams hans hnms with hks thms and ndma not determined based on averages in the raw tertiary filtered wastewater calculated genotoxicity after fp clm were not consistent across throughput and ranked in the order of ndma i haas hans hals hams hnms based on averages specifically the calculated genotoxicity associated with hnms after fp cl was 43 of the total of the six species for which genotoxicity was available though it only amounted to 13 in terms of concentration meanwhile haa5 after fp cl accounted for 65 of the sum concentration of the six genotoxic dbp species yet were less than 2 of the total calculated genotoxicity 3 5 3 gac treatment of toxicity from fp chloramine and chlorine reactive precursors doc breakthrough behavior followed more closely with total dbp fp cl molar concentrations than with total calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity as shown in fig s12 for example in the beginning of the breakthrough curve in fig s12 calculated cytotoxicity underwent 40 breakthrough by the first sampling campaign 1000 bvs whereas 20 breakthrough occurred for doc it was found that hal and hnm after fp cl were responsible for the fast cytotoxicity breakthrough since both were not mitigated during gac in the first sampling campaign see fig s13 therefore unregulated dbps could have negative health implications that are disconnected from general water quality parameters such as doc and regulated classes of dbps this was also found true in studies assessing calculated cytotoxicity in other treated wastewaters and in drinking waters chuang and mitch 2017 plewa et al 2017 the removal of calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity was lower for all throughputs than the removal of molar concentrations because there was higher calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity from the more gac recalcitrant set of precursors e g hnm ham and han precursors when compared to those that are found at high concentration and are removed effectively e g hal and haa5 precursors see figs 4 and 5 3 5 4 preoxidation gac treatment of toxicity from fp chloramine and chlorine reactive precursors pre ozonation increased the total calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of dbps formed after fp cl and clm primarily due to the increases in hnm precursors but it also had a synergistic effect with gac where gaco3 removed hnms to a greater degree when compared to gacraw pre chlorination was not consistent in the effect it had on cytotoxicity and genotoxicity but it did consistently yield a gaccl2 effluent with lower calculated toxicity than gacraw effluent while pre chlorination has been shown to improve dbp attenuation during gac jiang et al 2017 improving toxicity without notable reduction in total concentration is unique to this study in the first two sets of samples 363 450 and 5100 6700 bvs the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity calculated from dbps formed during fp clm was higher than from fp cl though the concentration of dbps was five times higher for fp cl figs 4 and 5 respectively this was contrasting to studies with a similar cytotoxicity calculation approach chuang and mitch 2017 zeng et al 2016 chuang and mitch 2017 found chloramination under simulated distribution system conditions comparable to ufc herein produced lower calculated cytotoxicity 3 80 fold compared to chlorination in treated municipal wastewater before and after ozone and biofiltration in this study the calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were higher for chloramination formed dbps because of the unique oxidation conditions for example we observed formation of dichloroacetamide which is orders of magnitude more toxic e g cytotoxicity of dichloroacetamide lc50 1 9 10 6 m than those that are more prominent such as thms and haas e g cytotoxicity of chloroform lc50 9 2 10 3 m richardson et al 2008 wagner and plewa 2017 the calculated cytotoxicity was drastically lower during the last sampling 18 400 21 000 bvs of fp clm even though the total concentration of dbp fp clm was not considerably reduced this occurred because highly cytotoxic chloroacetaldehyde cytotoxicity of chloroacetaldehyde lc50 3 6 10 6 m and dibromoacetaldehyde cytotoxicity of dibromoacetaldehyde lc50 4 4 10 6 m jeong et al 2015 were below detection in the final round of samples though they were the primary source of calculated cytotoxicity in the tens of nm for the first two sample campaigns 4 conclusions this study measured chlorine and chloramine reactive dbp precursors of nine regulated and 57 unregulated dbps in tertiary treated wastewater before and after treatment with pilot scale pre oxidation followed by gac adsorption these results indicate gac employed in a potable reuse application has the potential to reduce chlorine and chloramine reactive dbp precursors compared to no gac application also gac employed with pre ozonation can produce an effluent with lower haa5 ufc thm4 ufc ndma ufc and the sum of regulated and emerging dbp precursors under fp cl and clm than gac with pre chlorination gac with pre chlorination produced an effluent with less sum of regulated and emerging dbp precursors under fp cl than without pretreatment however bromate mitigation strategies are likely warranted when gac with pre ozone is used to treat wastewater though dbp precursors under fp conditions can be reduced to a greater extent by gac with pre oxidation when compared to gac with no pre oxidation gac with pre ozonation can potentially produce an effluent with calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity that are similar to gac with no pre oxidation while gac with pre chlorination can potentially yield an effluent with the lowest calculated toxicity caution is warranted if chloramines alone are to be used post disinfection since chloramines can potentially produce more species of unregulated dbps and the calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity from dbps formed during fp clm can be potentially higher than from fp cl even though the concentration of dbps can be five times higher for fp cl this study suggests that doc can be used as an indicator for dbp treatment efficacy however the doc breakthrough behavior did not correlate with the total sum of calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity therefore for potable reuse applications unregulated dbps could have negative health implications that are disconnected from doc and regulated classes of dbps which could be verified under simulated disinfection conditions declaration of competing interest

19987,nitrite in drinking water is a potentially harmful substance for humans and controlling nitrite formation in drinking water distribution systems dwdss is highly important the effect of natural organic matter nom on the formation of nitrite in simulated distribution systems was studied the objective was to inspect how a reduced nom concentration affected nitrite development via nitrification separated from the effects of disinfection we observed that nitrite formation was noticeably sensitive to the changes in the nom concentrations nitrite declined with reduced nom toc 1 0 mg l 1 but increased with the normal nom concentration of tap water toc 1 6 mg l 1 ammonium oxidation was not altered by the reduced nom however nitrite oxidation was enhanced significantly according to the pseudo first order reaction rate model interpretation the enhanced nitrite oxidation was observed with both ammonium and nitrite as the initial nitrogen source the theoretical maximum nitrite concentrations were higher with the normal concentration of nom than with reduced nom the results suggest that the role of nitrite oxidation may be quite important in nitrite formation in dwdss and worth further studies as a practical result our study supported enhanced nom removal in non disinfected dwdss graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrite nitrification natural organic matter water distribution systems non disinfected conditions 1 introduction nitrification and nitrite formation are unwanted but widely observed occurrences in drinking water distribution with water containing free ammonium or an ammonium source autotrophic nitrification is a two phase microbiological reaction first ammonium is oxidized into nitrite equation 1 and second nitrite is oxidized into nitrate equation 2 as follows 1 2 nh4 3 o2 2 no2 2 h2o 4 h 2 2 no2 o2 2 no3 equation 1 is called nitritation and equation 2 is called nitratation nitrite is formed as an intermediate product of these two reactions nitritation occurs by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitratation by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob the most common type of aob is nitrosomonas sp and the most common type of nob is nitrospira sp the aob and the nob are aerobic chemolithoautotrophic organisms that consume carbon dioxide and do not need organic matter for their growth in general organic matter suppresses nitrification this effect is largely due to competition between the fast growing organic matter consuming heterotrophic bacteria and the slowly growing aob and nob which lose in this competition for substrate oxygen nutrients and space furthermore aob and nob are forced deeper into biofilms by rapid heterotrophic growth which leads to a greater mass transport resistance furumai and rittmann 1994 rittmann and manem 1992 in drinking water natural organic matter nom originates from the surface or groundwater used as raw water in water treatment while most of the particulate nom is removed during drinking water production soluble nom remains in the distributed water nissinen et al 2001 in drinking water distribution systems dwdss nom has been observed to have opposing effects on nitrification in most research in the usa high nom concentrations were associated with increased nitrite formation harrington et al 2002 wilczak et al 2003 yang et al 2008b zhang et al 2010 on the other hand decreasing nom by granular activated carbon gac filtration has induced increased nitrite concentrations in the usa and finland skadsen 1993 vahala et al 1999 however the research of skadsen et al included the addition of monochloramine prior the gac filters which caused nitrification in the biofilm of the gac filter thus the dwds was inoculated with aob and nob from the produced water furthermore in canada no correlation between nom and nitrite concentrations was found in two dwdss scott et al 2015 huang et al 2016 noticed that the dissolved organic matter dom in the molecular size range of 200 500 g mol 1 correlated positively with oxidized nitrogen and with active bacterial cells in a dwds disinfected with monochloramine nitrite can be formed in dwdss from the ammonium in the raw water for example in china ammonium concentrations of 0 1 3 mg l 1 have been reported and the highest values may reach more than 10 mg l 1 zhang et al 2019 also in denmark the groundwater used as drinking water contained ammonium and nitrite schullehner et al 2017 moreover a common disinfectant monochloramine provides ammonium when decomposed thus promoting nitrite formation harrington et al 2002 wilczak et al 1996 wolfe et al 1990 it has also been observed that a significant share of monochloramine itself can be directly metabolized into nitrite maestre et al 2016 wahman et al 2016 in dwdss nitrification can be prevented by other disinfection chemicals for example free chlorine rosenfeldt et al 2009 however chlorination enhances the formation of disinfection by products dbps according to the european directive 98 83 ec the maximum admissible concentrations of nitrite nitrate and ammonium in drinking water are 0 5 mg l 1 50 mg l 1 and 0 5 mg l 1 respectively european council 1998 the effect of nom on nitrite formation in dwdss with disinfection chemicals especially monochloramine has been inspected in several studies as described above however studies without disinfection chemicals are rare thus to determine the effects of nom separated from the effects of disinfection chemicals laboratory scale tests were organized in this study non disinfected dwdss are common for example in europe lipponen et al 2002 schullehner et al 2017 waak et al 2018 the objective of the study was to evaluate how the nitrite concentrations are affected by reduced concentrations of nom in conditions relevant to water distribution furthermore the focus was to understand the roles of both nitritation and nitratation 2 materials and methods 2 1 a description of the simulated distribution systems nitrite formation was studied in two simulated distribution systems sdss each sds consisted of a 22 m pipe loop and a covered water tank material polypropylene the flow was generated by a magnet pump iwaki md 30rvm 220n japan and measured with a water meter suve svi 1511 finland the sdss were equipped with pressure gauges freescale semiconductor mxp5050dp usa and thermometers nokeval pt100 sensor with a transmitter 620 finland see fig 1 a the external diameter of the pipe was 25 mm the wall thickness was 2 3 mm and the material was polyethylene uponor blue stripe finland a vent valve was installed at the highest point of each pipe loop the sdss were operated in a closed and temperature regulated room at the temperature of 18 c with a positive water pressure of 0 2 bar and a volumetric flow of 0 1 m3 h 1 the water was pumped from the bottom of the tank through the pipe loop and returned to the tank below the water level five biofilm collectors were installed in the pipe loops each consisting of 0 6 m of water pipe with pvc valves at both ends two similar sdss named sds1 and sds2 were built in the research laboratory of water engineering in aalto university espoo finland before starting the operation of the sdss the tanks and pipe loops were shock chlorinated and rinsed with tap water and consequently with water purified with reverse osmosis ro water furthermore a final rinsing was done by circulating ro water through the sdss for three weeks to dissolve the remnants of organic carbon and nutrients from the unused materials to grow the nitrifying biofilm the sdss were operated for 30 weeks before nitrification was established tap water 30 l was changed weekly in both sdss with ammonium additions to the level of 200 μgn l 1 in the sdss the hydraulic retention time was 18 min and in the pipe loop 4 min the volume of the pipe loop 7 2 l the influent water was dechlorinated water dechlorination was organized in a temperature regulated research room by storing the tap water in closed vats for one week before adding it to the sdss the vats were rinsed with ro water for several weeks before use a similar three day dechlorination method has been used by zhang et al 2008 on week 16 phosphorus addition to the level of 5 μgp l 1 lehtola et al 2002 was initiated in order to boost the growth of nitrifiers see the supplementary information section table s1 the whole study lasted for 59 weeks 2 2 nitrification tests four types of nitrification test were executed in order to evaluate the nitrite formation see fig 1b in the tests two nom concentrations were applied the normal nom concentration of the tap water and a reduced nom concentration these were combined with ammonium and nitrite as the initial substrates for nitrification the nom in the tap water of the helsinki metropolitan area originates from lake päijänne in southern finland coordinates 61 36 50 n 25 28 55 e the median concentration of nom as total non purgeable organic carbon toc in the freshly produced tap water was 1 6 mg l 1 range 1 4 2 0 mg l 1 during 2010 2015 furthermore the nitrogen fractions in the water entering the dwds during 2010 2015 were ammonium including monochloramine 100 190 μgn l 1 nitrite 3 43 μgn l 1 nitrate 250 370 μgn l 1 and total nitrogen 350 660 μgn l 1 the tests were organized as batch tests new influent was introduced once a week and the biofilm inside the pipe loop once grown was kept intact in commencing all tests the required chemicals were inserted as solutions to the influent water in the tank see the supplementary information section table s1 for the concentrations and volumes of the solutions thereafter the fresh influent was introduced into the biofilm by pumping it through the pipe loop at the maximum flow 1 0 m3 h 1 for 10 min subsequently the flow was adjusted to 0 1 m3 h 1 and the first sample taken ammonium tests were started on week 31 with two trial tests nitrite tests were initiated on week 35 and after two consecutive nitrite tests they were performed alternating weeks with ammonium tests see the timetable in table s2 in the supplementary information section in a nitrite test the water was first introduced into the tank and pumped through the pipe loop with a 0 1 m3 h 1 flow for 24 h to get rid of the ammonium content of the tap water utilizing nitrification in the pipe loop the nom concentration of the water was reduced by mixing 15 l of tap water with 15 l of ro water for example distilled water has earlier been used for this purpose zhang et al 2010 the ro water was stored for one week in the research room similarly to the tap water storage the hardness and alkalinity of the diluted tap water were amended with calcium magnesium and hydrogen carbonate ions see table s1 in the supplementary information section in addition nitrate was amended between weeks 44 and 50 the sdss were operated similarly resulting as two similar nitrification tests each week this was done particularly because two biological processes tend to drift apart even though they are operated similarly douterelo et al 2013 thus the manipulations were organized sequentially with a final verification with the initial conditions tests with normal nom were performed first for eight weeks and for four weeks in the end tests with reduced nom were performed for eleven weeks in between see the timetable in the supplementary information section table s2 2 3 water and biofilm sampling and analyses nitrite formation was monitored by sampling and analyzing the concentrations of ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 nitrate no3 and total nitrogen ntot from the water in the tanks for example zhang et al 2008 tracked aob and nob activity by measuring the loss of ammonia and the production of nitrite and nitrate the sampling intervals varied between tests and lasted 0 75 24 h during the first 1 3 days of the tests except for the trial tests which were only sampled with a 24 h interval the final effluents were sampled when they were removed from the tanks the nitrogen fractions of water samples were analyzed in the laboratory of water and environmental engineering according to the methods in table s3 in the supplementary information section all the ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations were reported as nitrogen see table 1 the samples were analyzed during the same day and if the analysis took longer than one day the samples were stored in 4 c two replicates of each analysis were performed the concentration of dissolved oxygen and the ph of the water were measured after each sampling in addition general water quality was analyzed once a month for toc heterotrophic plate count hpc hardness total residual chlorine cl2 ph alkalinity and turbidity table 1 nom was analyzed as assimilable organic carbon aoc and toc from tap water and the influent during the tests with reduced nom in a sampling campaign weeks 47 50 all the water analysis methods are related in the supplementary information section table s3 after all of the tests in week 59 the biofilm collectors were sampled according to the description in the supplementary information section section 3 the microbial community of biofilms were analyzed for the share of aob nob and the most abundant bacterial species according to the description in table s4 in the supplementary information section other analyses performed from the biofilm samples were a total bacterial count with the dapi staining and suspended solids ss see table s4 in the supplementary information section 2 4 calculations and statistical methods apparent reaction rates were calculated by fitting a line in the first linear part of the nitrite concentration changes in the ammonium tests the slope of the line was taken as the rate 3 r m no2 where r apparent reaction rate μgn l 1h 1 and m no2 the slope of the nitrite concentration change μgn l 1h 1 the apparent rates were calculated for four or five pairs of time and concentration in addition nitritation and nitratation reactions were inspected with a model of two consecutive and irreversible first order reactions equations 4 6 pseudo first order modeling is often used for example when the biodegradation of micropollutants is examined ternes and joss 2006 for simplicity we approximated the sdss as completely mixed reactors and the concentrations in the tank were taken as the concentrations of the effluent this assumption caused a small error however since all the tests were treated equally they are comparable to each other the pseudo first order kinetic equation for nitritation follows 4 nh4 t nh4 0 exp k nh4 t where nh4 t ammonium concentration at time t μgn l 1 nh4 0 the initial ammonium concentration μgn l 1 k nh4 the pseudo first order reaction rate constant for ammonium h 1 and t time h the pseudo first order kinetic equation for two consecutive reactions nitritation and nitratation follows no2 t no2 0 exp k no2 t nh4 0 k nh4 k no2 k nh4 exp k nh4 t exp k no2 t 5 k nh4 k no2 where no2 t nitrite concentration at time t μgn l 1 no2 0 the initial nitrite concentration μgn l 1 and k no2 pseudo first order reaction rate constant for nitrite h 1 the pseudo first order kinetic equation for nitrate formation was calculated with the nitrogen balance as follows 6 no3 t nh4 0 no2 0 no3 0 nh4 t no2 t where no3 t nitrate concentration at time t μgn l 1 no3 0 initial nitrate concentration μgn l 1 the theoretical maximum nitrite concentration occurs according to the two consecutive pseudo first order reactions model at the time t max with a zero initial nitrite concentration as follows 7 t max 1 k nh4 k no2 ln k nh4 k no2 in the tests with nitrite as the initial substrate the pseudo first order reaction rate constants for nitrite k no2 were calculated from equation 8 as follows 8 no2 t no2 0 exp k no2 t equations 4 and 8 were solved for k nh4 or k no2 in the logarithmic form equation 5 was solved for k no2 utilizing the least squares method the theoretical maximum nitrite concentrations for each pair of k nh4 and k no2 were calculated by fitting t max from equation 7 into equation 5 as t the error of the nitrogen balance during the whole test period was calculated to evaluate the possibility of reactions that increase or decrease nitrogen in the water phase according to equation 9 as follows 9 ε n influent n samples n effluent ε is the nitrogen balance error μg n influents is the sum of nitrogen of all the influent waters μg n samples is the sum of nitrogen taken in all of the water samples μg n effluent is the sum of nitrogen of all the removed effluent waters μg the sum of nitrogen was calculated by weighing the individual nitrogen concentrations by the corresponding water volume the data sets of reaction rates and reaction rate constants were tested for normality with the anderson darling test the normally distributed data the pseudo first order reaction rate constants of nitrite with normal and reduced nom and with ammonium and nitrite as the initial substrate and the separated data of sds1 and sds2 with normal and reduced nom were compared with student s t test and non normally distributed the apparent reaction rates of nitrite and the pseudo first order reaction rate constants of ammonium with normal and reduced nom with wilcoxon s rank sum test data was collected in microsoft excel testing and data analysis were performed in mathworks matlab version r2019a and the figures were finalized in adobe illustrator cc 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrite formation nitrite formation responded consistently to the changes in nom concentrations in the nitrification tests with ammonium with the normal nom of the tap water median nom 1 6 mg l 1 as toc nitrite increased while with reduced nom median nom 1 0 mg l 1 as toc nitrite decreased see fig 2 a the nitrite concentrations increased with normal nom by 2 7 μgn l 1 h 1 and decreased with reduced nom by 2 4 μgn l 1 h 1 as medians see fig 2b the difference of the concentration changes was statistically significant wilcoxon s rank sum test zval 3 4 p 6 5 10 4 the apparent nitrite formation rates were evaluated for the initial linear part of the concentration profile as the slope of the linear regression line see equation 3 it is conceivable that the biofilm composition in the pipe loop reacted quickly to the reduced or increased nom because the heterotrophic bacteria have a significantly higher maximum growth rate than the aob and nob the maximum growth rate of the aob and nob is 0 2 0 9 g new cells g cells d 1 and for the heterotrophic bacteria it is 3 0 13 2 g new cells g cells d 1 tchobanoglous et al 2003 nevertheless the two sdss had slightly different patterns of nitrite build up or loss even though they were operated similarly sds2 produced a wider range of rates normal nom 0 4 to 9 9 μgn l 1 h 1 reduced nom 8 6 to 0 3 μgn l 1 h 1 than sds1 normal nom 2 3 to 3 1 μgn l 1 h 1 reduced nom 6 6 to 1 3 μgn l 1 h 1 sds2 demonstrated initially slower rates than sds1 also when the nom concentrations were first reduced on the other hand in the last three tests the rates were slower in sds1 than in sds2 however in its entirety the apparent nitrite formation rates did not differ significantly between sds1 and sds2 normal nom student s t 0 68 p 0 53 reduced nom student s t 0 19 p 0 85 the ranges of the apparent rates in sds1 and sds2 demonstrated that the test design was appropriate it would possibly have been difficult to compare two sdss with different water qualities when the two sdss with the same water quality differed as observed 3 2 comparing the ammonium and nitrite oxidation reactions 3 2 1 the ammonium tests when the ammonium tests were interpreted with the pseudo first order reaction rate models equations 4 6 it was found out that the decrease of nitrite concentrations with reduced nom was a result of nitrite being oxidized more rapidly the values of the reaction rate constant of nitrite k no2 median with normal nom 0 18 h 1 and with reduced nom 0 55 h 1 differed significantly from each other see fig 3 b student s t 6 2 p 2 2 10 6 on the other hand the values of the reaction rate constant of ammonium k nh4 with normal nom median 0 082 h 1 and reduced nom median 0 058 h 1 did not differ significantly see fig 3a student s t 0 9 p 0 37 this indicated that the differences of the nitrite concentrations in the nitrification tests were mainly caused by changes in the nitrite oxidation rates and not by changes in ammonium oxidation all the model fittings can be seen in fig s1 and s2 in the supplementary information section the trial tests with ammonium were also included in the pseudo first order modeling interestingly the ammonium oxidation was not affected significantly by the decreased nom but only nitrite oxidation one probable factor behind this observation is the free energy of transformation δg⁰ which is 290 4 kj mol 1 for ammonium oxidation and only 72 1 kj mol 1 for nitrite oxidation stumm and morgan 2009 thus ammonium oxidation is thermodynamically four times more favorable than nitrite oxidation it is possible that the nob were more sensitive to the changes in their environment because they gained less energy than the aob furthermore the nob have been observed to be impacted by a lower monochloramine concentration than the aob at 25 c gomez alvarez et al 2014 schrantz et al 2013 this also indicates that the nob may be generally more vulnerable to changes in the environment 3 2 2 the nitrite tests the nitrification tests with nitrite as the initial substrate were interpreted with the pseudo first order reaction rate model equation 8 the nitrite tests confirmed that there was a significant difference in the values of the reaction rate constants k no2 with normal and reduced nom student s t 2 1 p 0 050 see fig 4 this finding supported the observations from the ammonium tests all the model fittings can be seen in figs s3 and s4 in the supplementary information section in the nitrite tests the median of k no2 was 0 23 h 1 with normal nom and 0 29 h 1 with reduced nom see fig 4 thus the means of k no2 and k no2 differed by 0 02 h 1 with normal nom and 0 25 h 1 with reduced nom the origin of nitrite may partly explain the difference of the k no2 and k no2 with reduced nom in the nitrite tests the nitrite originated entirely from the water phase contrary to the ammonium tests where most of the nitrite was created inside the biofilm thus nitrite was more readily available for the nob in the ammonium tests because the rates lacked the material transfer resistance of nitrite from the water phase to the insides of the biofilm apparently this explanation is not necessarily relevant for normal nom however it is evident that k no2 and k no2 cannot be used interchangeably 3 3 estimating the theoretical maximum nitrite concentrations the maximum concentrations of nitrite are of interest because they are a potential health hazard in distributed water the conditions leading to high maximum concentrations are to be avoided if possible the pseudo first order model described above allowed us to estimate a theoretical maximum of the nitrite concentration equations 5 and 7 by varying k nh4 and k no2 the model was applied with the initial ammonium concentration of 180 μgn l 1 with no nitrite see fig 5 the maximum nitrite concentrations formed a curved surface on which the lowest maximum nitrites occurred when k nh4 was low and k no2 was high on the other hand the highest concentration was with a combination of high k nh4 and low k no2 the nitrite concentrations are formed as an intermediate reaction product and thus they can form a peak when the initial nitrogen compound is ammonium if the nitrite oxidation rate is high enough compared with the ammonium oxidation rate the peak may be non existent and no extra nitrite is formed the ratio of the reaction rate constants of the two consecutive reactions k nh4 k no2 determined whether nitrite concentration started to increase or decrease initially theoretically in the case of the first trial test with ammonium in sds1 week 31 fig s1a in the supplementary information section if the ratio k nh4 k no2 had been 0 06 or less nitrite would have initially started to decrease here it was 0 94 thus producing a peak in the nitrite concentration profile altogether the median of the ratios of k nh4 k no2 was 0 53 in the tests with normal nom and 0 13 with reduced nom 3 4 the biofilms in the biofilm samples taken after the experiments on week 59 and combined from the biofilms of sds1 and sds2 the relative abundance of the aob nitrosomonas sp was 9 3 and the relative abundance of nob nitrospira sp was 8 7 the high shares of aob and nob demonstrated the existence of nitrification activity in the biofilm the most abundant species was the heterotrophic bacteria bradyrhizobium sp 25 which has earlier been found in abundance in non disinfected sdss aggarwal et al 2018 gomez alvarez et al 2014 however in a full scale study encompassing 18 months and 5 samples this species was not found kelly et al 2014 probably because monochloramine was used for secondary disinfection the rest of the biofilm microbiological composition in our tests is related in the supplementary information section section 5 the total numbers of microbial cells with dapi staining in the biofilms were 5 9 108 cells m 2 in sds1 and 6 8 108 cells m 2 in sds2 furthermore the total solids of the biofilms were 180 mg m 2 in sds1 and 240 mg m 2 in sds2 combined with the share of aob and nob above we can estimate the number of nitrosomonas sp 3 1 108 cells g 1 in sds1 and 2 6 108 cells g 1 in sds2 and nitrospira sp 2 9 108 cells g 1 in sds1 and 2 5 108 cells g 1 in sds2 for example lipponen et al 2002 enumerated 4 2 104 2 2 107 mpn g 1 of aob and 1 8 103 2 3 108 mpn g 1 of nob in the sediment samples of four non chlorinated dwdss our results are analogous with these results taking into account that the latter probably underestimate the share of nob and aob in the biofilm by including inorganic sediments in the mass of the sample the analyses of the biofilm did not however represent the whole test period deducing from the varying nitrite formation rates the biofilms inside the pipe loops went through changes during the tests there were no changes in the way the pipe loops were operated during each test period thus the change in the nitrite formation rates was most probably due to the biofilm change nevertheless the variation in nitrite formation originating from the biofilm changes was included in the statistical variation of all the replicates of each type of nitrification test in full scale dwdss the microbial composition of the biofilm varies along the lengthy pipes with the changing concentrations of the distributed water douterelo et al 2016 gomez alvarez et al 2014 in the sdss of the current study the biofilm was likely more uniform throughout the length of the pipe loops though variation with time occurred as mentioned above the nitrite profiles with normal nom were relatively similar to nitrite formation profiles observed in a monochloraminated full scale dwds rantanen et al 2018 nitrite peaked at the water age of 5 0 6 7 h at full scale while in the current study the nitrite peak occurred at 4 14 h the waters in the tests and at full scale both originated from the same water treatment plant wtp with the difference of monochloramine being used at full scale the concentration of aob and nob in the water may have had an effect on the ammonia and nitrite oxidation rates however we considered this effect minor before the actual tests the biofilm was grown in the pipes for a six month period during which ammonium reduction or nitrite formation were not observed thus notable nitrification was not achieved in the water phase by the suspended aob and nob one possible explanation for decreased nitrite concentrations with reduced nom could be that nitrite ions were more available for the nob if the heterotrophic matrix of the biofilm was less dense the aob would have generally been closer to the nob thus the material transfer of nitrite ions from aob to nob would have generally been faster a related effect has been observed in nitrifying activated sludge plants when the supply of nitrite to nob deteriorated during a process disturbance kaelin et al 2009 knapp and graham 2007 3 5 the applicability of the models the apparent and pseudo first rate models allowed us to interpret the changes that the reduced nom had on the biofilm resulting in differences in nitrite formation the other conditions temperature flow total residual chlorine alkalinity and hardness were controlled in order to only observe the consequences of reduced nom the applicability of the pseudo first rate models was evaluated with ammonium test data on the first eight tests weeks 31 34 with one or more samples after the first day see figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary information section the coefficients of determination r 2 for nitrite formation in tests with ammonium ranged from 0 57 to 0 99 median 0 90 n 8 thus it was considered that the pseudo first rate model was sufficient to describe the data of the tests that lasted one week usually the growth rate of the microbes is included in modeling nitrification in dwdss schrantz et al 2013 wahman et al 2011 woolschlager et al 2001 yang et al 2008a this is mainly needed for long term prediction however in our research we wanted to compare two conditions and using simpler reaction rate models was sufficient for this also the pseudo first order model was the simplest possible model that could separate the ammonium and nitrite reaction rates from each other 3 6 the natural organic matter the nom concentration in tap water and influent water were analyzed in a sampling campaign during the tests with reduced nom as toc and aoc weeks 47 50 the target was to compare the tap water and diluted influent from exactly the same tap water the toc concentration was reduced from 1 9 mg l 1 to 1 1 mg l 1 while aoc was reduced from 150 μgc l 1 to 120 μgc l 1 as medians this confirmed that the experimental procedure was able to reduce the nom content of the influent aoc is supposed to be the main source for biofilm regrowth by heterotrophic bacteria ross et al 2013 according to the results of the sampling campaign the difference in aoc was not as remarkable as the difference in toc the minor difference in aoc may have been a result of the relatively high phosphorus content of the sample waters 5 μg l 1 compared with ordinary drinking water in finland below the loq of 0 5 μg l 1 it has been reported that normally phosphorus is the limiting nutrient in aoc assays not nom miettinen et al 1996 nevertheless the nom dilution method of the current study did not alter the general size distribution of the nom molecules thus the observations were not attributable to changes in the molecular size range as huang et al 2016 had noticed 3 7 the possibility of denitrification and other reactions of nitrogen the nitrogen balances were calculated to evaluate the possibility of reactions that are capable of changing the total amount of nitrogen in the water phase denitrification anammox and nitrogen accumulation as detected the biofilm contained bacteria capable of these reactions see the supplementary information section section 5 the total balance error of nitrogen inputs and outputs during the whole tests was calculated according to equation 9 a minor amount of nitrogen was increased total nitrogen in sds1 1 1 of the feed total nitrogen in sds2 2 0 of the feed inorganic nitrogen in sds1 0 3 of the feed inorganic nitrogen in sds2 1 0 of the feed the total amounts of increase were however small compared to the weekly variation of the balances total nitrogen in sds1 5 6 to 8 9 of the feed total nitrogen in sds2 5 0 to 7 2 of the feed inorganic nitrogen in sds1 5 0 to 4 6 of the feed inorganic nitrogen in sds2 7 0 to 8 1 of the feed thus the effect of the reactions accumulating or releasing nitrogen were not significant as a whole although denitrifying organisms and denitrification have been observed in dwdss nagymate et al 2016 and sdss masters et al 2015 the reactions requiring low oxygen concentrations the denitrification of nitrite or nitrate and anammox were not likely because the minimum oxygen concentration of the water was 8 8 mgo2 l 1 thus the anoxic conditions were only possible in the deep parts of the biofilm and these are strongly limited by mass transfer into and out of the biofilm because nitrite formed in the tests a one step complete ammonium oxidation comammox reaction daims et al 2015 was unlikely with normal nom however the occurrence of comammox could not be excluded in the tests with reduced nom especially because nitrospira sp the type of bacteria capable of comammox was observed in the biofilm 4 conclusions the effects of natural organic matter nom on nitrite formation in the conditions of non disinfected tap water were studied in simulated distribution systems sdss with an emphasis on both ammonium and nitrite oxidation the tests revealed that reducing the nom concentration declined the nitrite levels furthermore this research suggested that nitrite oxidation dominated nitrite formation in the conditions of water distribution the results of this research emphasize the benefits of nom removal at water treatment plants wtps decreasing nom at wtps with non disinfected drinking water distribution systems dwdss could constitute a promising alternative for reducing nitrite concentrations in the distributed water furthermore the observed strong dependence of nitrite concentrations on nitrite oxidation is a fruitful starting point for analyzing nitrification episodes in disinfected dwdss declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

19987,nitrite in drinking water is a potentially harmful substance for humans and controlling nitrite formation in drinking water distribution systems dwdss is highly important the effect of natural organic matter nom on the formation of nitrite in simulated distribution systems was studied the objective was to inspect how a reduced nom concentration affected nitrite development via nitrification separated from the effects of disinfection we observed that nitrite formation was noticeably sensitive to the changes in the nom concentrations nitrite declined with reduced nom toc 1 0 mg l 1 but increased with the normal nom concentration of tap water toc 1 6 mg l 1 ammonium oxidation was not altered by the reduced nom however nitrite oxidation was enhanced significantly according to the pseudo first order reaction rate model interpretation the enhanced nitrite oxidation was observed with both ammonium and nitrite as the initial nitrogen source the theoretical maximum nitrite concentrations were higher with the normal concentration of nom than with reduced nom the results suggest that the role of nitrite oxidation may be quite important in nitrite formation in dwdss and worth further studies as a practical result our study supported enhanced nom removal in non disinfected dwdss graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrite nitrification natural organic matter water distribution systems non disinfected conditions 1 introduction nitrification and nitrite formation are unwanted but widely observed occurrences in drinking water distribution with water containing free ammonium or an ammonium source autotrophic nitrification is a two phase microbiological reaction first ammonium is oxidized into nitrite equation 1 and second nitrite is oxidized into nitrate equation 2 as follows 1 2 nh4 3 o2 2 no2 2 h2o 4 h 2 2 no2 o2 2 no3 equation 1 is called nitritation and equation 2 is called nitratation nitrite is formed as an intermediate product of these two reactions nitritation occurs by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitratation by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob the most common type of aob is nitrosomonas sp and the most common type of nob is nitrospira sp the aob and the nob are aerobic chemolithoautotrophic organisms that consume carbon dioxide and do not need organic matter for their growth in general organic matter suppresses nitrification this effect is largely due to competition between the fast growing organic matter consuming heterotrophic bacteria and the slowly growing aob and nob which lose in this competition for substrate oxygen nutrients and space furthermore aob and nob are forced deeper into biofilms by rapid heterotrophic growth which leads to a greater mass transport resistance furumai and rittmann 1994 rittmann and manem 1992 in drinking water natural organic matter nom originates from the surface or groundwater used as raw water in water treatment while most of the particulate nom is removed during drinking water production soluble nom remains in the distributed water nissinen et al 2001 in drinking water distribution systems dwdss nom has been observed to have opposing effects on nitrification in most research in the usa high nom concentrations were associated with increased nitrite formation harrington et al 2002 wilczak et al 2003 yang et al 2008b zhang et al 2010 on the other hand decreasing nom by granular activated carbon gac filtration has induced increased nitrite concentrations in the usa and finland skadsen 1993 vahala et al 1999 however the research of skadsen et al included the addition of monochloramine prior the gac filters which caused nitrification in the biofilm of the gac filter thus the dwds was inoculated with aob and nob from the produced water furthermore in canada no correlation between nom and nitrite concentrations was found in two dwdss scott et al 2015 huang et al 2016 noticed that the dissolved organic matter dom in the molecular size range of 200 500 g mol 1 correlated positively with oxidized nitrogen and with active bacterial cells in a dwds disinfected with monochloramine nitrite can be formed in dwdss from the ammonium in the raw water for example in china ammonium concentrations of 0 1 3 mg l 1 have been reported and the highest values may reach more than 10 mg l 1 zhang et al 2019 also in denmark the groundwater used as drinking water contained ammonium and nitrite schullehner et al 2017 moreover a common disinfectant monochloramine provides ammonium when decomposed thus promoting nitrite formation harrington et al 2002 wilczak et al 1996 wolfe et al 1990 it has also been observed that a significant share of monochloramine itself can be directly metabolized into nitrite maestre et al 2016 wahman et al 2016 in dwdss nitrification can be prevented by other disinfection chemicals for example free chlorine rosenfeldt et al 2009 however chlorination enhances the formation of disinfection by products dbps according to the european directive 98 83 ec the maximum admissible concentrations of nitrite nitrate and ammonium in drinking water are 0 5 mg l 1 50 mg l 1 and 0 5 mg l 1 respectively european council 1998 the effect of nom on nitrite formation in dwdss with disinfection chemicals especially monochloramine has been inspected in several studies as described above however studies without disinfection chemicals are rare thus to determine the effects of nom separated from the effects of disinfection chemicals laboratory scale tests were organized in this study non disinfected dwdss are common for example in europe lipponen et al 2002 schullehner et al 2017 waak et al 2018 the objective of the study was to evaluate how the nitrite concentrations are affected by reduced concentrations of nom in conditions relevant to water distribution furthermore the focus was to understand the roles of both nitritation and nitratation 2 materials and methods 2 1 a description of the simulated distribution systems nitrite formation was studied in two simulated distribution systems sdss each sds consisted of a 22 m pipe loop and a covered water tank material polypropylene the flow was generated by a magnet pump iwaki md 30rvm 220n japan and measured with a water meter suve svi 1511 finland the sdss were equipped with pressure gauges freescale semiconductor mxp5050dp usa and thermometers nokeval pt100 sensor with a transmitter 620 finland see fig 1 a the external diameter of the pipe was 25 mm the wall thickness was 2 3 mm and the material was polyethylene uponor blue stripe finland a vent valve was installed at the highest point of each pipe loop the sdss were operated in a closed and temperature regulated room at the temperature of 18 c with a positive water pressure of 0 2 bar and a volumetric flow of 0 1 m3 h 1 the water was pumped from the bottom of the tank through the pipe loop and returned to the tank below the water level five biofilm collectors were installed in the pipe loops each consisting of 0 6 m of water pipe with pvc valves at both ends two similar sdss named sds1 and sds2 were built in the research laboratory of water engineering in aalto university espoo finland before starting the operation of the sdss the tanks and pipe loops were shock chlorinated and rinsed with tap water and consequently with water purified with reverse osmosis ro water furthermore a final rinsing was done by circulating ro water through the sdss for three weeks to dissolve the remnants of organic carbon and nutrients from the unused materials to grow the nitrifying biofilm the sdss were operated for 30 weeks before nitrification was established tap water 30 l was changed weekly in both sdss with ammonium additions to the level of 200 μgn l 1 in the sdss the hydraulic retention time was 18 min and in the pipe loop 4 min the volume of the pipe loop 7 2 l the influent water was dechlorinated water dechlorination was organized in a temperature regulated research room by storing the tap water in closed vats for one week before adding it to the sdss the vats were rinsed with ro water for several weeks before use a similar three day dechlorination method has been used by zhang et al 2008 on week 16 phosphorus addition to the level of 5 μgp l 1 lehtola et al 2002 was initiated in order to boost the growth of nitrifiers see the supplementary information section table s1 the whole study lasted for 59 weeks 2 2 nitrification tests four types of nitrification test were executed in order to evaluate the nitrite formation see fig 1b in the tests two nom concentrations were applied the normal nom concentration of the tap water and a reduced nom concentration these were combined with ammonium and nitrite as the initial substrates for nitrification the nom in the tap water of the helsinki metropolitan area originates from lake päijänne in southern finland coordinates 61 36 50 n 25 28 55 e the median concentration of nom as total non purgeable organic carbon toc in the freshly produced tap water was 1 6 mg l 1 range 1 4 2 0 mg l 1 during 2010 2015 furthermore the nitrogen fractions in the water entering the dwds during 2010 2015 were ammonium including monochloramine 100 190 μgn l 1 nitrite 3 43 μgn l 1 nitrate 250 370 μgn l 1 and total nitrogen 350 660 μgn l 1 the tests were organized as batch tests new influent was introduced once a week and the biofilm inside the pipe loop once grown was kept intact in commencing all tests the required chemicals were inserted as solutions to the influent water in the tank see the supplementary information section table s1 for the concentrations and volumes of the solutions thereafter the fresh influent was introduced into the biofilm by pumping it through the pipe loop at the maximum flow 1 0 m3 h 1 for 10 min subsequently the flow was adjusted to 0 1 m3 h 1 and the first sample taken ammonium tests were started on week 31 with two trial tests nitrite tests were initiated on week 35 and after two consecutive nitrite tests they were performed alternating weeks with ammonium tests see the timetable in table s2 in the supplementary information section in a nitrite test the water was first introduced into the tank and pumped through the pipe loop with a 0 1 m3 h 1 flow for 24 h to get rid of the ammonium content of the tap water utilizing nitrification in the pipe loop the nom concentration of the water was reduced by mixing 15 l of tap water with 15 l of ro water for example distilled water has earlier been used for this purpose zhang et al 2010 the ro water was stored for one week in the research room similarly to the tap water storage the hardness and alkalinity of the diluted tap water were amended with calcium magnesium and hydrogen carbonate ions see table s1 in the supplementary information section in addition nitrate was amended between weeks 44 and 50 the sdss were operated similarly resulting as two similar nitrification tests each week this was done particularly because two biological processes tend to drift apart even though they are operated similarly douterelo et al 2013 thus the manipulations were organized sequentially with a final verification with the initial conditions tests with normal nom were performed first for eight weeks and for four weeks in the end tests with reduced nom were performed for eleven weeks in between see the timetable in the supplementary information section table s2 2 3 water and biofilm sampling and analyses nitrite formation was monitored by sampling and analyzing the concentrations of ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 nitrate no3 and total nitrogen ntot from the water in the tanks for example zhang et al 2008 tracked aob and nob activity by measuring the loss of ammonia and the production of nitrite and nitrate the sampling intervals varied between tests and lasted 0 75 24 h during the first 1 3 days of the tests except for the trial tests which were only sampled with a 24 h interval the final effluents were sampled when they were removed from the tanks the nitrogen fractions of water samples were analyzed in the laboratory of water and environmental engineering according to the methods in table s3 in the supplementary information section all the ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations were reported as nitrogen see table 1 the samples were analyzed during the same day and if the analysis took longer than one day the samples were stored in 4 c two replicates of each analysis were performed the concentration of dissolved oxygen and the ph of the water were measured after each sampling in addition general water quality was analyzed once a month for toc heterotrophic plate count hpc hardness total residual chlorine cl2 ph alkalinity and turbidity table 1 nom was analyzed as assimilable organic carbon aoc and toc from tap water and the influent during the tests with reduced nom in a sampling campaign weeks 47 50 all the water analysis methods are related in the supplementary information section table s3 after all of the tests in week 59 the biofilm collectors were sampled according to the description in the supplementary information section section 3 the microbial community of biofilms were analyzed for the share of aob nob and the most abundant bacterial species according to the description in table s4 in the supplementary information section other analyses performed from the biofilm samples were a total bacterial count with the dapi staining and suspended solids ss see table s4 in the supplementary information section 2 4 calculations and statistical methods apparent reaction rates were calculated by fitting a line in the first linear part of the nitrite concentration changes in the ammonium tests the slope of the line was taken as the rate 3 r m no2 where r apparent reaction rate μgn l 1h 1 and m no2 the slope of the nitrite concentration change μgn l 1h 1 the apparent rates were calculated for four or five pairs of time and concentration in addition nitritation and nitratation reactions were inspected with a model of two consecutive and irreversible first order reactions equations 4 6 pseudo first order modeling is often used for example when the biodegradation of micropollutants is examined ternes and joss 2006 for simplicity we approximated the sdss as completely mixed reactors and the concentrations in the tank were taken as the concentrations of the effluent this assumption caused a small error however since all the tests were treated equally they are comparable to each other the pseudo first order kinetic equation for nitritation follows 4 nh4 t nh4 0 exp k nh4 t where nh4 t ammonium concentration at time t μgn l 1 nh4 0 the initial ammonium concentration μgn l 1 k nh4 the pseudo first order reaction rate constant for ammonium h 1 and t time h the pseudo first order kinetic equation for two consecutive reactions nitritation and nitratation follows no2 t no2 0 exp k no2 t nh4 0 k nh4 k no2 k nh4 exp k nh4 t exp k no2 t 5 k nh4 k no2 where no2 t nitrite concentration at time t μgn l 1 no2 0 the initial nitrite concentration μgn l 1 and k no2 pseudo first order reaction rate constant for nitrite h 1 the pseudo first order kinetic equation for nitrate formation was calculated with the nitrogen balance as follows 6 no3 t nh4 0 no2 0 no3 0 nh4 t no2 t where no3 t nitrate concentration at time t μgn l 1 no3 0 initial nitrate concentration μgn l 1 the theoretical maximum nitrite concentration occurs according to the two consecutive pseudo first order reactions model at the time t max with a zero initial nitrite concentration as follows 7 t max 1 k nh4 k no2 ln k nh4 k no2 in the tests with nitrite as the initial substrate the pseudo first order reaction rate constants for nitrite k no2 were calculated from equation 8 as follows 8 no2 t no2 0 exp k no2 t equations 4 and 8 were solved for k nh4 or k no2 in the logarithmic form equation 5 was solved for k no2 utilizing the least squares method the theoretical maximum nitrite concentrations for each pair of k nh4 and k no2 were calculated by fitting t max from equation 7 into equation 5 as t the error of the nitrogen balance during the whole test period was calculated to evaluate the possibility of reactions that increase or decrease nitrogen in the water phase according to equation 9 as follows 9 ε n influent n samples n effluent ε is the nitrogen balance error μg n influents is the sum of nitrogen of all the influent waters μg n samples is the sum of nitrogen taken in all of the water samples μg n effluent is the sum of nitrogen of all the removed effluent waters μg the sum of nitrogen was calculated by weighing the individual nitrogen concentrations by the corresponding water volume the data sets of reaction rates and reaction rate constants were tested for normality with the anderson darling test the normally distributed data the pseudo first order reaction rate constants of nitrite with normal and reduced nom and with ammonium and nitrite as the initial substrate and the separated data of sds1 and sds2 with normal and reduced nom were compared with student s t test and non normally distributed the apparent reaction rates of nitrite and the pseudo first order reaction rate constants of ammonium with normal and reduced nom with wilcoxon s rank sum test data was collected in microsoft excel testing and data analysis were performed in mathworks matlab version r2019a and the figures were finalized in adobe illustrator cc 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrite formation nitrite formation responded consistently to the changes in nom concentrations in the nitrification tests with ammonium with the normal nom of the tap water median nom 1 6 mg l 1 as toc nitrite increased while with reduced nom median nom 1 0 mg l 1 as toc nitrite decreased see fig 2 a the nitrite concentrations increased with normal nom by 2 7 μgn l 1 h 1 and decreased with reduced nom by 2 4 μgn l 1 h 1 as medians see fig 2b the difference of the concentration changes was statistically significant wilcoxon s rank sum test zval 3 4 p 6 5 10 4 the apparent nitrite formation rates were evaluated for the initial linear part of the concentration profile as the slope of the linear regression line see equation 3 it is conceivable that the biofilm composition in the pipe loop reacted quickly to the reduced or increased nom because the heterotrophic bacteria have a significantly higher maximum growth rate than the aob and nob the maximum growth rate of the aob and nob is 0 2 0 9 g new cells g cells d 1 and for the heterotrophic bacteria it is 3 0 13 2 g new cells g cells d 1 tchobanoglous et al 2003 nevertheless the two sdss had slightly different patterns of nitrite build up or loss even though they were operated similarly sds2 produced a wider range of rates normal nom 0 4 to 9 9 μgn l 1 h 1 reduced nom 8 6 to 0 3 μgn l 1 h 1 than sds1 normal nom 2 3 to 3 1 μgn l 1 h 1 reduced nom 6 6 to 1 3 μgn l 1 h 1 sds2 demonstrated initially slower rates than sds1 also when the nom concentrations were first reduced on the other hand in the last three tests the rates were slower in sds1 than in sds2 however in its entirety the apparent nitrite formation rates did not differ significantly between sds1 and sds2 normal nom student s t 0 68 p 0 53 reduced nom student s t 0 19 p 0 85 the ranges of the apparent rates in sds1 and sds2 demonstrated that the test design was appropriate it would possibly have been difficult to compare two sdss with different water qualities when the two sdss with the same water quality differed as observed 3 2 comparing the ammonium and nitrite oxidation reactions 3 2 1 the ammonium tests when the ammonium tests were interpreted with the pseudo first order reaction rate models equations 4 6 it was found out that the decrease of nitrite concentrations with reduced nom was a result of nitrite being oxidized more rapidly the values of the reaction rate constant of nitrite k no2 median with normal nom 0 18 h 1 and with reduced nom 0 55 h 1 differed significantly from each other see fig 3 b student s t 6 2 p 2 2 10 6 on the other hand the values of the reaction rate constant of ammonium k nh4 with normal nom median 0 082 h 1 and reduced nom median 0 058 h 1 did not differ significantly see fig 3a student s t 0 9 p 0 37 this indicated that the differences of the nitrite concentrations in the nitrification tests were mainly caused by changes in the nitrite oxidation rates and not by changes in ammonium oxidation all the model fittings can be seen in fig s1 and s2 in the supplementary information section the trial tests with ammonium were also included in the pseudo first order modeling interestingly the ammonium oxidation was not affected significantly by the decreased nom but only nitrite oxidation one probable factor behind this observation is the free energy of transformation δg⁰ which is 290 4 kj mol 1 for ammonium oxidation and only 72 1 kj mol 1 for nitrite oxidation stumm and morgan 2009 thus ammonium oxidation is thermodynamically four times more favorable than nitrite oxidation it is possible that the nob were more sensitive to the changes in their environment because they gained less energy than the aob furthermore the nob have been observed to be impacted by a lower monochloramine concentration than the aob at 25 c gomez alvarez et al 2014 schrantz et al 2013 this also indicates that the nob may be generally more vulnerable to changes in the environment 3 2 2 the nitrite tests the nitrification tests with nitrite as the initial substrate were interpreted with the pseudo first order reaction rate model equation 8 the nitrite tests confirmed that there was a significant difference in the values of the reaction rate constants k no2 with normal and reduced nom student s t 2 1 p 0 050 see fig 4 this finding supported the observations from the ammonium tests all the model fittings can be seen in figs s3 and s4 in the supplementary information section in the nitrite tests the median of k no2 was 0 23 h 1 with normal nom and 0 29 h 1 with reduced nom see fig 4 thus the means of k no2 and k no2 differed by 0 02 h 1 with normal nom and 0 25 h 1 with reduced nom the origin of nitrite may partly explain the difference of the k no2 and k no2 with reduced nom in the nitrite tests the nitrite originated entirely from the water phase contrary to the ammonium tests where most of the nitrite was created inside the biofilm thus nitrite was more readily available for the nob in the ammonium tests because the rates lacked the material transfer resistance of nitrite from the water phase to the insides of the biofilm apparently this explanation is not necessarily relevant for normal nom however it is evident that k no2 and k no2 cannot be used interchangeably 3 3 estimating the theoretical maximum nitrite concentrations the maximum concentrations of nitrite are of interest because they are a potential health hazard in distributed water the conditions leading to high maximum concentrations are to be avoided if possible the pseudo first order model described above allowed us to estimate a theoretical maximum of the nitrite concentration equations 5 and 7 by varying k nh4 and k no2 the model was applied with the initial ammonium concentration of 180 μgn l 1 with no nitrite see fig 5 the maximum nitrite concentrations formed a curved surface on which the lowest maximum nitrites occurred when k nh4 was low and k no2 was high on the other hand the highest concentration was with a combination of high k nh4 and low k no2 the nitrite concentrations are formed as an intermediate reaction product and thus they can form a peak when the initial nitrogen compound is ammonium if the nitrite oxidation rate is high enough compared with the ammonium oxidation rate the peak may be non existent and no extra nitrite is formed the ratio of the reaction rate constants of the two consecutive reactions k nh4 k no2 determined whether nitrite concentration started to increase or decrease initially theoretically in the case of the first trial test with ammonium in sds1 week 31 fig s1a in the supplementary information section if the ratio k nh4 k no2 had been 0 06 or less nitrite would have initially started to decrease here it was 0 94 thus producing a peak in the nitrite concentration profile altogether the median of the ratios of k nh4 k no2 was 0 53 in the tests with normal nom and 0 13 with reduced nom 3 4 the biofilms in the biofilm samples taken after the experiments on week 59 and combined from the biofilms of sds1 and sds2 the relative abundance of the aob nitrosomonas sp was 9 3 and the relative abundance of nob nitrospira sp was 8 7 the high shares of aob and nob demonstrated the existence of nitrification activity in the biofilm the most abundant species was the heterotrophic bacteria bradyrhizobium sp 25 which has earlier been found in abundance in non disinfected sdss aggarwal et al 2018 gomez alvarez et al 2014 however in a full scale study encompassing 18 months and 5 samples this species was not found kelly et al 2014 probably because monochloramine was used for secondary disinfection the rest of the biofilm microbiological composition in our tests is related in the supplementary information section section 5 the total numbers of microbial cells with dapi staining in the biofilms were 5 9 108 cells m 2 in sds1 and 6 8 108 cells m 2 in sds2 furthermore the total solids of the biofilms were 180 mg m 2 in sds1 and 240 mg m 2 in sds2 combined with the share of aob and nob above we can estimate the number of nitrosomonas sp 3 1 108 cells g 1 in sds1 and 2 6 108 cells g 1 in sds2 and nitrospira sp 2 9 108 cells g 1 in sds1 and 2 5 108 cells g 1 in sds2 for example lipponen et al 2002 enumerated 4 2 104 2 2 107 mpn g 1 of aob and 1 8 103 2 3 108 mpn g 1 of nob in the sediment samples of four non chlorinated dwdss our results are analogous with these results taking into account that the latter probably underestimate the share of nob and aob in the biofilm by including inorganic sediments in the mass of the sample the analyses of the biofilm did not however represent the whole test period deducing from the varying nitrite formation rates the biofilms inside the pipe loops went through changes during the tests there were no changes in the way the pipe loops were operated during each test period thus the change in the nitrite formation rates was most probably due to the biofilm change nevertheless the variation in nitrite formation originating from the biofilm changes was included in the statistical variation of all the replicates of each type of nitrification test in full scale dwdss the microbial composition of the biofilm varies along the lengthy pipes with the changing concentrations of the distributed water douterelo et al 2016 gomez alvarez et al 2014 in the sdss of the current study the biofilm was likely more uniform throughout the length of the pipe loops though variation with time occurred as mentioned above the nitrite profiles with normal nom were relatively similar to nitrite formation profiles observed in a monochloraminated full scale dwds rantanen et al 2018 nitrite peaked at the water age of 5 0 6 7 h at full scale while in the current study the nitrite peak occurred at 4 14 h the waters in the tests and at full scale both originated from the same water treatment plant wtp with the difference of monochloramine being used at full scale the concentration of aob and nob in the water may have had an effect on the ammonia and nitrite oxidation rates however we considered this effect minor before the actual tests the biofilm was grown in the pipes for a six month period during which ammonium reduction or nitrite formation were not observed thus notable nitrification was not achieved in the water phase by the suspended aob and nob one possible explanation for decreased nitrite concentrations with reduced nom could be that nitrite ions were more available for the nob if the heterotrophic matrix of the biofilm was less dense the aob would have generally been closer to the nob thus the material transfer of nitrite ions from aob to nob would have generally been faster a related effect has been observed in nitrifying activated sludge plants when the supply of nitrite to nob deteriorated during a process disturbance kaelin et al 2009 knapp and graham 2007 3 5 the applicability of the models the apparent and pseudo first rate models allowed us to interpret the changes that the reduced nom had on the biofilm resulting in differences in nitrite formation the other conditions temperature flow total residual chlorine alkalinity and hardness were controlled in order to only observe the consequences of reduced nom the applicability of the pseudo first rate models was evaluated with ammonium test data on the first eight tests weeks 31 34 with one or more samples after the first day see figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary information section the coefficients of determination r 2 for nitrite formation in tests with ammonium ranged from 0 57 to 0 99 median 0 90 n 8 thus it was considered that the pseudo first rate model was sufficient to describe the data of the tests that lasted one week usually the growth rate of the microbes is included in modeling nitrification in dwdss schrantz et al 2013 wahman et al 2011 woolschlager et al 2001 yang et al 2008a this is mainly needed for long term prediction however in our research we wanted to compare two conditions and using simpler reaction rate models was sufficient for this also the pseudo first order model was the simplest possible model that could separate the ammonium and nitrite reaction rates from each other 3 6 the natural organic matter the nom concentration in tap water and influent water were analyzed in a sampling campaign during the tests with reduced nom as toc and aoc weeks 47 50 the target was to compare the tap water and diluted influent from exactly the same tap water the toc concentration was reduced from 1 9 mg l 1 to 1 1 mg l 1 while aoc was reduced from 150 μgc l 1 to 120 μgc l 1 as medians this confirmed that the experimental procedure was able to reduce the nom content of the influent aoc is supposed to be the main source for biofilm regrowth by heterotrophic bacteria ross et al 2013 according to the results of the sampling campaign the difference in aoc was not as remarkable as the difference in toc the minor difference in aoc may have been a result of the relatively high phosphorus content of the sample waters 5 μg l 1 compared with ordinary drinking water in finland below the loq of 0 5 μg l 1 it has been reported that normally phosphorus is the limiting nutrient in aoc assays not nom miettinen et al 1996 nevertheless the nom dilution method of the current study did not alter the general size distribution of the nom molecules thus the observations were not attributable to changes in the molecular size range as huang et al 2016 had noticed 3 7 the possibility of denitrification and other reactions of nitrogen the nitrogen balances were calculated to evaluate the possibility of reactions that are capable of changing the total amount of nitrogen in the water phase denitrification anammox and nitrogen accumulation as detected the biofilm contained bacteria capable of these reactions see the supplementary information section section 5 the total balance error of nitrogen inputs and outputs during the whole tests was calculated according to equation 9 a minor amount of nitrogen was increased total nitrogen in sds1 1 1 of the feed total nitrogen in sds2 2 0 of the feed inorganic nitrogen in sds1 0 3 of the feed inorganic nitrogen in sds2 1 0 of the feed the total amounts of increase were however small compared to the weekly variation of the balances total nitrogen in sds1 5 6 to 8 9 of the feed total nitrogen in sds2 5 0 to 7 2 of the feed inorganic nitrogen in sds1 5 0 to 4 6 of the feed inorganic nitrogen in sds2 7 0 to 8 1 of the feed thus the effect of the reactions accumulating or releasing nitrogen were not significant as a whole although denitrifying organisms and denitrification have been observed in dwdss nagymate et al 2016 and sdss masters et al 2015 the reactions requiring low oxygen concentrations the denitrification of nitrite or nitrate and anammox were not likely because the minimum oxygen concentration of the water was 8 8 mgo2 l 1 thus the anoxic conditions were only possible in the deep parts of the biofilm and these are strongly limited by mass transfer into and out of the biofilm because nitrite formed in the tests a one step complete ammonium oxidation comammox reaction daims et al 2015 was unlikely with normal nom however the occurrence of comammox could not be excluded in the tests with reduced nom especially because nitrospira sp the type of bacteria capable of comammox was observed in the biofilm 4 conclusions the effects of natural organic matter nom on nitrite formation in the conditions of non disinfected tap water were studied in simulated distribution systems sdss with an emphasis on both ammonium and nitrite oxidation the tests revealed that reducing the nom concentration declined the nitrite levels furthermore this research suggested that nitrite oxidation dominated nitrite formation in the conditions of water distribution the results of this research emphasize the benefits of nom removal at water treatment plants wtps decreasing nom at wtps with non disinfected drinking water distribution systems dwdss could constitute a promising alternative for reducing nitrite concentrations in the distributed water furthermore the observed strong dependence of nitrite concentrations on nitrite oxidation is a fruitful starting point for analyzing nitrification episodes in disinfected dwdss declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

19988,bioassays show promise as a complementary approach to chemical analysis to assess the efficacy of wastewater treatment processes as they can detect the mixture effects of all bioactive chemicals in a sample we investigated the treatment efficacy of ten australian wastewater treatment plants wwtps covering 42 of the national population over seven consecutive days solid phase extracts of influent and effluent were subjected to an in vitro test battery with six bioassays covering nine endpoints that captured the major modes of action detected in receiving surface waters wwtp influents and effluents were compared on the basis of population and flow normalised effect loads which provided insights into the biological effects exhibited by the mixture of chemicals before and after treatment effect removal efficacy varied between effect endpoints and depended on the treatment process an ozonation treatment step had the best treatment efficacy while wwtps with only primary treatment resulted in poor removal of effects effect removal was generally better for estrogenic effects and the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor than for inhibition of photosynthesis which is consistent with the persistence of herbicides causing this effect cytotoxicity and oxidative stress response provided a sum parameter of all bioactive chemicals including transformation products and removal was poorer than for specific endpoints except for photosynthesis inhibition although more than 500 chemicals were analysed the detected chemicals explained typically less than 10 of the measured biological effect apart from algal toxicity where the majority of the effect could be explained by one dominant herbicide diuron overall the current study demonstrated the utility of applying bioassays alongside chemical analysis to evaluate loads of chemical pollution reaching wwtps and treatment efficacy graphical abstract image 1 keywords in vitro bioassay wastewater treatment plant

effluent o malley et al 2020 to date the research has focused on chemical analysis but the mixture of thousands of chemicals present in complex samples such as wastewater means that targeted chemical

density of major australian cities as well as cities worldwide has rapidly increased over the last few decades coffee et al 2016 since different chemicals may be used in consumer products and pharmaceuticals in different regions the effect loads should allow for a better comparison between regions as well as between different wastewater treatment processes bioanalysis was complemented with a target screening analysis of 503 organic micropollutants namely pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps industrial compounds and pesticides on 7 day pooled extracts the mixture effects quantified by the in vitro bioassays were translated into effect loads by relating them to the per capita flow in the considered wwtp the removal efficacy of effect loads by the wwtps was compared with chemical removal efficacy and iceberg modelling was used to determine the contribution of known chemicals to the biological equivalent load 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection influent

provided in table s1 in the supplementary material 2 2 sample enrichment all samples were enriched using solid phase extraction spe with oasis hlb cartridges 400 mg sorbent waters rydalmere australia prior to spe the samples were filtered with 0 2 μm regenerated cellulose filters phenomenex lane cove australia the cartridges were conditioned with 7 ml methanol 7 ml ethyl acetate and 7 ml ultrapure water then between 19 0 and 23 6 ml of sample was enriched per cartridge table s2 ultrapure water blanks and conditioning controls were also included spe blanks after drying the cartridges were eluted with 7 ml methanol and 7 ml ethyl acetate and the extracts were blown down to dryness and immediately resuspended in 500 μl of methanol this gave sample enrichment factors ranging from 37 2 to 47 2 the methanolic extracts were then run in the cell based bioassays section 2 4 for chemical analysis and the algae assay the seven daily extracts were pooled to give a single influent and effluent extract for each wwtp the algae assay required a larger volume of extract than the cell based bioassays so it was only possible to analyse the pooled extracts 2 3 chemical analysis for chemical analysis the pooled extracts were evaporated and then reconstituted with an appropriate volume 69 79 μl of methanol to give an enrichment factor of 40 twenty five microlitres of the methanol extracts were then added to 1 ml ultrapure water to mimic the concentration of the original water sample enrichment factor 1 twenty five microlitres of an internal standard mix containing 40 isotope labelled compounds at 40 ng ml in methanol and 5 μl of a 2 m formate buffer ph 3 5 were added to the reconstituted water samples calibration standards were prepared at twelve levels ranging from 1 to 5000 ng l by adding 25 μl of the respective analyte solution 25 μl of internal standard mix and 5 μl of buffer into 1 ml of water from a pristine stream five hundred and three chemicals table s3 were analysed by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms with the method described in detail in neale et al 2020 and section s1 of the supplementary material the concentrations reported are referring to water concentrations after spe which facilitates a direct comparison with the bioanalysis data and is inherently consistent for quantification of treatment efficacy but does not account for spe recovery which will be affected by the spe sorbent and the sample blow down steps oasis hlb typically has good recovery 80 of neutral chemicals with a log octanol water partition coefficient log k ow between 1 and 5 but is less suitable for very polar chemicals and charged chemicals koke et al 2018 osorio et al 2018 2 4 bioanalysis the extracts were analysed in five reporter gene bioassays table 1 that were indicative of xenobiotic metabolism activation of ahr binding to pparγ hormone receptor mediated effects activation of erα and gr and adaptive stress response pathways oxidative stress response all reporter gene assays were run in a 384 well plate format with detailed information about the reporter gene assays described in könig et al 2017 and neale et al 2017a briefly 50 μl of each extract was blown to dryness then resuspended in assay media to avoid any solvent in the bioassays on the bioassay plate the maximum extract concentration expressed in units of relative enrichment factor ref ranged from 4 0 to 4 9 and each sample was run in an 11 step serial dilution series down to 1000 fold lower ref in duplicate the assay reference compound and negative controls were included on every plate cell viability was assessed for all reporter gene assays using an incucyte s3 live cell imaging system essen bioscience ann arbor michigan usa escher et al 2019 only concentrations with less than 10 cytotoxicity ic10 were used to evaluate activation to prevent cytotoxicity from masking the effect example in figure s1 a in addition the combined algae test was run in a 96 well plate format with the green alga raphidocelis subcapitata and detected three endpoints table 1 inhibition of photosynthesis after 2h and 24h to distinguish fast acting herbicides from

the cell viability in all reporter gene cell lines only concentrations ic10 were used for further evaluation the concentration causing 10 effect ec10 was derived from linear concentration effect curves up to 30 effect for assays indicative of xenobiotic metabolism receptor mediated effects and the combined algae test the effect in the oxidative stress response assay was expressed as the effect concentration causing an induction ratio of 1 5 ecir1 5 using linear concentration effect curves up to an induction ratio of 4 further information about bioassay data evaluation can be found in escher et al 2018b the ec values were expressed in units of ref which takes into consideration sample enrichment by spe and dilution in the assay a ref of 10 means the sample needs to be enriched 10 times before 10 effect or an induction ratio of 1 5 is observed the ec values were converted to bioanalytical equivalent concentrations for bioanalysis beqbio equation 1 beqbio were expressed as benzo

tulbio equation 4 and chemical concentration ci in ng l to mass load ml equation 5 to better compare between wwtps belbio and ml both in units of ng person day and tulbio in units of lbioassay person

calculated using blank corrected beqbio values only samples that had a beqbio value of 50 or higher than the beqbio of the spe blanks were used to calculate removal removal efficacy was also calculated for the analysed chemicals in the pooled samples based on the ml in the influent mlinfluent and the ml in the effluent mleffluent equation 8 if a chemical was below the lod in the effluent

equivalent load from chemical analysis belchem was calculated using the ml i of each detected chemical in the pooled samples and its relative effect potency repi relative to the reference chemical equation 9 repi was calculated using the ec value of the assay reference compound and the ec value of the detected chemical with ec values for the majority of detected chemicals published in neale et al 2020 all ec and repi values used for iceberg modelling are provided in table s5 9 bel chem i 1 n ml i rep i belchem was only calculated for the bioassays indicative of xenobiotic metabolism adaptive stress responses and the combined algae assay as the chemical analysis did not target chemicals active in erα and gr belchem was compared to the corresponding average belbio value for the influent and effluent of each wwtp this is analogous to iceberg modelling using beqbio and bioanalytical equivalent concentration from chemical analysis beqchem neale et al 2018 the contribution of each detected chemical i to belchem was calculated using tip of the iceberg modelling based on neale et al 2020 equation 10 10 contribution of i to bel chem rep i ml i bel chem 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioanalysis influent and effluent extracts collected over a 7 day period for each wwtp were run in the bioassays with all ec values shown in fig s2 and table s2 example concentration effect curves for plant s4 are provided in fig s1 the assays indicative of activation of er and binding to pparγ were the most responsive in the wastewater influent samples fig s2 the erα assay is highly sensitive to estrogenic compounds such as estrone 17β estradiol and 17α ethinylestradiol which are commonly present in wastewater influent and effluent murk et al 2002 leusch et al 2014 hamilton et al 2016 further many pharmaceuticals such as bezafibrate diclofenac indomethacin and telmisartan are active in pparγ geneblazer neale et al 2017a 2020 oxidative stress response was the least responsive assay with highest ec values while the response in activation of gr was often masked by cytotoxicity in the influent samples due to the much higher burden of non specifically acting compounds in any case most samples induced a response at a ref less than 1 indicating a high effect burden in the wastewater influent extracts the variation in ec values between wwtps and over the 7 days was fairly minimal with no clear trends observed fig s2 the same was true for cytotoxicity with ic10 values fig s3 therefore the daily extracts could be combined prior to testing in the algae assay the algae assay was the only assay run in a 96 well plate format and therefore had a higher volume requirement so it was only possible to analyse the pooled extracts wastewater treatment resulted in reduction of effect for most wwtps with similar ec values in all effluents for most assays the exceptions were wwtps p1 and p2 which both applied primary treatment only where high estrogenic and pparγ activity remained after treatment excluding these wwtps the ec values in effluent extracts were typically greater than ref 1 indicating the samples needed to be enriched to detect an effect the ec values in effluent were in a similar range as previously observed in the literature e g escher et al 2014 volker et al 2017 nivala et al 2018 it should be noted that effluents from australian wwtps are discharged into a mixing zone specified in their operating licence armcanz anzecc 2007 and thus the effects are expected to be even lower outside the mixing zone due to dilution the effect outside of the mixing zone was not assessed in the current study but could be compared with available effect based trigger values to determine if the effect in the receiving environment was acceptable or not escher et al 2018a in addition to the wwtp extracts spe blanks were run in all bioassays these spe blanks did not induce a response in the assays up to the highest tested refs apart from activation of ahr where the spe blanks had an ec10 of ref 1 7 to 1 8 table s2 the cause of the contamination is unknown but may be related to the solvents used for conditioning or elution in any case any wastewater effluent extracts that had the same effect as the spe blanks were excluded from further analysis all ec values were converted via beqbio and tubio to belbio and tulbio to compare effect and cytotoxicity loads between the wwtps and to calculate removal efficacy table s6 seven day averages were calculated to simplify the figures and the following discussions because there was little variation in effects and cytotoxicity during the 7 days figs s2 and s3 the variation in belbio between wwtps was much smaller than beqbio as it was normalised based on the average per capita flow this is demonstrated in fig 1 a where there was less variability between the 17β estradiol equivalent load eelbio in the influent samples for all plants compared to eeqbio eelbio in the influent fig 1b figure were also compared with the expected excretion of estrogenic compounds the average excretion of estrone 17β estradiol and 17α ethinylestradiol in units of μg person day from laurenson et al 2014 was converted to the 17β estradiol equivalent load for chemical analysis eelchem using repi values from konemann et al 2018 this gave an eelchem of 9 87 μge2 person day 9870 nge2 person day which is in a similar range as the influent eelbio values in the current study fig 1b consequently the belbio was calculated for all bioassays and averaged over the 7 days fig 1c but the belbio for each day separately can be found in table s6 as can be seen in fig 1c there was little variation in the average influent belbio values for the 10 wwtps with coefficients of variation ranging from 17 to 65 for the different bioassays and there was no evident relationship between influent quality and treatment type this means the influent quality per capita was very similar across australia and therefore the different plants can be directly compared 3 2 effect and chemical removal the efficacy of effect removal in each wwtp based on belbio is summarised in fig 2 averaging over the 7 days with removal for each wwtp for each day provided in fig s4 and table s7 cytotoxicity tulbio were averaged between all cell lines the average removal efficacy for plants with secondary or tertiary treatment wwtps s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 t1 t2 t3 ranged from 39 for ahr activity and 41 for 2h psii inhibition to 93 for estrogenic activity and pparγ activity and cytotoxicity tulbio were reduced by 42 84 removal was much lower in wwtps p1 and p2 which had only primary treatment with on average 16 removal of ahr activity and 11 removal of estrogenic activity herbicides detected by algal toxicity had only 18 removal in wwtp p1 and were not removed in wwtp p2 for pparγ activity and oxidative stress response the removal was negative with 5 and 11 respectively and cytotoxicity tulbio also increased slightly from influent to effluent fig 2 apparent negative removal may stem from fluctuations in input because samples were taken at the same time and do not represent the same water parcel given there were hardly any variations in effect during the 7 days in the influent these should be minor fluctuations certain chemicals may also form during treatment if they are excreted as conjugates that are not or less active in the in vitro assays and cleaved back to the bioactive parent chemical in the effluent this has been hypothesised for the pharmaceutical carbamazepine and its glucuronic conjugate vieno et al 2007 variable removal of ahr activity during wastewater treatment has been reported in the literature with 13 90 removal observed jalova et al 2013 nivala et al 2018 similar pparγ removal efficacy has also been observed previously with between 69 and 94 removal reported bain et al 2014 nivala et al 2018 up to 99 7 removal of estrogenic activity was observed which fits with previous studies where between 80 and 99 removal was reported e g jugan et al 2009 jalova et al 2013 escher et al 2014 hamilton et al 2016 houtman et al 2018 nivala et al 2018 removal of gr activity could only be calculated for wwtp t1 with most samples either cytotoxic or inactive in gr geneblazer between 67 and 69 removal of gr activity was observed poor to moderate removal of gr activity has previously been reported with between 7 and 66 removal efficacy observed bain et al 2014 roberts et al 2015 houtman et al 2018 oxidative stress response removal varied between wwtps and over time with between 10 and 90 removal efficacy observed average of 60 in all plants except p1 and p2 fewer studies have considered oxidative stress response removal during wastewater treatment processes though between 61 and 85 removal has previously been reported volker et al 2017 nivala et al 2018 algal toxicity is driven by herbicides which are typically poorly removed by secondary treatment as was observed previously with 48 removal of 2h psii inhibition deq and 38 removal of 24h psii inhibition deq by secondary treatment escher et al 2008 ozonation also improved treatment efficacy to over 80 escher et al 2009 which is consistent with our findings for t3 cytotoxicity was not removed after primary treatment though it was often well removed after secondary and tertiary treatment which aligns well with the removal of chemicals stalter et al 2011 also found cytotoxicity was well removed by secondary and tertiary wastewater treatment using a rat pituitary cell line assay for comparison with effect load the chemical concentrations reported in table s3 were converted to mass loads ml table s8 the sum of ml in the influent was very similar for all wwtps and ranged from 0 13 to 0 34 g person day which was consistent with the little variation of effect loads of all influents a detailed analysis of the chemical removal is beyond the scope of the present work and will be forthcoming in a study by other authors the removal efficacy of all chemicals detected in the wwtp influent are provided in table s8 and summarised in fig 2 with each grey dot representing one chemical removal efficacy varied between wwtps and for different chemicals but aligned well with the belbio and tulbio removal efficacy results fig 2 although the differences between individual chemicals were evidently much larger than between different bioassays 3 3 iceberg modelling iceberg modelling serves to compare the measured effect of the water sample with the predicted mixture effect of the detected chemicals and was only performed for ahr pparγ oxidative stress response and the combined algae assay since no natural and pharmaceutical hormones were included in the chemical analysis iceberg modelling was not meaningful for er and gr in these assays a small number of highly potent chemicals typically explains most of the effect e g leusch et al 2010 schriks et al 2010 jia et al 2016 konemann et al 2018 which means that it is sufficient to perform bioanalysis to evaluate the removal efficacy for estrogenic chemicals in addition no iceberg modelling was performed for cytotoxicity an average belbio value was calculated for the influent and effluent samples for iceberg modelling table s9 to compare with belchem derived from the chemical analysis of the pooled extracts belchem was calculated using effect data for reporter gene assays provided in neale et al 2020 an additional 15 active chemicals contributed to belchem for the three assays in the current study with effect data collected from the tox21 database or the literature neale et al 2017a the effect data for 13 herbicides and 12 non herbicides in the combined algae test were from glauch and escher 2020 the average percent contribution of known chemicals to belchem for each assay is shown in fig s5 in each bioassay there were a few dominant chemicals but they differed from assay to assay the pharmaceutical telmisartan and the herbicide diuron dominated the b a p elchem and telmisartan was also the main contributor to rosiglitazone elchem in the case of the oxidative stress response phytoestrogen daidzein dominated in influent while industrial compound 2 benzothiazolesulfonic acid dominated in effluent the deqchem in the combined algae assay was dominated by diuron this analysis of chemicals contributing to belchem is equivalent to the widely used toxic unit approach for chemical analysis where literature ecotoxicity data is used to scale and sum the detected concentrations massei et al 2018 kandie et al 2020 here we can additionally compare the belchem with the belbio to estimate which fraction of the overall effect can be explained by the detected chemicals thirty four chemicals contributed to b a p elchem for activation of ahr with industrial compound 2 4 dichlorophenol having the overall highest contribution to b a p elchem but only in wwtp t2 1 1 μgb a p person day telmisartan and diuron were the dominant contributors to b a p elchem and because they were hardly removed by secondary treatment there was no change in their b a p elchem during treatment except for wwtp t3 which had additional ozonation fig 3 the same applied to the antifungal climbazole and 2 benzothioazole sulfonic acid in contrast the phytoestrogens daidzein and genistein which contributed substantially to b a p elchem in the influent were well degraded and hardly detectable in the effluents apart from wwtps p1 and p2 which lacked secondary treatment comparing b a p elchem to the corresponding average b a p elbio value only up to 0 56 of the activation of ahr load could be explained by the 34 detected active chemicals with a similar fraction explained for both influent and effluent samples table s9 for comparison with 40 active chemicals up to 2 8 of the activation of ahr response could be explained by known chemicals in surface water samples from germany neale et al 2020 we had effect data for 72 of the 503 targeted chemicals but the majority was inactive with only 69 19 having ec10 values given that there are likely to be tens of thousands of chemicals present in a water sample and even if only 19 activate ahr it is conceivable that the detected chemicals explain only a low fraction of the effect the detected ahr active chemicals had repi values from 7 10 7 to 6 10 4 indicating that the targeted chemicals were of very low potency hence chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which were not analysed and would be expected to be present in very low concentrations but which have very high repi values could have contributed substantially to the mixture effects only 19 of the detected chemicals contributed to rosiglitazone elchem in the pparγ assay but they had much higher repi values than the detected chemicals in ahr telmisartan had the highest repi of 0 003 and was a major contributor to rosiglitazone elchem in most wwtps with little difference in rosiglitazone elchem between the influent and effluent for most wwtps due to poor removal of telmisartan fig s6 the herbicide 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid had the highest contribution to rosiglitazone elchem but only in the influent of wwtp t2 because of its very high concentration despite a low repi value of 6 10 5 between 0 16 and 9 3 of belbio could be explained by detected chemicals in pparγ geneblazer table s9 a much larger fraction of the effect could be explained in the effluent maximum 9 3 average 5 0 compared to the influent samples maximum 0 71 average 0 39 this suggests that unknown chemicals that activate pparγ were better removed than known activators of pparγ but it is also possible that individual contributors fell below the analytical detection limit in the effluent but still contributed to mixture effects the fraction explained by known chemicals was higher than observed in previous studies e g könig et al 2017 neale et al 2018 and can be explained by the high load of the potent pparγ activator telmisartan which was present at 384 1533 μg person day in all samples except for wwtp t3 effluent telmisartan is used to treat high blood pressure and was among the top 10 most commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals based on daily dose in australia in 2015 pharmaceutical benefits advisory committee 2016 forty six of the detected chemicals contributed to dichlorvos elchem in the oxidative stress assay with daidzein repi 0 41 having the greatest contribution in the influent samples fig s7 chemicals such as daidzein genistein repi 0 49 and the alkaloid piperine repi 0 39 primarily contributed to dichlorvos elchem in the influent samples but had low to no input to dichlorvos elchem in the effluent samples due to their good removal efficacy 98 except for in wwtps p1 and p2 between 26 and 39 removal for daidzein genistein and piperine in p1 and p2 in contrast the dichlorvos elchem was often similar in the influent and effluent for poorly removed compounds such as 2 benzothiazolesulfonic acid diuron and the pharmaceutical mebendazole dichlorvos elchem could only explain between 0 0004 and 0 20 of dichlorvos elbio with little difference between the influent and effluent samples table s9 according to the literature martin et al 2010 a large fraction of chemicals can activate the oxidative stress response three hundred and fifty seven of the targeted chemicals had experimental data and 24 thereof were active as for ahr it is likely that many chemicals present but not targeted may cause the large observed oxidative stress response the low fraction explained is consistent with other studies also finding that known chemicals could typically explain less than 1 of the observed effect in water samples escher et al 2013 tang et al 2014 neale et al 2015 in the case of algal toxicity there were fewer herbicides detected than in european wwtp effluents glauch and escher 2020 but the effects were still dominated by herbicides with only a minor contribution by biocide triclosan which is well removed by secondary and tertiary treatment and has a lower repi than most herbicides i e reptriclosan was 0 002 0 004 for inhibition of photosynthesis after 2h and 24h respectively glauch and escher 2020 by a large margin diuron dominated the effect and explained between 70 and 100 of the delchem for 2h psii inhibition fig 4 and 24h psii inhibition fig s8 and somewhat less for 24h growth inhibition fig s9 the other herbicides made up the rest of the effect apart from 24h growth inhibition where triclosan contributed up to 40 of delchem due to the reptriclosan of 0 13 for this endpoint the delchem explained on average 48 of the delbio for 2h psii inhibition table s9 and 58 for 24h psii inhibition but less than 10 for 24h growth inhibition where many other chemicals can contribute to the effect and the herbicides are of lower relative potency this is consistent with previous work on advanced water treatment tang and escher 2014 where in wwtp effluent between 47 and 73 of algal toxicity could be explained by the combined action of atrazine diuron hexazinone and simazine 3 4 implications the study presented here is unique because it covered wwtps at major cities capturing 42 and more than 9 mio of the australian population of 23 401 892 people at census day 2016 thanks to sampling during a population census a very precise population estimate was possible and hence the measured concentrations could be converted to per capita mass and bioanalytical equivalent loads in units of ng person day this was an excellent basis for direct comparison between treatment efficacy of different plants with respect to mixture effects however even if no flow and population data are available bioanalytical equivalent concentrations are still very useful to compare plants and to evaluate if the overall effects in the effluent are safe for the receiving waters after dilution jarosova et al 2014 further after applying a dilution factor appropriate to the circumstances of a given wwtp the expected contribution of effect to surface water could be predicted and the resulting beq in surface water compared with existing surface water effect based trigger values escher et al 2018a effluents from australian wwtps are discharged into a mixing zone but effects both within and outside the mixing zone were not evaluated in the current study the removal of mixture effects was clearly related to the treatment type with poorest removal for primary treatment it is interesting to note that both cytotoxicity and oxidative stress response typically had the lowest removal efficacies even after ozonation oxidative stress response is a rather general adaptive stress response often occurring just prior to cytotoxicity biodegradation and ozonation will not necessarily mineralise chemicals but transform them with the transformation products often being more hydrophilic and hence less cytotoxic but still contributing to the mixture effects escher and fenner 2011 therefore these fairly non specific bioassays are important to estimate the overall toxic potency tip of the iceberg modelling showed that the detected chemicals contributing to belchem were often abundant chemicals with moderate to high potency such as telmisartan which had an average total daily load of 18 kg together with its high potency in pparγ it was the dominant risk driver for this endpoint and also important for ahr diuron despite a total load of less than 1 kg per day dominated the algal toxicity due to its very high potency and contributed substantially to ahr activation 2 benzothiazolesulfonic acid 11 kg per day and daidzein 11 kg per day were both drivers for activating the oxidative stress response the mixture risk drivers changed after treatment with recalcitrant chemicals playing a more important role telmisartan and diuron were poorly removed in most wwtps so they remained important before and after treatment 4 conclusions the current study aimed to determine per capita biological equivalent loads in influent and effluent samples collected during the 2016 australian census and to evaluate effect removal efficacy using a bioassay test battery covering different stages of cellular toxicity pathways as well as algal toxicity while bioanalytical equivalent concentrations were rather variable between the wwtp influents translating into bioanalytical equivalent loads reduced the variability effect removal efficacy was poorest for primary treatment with good removal of estrogenic activity and pparγ activity by secondary and tertiary treatment however even secondary treatment did not completely reduce algal toxicity which can be explained by herbicides being rather persistent to biodegradation and only well removed by ozonation with the exception of algal toxicity the detected chemicals could only explain a small fraction 10 of the observed effect the study demonstrates how both bioanalytical equivalent loads and mass loads can be applied in a complementary way to provide a better comparison of removal efficacy between

19988,bioassays show promise as a complementary approach to chemical analysis to assess the efficacy of wastewater treatment processes as they can detect the mixture effects of all bioactive chemicals in a sample we investigated the treatment efficacy of ten australian wastewater treatment plants wwtps covering 42 of the national population over seven consecutive days solid phase extracts of influent and effluent were subjected to an in vitro test battery with six bioassays covering nine endpoints that captured the major modes of action detected in receiving surface waters wwtp influents and effluents were compared on the basis of population and flow normalised effect loads which provided insights into the biological effects exhibited by the mixture of chemicals before and after treatment effect removal efficacy varied between effect endpoints and depended on the treatment process an ozonation treatment step had the best treatment efficacy while wwtps with only primary treatment resulted in poor removal of effects effect removal was generally better for estrogenic effects and the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor than for inhibition of photosynthesis which is consistent with the persistence of herbicides causing this effect cytotoxicity and oxidative stress response provided a sum parameter of all bioactive chemicals including transformation products and removal was poorer than for specific endpoints except for photosynthesis inhibition although more than 500 chemicals were analysed the detected chemicals explained typically less than 10 of the measured biological effect apart from algal toxicity where the majority of the effect could be explained by one dominant herbicide diuron overall the current study demonstrated the utility of applying bioassays alongside chemical analysis to evaluate loads of chemical pollution reaching wwtps and treatment efficacy graphical abstract image 1 keywords in vitro bioassay wastewater treatment plant

effluent o malley et al 2020 to date the research has focused on chemical analysis but the mixture of thousands of chemicals present in complex samples such as wastewater means that targeted chemical analysis cannot detect all chemicals present nor can it accurately predict the toxicity and thus the environmental risk of these complex mixtures escher et al 2020 bioanalytical tools i e in vitro bioassays and well plate based in vivo assays have been proposed as a complementary approach to chemical analysis as they can detect the mixture effects of all active chemicals in a sample including transformation products and unknown chemicals while in vitro bioassays are recommended for water quality monitoring brack et al 2019 they have also been applied to evaluate treatment efficacy by

evaluate effect removal efficacy using a battery of bioassays jia et al 2015 the bioassay test battery included assays indicative of different stages of cellular toxicity pathways including xenobiotic

könig et al 2017 the important xenobiotic metabolism receptors aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr and the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma pparγ were included in the current study because chemicals can stimulate transformation processes in cells to metabolise detoxify or bioactivate chemicals omiecinski et al 2011 hormonal pathways are essential for growth development and reproduction

in vitro bioassays has typically relied on bioanalytical equivalent concentrations an understanding of the per capita effect load in wastewater influent and effluent is important as the population density of major australian cities as well as cities worldwide has rapidly increased over the last few decades coffee et al 2016 since different chemicals may be used in consumer products and pharmaceuticals in different regions the effect loads should allow for a better comparison between regions as well as between different wastewater treatment processes bioanalysis was complemented with a target screening analysis of 503 organic micropollutants namely pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps industrial compounds and pesticides on 7 day pooled extracts the mixture effects quantified by the in vitro bioassays were translated into effect loads by relating them to the per capita flow in the considered wwtp the removal efficacy of effect loads by the wwtps was compared with chemical removal efficacy and iceberg modelling was used to determine the contribution of known chemicals to the biological equivalent load 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection influent

australian population over 9 mio people further information about sample collection can be found in o brien et al 2019 two wwtps p1 p2 had only primary treatment five wwtps s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 had

provided in table s1 in the supplementary material 2 2 sample enrichment all samples were enriched using solid phase extraction spe with oasis hlb cartridges 400 mg sorbent waters rydalmere australia prior to spe the samples were filtered with 0 2 μm regenerated cellulose filters phenomenex lane cove australia the cartridges were conditioned with 7 ml methanol 7 ml ethyl acetate and 7 ml ultrapure water then between 19 0 and 23 6 ml of sample was enriched per cartridge table s2 ultrapure water blanks and conditioning controls were also included spe blanks after drying the cartridges were eluted with 7 ml methanol and 7 ml ethyl acetate and the extracts were blown down to dryness and immediately resuspended in 500 μl of methanol this gave sample enrichment factors ranging from 37 2 to 47 2 the methanolic extracts were then run in the cell based bioassays section 2 4 for chemical analysis and the algae assay the seven daily extracts were pooled to give a single influent and effluent extract for each wwtp the algae assay required a larger volume of extract than the cell based bioassays so it was only possible to analyse the pooled extracts 2 3 chemical analysis for chemical analysis the pooled extracts were evaporated and then reconstituted with an appropriate volume 69 79 μl of methanol to give an enrichment factor of 40 twenty five microlitres of the methanol extracts were then added to 1 ml ultrapure water to mimic the concentration of the original water sample enrichment factor 1 twenty five microlitres of an internal standard mix containing 40 isotope labelled compounds at 40 ng ml in methanol and 5 μl of a 2 m formate buffer ph 3 5 were added to the reconstituted water samples calibration standards were prepared at twelve levels ranging from 1 to 5000 ng l by adding 25 μl of the respective analyte solution 25 μl of internal standard mix and 5 μl of buffer into 1 ml of water from a pristine stream five hundred and three chemicals table s3 were analysed by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms with the method described in detail in neale et al 2020 and section s1 of the supplementary material the concentrations reported are referring to water concentrations after spe which facilitates a direct comparison with the bioanalysis data and is inherently consistent for quantification of treatment efficacy but does not account for spe recovery which will be affected by the spe sorbent and the sample blow down steps oasis hlb typically has good recovery 80 of neutral chemicals with a log octanol water partition coefficient log k ow between 1 and 5 but is less suitable for very polar chemicals and charged chemicals koke et al 2018 osorio et al 2018 2 4 bioanalysis the extracts were analysed in five reporter gene bioassays table 1 that were indicative of xenobiotic metabolism activation of ahr binding to pparγ hormone receptor mediated effects activation of erα and gr and adaptive stress response pathways oxidative stress response all reporter gene assays were run in a 384 well plate format with detailed information about the reporter gene assays described in könig et al 2017 and neale et al 2017a briefly 50 μl of each extract was blown to dryness then resuspended in assay media to avoid any solvent in the bioassays on the bioassay plate the maximum extract concentration expressed in units of relative enrichment factor ref ranged from 4 0 to 4 9 and each sample was run in an 11 step serial dilution series down to 1000 fold lower ref in duplicate the assay reference compound and negative controls were included on every plate cell viability was assessed for all reporter gene assays using an incucyte s3 live cell imaging system essen bioscience ann arbor michigan usa escher et al 2019 only concentrations with less than 10 cytotoxicity ic10 were used to evaluate activation to prevent cytotoxicity from masking the effect example in figure s1 a in addition the combined algae test was run in a 96 well plate format with the green alga raphidocelis subcapitata and detected three endpoints table 1 inhibition of photosynthesis after 2h and 24h to distinguish fast acting herbicides from chemicals with indirect effects on photosynthesis psii inhibition and growth rate inhibition over 24h glauch and escher 2020 this assay is based on the initial combined algae test developed by escher

the cell viability in all reporter gene cell lines only concentrations ic10 were used for further evaluation the concentration causing 10 effect ec10 was derived from linear concentration effect

effect concentration causing an induction ratio of 1 5 ecir1 5 using linear concentration effect curves up to an induction ratio of 4 further information about bioassay data evaluation can be found in escher et al 2018b the ec values were expressed in units of ref which takes into consideration sample enrichment by spe and dilution in the assay a ref of 10 means the sample needs to be enriched 10 times before 10 effect or an induction ratio of 1 5 is observed the ec values were converted to bioanalytical equivalent concentrations for bioanalysis beqbio equation 1 beqbio were expressed as benzo

equivalent load from chemical analysis belchem was calculated using the ml i of each detected chemical in the pooled samples and its relative effect potency repi relative to the reference chemical equation 9 repi was calculated using the ec value of the assay reference compound and the ec value of the detected chemical with ec values for the majority of detected chemicals published in neale et

adaptive stress responses and the combined algae assay as the chemical analysis did not target chemicals active in erα and gr belchem was compared to the corresponding average belbio value for the influent and effluent of each wwtp this is analogous to iceberg modelling using beqbio and bioanalytical equivalent concentration from chemical analysis beqchem neale et al 2018 the contribution of each detected chemical i to belchem was calculated using tip of the iceberg modelling based on neale et al 2020 equation 10 10 contribution of i to bel chem rep i ml i bel chem 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioanalysis influent and effluent extracts collected over a 7 day period for each wwtp were run in the bioassays with all ec values shown in fig s2 and table s2 example concentration effect curves for plant s4 are provided in fig s1 the assays indicative of activation of er and binding to pparγ were the most responsive in the wastewater influent samples fig s2 the erα assay is highly sensitive to estrogenic compounds such as estrone 17β estradiol and 17α ethinylestradiol which are commonly present in wastewater influent and effluent murk et al 2002 leusch et al 2014 hamilton et al 2016 further many pharmaceuticals such as bezafibrate diclofenac indomethacin and telmisartan are active in pparγ geneblazer neale et al 2017a 2020 oxidative stress response was the least responsive assay with highest ec values while the response in activation of gr was often masked by cytotoxicity in the influent samples due to the much higher burden of non specifically acting compounds in any case most samples induced a response at a ref less than 1 indicating a high effect burden in the wastewater influent extracts the variation in ec values between wwtps and over the 7 days was fairly minimal with no clear trends observed fig s2 the same was true for cytotoxicity with ic10 values fig s3 therefore the daily extracts could be combined prior to testing in the algae assay the algae assay was the only assay run in a 96 well plate format and therefore had a higher volume requirement so it was only possible to analyse the pooled extracts wastewater treatment resulted in reduction of effect for most wwtps with similar ec values in all effluents for most assays the exceptions were wwtps p1 and p2 which both applied primary treatment only where high estrogenic and pparγ activity remained after treatment excluding these wwtps the ec values in effluent extracts were typically greater than ref 1 indicating the samples needed to be enriched to detect an effect the ec values in effluent were in a similar range as previously observed in the literature e g escher et al 2014 volker et al 2017 nivala et al 2018 it should be noted that effluents from australian wwtps are discharged into a mixing zone specified in their operating licence armcanz anzecc 2007 and thus the effects are expected to be even lower outside the mixing zone due to dilution the effect outside of the mixing zone was not assessed in the current study but could be compared with available effect based trigger values to determine if the effect in the receiving environment was acceptable or not escher et al 2018a in addition to the wwtp extracts spe blanks were run in all bioassays these spe blanks did not induce a response in the assays up to the highest tested refs apart from activation of ahr where the spe blanks had an ec10 of ref 1 7 to 1 8 table s2 the cause of the contamination is unknown but may be related to the solvents used for conditioning or elution in any case any wastewater effluent extracts that had the same effect as the spe blanks were excluded from further analysis all ec values were converted via beqbio and tubio to belbio and tulbio to compare effect and cytotoxicity loads between the wwtps and to calculate removal efficacy table s6 seven day averages were calculated to simplify the figures and the following discussions because there was little variation in effects and cytotoxicity during the 7 days figs s2 and s3 the variation in belbio between wwtps was much smaller than beqbio as it was normalised based on the average per capita flow this is demonstrated in fig 1 a where there was less variability between the 17β estradiol equivalent load eelbio in the influent samples for all plants compared to eeqbio eelbio in the influent fig 1b figure were also compared with the expected excretion of estrogenic compounds the average excretion of estrone 17β estradiol and 17α ethinylestradiol in units of μg person day from laurenson et al 2014 was converted to the 17β estradiol equivalent load for chemical analysis eelchem using repi values from konemann et al 2018 this gave an eelchem of 9 87 μge2 person day 9870 nge2 person day which is in a similar range as the influent eelbio values in the current study fig 1b consequently the belbio was calculated for all bioassays and averaged over the 7 days fig 1c but the belbio for each day separately can be found in table s6 as can be seen in fig 1c there was little variation in the average influent belbio values for the 10 wwtps with coefficients of variation ranging from 17 to 65 for the different bioassays and there was no evident relationship between influent quality and treatment type this means the influent quality per capita was very similar across australia and therefore the different plants can be directly compared 3 2 effect and chemical removal the efficacy of effect removal in each wwtp based on belbio is summarised in fig 2 averaging over the 7 days with removal for each wwtp for each day provided in fig s4 and table s7 cytotoxicity tulbio were averaged between all cell lines the average removal efficacy for plants with secondary or tertiary treatment wwtps s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 t1 t2 t3 ranged from 39 for ahr activity and 41 for 2h psii inhibition to 93 for estrogenic activity and pparγ activity and cytotoxicity tulbio were reduced by 42 84 removal was much lower in wwtps p1 and p2 which had only primary treatment with on average 16 removal of ahr activity and 11 removal of estrogenic activity herbicides detected by algal toxicity had only 18 removal in wwtp p1 and were not removed in wwtp p2 for pparγ activity and oxidative stress response the removal was negative with 5 and 11 respectively and cytotoxicity tulbio also increased slightly from influent to effluent fig 2 apparent negative removal may stem from fluctuations in input because samples were taken at the same time and do not represent the same water parcel given there were hardly any variations in effect during the 7 days in the influent these should be minor fluctuations certain chemicals may also form during treatment if they are excreted as conjugates that are not or less active in the in vitro assays and cleaved back to the bioactive parent chemical in the effluent this has been hypothesised for the pharmaceutical carbamazepine and its glucuronic conjugate vieno et al 2007 variable removal of ahr activity during wastewater treatment has been reported in the literature with 13 90 removal observed jalova et al 2013 nivala et al 2018 similar pparγ removal efficacy has also been observed previously with between 69 and 94 removal reported bain et al 2014 nivala et al 2018 up to 99 7 removal of estrogenic activity was observed which fits with previous studies where between 80 and 99 removal was reported e g jugan et al 2009 jalova et al 2013 escher et al 2014 hamilton et al 2016 houtman et al 2018 nivala et al 2018 removal of gr activity could only be calculated for wwtp t1 with most samples either cytotoxic or inactive in gr geneblazer between 67 and 69 removal of gr activity was observed poor to moderate removal of gr activity has previously been reported with between 7 and 66 removal efficacy observed bain et al 2014 roberts et al 2015 houtman et al 2018 oxidative stress response removal varied between wwtps and over time with between 10 and 90 removal efficacy observed average of 60 in all plants except p1 and p2 fewer studies have considered oxidative stress response removal during wastewater treatment processes though between 61 and 85 removal has previously been reported volker et al 2017 nivala et al 2018 algal toxicity is driven by herbicides which are typically poorly removed by secondary treatment as was observed previously with 48 removal of 2h psii inhibition deq and 38 removal of 24h psii inhibition deq by secondary treatment escher et al 2008 ozonation also improved treatment efficacy to over 80 escher et al 2009 which is consistent with our findings for t3 cytotoxicity was not removed after primary treatment though it was often well removed after secondary and tertiary treatment which aligns well with the removal of chemicals stalter et al 2011 also found cytotoxicity was well removed by secondary and tertiary wastewater treatment using a rat pituitary cell line assay for comparison with effect load the chemical concentrations reported in table s3 were converted to mass loads ml table s8 the sum of ml in the influent was very similar for all wwtps and ranged from 0 13 to 0 34 g person day which was consistent with the little variation of effect loads of all influents a detailed analysis of the chemical removal is beyond the scope of the present work and will be forthcoming in a study by other authors the removal efficacy of all chemicals detected in the wwtp influent are provided in table s8 and summarised in fig 2 with each grey dot representing one chemical removal efficacy varied between wwtps and for different chemicals but aligned well with the belbio and tulbio removal efficacy results fig 2 although the differences between individual chemicals were evidently much larger than between different bioassays 3 3 iceberg modelling iceberg modelling serves to compare the measured effect of the water sample with the predicted mixture effect of the detected chemicals and was only performed for ahr pparγ oxidative stress response and the combined algae assay since no natural and pharmaceutical hormones were included in the chemical analysis iceberg modelling was not meaningful for er and gr in these assays a small number of highly potent chemicals typically explains most of the effect e g leusch et al 2010 schriks et al 2010 jia et al 2016 konemann et al 2018 which means that it is sufficient to perform bioanalysis to evaluate the removal efficacy for estrogenic chemicals in addition no iceberg modelling was performed for cytotoxicity an average belbio value was calculated for the influent and effluent samples for iceberg modelling table s9 to compare with belchem derived from the chemical analysis of the pooled extracts belchem was calculated using effect data for reporter gene assays provided in neale et al 2020 an additional 15 active chemicals contributed to belchem for the three assays in the current study with effect data collected from the tox21 database or the literature neale et al 2017a the effect data for 13 herbicides and 12 non herbicides in the combined algae test were from glauch and escher 2020 the average percent contribution of known chemicals to belchem for each assay is shown in fig s5 in each bioassay there were a few dominant chemicals but they differed from assay to assay the pharmaceutical telmisartan and the herbicide diuron dominated the b a p elchem and telmisartan was also the main contributor to rosiglitazone elchem in the case of the oxidative stress response phytoestrogen daidzein dominated in influent while industrial compound 2 benzothiazolesulfonic acid dominated in effluent the deqchem in the combined algae assay was dominated by diuron this analysis of chemicals contributing to belchem is equivalent to the widely used toxic unit approach for chemical analysis where literature ecotoxicity data is used to scale and sum the detected concentrations massei et al 2018 kandie et al 2020 here we can additionally compare the belchem with the belbio to estimate which fraction of the overall effect can be explained by the detected chemicals thirty four chemicals contributed to b a p elchem for activation of ahr with industrial compound 2 4 dichlorophenol having the overall highest contribution to b a p elchem but only in wwtp t2 1 1 μgb a p person day telmisartan and diuron were the dominant contributors to b a p elchem and because they were hardly removed by secondary treatment there was no change in their b a p elchem during treatment except for wwtp t3 which had additional ozonation fig 3 the same applied to the antifungal climbazole and 2 benzothioazole sulfonic acid in contrast the phytoestrogens daidzein and genistein which contributed substantially to b a p elchem in the influent were well degraded and hardly detectable in the effluents apart from wwtps p1 and p2 which lacked secondary treatment comparing b a p elchem to the corresponding average b a p elbio value only up to 0 56 of the activation of ahr load could be explained by the 34 detected active chemicals with a similar fraction explained for both influent and effluent samples table s9 for comparison with 40 active chemicals up to 2 8 of the activation of ahr response could be explained by known chemicals in surface water samples from germany neale et al 2020 we had effect data for 72 of the 503 targeted chemicals but the majority was inactive with only 69 19 having ec10 values given that there are likely to be tens of thousands of chemicals present in a water sample and even if only 19 activate ahr it is conceivable that the detected chemicals explain only a low fraction of the effect the detected ahr active chemicals had repi values from 7 10 7 to 6 10 4 indicating that the targeted chemicals were of very low potency hence chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which were not analysed and would be expected to be present in very low concentrations but which have very high repi values could have contributed substantially to the mixture effects only 19 of the detected chemicals contributed to rosiglitazone elchem in the pparγ assay but they had much higher repi values than the detected chemicals in ahr telmisartan had the highest repi of 0 003 and was a major contributor to rosiglitazone elchem in most wwtps with little difference in rosiglitazone elchem between the influent and effluent for most wwtps due to poor removal of telmisartan fig s6 the herbicide 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid had the highest contribution to rosiglitazone elchem but only in the influent of wwtp t2 because of its very high concentration despite a low repi value of 6 10 5 between 0 16 and 9 3 of belbio could be explained by detected chemicals in pparγ geneblazer table s9 a much larger fraction of the effect could be explained in the effluent maximum 9 3 average 5 0 compared to the influent samples maximum 0 71 average 0 39 this suggests that unknown chemicals that activate pparγ were better removed than known activators of pparγ but it is also possible that individual contributors fell below the analytical detection limit in the effluent but still contributed to mixture effects the fraction explained by known chemicals was higher than observed in previous studies e g könig et al 2017 neale et al 2018 and can be explained by the high load of the potent pparγ activator telmisartan which was present at 384 1533 μg person day in all samples except for wwtp t3 effluent telmisartan is used to treat high blood pressure and was among the top 10 most commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals based on daily dose in australia in 2015 pharmaceutical benefits advisory committee 2016 forty six of the detected chemicals contributed to dichlorvos elchem in the oxidative stress assay with daidzein repi 0 41 having the greatest contribution in the influent samples fig s7 chemicals such as daidzein genistein repi 0 49 and the alkaloid piperine repi 0 39 primarily contributed to dichlorvos elchem in the influent samples but had low to no input to dichlorvos elchem in the effluent samples due to their good removal efficacy 98 except for in wwtps p1 and p2 between 26 and 39 removal for daidzein genistein and piperine in p1 and p2 in contrast the dichlorvos elchem was often similar in the influent and effluent for poorly removed compounds such as 2 benzothiazolesulfonic acid diuron and the pharmaceutical mebendazole dichlorvos elchem could only explain between 0 0004 and 0 20 of dichlorvos elbio with little difference between the influent and effluent samples table s9 according to the literature martin et al 2010 a large fraction of chemicals can activate the oxidative stress response three hundred and fifty seven of the targeted chemicals had experimental data and 24 thereof were active as for ahr it is likely that many chemicals present but not targeted may cause the large observed oxidative stress response the low fraction explained is consistent with other studies also finding that known chemicals could typically explain less than 1 of the observed effect in water samples escher et al 2013 tang et al 2014 neale et al 2015 in the case of algal toxicity there were fewer herbicides detected than in european wwtp effluents glauch and escher 2020 but the effects were still dominated by herbicides with only a minor contribution by biocide triclosan which is well removed by secondary and tertiary treatment and has a lower repi than most herbicides i e reptriclosan was 0 002 0 004 for inhibition of photosynthesis after 2h and 24h respectively glauch and escher 2020 by a large margin diuron dominated the effect and explained between 70 and 100 of the delchem for 2h psii inhibition fig 4 and 24h psii inhibition fig s8 and somewhat less for 24h growth inhibition fig s9 the other herbicides made up the rest of the effect apart from 24h growth inhibition where triclosan contributed up to 40 of delchem due to the reptriclosan of 0 13 for this endpoint the delchem explained on average 48 of the delbio for 2h psii inhibition table s9 and 58 for 24h psii inhibition but less than 10 for 24h growth inhibition where many other chemicals can contribute to the effect and the herbicides are of lower relative potency this is consistent with previous work on advanced water treatment tang and escher 2014 where in wwtp effluent between 47 and 73 of algal toxicity could be explained by the combined action of atrazine diuron hexazinone and simazine 3 4 implications the study presented here is unique because it covered wwtps at major cities capturing 42 and more than 9 mio of the australian population of 23 401 892 people at census day 2016 thanks to sampling during a population census a very precise population estimate was possible and hence the measured concentrations could be converted to per capita mass and bioanalytical equivalent loads in units of ng person day this was an excellent basis for direct comparison between treatment efficacy of different plants with respect to mixture effects however even if no flow and population data are available bioanalytical equivalent concentrations are still very useful to compare plants and to evaluate if the overall effects in the effluent are safe for the receiving waters after dilution jarosova et al 2014 further after applying a dilution factor appropriate to the circumstances of a given wwtp the expected contribution of effect to surface water could be predicted and the resulting beq in surface water compared with existing surface water effect based trigger values escher et al 2018a effluents from australian wwtps are discharged into a mixing zone but effects both within and outside the mixing zone were not evaluated in the current study the removal of mixture effects was clearly related to the treatment type with poorest removal for primary treatment it is interesting to note that both cytotoxicity and oxidative stress response typically had the lowest removal efficacies even after ozonation oxidative stress response is a rather general adaptive stress response often occurring just prior to cytotoxicity biodegradation and ozonation will not necessarily mineralise chemicals but transform them with the transformation products often being more hydrophilic and hence less cytotoxic but still contributing to the mixture effects escher and fenner 2011 therefore these fairly non specific bioassays are important to estimate the overall toxic potency tip of the iceberg modelling showed that the detected chemicals contributing to belchem were often abundant chemicals with moderate to high potency such as telmisartan which had an average total daily load of 18 kg together with its high potency in pparγ it was the dominant risk driver for this endpoint and also important for ahr diuron despite a total load of less than 1 kg per day dominated the algal toxicity due to its very high potency and contributed substantially to ahr activation 2 benzothiazolesulfonic acid 11 kg per day and daidzein 11 kg per day were both drivers for activating the oxidative stress response the mixture risk drivers changed after treatment with recalcitrant chemicals playing a more important role telmisartan and diuron were poorly removed in most wwtps so they remained important before and after treatment 4 conclusions the current study aimed to determine per capita biological equivalent loads in influent and effluent samples collected during the 2016 australian census and to evaluate effect removal efficacy using a bioassay test battery covering different stages of cellular toxicity pathways as well as algal toxicity while bioanalytical equivalent concentrations were rather variable between the wwtp influents translating into bioanalytical equivalent loads reduced the variability effect removal efficacy was poorest for primary treatment with good removal of estrogenic activity and pparγ activity by secondary and tertiary treatment however even secondary treatment did not completely reduce algal toxicity which can be explained by herbicides being rather persistent to biodegradation and only well removed by ozonation with the exception of algal toxicity the detected chemicals could only explain a small fraction 10 of the observed effect the study demonstrates how both bioanalytical equivalent loads and mass loads can be applied in a complementary way to provide a better comparison of removal efficacy between

19989,flocculants are often added during produced water treatment to improve the crude oil droplet growth and separation from the water phase prior to use in the field their performance is tested in laboratory conditions typically with jar tests that require quite large volumes of sample in this paper we present a microfluidic method as an alternative to study the efficiency of flocculants on enhancing coalescence between oil droplets two crude oil emulsions and four flocculants at different concentrations were tested the new method is also compared to the more traditional techniques an anionic flocculant showed the biggest improvement in separation for almost all systems what is more marked differences were observed between methods with static bottle and turbidity tests and dynamic test conditions light scattering and microfluidics where stabilization and dispersion effects were observed for the latter the microfluidic methodology with added benefits such as visualization lower sample volumes and shorter measurement times yielded similar trends as compared to other techniques overall it was shown that microfluidics is a viable alternative to the standard tests graphical abstract image 1 keywords flocculation produced water coalescence microfluidics flocculants water treatment 1 introduction many industrial processes utilize flocculation i e formation of loose aggregates to enhance separation it is typically induced by adding multivalent metal salts or polymers as destabilizing agents and is commonly used in wastewater treatment daifa et al 2019 within mining jang et al 2010 food ahmad et al 2005 and petroleum industries sjoblom 2001 polymeric flocculants are often added to improve the treatment efficiency of the large volumes of produced water during petroleum production in offshore production the produced water is either discharged to the sea or re injected into production or disposal reservoirs prior to this it must be treated to a sufficient level of purity regulated by environmental laws and or geological specifications of the reservoir dudek et al 2020c conventional flocculants used in produced water treatment are water soluble polymers often cationic but also anionic non ionic amphoteric and amphiphilic with molecular weights ranging from several thousand to several million da kelland 2014 there are two suggested mechanisms that explain their effect on separation one possibility is that individual polymer chains become attached to two or more droplets and form bridges that keep the droplets in flocs that are easier to separate than individual drops this is also the classical way of describing flocculation of solids droplets on the other hand can coalesce and it is possible that the polymer bridges formed between droplets keep them in proximity of each other sufficiently long for drop growth by coalescence to occur similar reasoning can be used for drop bubble bridging in flotation units santos et al 2018 it is however unclear which of the two mechanisms is dominant during produced water treatment as most techniques for studying flocculation do no allow to visually follow the droplets in dynamic conditions selecting the best flocculant formulation is crucial from an operational point of view different fluid properties and process conditions often require that flocculants must be tailored to specific fields wells separation trains or even type of separator extensive laboratory measurements are performed prior to selection where the performance of flocculants is frequently tested using bottle or jar tests kelland 2014 in the former the flocculant is added to an oil in water emulsion shaken and left at static conditions the time until water clarification can be determined by visual inspection turbidity measurements or sampling followed by extraction and quantification of oil jar tests add some level of agitation in the sample container and are often used during field tests with fresh produced water samples a gas flotation step can also be added after the initial flocculation process if the separation takes a lot of time for example for water after polymer flooding s fernandes et al 2005 santos et al 2020 other methods can be applied if more detailed information about the systems is required fernandes et al used light scattering technique for measuring drop size distribution after adding flocculants s fernandes et al 2005 while angle et al studied the evolution of droplet sizes of diluted heavy oil in water including a number of parameters such as the presence of particles water ph and the oil phase volume fraction angle and hamza 2009 some drawbacks for these methods are the need for large sample volumes and long measurement times droplet based microfluidics is a technique where droplets can be manipulated and observed in microchannels it offers precise control over experimental conditions possibility to study phenomena during flow and use very small microlitres sample volumes it has been applied to study coalescence between droplets or bubbles wang et al 2016 2020 recently also in crude oil systems dudek et al 2020a leary et al 2020 the objective of this paper is to introduce microfluidic methodology as a viable way of determining the efficiency of flocculants during separation of crude oil from produced water microfluidics allows to visually follow the coalescence process between drops which is the underlying phenomena responsible for improved removal of oil droplets the novel method was compared to conventional techniques such as bottle testing turbidity measurements and static light scattering measurements this allowed for evaluation of strengths and weaknesses between the various methods as well as some mechanistic considerations 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials two crude oils produced at the norwegian continental shelf ncs were used in this study they are designated as crude oil e and g in accordance with previous studies in our group dudek et al 2020a both are light crude oils and are considered representative for the type of oil produced at ncs table 1 shows the properties of both the oils sodium chloride analytical grade was dissolved in deionized water millipore simplicity systems at concentration of 35 g l and used as the water phase four commercial flocculants denoted f1 to f4 were provided by nouryon surface chemistry ab and schlumberger production technologies information from the vendors together with more detailed characteristics performed by the present authors is given in section 3 1 ph of the water phases was not controlled and varied between 5 8 and 6 4 2 2 methods 2 2 1 emulsion preparation in general 500 ppm oil in water emulsions were prepared as follows first crude oil was weighed and appropriate amounts of brine were added the sample volume was ca 40 ml for the bottle tests and turbidity measurements while about 500 ml was required for the light scattering experiments the sample was then mixed with a high performance disperser ultra turrax ika for 3 min at 10 000 rpm these conditions gave repeatable distribution of drop sizes regardless of the volume of the emulsion the majority of the drops were below 60 μm in diameter see the initial size distribution in fig 6 for the zeta potential measurements 500 ppm oil in water emulsions were prepared by mixing crude oil and 1 g l of sodium chloride dissolved in deionized water at 10 000 rpm for 1 min a known volume of flocculant solution was added to the emulsion when required all the samples were degassed in an ultrasonication bath for 30 s prior to measurements 2 2 2 sample characterization 2 2 2 1 dynamic light scattering the size of the flocculants in solution and oil drops dispersed in water with and without flocculants was measured by dynamic light scattering using a zetasizer nano malvern instruments 200 ppm flocculants were dissolved in deionized water containing 1 g l sodium chloride three scans were made for each sample and two parallels were made for each condition 2 2 2 2 electrophoretic measurements the zeta potentials of dissolved flocculants and oil in water emulsions with and without flocculants were obtained by electrophoretic mobility measurements using a zetasizer nano malvern instruments three scans were made for each sample and two parallels were made for each condition 2 2 2 3 interfacial tension measurements interfacial tension measurements were performed with a pendant drop tensiometer pat1 sinterface a crude oil drop was immersed into appropriate solutions by a capillary connected to a micro syringe the interfacial tension was calculated by fitting the young laplace equation to images of the drop profile each measurement lasted 2 h three parallels were performed for each system 2 2 3 stability measurements 2 2 3 1 bottle tests after preparation the emulsion was stirred at 200 rpm with a magnetic stirrer a concentrated solution of flocculant was added by a micropipette to give the required concentration the visual change in the clarity of the emulsion was recorded every 5 min for 30 min or until the water phase was deemed clear each measurement was repeated at least two times 2 2 3 2 turbidity measurements immediately after preparation the emulsion was transferred into a measurement vial the flocculant was added in the same way as for the bottle tests the vial was gently shaken to distribute the flocculant and inserted in the measurement slot of a turbiscan lab instrument formulaction where the light transmission through the sample over its entire height 40 mm was measured every 1 min for 15 min the average light transmission between 8 and 12 mm sample height was reported all measurements were performed at least three times 2 2 3 3 static light scattering measurements drop size distributions of the emulsions were measured by static light scattering experiments using a mastersizer 3000 with a hydro ev extension malvern instruments prior to experiments brine was passed through the instrument to measure the background data of the continuous phase subsequently the emulsion was poured into a 600 ml beaker and mounted in the instrument the sample was stirred at 3000 rpm and continuously pumped through the measurement cell the light scattered by the droplets were detected at different angles and transformed into a volume size distribution 100 measurements were performed continuously each lasting 10 s adding up to ca 16 min of experimental time the concentrated solution of a flocculant was injected into the beaker via a micropipette and distributed by the built in mixer in the device after the first minute allowing to obtain initial size distribution after the measurements the instrument was cleaned by passing through water xylene isopropanol mixture 1 1 isopropanol and finally several times more with water three measurements were taken for each condition 2 2 3 4 microfluidics two chip designs with different ways of introducing the flocculants were investigated the initial test design and the optimised test design fig 1 in both cases the fluids were pumped with syringe pumps nemesys mid pressure module v3 cetoni gmbh into the custom designed glass microfluidic chip placed in a chip holder micronit microtechnologies b v all channels had a uniform depth of 45 μm monodisperse droplets were generated at a t junction with 100 μm wide channels after passing a meandering channel they got into a 500 μm wide and 33 mm long coalescence chamber where collisions and coalescence events occurred in the initial test design the flocculant was already dissolved in the brine when the droplets were generated at the t junction and the length of the meandering channel varied from 3 to 75 mm fig 1 initial test design this allowed for different surface ageing of the droplets in the optimised test design fig 1 optimised test design the droplets were generated at the t junction using brine and then passed through the meandering channel with a fixed length of 15 mm the flocculant solution was then added at the entrance of the coalescence chamber the concentration of the flocculant was proportionally higher due to the increased interfacial area ca 35 times but also due to a dilution effect during all experiments a high speed camera ax100 photron connected to an inverted microscope ti u eclipse nikon was used to record images at 8500 fps at the inlet and outlet of the coalescence chamber approximately 10 000 images were taken for each part of the channel the recordings were processed with imagej to extract the position and size of droplets in each image which were later used to calculate the coalescence frequency for each experiment more details can be found elsewhere dudek et al 2020a all reported values were an average of at least three parallels 3 results and discussion the outline of this section is as follows first characterization of the flocculant solutions and emulsions with and without flocculants is presented next the principles and results of each technique are presented and discussed finally the flocculants and methods are evaluated with their advantages and drawbacks 3 1 sample characterization 3 1 1 flocculants table 2 summarizes the information from the chemical suppliers about the type and molecular weight for the flocculants the average size and zeta potential for the flocculants dissolved in aqueous solutions are shown in fig 2 the average size of the flocculants seemed to be related to their molecular weight the smallest size was measured for f2 with the lowest molecular weight while f4 with the highest molecular weight had particles larger than 1 μm no molecular weight data was available for f3 however the size measurement suggested that it could be in the range of a few mda still it should be noted that the polymer chain structure e g high deviation from spherical shape could heavily influence the hydrodynamic radius calculated from the dynamic light scattering experiments the polydispersity indices pdi and size distribution graphs suggested quite high polydispersity within the flocculant molecules or that some of the flocculants could be multicomponent blends fig s1 in si the zeta potentials were in line with the type of flocculant listed in table 2 the surface charges originate from the presence of dissociated anionic groups or protonated cationic groups in the molecules the polycationic additives f1 f3 had the highest positive zeta potentials the amphiphilic f2 had lower and most likely ph dependent charge while the anionic f4 had a significant negative zeta potential 3 1 2 emulsions fig 3 shows the zeta potentials for crude oil g emulsions without and after addition of the flocculants data for crude oil e is shown in fig s2 in si crude oil drops without addition of flocculants had a negative zeta potential of ca 10 mv the negative potential is common for dispersed oil in produced water however the exact value will depend on the oil properties and ionic composition of water buckley et al 1989 farooq et al 2013 addition of three of the flocculants f1 f2 and f3 reversed the zeta potential of the droplets to positive values and the magnitude of that effect corresponded with the type of the flocculant cationic or amphiphilic the presence of the anionic f4 decreased the negative zeta potential of the droplets significantly while the differences between the addition of any flocculant at 10 and 20 ppm were relatively low larger absolute charges were always observed for the higher concentration similar observations were made for crude oil e fig s2 in si the dynamic interfacial tension graphs for oil e in brine with and without flocculants are plotted in fig s3 in si without flocculants crude oil e reached ca 21 mn m after 2 h of measurement the addition of an additive regardless of the type caused a faster drop of the interfacial tension especially in the initial 10 20 min of the measurement after that time the values started to stabilize in a similar manner as without any flocculant however the value after 2 h was slightly below 20 mn m for all cases overall the interfacial tension results confirmed that the flocculants are indeed adsorbing at the oil water interface however their effect on the interfacial tension is relatively small and apparently did not depend on the type of additive both the electrophoretic and interfacial tension measurements showed that all the flocculants adsorbed at the oil drop water interface there are several mechanisms explaining the adsorption of polyelectrolytes on surfaces both with the same and opposite charge holmberg et al 2002 the first three flocculants have a positive charge which should promote the adsorption at a negatively charged crude oil water interface through columbic attraction however in the abundant presence of electrolytes as in our case the adsorption can be decreased the charge of a surface in water must be balanced by the presence of counterions in the vicinity of the surface when electrolytes are present the increase of entropy is not as significant as in an electrolyte free system in addition salt ions can shield the attractive interactions between the polymer and the surface and compete with the polymer for the adsorption sites if the surface and polymer have the same charge as was the case with f4 the attraction is mainly due to van der waals forces in contrast to the oppositely charged interfaces here the addition of salt should increase the adsorption of polymer when a polymer adsorbs at a similarly charged surfaces the charge is neutralized by the presence of counterions which yields local concentration gradient and decrease in the entropy of the system higher concentration of electrolytes will diminish this effect moreover it can also shield the electrostatic repulsion between the surface and the polymer as it will be seen later the high concentration of the electrolyte could also have contributed to the performance of flocculants during emulsion stability testing 3 2 bottle tests the results from the bottle tests for crude oil e are presented in fig 4 the black line shows the time for clarification for the oil in water emulsion without any flocculant present i e equal to or more than 30 min adding 10 ppm of any of the flocculants reduced the separation time slightly in most cases the effect of the higher concentrations was however more pronounced f1 f2 and f3 all reduced the clarification time to ca 20 min while f4 decreased it down to 10 min similar trends were obtained for crude oil g fig s4 in si without major improvement in the separation efficiency it was difficult to compare different systems the errors in the bottle measurements originated from two sources firstly it was problematic to pinpoint the exact moment when the emulsion was clear when the measurements are based on visual observations this is highly operator dependent and can also be affected by other factors e g lighting conditions the ability to more accurately quantify these results could be improved by oil content measurements however this prolongs the procedure significantly secondly the clarity of the samples was noted every 5 min which added some more uncertainty to the results 3 3 turbidity it was challenging to reproduce the initial level of transmitted light for all samples even with consistent methodology in place however the relative change in transmission over time was similar for most parallels and allowed to compare different conditions fig 5 presents the relative change in light transmission after 15 min for all flocculants and concentrations compared to the initial turbidity of the sample the solid line represents the change in transmitted light for the sample without flocculant with the dotted lines as the corresponding standard deviations most of the samples with flocculants experienced changes in transmission within these error bars the exceptions were f1 at 10 ppm and possibly f4 at 20 ppm these two flocculants also had the best performance in the bottle tests also for crude oil g fig s5 in si f1 and f4 at the highest concentration gave better results flocculant 3 at 20 ppm however led to stabilization of emulsion while the rest of the flocculants had a negligible effect on the emulsion stability similar to bottle tests it was difficult to distinguish an improvement in separation unless major differences in turbidity occurred for example for f1 at 10 ppm 3 4 static light scattering the evolution of size distributions over time is shown in fig 6 for the emulsion without flocculant and when f4 was added to the emulsion the initial size distributions i e first few measurements after starting the experiment are shown as dotted lines volume wise most droplets were initially between 10 and 50 μm in diameter however there was also noticeable share of sub 10 μm drops it should be mentioned that multiple scattering caused by too high concentration of the dispersed phase can lead to false signals in the small droplet size ranges however care was taken to keep the concentrations low enough to minimize this effect and the main signal droplets larger than 10 μm remained largely unaffected the arrow in the figures shows the direction towards which the distributions evolve without flocculants the size distribution did not change significantly during the 15 min of measurement the largest drop diameter increased from ca 60 80 μm by contrast the presence of f4 caused a noticeable shift of the size distribution to the right and positively affected the growth of drops either by flocculation or coalescence the largest drop size increased from approximately 40 μm to more than 100 μm another way to describe a size distribution is with the mean value in the case of volume distributions volume mean diameters d 4 3 are often calculated fig 7 shows a summary of evolution of d 4 3 in all systems with crude oil g the corresponding figure showing data for crude oil e is presented in si fig s6 selected measurement points were shown to avoid cluttering the figure standard deviations were omitted for the same reason which is additionally discussed in section 3 6 2 the flocculants were added after the second measurement point whereas the next three points show the subsequent evolution of drop sizes the black line is the drop growth without flocculant f1 at lower concentration and f4 increased the drop growth compared to the sample without flocculants with the latter being more effective at both concentrations furthermore it took longer time for f1 to have an effect as improvement was only observed for the second half of the measurements f2 and f3 gave lower d 4 3 values than for the emulsion without flocculant and the effect was largest at the highest concentrations this suggested that the flocculants led to increased stability and possible breakage of drops due to the mixing and flow through the tubing and cell flow velocity ca 0 1 m s followed by a slow growth in size droplet breakage was probably observed for crude oil g when 20 ppm of f3 was added as a continuous reduction in drop size was observed over the duration of the experiment another useful way of representing the volume size distributions is with dx10 dx50 and dx90 values these are defined as threshold values where 10 50 and 90 of drop sizes in the system are smaller or equal to them respectively fig s7 in si shows the average dx values of crude oil e drops for three cases no flocculant f3 and f4 both at 20 ppm dx10 represents the smallest droplets in the emulsion at the beginning of most experiments its value was typically not higher than 5 μm by the end of the measurement without any flocculant in the system and with f4 at 20 ppm this value was twice and four times as high respectively in the case of f3 only minimal increase was observed dx50 can also be defined as a median value for volume distributions smaller relative increase was observed here as compared to dx10 but with similar trends the same can be said about dx90 often representing the largest droplets in a system while for f3 it went up only by 10 μm it grew by ca 20 μm without any additives and it doubled to more than 100 μm for the other flocculant dx values can provide additional information on the effect of the flocculant on a particular size range of droplets for example showing that the chemical is more effective in promoting the coalescence between the smallest most difficult to remove droplets this seems to be the case with f4 where the increase of the dx10 was considerable still the multiple scattering phenomena could have contributed to some changes in the values of dx10 as explained earlier without any flocculant all drop size classes increased in a similar degree the addition of flocculant 3 however led to size increase only for the largest droplets while hardly any change in the smaller size classes was observed even though larger drops require longer time to coalesce dudek et al 2020b they are easier to encounter by other drops during flow which could explain higher coalescence in this size class 3 5 microfluidics 3 5 1 initial test design fig s8 in si shows how the coalescence frequency was reduced by the length of the meandering channel for crude oil e with different concentrations of f4 f4 was chosen for these experiments since it generally showed the biggest improvement in separation when using the other experimental approaches the coalescence frequency clearly decreased the longer the oil drops had to travel before entering the coalescence chamber this was in line with our previous findings and is due to migration of interfacially active crude oil components i e resins and asphaltenes to the oil water interface where they build up an interfacial layer that opposes coalescence dudek et al 2020a the small difference between the coalescence in the short and medium length channels can probably be explained by relatively large molecular weights for the migrating components that take longer time to adsorb at the oil water interface similar trends were also obtained for the experiments with the addition of flocculant in all cases the coalescence was lowest for the measurements with the longest channel the measurements without and with 10 ppm of f4 were quite similar while the coalescence was markedly lower with 500 ppm two important outcomes were noted from these initial tests firstly the presence of flocculant reduced the coalescence between drops one possible explanation is that adsorption of the flocculant at the fresh oil water interface stabilized the drops this is supported by the interfacial tension measurements where the presence of any of the flocculants caused a small but noticeable change in the interfacial properties of crude oils another explanation could be that the flocculants adsorb less at freshly generated droplets than at aged interfaces which has different surface properties the flocculants in solution would then increase the drainage time of the thin liquid film occurring between droplets prior to coalescence and thereby reduce coalescence secondly the concentration of the flocculant needed to see noticeable effects on the coalescence was considerably higher than for the other tests this was because the oil in water concentration in the coalescence chamber was approximately 100 times higher than in the 500 ppm emulsions by calculating the total interfacial area for the microfluidic experiments for droplets of 55 μm and other techniques initial dx50 25 μm taken from the light scattering data it was seen that this ratio is equal to ca 35 which was used for further experiments 3 5 2 optimised test design the coalescence frequencies when the flocculants were added at the entrance of the coalescence chamber are presented in fig 8 the flocculant concentrations are denoted as low and high concentrations and correspond to 10 and 20 ppm levels from other measurements as explained before similar results for crude oil g are shown in fig s9 in si the average coalescence frequency and the corresponding standard deviation for the samples without flocculant are shown as solid and dotted lines respectively the injection of additional fluid affects the volume fraction of the dispersed phase and the linear velocity in the channel both of which impact coalescence in microchannels krebs et al 2012 therefore pure brine was also injected at the same flow rate through the additional inlet at the beginning of coalescence chamber to keep total flow rate constant both f1 and f4 improved the merging between droplets and the coalescence frequency was generally higher at the concentration equivalent to 20 ppm by contrast the lowest coalescence was seen for f2 and f3 at the highest flocculant concentrations in this chip design the flocculant was added in the beginning of the coalescence chamber perpendicularly to the direction of the main flow in order to verify the distribution of flocculants and oil drops in the coalescence chamber the flocculant solution was replaced by a dye stained water phase fig 9 shows snapshots of this system with varying number of drops in the coalescence chamber without any or with only a few droplets present the laminar flow typical for microfluidics inhibited mixing between the injected and continuous phase therefore the distribution of the flocculant was only driven by the diffusion across the water water boundary this is seen in the first and second column of snapshots in fig 9 the stratified flow of the dye stained water phase and the continuous phase normally containing droplets is visible over the entire length of the coalescence chamber similar case occurred when only some droplets were generated in this situation there were too few droplets to invoke collisions so they mostly followed the laminar streamlines of the continuous phase this resulted in lack of mixing between the two water inlets and two stratified flows were still visible at the outlet of the channel however when the flow of droplets was set to the same level as for all microfluidic experiments the drops started to collide with each other the collisions forced the droplets to also flow in vertical direction which disturbed the laminar flow in the channel the effect could already be seen at the inlet where the frequent contact between drops caused the interface of the dye stained water phase to oscillate further down the channel the droplets flowing out of the upper part of the channel were disrupting the laminar streams creating vortices which resulted in mixing between the two water phases and distribution of the flocculant into the entire cross section of the channel already after 6 mm the boundary between the two phases was no longer visible and only slight colour gradient across the width of the channel could be observed to the best of our knowledge this is the first description of mixing in the continuous phase by the dispersed phase previous papers related to mixing in multiphase microfluidics have dealt with mixing inside the dispersed droplets or mixing in the continuous phase during slug flow bordbar et al 2020 tice et al 2003 3 6 comparison of flocculants and methods discussion 3 6 1 performance of flocculants the comparison of the results obtained with different methods for crude oil e is presented in fig 10 data for crude oil g in fig s10 in si the values are the relative improvement or in some cases decrease of performance for each flocculant as compared to the sample without flocculants coalescence of crude oil drops is inhibited by the adsorption of indigenous surface active components such as resins asphaltenes naphthenic acids and various solids at the oil water interface this can lead to steric stabilization elastic interfaces and marangoni effects which all can prolong the drainage time of the thin aqueous film formed when droplets approach each other if this drainage time becomes longer than the contact time between droplets in the dynamic and turbulent produced water systems coalescence will be scarce and droplet growth slow the flocculants are added to the water phase in order to create flocs bridge droplets and facilitate coalescence leading to improved separation most tests indicated that the most efficient flocculant for both crude oils was f4 according to our data it had the largest molecular weight the largest particle size and in contrast to other flocculants a negative zeta potential even though the crude oil droplets were also negatively charged the flocculant still adsorbed at the oil water interface and decreased the zeta potential even further analysis of our results suggests that the impact of the charge neutralization mechanism on the separation efficiency is probably negligible due to high salinity conditions which effectively screen the charges at the oil water interface it seems that the large molecular weight of f4 was predominantly responsible for its ability to create bigger oil droplets this conclusion is similar to other studies where the larger molecular weight of the flocculant has been connected to improved performance during oil removal s fernandes et al 2005 santos et al 2020 santos et al 2018 furthermore we did not observe any evidence of flocculation during our microfluidic experiments which suggests that the main principle of flocculants improving separation in our study was promoting coalescence it is also unlikely that flocculation occurred during light scattering experiments as the changes in size distribution were relatively smooth similar linear flow velocity as in microfluidic measurements and agitation in the vessel probably inhibited formation of unstable flocs and pointed to coalescence as the main destabilization mechanism some of the flocculants gave worse performance as compared to the experiments without any additives in bottle tests and turbidity measurements almost all flocculants at all concentrations showed a positive response as compared to tests without additives therefore the comparison of efficiency is mostly based on the magnitude of separation improvement methods involving flow however displayed stabilizing or even dispersing effects which lead to worse separation than without flocculants indeed when f3 was used during the light scattering measurement one could observe a decline in d 4 3 after a period of initial increase even though breakage of droplets was not recorded in our microfluidic recordings similar trends were seen for f3 which gave the worst overall performance in that technique 3 6 2 methodology comparison different methods are used to study the efficiency of flocculants in separation processes bottle or jar testing is a well established technique for measuring the efficiency of separation gao et al 2011 huang et al 2019 liu et al 2013 it is based on the gravity separation of droplets the better the flocculant the higher its effect on the coalescence between droplets and the faster the creaming this methodology is simple to conduct and allows several tests at the same time the evaluation of the results can be done through visual observation or by sampling and measuring the oil in water content with a suitable technique visual observation of the sample requires the operator to be present during the entire measurement and is quite subjective in the case of oil content measurement more time and resources chemicals analytical instruments are required for extraction and analysis of the oil concentration there are however a few drawbacks while coalescence or flocculation between droplets is the main mechanism of improving separation this is not directly observed in this method instead creaming of droplets is followed which is orders of magnitude slower than the coalescence process between two droplets measurements with standard samples are typically quicker however separation of oil from water after polymer flooding might take several hours gao et al 2011 the tests are also performed in static conditions of column separation sometimes assisted with some level of agitation turbidity measurements are quite similar to bottle tests this means that it will take similar time to perform the tests which can range from several minutes to hours zhang 2017 other setup configurations are also possible for example fernandes et al evaluated the efficiency of polymeric flocculants with the use of photometric analyser allowing to measure light transmission in flow fernandes et al 2004 compared to bottle testing an improvement is quantitative non subjective data in the form of light transmission measurements over time this is easier to compare than visual observations of turbidity of the samples and it offers more detailed information about the progress of separation the method is also simple and it is possible to measure several samples at the same time in our case the samples were measured continuously for 15 min however less frequent measurements could allow several samples to be tested by changing them in the instrument manually or with an autosampler nevertheless the reproducibility is certainly an issue as it was often difficult to obtain the same initial conditions even with rigorous sample preparation method what is more 500 ppm of oil in the water phase was the lower limit for reliable detection of our instrument below that value the signal was too weak the strength of the signal is however dependent on the type of crude oil heavier oils will produce darker emulsions which could decrease the lower detection limit lighter oils will be more transparent and could be problematic during measurements at lower concentrations the static light scattering methodology allowed to see the direct effect of the addition of flocculants on the drop size distribution however the technique is not without its disadvantages the error bars in figs 7 and s6 were purposely not added to avoid complicating the graphs the absolute values of d 4 3 for both crude oil emulsions together with standard deviations are shown in tables s1 and s2 in si even though the reproducibility of emulsion preparation method was high the first measured size distribution often varied quite a lot due to the startup procedure this impacted the experiment and resulted in large deviations between each parallel one of the reasons was the unavoidable presence of gas bubbles in the beginning of the experiment which took up to a few minutes to remove another limitation of the method was the oil in water concentration when using too concentrated emulsions multiple scattering can occur and as described before give a false signal from the smaller droplets when too little dispersed phase is used the signal to noise ratio might be too low like in turbidity measurements the strength of the signal will also depend on the type of oil and its refractive index fortunately 500 ppm was within the acceptable range for reliable measurements furthermore the droplets could also cream to the surface during the measurement due to imperfect mixing in the vessel thin oil film formation was observed towards the end of the measurement however it did not seem to impact the results to a large extent at least not within our experimental time on the whole the results showed similar trends within each parallel and also in comparison with other techniques microfluidics has already become a well established technology for studying coalescence in emulsified systems bremond and bibette 2012 measurement of droplet growth in microfluidic channels is fast and relies on direct observation and recording of coalescing droplets in flow in contrast other techniques require following changes in water clarity through subjective visual observation turbidity or light scattering alternatively time and solvent consuming sampling extraction and analysis of remaining dispersed oil could also be performed during microfluidic measurements the droplet size is quite similar to what can be expected in the produced water treatment and it is also possible to reduce the drop diameter even further what is more the droplets were generated in situ which reduced the problems with initial drop size distribution compared to other techniques the main difference between our microfluidic method and other techniques used in this study is the concentration of oil because of the laminar flow in the channel the number of generated droplets needs to be quite high to invoke collisions otherwise the droplets would flow in a single row and hardly interact with each other as observed in fig 9 to the best of our knowledge only one other group attempted to study the performance of an additive to observe the effect on flocculation or improved coalescence with the use of microfluidic chips radhakrishnan et al developed a μfloc device for testing flocculation of yeast in the presence of polymeric flocculants p radhakrishnan et al 2018 they also showed that microfluidics could be a great alternative to more traditional methods such as light microscopy or light scattering creaming and flocculation and or coalescence are the main mechanism of oil in water emulsion destabilization however in the first two methods flocculation cannot be quantified directly as both require gravity separation to clarify the water phase and provide a detectable response since the oil droplets are in tens of μm size range this process is rather slow the rising velocity of a crude oil e droplets of 5 and 25 μm in diameter is ca 0 2 and 4 mm min respectively furthermore the emulsions had quite low concentration of oil which could limit collisions between drops and decrease coalescence rates especially considering static conditions of the experiments by contrast in light scattering and microfluidics only the fast phenomena are followed coalescence in flow conditions takes typically between 10 and 100 ms dudek et al 2020a and the changes in size distributions are visible very quickly additionally breakage of droplets could also take place during light scattering experiments due to mixing in the measurement vessel while bottle and turbidity tests typically took around 30 min to finish the effect of the flocculant was visible within a few minutes after starting the experiment for the other two methods however the lengthy preparation and cleaning procedures also affected the time per sample aspect light scattering instrument had to be cleaned thoroughly after each measurement using several different solvents bringing the total experimental time close to 60 min for single test condition microfluidic method took ca 15 min to start and 60 min to clean however several measurements limited only by the number of chips could be done during one run in addition the droplets were generated on the chip as compared to other methods which also saved time and cleaning when it comes to the volume of the sample almost 0 5l of emulsion was needed for our light scattering experiments significantly less was needed for bottle tests and turbidity ca 50 ml and even less than that for microfluidics few μl for 1 s recording the method has the potential to utilize below 1 ml of sample if some optimization steps are implemented for example simplification of the syringe loading procedure or usage of lower volume syringes bottle jar tests and turbidity measurements are often employed in testing of flocculants even though they have several drawbacks such as long measurement time and static conditions this could lead to some problems with screening of chemicals especially if the flocculant has a long initiation time e g low adsorption kinetics or causes breakage of drops impossible to observe in no flow conditions light scattering experiments are quite cumbersome to perform especially considering the lengthy cleaning procedures and large sample volume however it provides additional information about behaviour of drops in flow and gives better understanding on the extent of coalescence and breakage in a system microfluidics also adds the possibility of testing the efficiency of flocculants in dynamic conditions it provides very good control over the drop generation process which compared to the other methods is much more reliable and repeatable the volume of samples required for testing is significantly reduced what is more with few improvements one can drastically decrease the measurement time per sample this can be done through controlling the flocculant concentration injected into the chip which will further extend the possibility of screening tests 4 conclusions in this paper we have characterized four flocculants and tested their performance for produced water treatment with a newly developed microfluidic technique these measurements were compared to three other more established methodologies namely bottle tests turbidity and static light scattering measurements the results showed that for most systems the anionic flocculant was most effective likely due to its large particle size and high molecular weight few differences were observed between the methods which was mostly attributed to the static or dynamic conditions during the measurements or the way the data was collected bottle and turbidity tests relied on observing the clarification of the sample either by eye or measuring the light intensity passing through the sample however no direct data on the effect of the flocculants on the droplet size could have been collected from these experiments in contrast light scattering measurements enabled to observe the changes in drop size distribution during flow while the measurements were quite fast and provided additional results on droplet breakage in some cases the preparation and cleaning procedures were very lengthy in addition to high consumption of samples and solvents furthermore all three methods suffered from issues with repeatable emulsion preparation and transfer to the measurement vessel microfluidic method proved to be a good alternative to standard testing with additional advantages such as low sample consumption monodisperse emulsion generation and shorter measurement times visual observation of droplets allowed to gain several additional insights into the separation process mixing in microfluidics through drop collisions was very effective and helped to distribute the additive in the additive almost immediately after the injection point what is more no floc formation was observed during flow in microchannels which suggested that the main destabilization mechanism responsible for improving separation was coalescence between oil droplets declaration of

19989,flocculants are often added during produced water treatment to improve the crude oil droplet growth and separation from the water phase prior to use in the field their performance is tested in laboratory conditions typically with jar tests that require quite large volumes of sample in this paper we present a microfluidic method as an alternative to study the efficiency of flocculants on enhancing coalescence between oil droplets two crude oil emulsions and four flocculants at different concentrations were tested the new method is also compared to the more traditional techniques an anionic flocculant showed the biggest improvement in separation for almost all systems what is more marked differences were observed between methods with static bottle and turbidity tests and dynamic test conditions light scattering and microfluidics where stabilization and dispersion effects were observed for the latter the microfluidic methodology with added benefits such as visualization lower sample volumes and shorter measurement times yielded similar trends as compared to other techniques overall it was shown that microfluidics is a viable alternative to the standard tests graphical abstract image 1 keywords flocculation produced water coalescence microfluidics flocculants water treatment 1 introduction many industrial processes utilize flocculation i e formation of loose aggregates to enhance separation it is typically induced by adding multivalent metal salts or polymers as destabilizing agents and is commonly used in wastewater treatment daifa et al 2019 within mining jang et al 2010 food ahmad et al 2005 and petroleum industries sjoblom 2001 polymeric flocculants are often added to improve the treatment efficiency of the large volumes of produced water during petroleum production in offshore production the produced water is either discharged to the sea or re injected into production or disposal reservoirs prior to this it must be treated to a sufficient level of purity regulated by environmental laws and or geological specifications of the reservoir dudek et al 2020c conventional flocculants used in produced water treatment are water soluble polymers often cationic but also anionic non ionic amphoteric and amphiphilic with molecular weights ranging from several thousand to several million da kelland 2014 there are two suggested mechanisms that explain their effect on separation one possibility is that individual polymer chains become attached to two or more droplets and form bridges that keep the droplets in flocs that are easier to separate than individual drops this is also the classical way of describing flocculation of solids droplets on the other hand can coalesce and it is possible that the polymer bridges formed between droplets keep them in proximity of each other sufficiently long for drop growth by coalescence to occur similar reasoning can be used for drop bubble bridging in flotation units santos et al 2018 it is however unclear which of the two mechanisms is dominant during produced water treatment as most techniques for studying flocculation do no allow to visually follow the droplets in dynamic conditions selecting the best flocculant formulation is crucial from an operational point of view different fluid properties and process conditions often require that flocculants must be tailored to specific fields wells separation trains or even type of separator extensive laboratory measurements are performed prior to selection where the performance of flocculants is frequently tested using bottle or jar tests kelland 2014 in the former the flocculant is added to an oil in water emulsion shaken and left at static conditions the time until water clarification can be determined by visual inspection turbidity measurements or sampling followed by extraction and quantification of oil jar tests add some level of agitation in the sample container and are often used during field tests with fresh produced water samples a gas flotation step can also be added after the initial flocculation process if the separation takes a lot of time for example for water after polymer flooding s fernandes et al 2005 santos et al 2020 other methods can be applied if more detailed information about the systems is required fernandes et al used light scattering technique for measuring drop size distribution after adding flocculants s fernandes et al 2005 while angle et al studied the evolution of droplet sizes of diluted heavy oil in water including a number of parameters such as the presence of particles water ph and the oil phase volume fraction angle and hamza 2009 some drawbacks for these methods are the need for large sample volumes and long measurement times droplet based microfluidics is a technique where droplets can be manipulated and observed in microchannels it offers precise control over experimental conditions possibility to study phenomena during flow and use very small microlitres sample volumes it has been applied to study coalescence between droplets or bubbles wang et al 2016 2020 recently also in crude oil systems dudek et al 2020a leary et al 2020 the objective of this paper is to introduce microfluidic methodology as a viable way of determining the efficiency of flocculants during separation of crude oil from produced water microfluidics allows to visually follow the coalescence process between drops which is the underlying phenomena responsible for improved removal of oil droplets the novel method was compared to conventional techniques such as bottle testing turbidity measurements and static light scattering measurements this allowed for evaluation of strengths and weaknesses between the various methods as well as some mechanistic considerations 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials two crude oils produced at the norwegian continental shelf ncs were used in this study they are designated as crude oil e and g in accordance with previous studies in our group dudek et al 2020a both are light crude oils and are considered representative for the type of oil produced at ncs table 1 shows the properties of both the oils sodium chloride analytical grade was dissolved in deionized water millipore simplicity systems at concentration of 35 g l and used as the water phase four commercial flocculants denoted f1 to f4 were provided by nouryon surface chemistry ab and schlumberger production technologies information from the vendors together with more detailed characteristics performed by the present authors is given in section 3 1 ph of the water phases was not controlled and varied between 5 8 and 6 4 2 2 methods 2 2 1 emulsion preparation in general 500 ppm oil in water emulsions were prepared as follows first crude oil was weighed and appropriate amounts of brine were added the sample volume was ca 40 ml for the bottle tests and turbidity measurements while about 500 ml was required for the light scattering experiments the sample was then mixed with a high performance disperser ultra turrax ika for 3 min at 10 000 rpm these conditions gave repeatable distribution of drop sizes regardless of the volume of the emulsion the majority of the drops were below 60 μm in diameter see the initial size distribution in fig 6 for the zeta potential measurements 500 ppm oil in water emulsions were prepared by mixing crude oil and 1 g l of sodium chloride dissolved in deionized water at 10 000 rpm for 1 min a known volume of flocculant solution was added to the emulsion when required all the samples were degassed in an ultrasonication bath for 30 s prior to measurements 2 2 2 sample characterization 2 2 2 1 dynamic light scattering the size of the flocculants in solution and oil drops dispersed in water with and without flocculants was measured by dynamic light scattering using a zetasizer nano malvern instruments 200 ppm flocculants were dissolved in deionized water containing 1 g l sodium chloride three scans were made for each sample and two parallels were made for each condition 2 2 2 2 electrophoretic measurements the zeta potentials of dissolved flocculants and oil in water emulsions with and without flocculants were obtained by electrophoretic mobility measurements using a zetasizer nano malvern instruments three scans were made for each sample and two parallels were made for each condition 2 2 2 3 interfacial tension measurements interfacial tension measurements were performed with a pendant drop tensiometer pat1 sinterface a crude oil drop was immersed into appropriate solutions by a capillary connected to a micro syringe the interfacial tension was calculated by fitting the young laplace equation to images of the drop profile each measurement lasted 2 h three parallels were performed for each system 2 2 3 stability measurements 2 2 3 1 bottle tests after preparation the emulsion was stirred at 200 rpm with a magnetic stirrer a concentrated solution of flocculant was added by a micropipette to give the required concentration the visual change in the clarity of the emulsion was recorded every 5 min for 30 min or until the water phase was deemed clear each measurement was repeated at least two times 2 2 3 2 turbidity measurements immediately after preparation the emulsion was transferred into a measurement vial the flocculant was added in the same way as for the bottle tests the vial was gently shaken to distribute the flocculant and inserted in the measurement slot of a turbiscan lab instrument formulaction where the light transmission through the sample over its entire height 40 mm was measured every 1 min for 15 min the average light transmission between 8 and 12 mm sample height was reported all measurements were performed at least three times 2 2 3 3 static light scattering measurements drop size distributions of the emulsions were measured by static light scattering experiments using a mastersizer 3000 with a hydro ev extension malvern instruments prior to experiments brine was passed through the instrument to measure the background data of the continuous phase subsequently the emulsion was poured into a 600 ml beaker and mounted in the instrument the sample was stirred at 3000 rpm and continuously pumped through the measurement cell the light scattered by the droplets were detected at different angles and transformed into a volume size distribution 100 measurements were performed continuously each lasting 10 s adding up to ca 16 min of experimental time the concentrated solution of a flocculant was injected into the beaker via a micropipette and distributed by the built in mixer in the device after the first minute allowing to obtain initial size distribution after the measurements the instrument was cleaned by passing through water xylene isopropanol mixture 1 1 isopropanol and finally several times more with water three measurements were taken for each condition 2 2 3 4 microfluidics two chip designs with different ways of introducing the flocculants were investigated the initial test design and the optimised test design fig 1 in both cases the fluids were pumped with syringe pumps nemesys mid pressure module v3 cetoni gmbh into the custom designed glass microfluidic chip placed in a chip holder micronit microtechnologies b v all channels had a uniform depth of 45 μm monodisperse droplets were generated at a t junction with 100 μm wide channels after passing a meandering channel they got into a 500 μm wide and 33 mm long coalescence chamber where collisions and coalescence events occurred in the initial test design the flocculant was already dissolved in the brine when the droplets were generated at the t junction and the length of the meandering channel varied from 3 to 75 mm fig 1 initial test design this allowed for different surface ageing of the droplets in the optimised test design fig 1 optimised test design the droplets were generated at the t junction using brine and then passed through the meandering channel with a fixed length of 15 mm the flocculant solution was then added at the entrance of the coalescence chamber the concentration of the flocculant was proportionally higher due to the increased interfacial area ca 35 times but also due to a dilution effect during all experiments a high speed camera ax100 photron connected to an inverted microscope ti u eclipse nikon was used to record images at 8500 fps at the inlet and outlet of the coalescence chamber approximately 10 000 images were taken for each part of the channel the recordings were processed with imagej to extract the position and size of droplets in each image which were later used to calculate the coalescence frequency for each experiment more details can be found elsewhere dudek et al 2020a all reported values were an average of at least three parallels 3 results and discussion the outline of this section is as follows first characterization of the flocculant solutions and emulsions with and without flocculants is presented next the principles and results of each technique are presented and discussed finally the flocculants and methods are evaluated with their advantages and drawbacks 3 1 sample characterization 3 1 1 flocculants table 2 summarizes the information from the chemical suppliers about the type and molecular weight for the flocculants the average size and zeta potential for the flocculants dissolved in aqueous solutions are shown in fig 2 the average size of the flocculants seemed to be related to their molecular weight the smallest size was measured for f2 with the lowest molecular weight while f4 with the highest molecular weight had particles larger than 1 μm no molecular weight data was available for f3 however the size measurement suggested that it could be in the range of a few mda still it should be noted that the polymer chain structure e g high deviation from spherical shape could heavily influence the hydrodynamic radius calculated from the dynamic light scattering experiments the polydispersity indices pdi and size distribution graphs suggested quite high polydispersity within the flocculant molecules or that some of the flocculants could be multicomponent blends fig s1 in si the zeta potentials were in line with the type of flocculant listed in table 2 the surface charges originate from the presence of dissociated anionic groups or protonated cationic groups in the molecules the polycationic additives f1 f3 had the highest positive zeta potentials the amphiphilic f2 had lower and most likely ph dependent charge while the anionic f4 had a significant negative zeta potential 3 1 2 emulsions fig 3 shows the zeta potentials for crude oil g emulsions without and after addition of the flocculants data for crude oil e is shown in fig s2 in si crude oil drops without addition of flocculants had a negative zeta potential of ca 10 mv the negative potential is common for dispersed oil in produced water however the exact value will depend on the oil properties and ionic composition of water buckley et al 1989 farooq et al 2013 addition of three of the flocculants f1 f2 and f3 reversed the zeta potential of the droplets to positive values and the magnitude of that effect corresponded with the type of the flocculant cationic or amphiphilic the presence of the anionic f4 decreased the negative zeta potential of the droplets significantly while the differences between the addition of any flocculant at 10 and 20 ppm were relatively low larger absolute charges were always observed for the higher concentration similar observations were made for crude oil e fig s2 in si the dynamic interfacial tension graphs for oil e in brine with and without flocculants are plotted in fig s3 in si without flocculants crude oil e reached ca 21 mn m after 2 h of measurement the addition of an additive regardless of the type caused a faster drop of the interfacial tension especially in the initial 10 20 min of the measurement after that time the values started to stabilize in a similar manner as without any flocculant however the value after 2 h was slightly below 20 mn m for all cases overall the interfacial tension results confirmed that the flocculants are indeed adsorbing at the oil water interface however their effect on the interfacial tension is relatively small and apparently did not depend on the type of additive both the electrophoretic and interfacial tension measurements showed that all the flocculants adsorbed at the oil drop water interface there are several mechanisms explaining the adsorption of polyelectrolytes on surfaces both with the same and opposite charge holmberg et al 2002 the first three flocculants have a positive charge which should promote the adsorption at a negatively charged crude oil water interface through columbic attraction however in the abundant presence of electrolytes as in our case the adsorption can be decreased the charge of a surface in water must be balanced by the presence of counterions in the vicinity of the surface when electrolytes are present the increase of entropy is not as significant as in an electrolyte free system in addition salt ions can shield the attractive interactions between the polymer and the surface and compete with the polymer for the adsorption sites if the surface and polymer have the same charge as was the case with f4 the attraction is mainly due to van der waals forces in contrast to the oppositely charged interfaces here the addition of salt should increase the adsorption of polymer when a polymer adsorbs at a similarly charged surfaces the charge is neutralized by the presence of counterions which yields local concentration gradient and decrease in the entropy of the system higher concentration of electrolytes will diminish this effect moreover it can also shield the electrostatic repulsion between the surface and the polymer as it will be seen later the high concentration of the electrolyte could also have contributed to the performance of flocculants during emulsion stability testing 3 2 bottle tests the results from the bottle tests for crude oil e are presented in fig 4 the black line shows the time for clarification for the oil in water emulsion without any flocculant present i e equal to or more than 30 min adding 10 ppm of any of the flocculants reduced the separation time slightly in most cases the effect of the higher concentrations was however more pronounced f1 f2 and f3 all reduced the clarification time to ca 20 min while f4 decreased it down to 10 min similar trends were obtained for crude oil g fig s4 in si without major improvement in the separation efficiency it was difficult to compare different systems the errors in the bottle measurements originated from two sources firstly it was problematic to pinpoint the exact moment when the emulsion was clear when the measurements are based on visual observations this is highly operator dependent and can also be affected by other factors e g lighting conditions the ability to more accurately quantify these results could be improved by oil content measurements however this prolongs the procedure significantly secondly the clarity of the samples was noted every 5 min which added some more uncertainty to the results 3 3 turbidity it was challenging to reproduce the initial level of transmitted light for all samples even with consistent methodology in place however the relative change in transmission over time was similar for most parallels and allowed to compare different conditions fig 5 presents the relative change in light transmission after 15 min for all flocculants and concentrations compared to the initial turbidity of the sample the solid line represents the change in transmitted light for the sample without flocculant with the dotted lines as the corresponding standard deviations most of the samples with flocculants experienced changes in transmission within these error bars the exceptions were f1 at 10 ppm and possibly f4 at 20 ppm these two flocculants also had the best performance in the bottle tests also for crude oil g fig s5 in si f1 and f4 at the highest concentration gave better results flocculant 3 at 20 ppm however led to stabilization of emulsion while the rest of the flocculants had a negligible effect on the emulsion stability similar to bottle tests it was difficult to distinguish an improvement in separation unless major differences in turbidity occurred for example for f1 at 10 ppm 3 4 static light scattering the evolution of size distributions over time is shown in fig 6 for the emulsion without flocculant and when f4 was added to the emulsion the initial size distributions i e first few measurements after starting the experiment are shown as dotted lines volume wise most droplets were initially between 10 and 50 μm in diameter however there was also noticeable share of sub 10 μm drops it should be mentioned that multiple scattering caused by too high concentration of the dispersed phase can lead to false signals in the small droplet size ranges however care was taken to keep the concentrations low enough to minimize this effect and the main signal droplets larger than 10 μm remained largely unaffected the arrow in the figures shows the direction towards which the distributions evolve without flocculants the size distribution did not change significantly during the 15 min of measurement the largest drop diameter increased from ca 60 80 μm by contrast the presence of f4 caused a noticeable shift of the size distribution to the right and positively affected the growth of drops either by flocculation or coalescence the largest drop size increased from approximately 40 μm to more than 100 μm another way to describe a size distribution is with the mean value in the case of volume distributions volume mean diameters d 4 3 are often calculated fig 7 shows a summary of evolution of d 4 3 in all systems with crude oil g the corresponding figure showing data for crude oil e is presented in si fig s6 selected measurement points were shown to avoid cluttering the figure standard deviations were omitted for the same reason which is additionally discussed in section 3 6 2 the flocculants were added after the second measurement point whereas the next three points show the subsequent evolution of drop sizes the black line is the drop growth without flocculant f1 at lower concentration and f4 increased the drop growth compared to the sample without flocculants with the latter being more effective at both concentrations furthermore it took longer time for f1 to have an effect as improvement was only observed for the second half of the measurements f2 and f3 gave lower d 4 3 values than for the emulsion without flocculant and the effect was largest at the highest concentrations this suggested that the flocculants led to increased stability and possible breakage of drops due to the mixing and flow through the tubing and cell flow velocity ca 0 1 m s followed by a slow growth in size droplet breakage was probably observed for crude oil g when 20 ppm of f3 was added as a continuous reduction in drop size was observed over the duration of the experiment another useful way of representing the volume size distributions is with dx10 dx50 and dx90 values these are defined as threshold values where 10 50 and 90 of drop sizes in the system are smaller or equal to them respectively fig s7 in si shows the average dx values of crude oil e drops for three cases no flocculant f3 and f4 both at 20 ppm dx10 represents the smallest droplets in the emulsion at the beginning of most experiments its value was typically not higher than 5 μm by the end of the measurement without any flocculant in the system and with f4 at 20 ppm this value was twice and four times as high respectively in the case of f3 only minimal increase was observed dx50 can also be defined as a median value for volume distributions smaller relative increase was observed here as compared to dx10 but with similar trends the same can be said about dx90 often representing the largest droplets in a system while for f3 it went up only by 10 μm it grew by ca 20 μm without any additives and it doubled to more than 100 μm for the other flocculant dx values can provide additional information on the effect of the flocculant on a particular size range of droplets for example showing that the chemical is more effective in promoting the coalescence between the smallest most difficult to remove droplets this seems to be the case with f4 where the increase of the dx10 was considerable still the multiple scattering phenomena could have contributed to some changes in the values of dx10 as explained earlier without any flocculant all drop size classes increased in a similar degree the addition of flocculant 3 however led to size increase only for the largest droplets while hardly any change in the smaller size classes was observed even though larger drops require longer time to coalesce dudek et al 2020b they are easier to encounter by other drops during flow which could explain higher coalescence in this size class 3 5 microfluidics 3 5 1 initial test design fig s8 in si shows how the coalescence frequency was reduced by the length of the meandering channel for crude oil e with different concentrations of f4 f4 was chosen for these experiments since it generally showed the biggest improvement in separation when using the other experimental approaches the coalescence frequency clearly decreased the longer the oil drops had to travel before entering the coalescence chamber this was in line with our previous findings and is due to migration of interfacially active crude oil components i e resins and asphaltenes to the oil water interface where they build up an interfacial layer that opposes coalescence dudek et al 2020a the small difference between the coalescence in the short and medium length channels can probably be explained by relatively large molecular weights for the migrating components that take longer time to adsorb at the oil water interface similar trends were also obtained for the experiments with the addition of flocculant in all cases the coalescence was lowest for the measurements with the longest channel the measurements without and with 10 ppm of f4 were quite similar while the coalescence was markedly lower with 500 ppm two important outcomes were noted from these initial tests firstly the presence of flocculant reduced the coalescence between drops one possible explanation is that adsorption of the flocculant at the fresh oil water interface stabilized the drops this is supported by the interfacial tension measurements where the presence of any of the flocculants caused a small but noticeable change in the interfacial properties of crude oils another explanation could be that the flocculants adsorb less at freshly generated droplets than at aged interfaces which has different surface properties the flocculants in solution would then increase the drainage time of the thin liquid film occurring between droplets prior to coalescence and thereby reduce coalescence secondly the concentration of the flocculant needed to see noticeable effects on the coalescence was considerably higher than for the other tests this was because the oil in water concentration in the coalescence chamber was approximately 100 times higher than in the 500 ppm emulsions by calculating the total interfacial area for the microfluidic experiments for droplets of 55 μm and other techniques initial dx50 25 μm taken from the light scattering data it was seen that this ratio is equal to ca 35 which was used for further experiments 3 5 2 optimised test design the coalescence frequencies when the flocculants were added at the entrance of the coalescence chamber are presented in fig 8 the flocculant concentrations are denoted as low and high concentrations and correspond to 10 and 20 ppm levels from other measurements as explained before similar results for crude oil g are shown in fig s9 in si the average coalescence frequency and the corresponding standard deviation for the samples without flocculant are shown as solid and dotted lines respectively the injection of additional fluid affects the volume fraction of the dispersed phase and the linear velocity in the channel both of which impact coalescence in microchannels krebs et al 2012 therefore pure brine was also injected at the same flow rate through the additional inlet at the beginning of coalescence chamber to keep total flow rate constant both f1 and f4 improved the merging between droplets and the coalescence frequency was generally higher at the concentration equivalent to 20 ppm by contrast the lowest coalescence was seen for f2 and f3 at the highest flocculant concentrations in this chip design the flocculant was added in the beginning of the coalescence chamber perpendicularly to the direction of the main flow in order to verify the distribution of flocculants and oil drops in the coalescence chamber the flocculant solution was replaced by a dye stained water phase fig 9 shows snapshots of this system with varying number of drops in the coalescence chamber without any or with only a few droplets present the laminar flow typical for microfluidics inhibited mixing between the injected and continuous phase therefore the distribution of the flocculant was only driven by the diffusion across the water water boundary this is seen in the first and second column of snapshots in fig 9 the stratified flow of the dye stained water phase and the continuous phase normally containing droplets is visible over the entire length of the coalescence chamber similar case occurred when only some droplets were generated in this situation there were too few droplets to invoke collisions so they mostly followed the laminar streamlines of the continuous phase this resulted in lack of mixing between the two water inlets and two stratified flows were still visible at the outlet of the channel however when the flow of droplets was set to the same level as for all microfluidic experiments the drops started to collide with each other the collisions forced the droplets to also flow in vertical direction which disturbed the laminar flow in the channel the effect could already be seen at the inlet where the frequent contact between drops caused the interface of the dye stained water phase to oscillate further down the channel the droplets flowing out of the upper part of the channel were disrupting the laminar streams creating vortices which resulted in mixing between the two water phases and distribution of the flocculant into the entire cross section of the channel already after 6 mm the boundary between the two phases was no longer visible and only slight colour gradient across the width of the channel could be observed to the best of our knowledge this is the first description of mixing in the continuous phase by the dispersed phase previous papers related to mixing in multiphase microfluidics have dealt with mixing inside the dispersed droplets or mixing in the continuous phase during slug flow bordbar et al 2020 tice et al 2003 3 6 comparison of flocculants and methods discussion 3 6 1 performance of flocculants the comparison of the results obtained with different methods for crude oil e is presented in fig 10 data for crude oil g in fig s10 in si the values are the relative improvement or in some cases decrease of performance for each flocculant as compared to the sample without flocculants coalescence of crude oil drops is inhibited by the adsorption of indigenous surface active components such as resins asphaltenes naphthenic acids and various solids at the oil water interface this can lead to steric stabilization elastic interfaces and marangoni effects which all can prolong the drainage time of the thin aqueous film formed when droplets approach each other if this drainage time becomes longer than the contact time between droplets in the dynamic and turbulent produced water systems coalescence will be scarce and droplet growth slow the flocculants are added to the water phase in order to create flocs bridge droplets and facilitate coalescence leading to improved separation most tests indicated that the most efficient flocculant for both crude oils was f4 according to our data it had the largest molecular weight the largest particle size and in contrast to other flocculants a negative zeta potential even though the crude oil droplets were also negatively charged the flocculant still adsorbed at the oil water interface and decreased the zeta potential even further analysis of our results suggests that the impact of the charge neutralization mechanism on the separation efficiency is probably negligible due to high salinity conditions which effectively screen the charges at the oil water interface it seems that the large molecular weight of f4 was predominantly responsible for its ability to create bigger oil droplets this conclusion is similar to other studies where the larger molecular weight of the flocculant has been connected to improved performance during oil removal s fernandes et al 2005 santos et al 2020 santos et al 2018 furthermore we did not observe any evidence of flocculation during our microfluidic experiments which suggests that the main principle of flocculants improving separation in our study was promoting coalescence it is also unlikely that flocculation occurred during light scattering experiments as the changes in size distribution were relatively smooth similar linear flow velocity as in microfluidic measurements and agitation in the vessel probably inhibited formation of unstable flocs and pointed to coalescence as the main destabilization mechanism some of the flocculants gave worse performance as compared to the experiments without any additives in bottle tests and turbidity measurements almost all flocculants at all concentrations showed a positive response as compared to tests without additives therefore the comparison of efficiency is mostly based on the magnitude of separation improvement methods involving flow however displayed stabilizing or even dispersing effects which lead to worse separation than without flocculants indeed when f3 was used during the light scattering measurement one could observe a decline in d 4 3 after a period of initial increase even though breakage of droplets was not recorded in our microfluidic recordings similar trends were seen for f3 which gave the worst overall performance in that technique 3 6 2 methodology comparison different methods are used to study the efficiency of flocculants in separation processes bottle or jar testing is a well established technique for measuring the efficiency of separation gao et al 2011 huang et al 2019 liu et al 2013 it is based on the gravity separation of droplets the better the flocculant the higher its effect on the coalescence between droplets and the faster the creaming this methodology is simple to conduct and allows several tests at the same time the evaluation of the results can be done through visual observation or by sampling and measuring the oil in water content with a suitable technique visual observation of the sample requires the operator to be present during the entire measurement and is quite subjective in the case of oil content measurement more time and resources chemicals analytical instruments are required for extraction and analysis of the oil concentration there are however a few drawbacks while coalescence or flocculation between droplets is the main mechanism of improving separation this is not directly observed in this method instead creaming of droplets is followed which is orders of magnitude slower than the coalescence process between two droplets measurements with standard samples are typically quicker however separation of oil from water after polymer flooding might take several hours gao et al 2011 the tests are also performed in static conditions of column separation sometimes assisted with some level of agitation turbidity measurements are quite similar to bottle tests this means that it will take similar time to perform the tests which can range from several minutes to hours zhang 2017 other setup configurations are also possible for example fernandes et al evaluated the efficiency of polymeric flocculants with the use of photometric analyser allowing to measure light transmission in flow fernandes et al 2004 compared to bottle testing an improvement is quantitative non subjective data in the form of light transmission measurements over time this is easier to compare than visual observations of turbidity of the samples and it offers more detailed information about the progress of separation the method is also simple and it is possible to measure several samples at the same time in our case the samples were measured continuously for 15 min however less frequent measurements could allow several samples to be tested by changing them in the instrument manually or with an autosampler nevertheless the reproducibility is certainly an issue as it was often difficult to obtain the same initial conditions even with rigorous sample preparation method what is more 500 ppm of oil in the water phase was the lower limit for reliable detection of our instrument below that value the signal was too weak the strength of the signal is however dependent on the type of crude oil heavier oils will produce darker emulsions which could decrease the lower detection limit lighter oils will be more transparent and could be problematic during measurements at lower concentrations the static light scattering methodology allowed to see the direct effect of the addition of flocculants on the drop size distribution however the technique is not without its disadvantages the error bars in figs 7 and s6 were purposely not added to avoid complicating the graphs the absolute values of d 4 3 for both crude oil emulsions together with standard deviations are shown in tables s1 and s2 in si even though the reproducibility of emulsion preparation method was high the first measured size distribution often varied quite a lot due to the startup procedure this impacted the experiment and resulted in large deviations between each parallel one of the reasons was the unavoidable presence of gas bubbles in the beginning of the experiment which took up to a few minutes to remove another limitation of the method was the oil in water concentration when using too concentrated emulsions multiple scattering can occur and as described before give a false signal from the smaller droplets when too little dispersed phase is used the signal to noise ratio might be too low like in turbidity measurements the strength of the signal will also depend on the type of oil and its refractive index fortunately 500 ppm was within the acceptable range for reliable measurements furthermore the droplets could also cream to the surface during the measurement due to imperfect mixing in the vessel thin oil film formation was observed towards the end of the measurement however it did not seem to impact the results to a large extent at least not within our experimental time on the whole the results showed similar trends within each parallel and also in comparison with other techniques microfluidics has already become a well established technology for studying coalescence in emulsified systems bremond and bibette 2012 measurement of droplet growth in microfluidic channels is fast and relies on direct observation and recording of coalescing droplets in flow in contrast other techniques require following changes in water clarity through subjective visual observation turbidity or light scattering alternatively time and solvent consuming sampling extraction and analysis of remaining dispersed oil could also be performed during microfluidic measurements the droplet size is quite similar to what can be expected in the produced water treatment and it is also possible to reduce the drop diameter even further what is more the droplets were generated in situ which reduced the problems with initial drop size distribution compared to other techniques the main difference between our microfluidic method and other techniques used in this study is the concentration of oil because of the laminar flow in the channel the number of generated droplets needs to be quite high to invoke collisions otherwise the droplets would flow in a single row and hardly interact with each other as observed in fig 9 to the best of our knowledge only one other group attempted to study the performance of an additive to observe the effect on flocculation or improved coalescence with the use of microfluidic chips radhakrishnan et al developed a μfloc device for testing flocculation of yeast in the presence of polymeric flocculants p radhakrishnan et al 2018 they also showed that microfluidics could be a great alternative to more traditional methods such as light microscopy or light scattering creaming and flocculation and or coalescence are the main mechanism of oil in water emulsion destabilization however in the first two methods flocculation cannot be quantified directly as both require gravity separation to clarify the water phase and provide a detectable response since the oil droplets are in tens of μm size range this process is rather slow the rising velocity of a crude oil e droplets of 5 and 25 μm in diameter is ca 0 2 and 4 mm min respectively furthermore the emulsions had quite low concentration of oil which could limit collisions between drops and decrease coalescence rates especially considering static conditions of the experiments by contrast in light scattering and microfluidics only the fast phenomena are followed coalescence in flow conditions takes typically between 10 and 100 ms dudek et al 2020a and the changes in size distributions are visible very quickly additionally breakage of droplets could also take place during light scattering experiments due to mixing in the measurement vessel while bottle and turbidity tests typically took around 30 min to finish the effect of the flocculant was visible within a few minutes after starting the experiment for the other two methods however the lengthy preparation and cleaning procedures also affected the time per sample aspect light scattering instrument had to be cleaned thoroughly after each measurement using several different solvents bringing the total experimental time close to 60 min for single test condition microfluidic method took ca 15 min to start and 60 min to clean however several measurements limited only by the number of chips could be done during one run in addition the droplets were generated on the chip as compared to other methods which also saved time and cleaning when it comes to the volume of the sample almost 0 5l of emulsion was needed for our light scattering experiments significantly less was needed for bottle tests and turbidity ca 50 ml and even less than that for microfluidics few μl for 1 s recording the method has the potential to utilize below 1 ml of sample if some optimization steps are implemented for example simplification of the syringe loading procedure or usage of lower volume syringes bottle jar tests and turbidity measurements are often employed in testing of flocculants even though they have several drawbacks such as long measurement time and static conditions this could lead to some problems with screening of chemicals especially if the flocculant has a long initiation time e g low adsorption kinetics or causes breakage of drops impossible to observe in no flow conditions light scattering experiments are quite cumbersome to perform especially considering the lengthy cleaning procedures and large sample volume however it provides additional information about behaviour of drops in flow and gives better understanding on the extent of coalescence and breakage in a system microfluidics also adds the possibility of testing the efficiency of flocculants in dynamic conditions it provides very good control over the drop generation process which compared to the other methods is much more reliable and repeatable the volume of samples required for testing is significantly reduced what is more with few improvements one can drastically decrease the measurement time per sample this can be done through controlling the flocculant concentration injected into the chip which will further extend the possibility of screening tests 4 conclusions in this paper we have characterized four flocculants and tested their performance for produced water treatment with a newly developed microfluidic technique these measurements were compared to three other more established methodologies namely bottle tests turbidity and static light scattering measurements the results showed that for most systems the anionic flocculant was most effective likely due to its large particle size and high molecular weight few differences were observed between the methods which was mostly attributed to the static or dynamic conditions during the measurements or the way the data was collected bottle and turbidity tests relied on observing the clarification of the sample either by eye or measuring the light intensity passing through the sample however no direct data on the effect of the flocculants on the droplet size could have been collected from these experiments in contrast light scattering measurements enabled to observe the changes in drop size distribution during flow while the measurements were quite fast and provided additional results on droplet breakage in some cases the preparation and cleaning procedures were very lengthy in addition to high consumption of samples and solvents furthermore all three methods suffered from issues with repeatable emulsion preparation and transfer to the measurement vessel microfluidic method proved to be a good alternative to standard testing with additional advantages such as low sample consumption monodisperse emulsion generation and shorter measurement times visual observation of droplets allowed to gain several additional insights into the separation process mixing in microfluidics through drop collisions was very effective and helped to distribute the additive in the additive almost immediately after the injection point what is more no floc formation was observed during flow in microchannels which suggested that the main destabilization mechanism responsible for improving separation was coalescence between oil droplets declaration of
