16910,the anaerobic biodegradability assessment biodegradation extent and kinetics of organic wastes is critical for optimum design and evaluating treatment efficiencies for anaerobic treatment technologies the biochemical sulfide potential bsp assay has previously demonstrated the advantages of its time efficiency and measurement accuracy for biologically assessing substrate degradability while its application is limited by undefined operational parameters in this study the bsp assay was further optimized through a systematic investigation of a critical parameter inoculum to substrate ratio isr and the applicable kinetic model to unravel the potential use of bsp assays for anaerobic waste treatment under two series of experimental scenarios the common isr ranges of 0 5 4 0 based on the traditional bmp assay and extreme isrs as low as 0 1 were studied in which the advantage of a bsp assay on extreme isrs was highlighted meanwhile the underlying cause and mechanism for biodegradability discrepancies under different isrs 0 1 6 0 were further investigated the extracellular polymeric substance eps characterization of residual organics and the two substrate first order hydrolysis model analyses revealed that the hydrolysis process of slowly biodegradable organics fraction was hindered under improper isr conditions furthermore the cone model was evaluated as more appropriate for biodegradation kinetics analysis in bsp assays among the five common kinetic models i e exponential fitzhugh cone transference and modified gompertz models overall the results provide fundamental guidance on designing consistent bsp assays and put a step forward in standardizing the bsp assay for anaerobic biodegradability assessments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords substrate biodegradability assessment biochemical sulfide potential assay sulfidogenesis inoculum to substrate ratio waste activated sludge 1 introduction the significant amounts of organic wastes e g sewage sludge and municipal solid waste that are inevitably produced with increasing population growth and industrial agricultural development have become a major environmental challenge vergara and tchobanoglous 2012 anaerobic biotechnology can effectively contribute to the treatment of various waste streams and the recovery of bioenergy thereby leading to the sustainable development of carbon neutral waste treatment mccarty et al 2011 fang and zhang 2015 conducting suitable anaerobic biodegradability assessments to preliminarily characterize the potential of organic waste anaerobic conversion is crucial to determine the design and operation parameters of anaerobic systems and improve the organics degradation efficiency angelidaki et al 2009 this anaerobic biodegradability assessment has conventionally been analyzed by the biochemical methane potential bmp assay based on the methane gas production value and further modeling analysis the bmp assay can determine the waste degradation kinetics and signal potential biomass inhibition under the anaerobic conditions of a methanogenic environment owen et al 1979 numerous efforts have been made to optimize and standardize the bmp assay for broader use hansen et al 2004 angelidaki et al 2009 holliger et al 2016 hafner et al 2020 nevertheless one major limitation of the bmp assay for substrate biodegradability assessment is its long experimental time due to the slow growth of methanogens and complex reaction steps of methanogenesis in which an experiment should only be terminated when the daily methane production is less than 1 of the cumulative methane production bmp1 achieved holliger et al 2016 several alternative approaches e g chemical and elemental analyses spectroscopic uv vis mid infrared near infrared characterization and respirometry evaluation have been studied to obtain the bmp faster lesteur et al 2010 however the degradation kinetics information is often neglected meanwhile the measurement of the volume and composition of the targeted metabolite methane gas often raises concern in regard to the assessment quality of the bmp assay strömberg et al 2014 and it was reported that 15 37 variations were observed in assessing identical model substrates by following a standardized protocol among 19 laboratories raposo et al 2011 recently the biochemical sulfide potential bsp assay has been developed and demonstrated its feasibility for substrate characterization in the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated sani process chen et al 2018 similar to the bmp assay under the anaerobic condition but leveraging the metabolism of sulfate reducing bacteria srb a shortened experimental duration and improved accuracy have been observed in the bsp assay which potentially serves as a novel alternative to biologically assess the substrate degradability for different anaerobic applications however the critical operational parameter of the assay i e the inoculum to substrate ratio isr and the suitable kinetic model for analyzing biodegradation kinetics and interpreting the sulfidogenesis bioprocess that are prerequisites in the bsp assay have not been clarified in the conventional bmp assay it is known that the isr regulates the enzymatic activity and microbial balances of acidogenic fermentation and methanogenesis raposo et al 2009 eskicioglu and ghorbani 2011 fagbohungbe et al 2015 the lag phase λ of microorganisms reaction and their kinetic parameters µm and ks are always altered according to the selected isr values batstone et al 2003 raposo et al 2006 donoso bravo et al 2011 a decreased isr with a fixed inoculum dosage can lead to the accumulation of intermediate compounds e g volatile fatty acids thereby resulting in system acidification with a decreased aqueous alkalinity and ph and consequently inhibiting the sensitive methanogens jensen et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 for high isrs there is also a risk that the inoculum may exhibit low metabolic activities thereby amplifying the background values metabolites from the inoculum via endogenous decay and affecting the bmp results angelidaki et al 2004 differing from the general bmp assay that bicarbonate system hco3 alkalinity makes main contribution to the total alkalinity additional alkalinity and buffering abilities exist in the bsp assay originating from the first dissociation reaction of h2s i e hs alkalinity de godoi et al 2017 poinapen and ekama 2010 thus it can be inferred that a different range of isr values should be applied for the bsp assay meanwhile the inoculum concentration is also an important factor in biodegradability assessment assay that plays significant role in random errors and inter laboratory variability angelidaki and sanders 2004 hafner et al 2020 normally a low inoculum concentration is desired to reduce the interference with the substrate biodegradability assessment angelidaki et al 2009 whereas sufficient inoculum should be provided to guarantee the inoculum metabolic activities indicated as the specific sulfidogenic activity ssa and minimizing their negative effect on the biodegradability assessment in the bsp assay however there is still no standardized protocol for systematic understanding of the bsp assay and the critical operating parameters for obtaining reliable results remains unknown analysis of biodegradation kinetics is helpful for reactor design bioprocess prediction and system optimization astals et al 2013 donoso bravo et al 2011 tomei et al 2009 to aid in the understanding of the waste degradation process and determining the degradation kinetics in the bmp assay the exponential model and the modified gompertz equation have been commonly used to describe the biogas generation batstone et al 2009 batstone and jensen 2011 kafle and chen 2016 however considering the fundamental difference between the bsp and bmp assays neither model can be generically applied for simulating all of the system conditions owing to the structural and numerical complexity of the anaerobic environment donoso bravo et al 2011 thus further study is required to verify the applicability of common kinetic models i e exponential fitzhugh cone transference and modified gompertz models for the bsp assay and to determine the more appropriate one for the bsp assay through model evaluation therefore the overall objectives of this study were to unravel the potential of the bsp assay for broader anaerobic waste treatment while conducting a first step investigation of the isr in standardizing the protocol this work will also contribute to improving the understanding and prediction of the sulfidogenic responses of srb on solid organic waste with the investigation of waste activated sludge was these efforts and results will provide valuable guidance for conducting bsp assays to obtain reliable biodegradability results and demonstrate a new tool with good potential for anaerobic biodegradability assessment 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrate and inoculum source and characteristics fresh was samples collected at the same site from a local wastewater treatment plant in hong kong before each series of bsp assay were used as the substrate for three series of bsp assays i e was1 was2 was3 the anaerobic sludge inoculum enriched with srb was harvested from a long term operated sulfidogenic bioreactor the characteristics suspended solids and chemical oxygen demand cod of the substrates and inoculum for conducting bsp assays in the three series batch assays are shown in table 1 2 2 biochemical sulfide potential bsp assay three series of bsp assays batch tests a b and c were conducted in 120 ml serum bottles and each series contained 6 7 paired experiments blank vs test thereby corresponding to 40 sets of bsp assays each set of assays was conducted in triplicate thus there were 120 individual assays for all of the tests sodium sulfate was added to achieve an excess sulfate condition to fulfill a stoichiometric ratio of less than 0 67 mg cod mg so4 2 that favored a complete sulfidogenesis reaction van loosdrecht et al 2016 the blank experiments were set up to benchmark the sulfide production through the endogenous decay of the inoculum and the blank sulfide production was subtracted from the corresponding sulfide generation in test series for the net sulfide production calculation the experimental procedure of the bsp assay was adopted from our previous study chen et al 2018 which was developed based on the bmp assay protocol angelidaki et al 2009 the detailed steps were as follows the initial ph in all of the experiments was adjusted to 7 0 0 1 using 4m hcl and 4m naoh solution after nitrogen gas flushing the serum bottles were incubated on a shaker 120 rpm 28 1 c and regular sampling was performed all of the assays were continued until the daily total sulfide sum of dissolved sulfide and gaseous h2s production was less than 1 of the cumulative sulfide production for the purpose of using the bsp assay for general anaerobic degradability assessment the different inoculum concentrations and isrs were investigated in batch tests a b and c for standardization of the inoculum concentration the bsp assays were termed batch test a with was1 seven sets of paired experiments inoculum concentrations ranging from 0 38 g volatile suspended solids vss l to 3 45 g vss l i e 0 38 0 96 1 15 1 53 2 30 2 87 and 3 45 g vss l termed batch test a1 a7 respectively were performed to determine the proper inoculum concentrations the isr for batch test a was kept constant at 2 0 on a vss basis which is the most commonly used and recommended isr in conventional bmp assays determining was biodegradability hansen et al 2004 using the obtained proper inoculum concentration ranges batch assay b using was2 as substrate was conducted to investigate the effects of the isrs in common range of 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 3 0 and 4 0 g vss g vss termed batch tests b1 b6 respectively and batch assay c with was3 as substrate was subsequently conducted to explore the effects of extremely low isr ranges of 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 g vss g vss termed batch tests c1 c7 respectively which were based on the conventional bmp assay the scenario designs of all of the experimental series are summarized in table 2 2 3 model based kinetics analysis of bsp assay results kinetic models are normally used for estimating the biodegradability rate of organic substrate for instance the exponential model has been used for biodegradation processes mainly governed by hydrolysis as a rate limiting step angelidaki and sanders 2004 batstone et al 2009 meanwhile the modified gompertz model and cone model are often used for more complex and refractory organic components such as the co digestion process or high solid anaerobic digestion process zhen et al 2015 el mashad 2013 using the obtained experimental results from the batch assays five commonly used kinetic models i e exponential model fitzhugh model cone model transference model and modified gompertz model were

total dissolved sulfide tds were determined according to the standard methods apha 1985 the h2s and hs concentrations were based on the speciation relationships shown in si broderius and smith 1977 the ph values were monitored throughout the test using a ph meter extracellular polymeric substances eps analysis was conducted using the methods described by li and yang 2007 two types of eps i e loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were analyzed in which the contents of polysaccharides ps protein pn and humic like substances hs were measured gaudy 1962 fr et al 1995 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of proper inoculum concentrations in the bsp assay regarding the differences in the substrate preferences between the srb and methanogenic archaea ma isa et al 1986 lawrence 1966 it is necessary to first standardize the inoculum concentration and investigate its effect on the bsp assay prior to the isr studies the inoculum dosage in the traditional bmp assay was reported as 1 3 3 3 g vss l for assessing various substrates maya altamira et al 2008 alzate et al 2012 kafle and kim 2013 awais et al 2016 considering the wider range of substrate preferences the biodegradation performances of the bsp assay with different inoculum concentrations 0 38 3 45 g vss l under an isr of 2 0 were investigated and the results are shown in fig 1 the biodegradation performances of the bsp assay batch tests a1 a7 with different inoculum concentrations 0 38 3 45 g vss l are shown in fig 1 a similar amount of time approximately 6 0 days for reaching bsp1 indicating the completion of the bsp assay was observed for batch tests a2 a7 and the duration of batch test a1 0 38 g vss l inoculum was only 4 5 days fig 1a and 1b meanwhile for all of the scenarios batch tests a1 a7 the sulfide produced from the blank series accounted for only 4 1 16 7 of the total sulfide production fig 1b the findings confirmed that the range of the inoculum concentration from 0 96 g vss l to 3 45 g vss l batch tests a2 a7 did not adversely affect the bsp performance duration while satisfying the stated requirement in the bmp protocol of background metabolite production should be less than 20 of the total final production holliger et al 2016 figure 1c shows the substrate biodegradability extent results of bsp batch test a1 a7 the calculated biodegradability extents of batch tests a2 a7 were all close to each other with an average value of 19 74 0 74 however the value was only 10 64 for batch test a1 which was 46 10 lower than the average value thereby indicating that the assessment quality of the bsp assay was severely affected under this condition no obvious correlations existed between the biodegradability extent test duration and inoculum concentration indicating that an excessive amount of inoculum confers no extra benefits to the enhanced biodegradability extent or the accelerated biodegradation rate but does raise greater concerns over the background sulfide proportion from endogenous decay process which are required to be less than 20 of the total sulfide generation i e bsp1 fig 1d shows the ssa of batch test a the obtained ssa values for batch tests a2 a7 were similar and close to the average value of 0 034 0 003 g codconverted g vssinoculum d the lowest ssa value of 0 018 g codconverted g vssinoculum d was found at the lowest inoculum concentration of 0 38 g vss l in batch test a1 which was 45 5 lower than the average ssa obtained from a2 a7 thereby indicating that the microbial activity was negatively affected under the condition of a1 the results of the substrate biodegradability extent and ssa indicated that it is necessary to keep the inoculum concentration and ssa higher than 0 96 g vss l and 0 018 g codconverted g vssinoculum d respectively it was worhtnoting that the derived minimum threshold of inoculum concentration was from the inoculum and substrate in the specific case of this study and it is recommended bsp assay applications for various kinds of organics should be conducted with several concentration levels of inoculum in parallel like that of required in the bmp assay protocol to avoid the underestimation angelidaki et al 2009 to determine the reasonable isrs in the following bsp assays an inoculum concentration range of 0 96 3 45 g vss l was adopted 3 2 biodegradation performance of was under different isrs 3 2 1 bsp assays under common isr range from 0 5 to 4 0 to investigate the applicable isr range in the bsp assay isrs in the range of 0 5 4 0 batch tests b1 b6 which are commonly studied values in conventional bmp assays were evaluated in the bsp assay fig 2 a depicts the changes in the sulfide generation for reaching the steady state of bsp1 in which no clear lag phase and deviations in test duration fig 2b were observed under all of the isr conditions the percentages of sulfide produced from the blank series of tests b1 b6 is revealed in fig 2b all of the values were less than 20 for batch tests b1 b5 whereas the value reached 45 for batch test b6 moreover the results of the ssa and biodegradability extent for batch tests b1 b6 are illustrated in fig 2c the ssa values presented an inverse proportional trend with the increased isrs in batch tests b1 b6 in which the trendline equation of y 0 0514x 1 07 r 2 0 97 could be obtained for the values that originated from batch tests b1 b5 thereby indicating that an inoculum deficiency did not occur under those isr conditions however the ssa value was lower than 0 018 g codconverted g vssinoculum d under batch test b6 which was the marginal value for the guaranteed inoculum activity although the biodegradability extents under scenarios b1 b6 fig 2c were in the range of 27 40 29 00 28 07 0 77 on average for isrs of 0 5 3 0 they sharply decreased to 21 00 when the isr further increased to 4 0 which was 24 35 lower than the average value of b1 b5 the optimal isr that achieved the maximum organics biodegradation extent was found to be 2 15 from the quadratic equation y 0 0237x 2 0 1018x 0 1865 r 2 0 96 of the biodegradability extent trendline within the studied isr range 0 5 4 0 these values of biodegradability extent for the was substrate were consistent with those in previous publications 13 to 33 wang et al 2013 yun et al 2015 wei et al 2018 mahdy et al 2015 zahedi et al 2017 which are generally considered to be lower than those of primary sludge owing to the high content of recalcitrant and non biodegradable substances lafitte trouqué and forster 2002 the underestimation of the biodegradability extent under batch test b6 isr 4 0 can be attributed to the low microbial activity that was revealed by the ssa fig 2 cossu and raga 2008 ponsá et al 2008 scaglia et al 2010 c furthermore there is evidence that biomass cannot induce hydrolytic enzymes properly under a low substrate load lim and fox 2013 moreover the amplified sulfide production approximately 45 from the blank series at an isr of 4 0 can also affect the reliability of the bsp results the ph values under different isr scenarios batch tests b1 b6 remained approximately neutral within the range of 7 3 7 6 fig 2d and no ph imbalance was observed even at the lowest isr of 0 5 which sustained the highest substrate load thereby showing the sufficient buffering capacity of the bsp assay under low isr conditions specifically the sulfide alkalinity contributed approximately 653 mg caco3 l at an isr of 0 5 compared with the 475 351 300 and 207 mg caco3 l with increasing isrs of 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 3 0 respectively and 110 mg caco3 l at an isr of 4 0 in the conventional bmp assay for sewage sludge co digestion treatment the alkalinities under these anaerobic biodegradation environments were approximately 2000 3000 mg caco3 l nakakihara et al 2014 rao and baral 2011 moretto et al 2020 bolzonella et al 2006 thus under isr condition of 0 5 the sulfide alkalinity accounted for nearly one third to one quarter of the total alkalinity in the sulfidogenesis system which greatly contributed to the increased buffering capacity and process stability in bsp assay thus similar ph values could be maintained for batch tests b1 b6 therefore based on the combined indications by the ssa and biodegradability extent the isr range of 0 5 3 0 was confirmed to be applicable in the bsp assay 3 2 2 bsp assays under extreme isr conditions low to 0 1 as demonstrated in section 3 2 1 the bioprocess of the bsp assay remained stable and effective for biodegradation assessments with an isr as low as 0 5 in view of the increased sulfide alkalinity with a lower isr that might enable an enlarged ph buffering ability in the bsp process extremely low isrs of 0 1 0 5 batch tests c1 c4 were further investigated to explore their feasibility in the bsp assay the effects on biodegradability characterization and further result validation isrs of 1 0 2 0 batch tests c5 c7 therefore the was substrate biodegradation characteristics from different isr scenarios of 0 1 2 0 batch tests c1 c7 were investigated and the results are illustrated in fig 3 first for the bsp system stability under extremely low isrs the ph values under all of the scenarios and digestion times remained between 6 8 and 7 8 fig 3a which were favorable for the metabolism of anaerobic microorganisms thereby demonstrating the ph stability of the bsp bioprocess under extreme isr conditions batch tests c1 c4 the system stability under those extreme isrs batch tests c1 c4 can be attributed to the sulfide alkalinity which was 1 9 3 8 times higher than that under an isr of 1 0 batch test c5 and contributed to the additional strong buffering ability of the bsp process as well as the bicarbonate alkalinity meanwhile the lowest ph values were observed under c6 and c7 conditions resulted from the lowest sulfide production fig 3b under those conditions to enhance the maintenance of system buffering ability as sulfide alkalinity in terms of the substrate biodegradation performance the net sulfide production required a similar duration to approach bsp1 under all of the stable bsp assay scenarios from isrs of 0 1 to 2 0 fig 3b furthermore the substrate solubilization performances were compared and analyzed as illustrated in fig 3c a higher release amount and rate of biodegradable organics was revealed under lower isr conditions within the studied isrs batch tests c1 c7 the higher release rate of more scod at extreme isrs batch tests c1 c4 implied that more cells were decomposed from particulate substrates that consistent with the higher organics concentration added initially and ascribed to the key enzymes relevant to hydrolysis and acidogenesis meanwhile the cod solubilization ratios scod tcod showed that comparable values of 18 3 20 2 were achieved under all of the experimental conditions thereby indicating that the hydrolytic activity of was was not adversely influenced under the extreme isr conditions batch tests c1 c4 fig 3d exhibits the biodegradation extent and ssa results of all of the scenarios batch tests c1 c7 a slightly higher biodegradation extent a comparable value range of 14 65 16 14 was found under extreme isrs of 0 1 0 5 batch tests c1 c4 compared with that of 14 44 under an isr of 2 0 batch test c7 which was the optimum isr within the common isr range of 0 5 4 0 regarding the biodegradability extent section 3 2 1 this implied that under extremely low isrs from 0 1 to 0 5 batch tests c1 c4 the efficacy and robustness of the bsp assay in biodegradation characterization were maintained the ssa results were all higher than the marginal value of 0 018 g codconverted g vssinoculum d for the guaranteed inoculum activity and strongly correlated with the isr trends under the conditions of batch tests c1 c7 thereby implying that the microbial activity was not affected under extreme isr conditions of 0 1 0 5 batch tests c1 c4 it was concluded that the biodegradability extent and ssa were not influenced in the bsp assays under extremely low isrs from 0 1 to 0 5 therefore it was confirmed that the applicable range of isrs for the bsp assay can be extended to 0 1 3 0 3 3 mechanism of the isr role in biodegradability characterization of was to further investigate the underlying reasons for the difference in substrate biodegradation extent under different isr environments the residual organic matter characterized as eps after the bsp assay under different isrs i e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 4 0 6 0 was explored details in si eps are the main constituent of sludge cells and are composed of molecules from cell lysis polymers bond to active and inert biomass or adsorbed attached matter nielsen et al 1997 hsieh et al 1994 in the anaerobic treatment process eps of sludge cells are normally exogenously disintegrated by hydrolytic enzymes and released as small molecules to be further utilized by microorganisms comte et al 2006 bura et al 1998 sheng et al 2010 the two structural types of eps lb eps and tb eps and their major chemical composition pn ps and hs were characterized accordingly figure 4 a shows the concentration variations in residual lb eps and tb eps under different isrs in the bsp assay the lb eps quantities showed a decreasing trend from 20 3 25 8 mg toc g vss under an isr of 0 1 0 5 to 14 3 19 0 mg toc g vss with higher isrs meanwhile the tb eps quantities were appropriately 27 31 6 mg toc g vss under the isr range of 0 1 3 0 and increased to 37 3 mg toc g vss and 42 8 mg toc g vss at an isr of 4 0 and 6 0 the lb eps tb eps ratio showed a decreasing trend from 0 71 0 83 at an isr of 0 1 0 5 to 0 51 0 58 at an isr of 1 0 3 0 and further decreased to 0 48 and 0 44 under isr of 4 0 and 6 0 respectively moreover the major components i e pn ps and hs from both lb eps and tb eps were quantified and are shown in fig 4b and 4c among the three types of organic matter hs pn and ps substantially higher proportions of hs were found in both lb eps and tb eps accounting for 79 95 and 75 87 respectively thereby suggesting that hs was the major component of the residual organics in the was after sulfidogenic degradation in bsp assay it was reported that hs contains refractory phenolic hydroxyl groups alcoholic hydroxyl groups and alkane structure they are also difficult to biodegrade in methanogenesis system liu et al 2019 li et al 2019a similar to the conclusion from section 3 2 that the biodegradability extent was underestimated with isr 4 0 the assessed biodegradability extent in this part was observed as undervalued under both isr 4 0 and 6 0 conditions fig 4d meanwhile the underestimated biodegradability extent under isr scenarios of 4 0 and 6 0 were correlated with low lb eps tb eps ratios 1 21 1 48 times lower than isrs of 0 1 3 0 eps provide colloidal stability to sludge flocs and are closely related to the sludge structural integrity liu and fang 2003 gianico et al 2013 the lower lb eps tb eps ratio indicated that a more compact residual substrate structure was maintained after the bsp process and less soluble substances were released which could have resulted from the lower efficiency of hydrolytic enzymatic activities to investigate this the sulfidogenic biodegradation process in the bsp assay was simulated by the two substrate first order hydrolysis model which segregates the substrate into readily biodegradable and slowly biodegradable organics rao et al 2000 wang et al 2013 table 3 under an isr of 4 0 and 6 0 lower biodegradation rate were observed in the slowly biodegradable organics fraction than that under other isr conditions from 0 1 to 3 0 meanwhile the higher quantities of tb eps and hs under an isr of 4 0 and 6 0 proved that more organic matter in the substrate was not fully hydrolyzed and consumed fig 2c these results verified that the hydrolysis process under an isr of 4 0 in the common isr ranges was adversely influenced thereby demonstrating the negative effect of improper isrs on hydrolysis and the anaerobic biodegradability characterization of the bsp assay thus it was deduced that the underestimated organics biodegradability in the bsp assay under a high isr of 4 0 within the common isrs was correlated with the hindered hydrolysis process resulting from the improper isr the strong correlation between the isr and the hydrolysis process was proved the possible mechanism of the relationship between the isr hydrolysis process and biodegradability characterization results in the bsp assays is shown in fig 5 the eps characteristics under extreme isrs below 0 5 were also analyzed because of the strong tolerance of the bsp assay under extreme isrs for biodegradability characterization under the extreme isrs of 0 1 0 3 the lb eps tb eps ratios were 1 48 1 73 times higher than those under an isr of 4 0 thereby indicating a less compact substrate structure and a more thorough hydrolysis process therefore it was hypothesized that under the isrs of 0 1 0 3 the high cell lysis efficiency enabled substrate depolymerization by the extracellular enzymes secreted from the biomass and thus promoted the release of intracellular materials the cod release performance fig 3c supported this hypothesis furthermore among the determined available isr range from 0 1 to 3 0 higher amounts of hs were observed in lb eps under isrs 0 1 0 3 350 378 mg g vss compared with that of under isrs of 0 5 1 5 286 296 mg g vss and isrs of 2 0 3 0 333 340 mg g vss it was reported that hs have an inhibitory effect on the anaerobic methanogenic biodegradation performance of organics li et al 2019b whereas no influence of hs on the biodegradation performance was observed under an isr of 0 1 0 3 in the bsp assay in this study the threshold concentration of hs and the mechanism of their influence on the bsp results and organic matter structures require further comprehensive investigation 3 4 evaluation of kinetic models in the bsp assay analysis of the kinetics is crucial in studying the anaerobic biodegradation rate as the kinetics is not only connected to many design and operational parameters but also enables the prediction of bioprocess performance in different operating scenarios raposo et al 2011 to determine the most suitable kinetic model for elucidating the biodegradation process in the bsp assay five commonly used kinetic models eqs 1 to 5 were evaluated using the results of the bsp assay with different applicable isrs 0 1 3 0 in which the influence of the isr values on the biodegradation kinetics was also investigated the simulation results of the fitted curves with experimental data under various isrs are shown in fig s3 in the supplementary information si the estimated biodegradation rate k varied with changes in the isr fig 6 a which was in agreement with previous reports that the hydrolysis rate is not a universal constant miron et al 2000 the biodegradation rates from all of the models showed the higher values with isrs of 0 5 2 0 among the isrs of 0 1 3 0 thereby implying the practical feasibility of a reduced retention time and smaller reactor application under those conditions furthermore the estimated biodegradability potentials from the five models were less sensitive to the isr than the biodegradation kinetics in the bsp assay fig 6b a comparison of the simulated ultimate biodegradability potential and the experimental data from the bsp assay is shown in fig 6c high pearson s correlation coefficients rp 0 972 0 981 under all of the isrs suggested a reasonably adequate agreement between the actual and simulated biodegradability extent values the estimated kinetic parameters and indicators r 2 rmse and aicc for accuracy and reliability evaluation of the studied models are presented in table 4 the average highest r 2 0 97 0 03 lowest rmse 20 03 12 44 and lowest aicc 50 09 8 49 were observed in the cone model thereby indicating that it best fits the actual evolution of sulfide production in the bsp assay among the studied models this suggested that the cone model had the minimum deviation for predicting and analyzing the bsp results with the was used in this study followed by the exponential model conversely the average overall lowest r 2 0 94 0 03 highest rmse 31 54 11 08 and highest aicc 61 63 8 13 were observed in the modified gompertz model this implied that the modified gompertz model was not as good as the cone model to simulate the sulfidogenesis biodegradation process in the bsp assay with sufficient accuracy although it has been the most commonly used kinetic model for the methanogenesis process simulation in bmp assays additionally the λ values estimated from the transference model and the gompertz model table 4 were either very small or negative under the varied isrs thereby implying that the analysis of λ in the bsp assay can be omitted to reduce the number of parameters in the computation this further indicated that it was less important to use the transference model and the modified gompertz model in bsp applications therefore the cone model was recommended as the most suitable model for biodegradation kinetics analysis in the bsp assay and the exponential model was ranked second finally a sufficient sampling frequency is required during the bsp assay for kinetics analysis to avoid a reduced statistical robustness and increased uncertainty 3 5 limitation and perspectives from the stoichiometry point of view the steady state bmp and bsp models that were built on mass and electron balances of the methanogenic and sulfidogenic degradation pathways were shown as eq s1 and eq s2 in the si both pathways were based on the assumptions 1 complete methhanogenesis and sulfidogenesis occur in both processes 2 without considering the inoculum influence in both bmp and bsp processes 3 methanogenesis was not present in the sulfidogenesis process and no sulfidogenesis occurred in the methanogenic process from the steady state bmp and bsp models with the assumptions abovementioned it can be calculated by simplification that identical amount of organics a 2 b 8 c 4 3 d 8 5 e 8 64 g cod can be biodegraded from 1 mole of substrate c a h b o c n d p e from the bmp and bsp assays respectively in case of the influence from inoculum was not included however as different inoculum and metabolism pathways were contained in the bsp and bmp assays different biodegradability extent could have occurred considering the inoculum influence which has been compared and validated in our previous study chen et al 2018 in our future study correlation coefficients between bmp values bsp values based on the databased of various organic substrates and different inoculum types could be derived comparably to the correlation coefficients between bmp values and aerobic respiration indexes ponsá et al 2008 cossu and raga 2008 scaglia et al 2010 meanwhile the amount of sulfate chemical dosage could also be a critical factor for bsp assay since the cod sulfate ratio regulates the inoculum activity and therefore affect the biodegradability assessment results besides it is worth noting that the optimized bsp assay is provided as a rapid approach for assessing the anaerobic biodegradability of organic substrates instead of replacing other assays furthermore the assessed biodegradability extent from the bsp assay could achieve the highest resemblance to the biodegradability extent from the conventional bmp results when compared to aerobic respiration methods and physical chemical alternatives e g chemical and elemental analyses uv vis spectroscopic mid infrared spectroscopic near infrared spectroscopic and etc in addition the sulfate chemical is readily available and the inoculum srb cultures cultivation is easily to be operated hence the necessity for bsp assay from those two aspects could be overcome and would not be the critical limiting factors for the implementation of bsp assay moreover shorter experimental durations enhanced measurement accuracy and wider ranges of isr with less inoculum amount provide advantages of bsp assay as a rapid assessment of the anaerobic biodegradability for organic waste the bsp assay additionally contributes to process understanding and risk assessments of broader anaerobic biotechnologies for instance estimation of the optimum ratios between co substrates prediction of the influence of unknown inhibitors on ad efficiency and feasibility studies of pre treatment strategies on digester stability and efficacy 4 conclusions this study provides a detailed examination of the previously unascertained bsp operational conditions for a fast and accurate anaerobic biodegradability assessment of organics including the inoculum concentration and isr and the selection of the most suitable kinetic model for biodegradation kinetics analysis the main conclusions are summarized as follows a minimum threshold of an inoculum concentration of 0 96 g l was verified for the guaranteed activity in the bsp assay and an ssa value of less than 0 018 g codconverted g vssinoculum d was found to adversely affect the biodegradability extent with was and inoculum used in our study the isr had a significant influence on the bsp assay results especially when the isr was higher than 3 0 the utility and superiority of the bsp assay under extreme isrs from 0 1 to 0 5 were highlighted an applicable isr range of 0 1 to 3 0 was confirmed for bsp assay implementation in assessing the organics biodegradability the underlying relationship between the isr and hydrolysis process in the bsp assay was revealed by the eps characteristics of the residual organics and further verified through a two substrate hydrolysis kinetic model the underestimated was biodegradability under an isr of 4 0 was mainly attributed to the hindered hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable organics the statistical analysis showed that the cone model is the most appropriate kinetic model for bsp assay application declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the authors greatly acknowledge dr tsui to

16910,the anaerobic biodegradability assessment biodegradation extent and kinetics of organic wastes is critical for optimum design and evaluating treatment efficiencies for anaerobic treatment technologies the biochemical sulfide potential bsp assay has previously demonstrated the advantages of its time efficiency and measurement accuracy for biologically assessing substrate degradability while its application is limited by undefined operational parameters in this study the bsp assay was further optimized through a systematic investigation of a critical parameter inoculum to substrate ratio isr and the applicable kinetic model to unravel the potential use of bsp assays for anaerobic waste treatment under two series of experimental scenarios the common isr ranges of 0 5 4 0 based on the traditional bmp assay and extreme isrs as low as 0 1 were studied in which the advantage of a bsp assay on extreme isrs was highlighted meanwhile the underlying cause and mechanism for biodegradability discrepancies under different isrs 0 1 6 0 were further investigated the extracellular polymeric substance eps characterization of residual organics and the two substrate first order hydrolysis model analyses revealed that the hydrolysis process of slowly biodegradable organics fraction was hindered under improper isr conditions furthermore the cone model was evaluated as more appropriate for biodegradation kinetics analysis in bsp assays among the five common kinetic models i e exponential fitzhugh cone transference and modified gompertz models overall the results provide fundamental guidance on designing consistent bsp assays and put a step forward in standardizing the bsp assay for anaerobic biodegradability assessments graphical abstract image graphical abstract

vergara and tchobanoglous 2012 anaerobic biotechnology can effectively contribute to the treatment of various waste streams and the recovery of bioenergy thereby leading to the sustainable development of carbon neutral waste treatment mccarty et al 2011 fang and zhang 2015 conducting suitable anaerobic biodegradability assessments to preliminarily characterize the potential of organic waste anaerobic conversion is crucial to determine the design and operation parameters of anaerobic systems and improve the organics degradation efficiency angelidaki et al 2009 this anaerobic biodegradability assessment has conventionally been analyzed by the biochemical methane potential bmp assay based on the methane gas production value and further modeling analysis the bmp assay can determine the waste degradation kinetics and signal potential biomass inhibition under the anaerobic conditions of a methanogenic environment owen et al 1979 numerous efforts have been made to optimize and standardize the bmp assay for broader use hansen et al 2004 angelidaki et al 2009 holliger et al 2016 hafner et al 2020 nevertheless one major limitation of the bmp assay for substrate biodegradability assessment is its long experimental time due to the slow growth of methanogens and complex reaction steps of methanogenesis in which an experiment should only be terminated when the daily methane production is less than 1 of the cumulative methane production bmp1 achieved holliger et al 2016 several alternative approaches e g chemical and elemental analyses spectroscopic uv vis mid infrared near infrared characterization and respirometry evaluation have been studied to obtain the bmp faster lesteur et al 2010 however the degradation kinetics information is often neglected meanwhile the measurement of the volume and composition of the targeted metabolite methane gas often raises concern in regard to the assessment quality of the bmp assay strömberg et al 2014 and it was reported that 15 37 variations were observed in assessing identical model substrates by following a standardized protocol among 19 laboratories raposo et al 2011 recently the biochemical sulfide potential bsp assay has been developed and demonstrated its feasibility for substrate characterization in the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated sani process chen et al 2018 similar to the bmp assay under the anaerobic condition but leveraging the metabolism of sulfate reducing bacteria srb a shortened experimental duration and improved accuracy have been observed in the bsp assay which potentially serves as a novel alternative to biologically assess the substrate degradability for different anaerobic applications however the critical operational parameter of the assay i e the inoculum to substrate ratio isr and the suitable kinetic model for analyzing biodegradation kinetics and interpreting the sulfidogenesis bioprocess that are prerequisites in the bsp assay have not been clarified in the conventional bmp assay it is known that the isr regulates the enzymatic activity and microbial balances of acidogenic fermentation and methanogenesis raposo et al 2009 eskicioglu and ghorbani 2011 fagbohungbe et al 2015 the lag phase λ of microorganisms reaction and their kinetic parameters µm and ks are always altered according to the selected isr values batstone et al 2003 raposo et al 2006 donoso bravo et al 2011 a decreased isr with a fixed inoculum dosage can lead to the accumulation of intermediate compounds e g volatile fatty acids thereby resulting in system acidification with a decreased aqueous alkalinity and ph and consequently inhibiting the sensitive methanogens jensen et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 for high isrs there is also a risk that the inoculum may exhibit low metabolic activities thereby amplifying the background values metabolites from the inoculum via endogenous decay and affecting the bmp results angelidaki et al 2004 differing from the general bmp assay that bicarbonate system hco3 alkalinity makes main contribution to the total alkalinity additional alkalinity and buffering abilities exist in the bsp assay originating from the first dissociation reaction of h2s i e hs alkalinity de godoi et al 2017 poinapen and ekama 2010 thus it can be inferred that a different range of isr values should be applied for the bsp assay meanwhile the inoculum concentration is also an important factor in biodegradability assessment assay that plays significant role in random errors and inter laboratory variability angelidaki and sanders 2004 hafner et al 2020 normally a low inoculum concentration is desired to reduce the interference with the substrate biodegradability assessment angelidaki et al 2009 whereas sufficient inoculum should be provided to guarantee the inoculum metabolic activities indicated as the specific sulfidogenic activity ssa and minimizing their negative effect on the biodegradability assessment in the bsp assay however there is still no standardized protocol for systematic understanding of the bsp assay and the critical operating parameters for obtaining reliable results remains unknown analysis of biodegradation kinetics is helpful for reactor design bioprocess prediction and system optimization astals et al 2013 donoso bravo et al 2011 tomei et al 2009 to aid in the understanding of the waste degradation process and determining the degradation kinetics in the bmp assay the exponential model and the modified gompertz equation have been commonly used to describe the biogas generation batstone et al 2009 batstone and jensen 2011 kafle and chen 2016 however considering the fundamental difference between the bsp and bmp assays neither model can be generically applied for simulating all of the system conditions owing to the structural and numerical complexity of the anaerobic environment donoso bravo et al 2011 thus further study is required to verify the applicability of common kinetic models i e exponential fitzhugh cone transference and modified gompertz models for the bsp assay and to determine the more appropriate one for the bsp assay through model evaluation therefore the overall objectives of this study were to unravel the potential of the bsp assay for broader anaerobic waste treatment while conducting a first step investigation of the isr in standardizing the protocol this work will also contribute to improving the understanding and prediction of the sulfidogenic responses of srb on solid organic waste with the investigation of waste activated sludge was these efforts and results will provide valuable guidance for conducting bsp assays to obtain reliable biodegradability results and demonstrate a new tool with good potential for anaerobic biodegradability assessment 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrate and inoculum source and characteristics fresh was samples collected at the same site from a local wastewater treatment plant in hong kong before each series of bsp assay were used as the substrate for three series of bsp assays i e was1 was2 was3 the anaerobic sludge inoculum enriched with srb was harvested from a long term operated sulfidogenic bioreactor the characteristics suspended solids and chemical oxygen demand cod of the substrates and inoculum for conducting bsp assays in the three series batch assays are shown in table 1 2 2 biochemical sulfide potential bsp assay three series of bsp assays batch tests a b and c were conducted in 120 ml serum bottles and each series contained 6 7 paired experiments blank vs test thereby corresponding to 40 sets of bsp assays each set of assays was conducted in triplicate thus there were 120 individual assays for all of the tests sodium sulfate was added to achieve an excess sulfate condition to fulfill a stoichiometric ratio of less than 0 67 mg cod mg so4 2 that favored a complete sulfidogenesis reaction van loosdrecht et al 2016 the blank experiments were set up to benchmark the sulfide production through the endogenous decay of the inoculum and the blank sulfide production was subtracted from the corresponding sulfide generation in test series for the net sulfide production calculation the experimental procedure of the bsp assay was adopted from our previous study chen et al 2018 which was developed based on the bmp assay protocol angelidaki et al 2009 the detailed steps were as follows the initial ph in all of the experiments was adjusted to 7 0 0 1 using 4m hcl and 4m naoh solution after nitrogen gas flushing the serum bottles were incubated on a shaker 120 rpm 28 1 c and regular sampling was performed all of the assays were continued until the daily total sulfide sum of dissolved sulfide and gaseous h2s production was less than 1 of the cumulative sulfide production for the purpose of using the bsp assay for general anaerobic degradability assessment the different inoculum concentrations and isrs were investigated in batch tests a b and c for standardization of the inoculum concentration the bsp assays were termed batch test a with was1 seven sets of paired experiments inoculum concentrations ranging from 0 38 g volatile suspended solids vss l to 3 45 g vss l i e 0 38 0 96 1 15 1 53 2 30 2 87 and 3 45 g vss l termed batch test a1 a7 respectively were performed to determine the proper inoculum concentrations the isr for batch test a was kept constant at 2 0 on a vss basis which is the most commonly used and recommended isr in conventional bmp assays determining was biodegradability hansen et al 2004 using the obtained proper inoculum concentration ranges batch assay b using was2 as substrate was conducted to investigate the effects of the isrs in common range of 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 3 0 and 4 0 g vss g vss termed batch tests b1 b6 respectively and batch assay c with was3 as substrate was subsequently conducted to explore the effects of extremely low isr ranges of 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 g vss g vss termed batch tests c1 c7 respectively which were based on the conventional bmp assay the scenario designs of all of the experimental series are summarized in table 2 2 3 model based kinetics analysis of bsp assay results kinetic models are normally used for estimating the biodegradability rate of organic substrate for instance the exponential model has been used for biodegradation processes mainly governed by hydrolysis as a rate limiting step angelidaki and sanders 2004 batstone et al 2009 meanwhile the modified gompertz model and cone model are often used for more complex and refractory organic components such as the co digestion process or high solid anaerobic digestion process zhen et al 2015 el mashad 2013 using the obtained experimental results from the batch assays five commonly used kinetic models i e exponential model fitzhugh model cone model transference model and modified gompertz model were

loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were analyzed in which the contents of polysaccharides ps protein pn and humic like substances hs were measured gaudy 1962 fr et al 1995 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of proper inoculum concentrations in the bsp assay regarding the differences in the substrate preferences between the srb and methanogenic archaea ma isa et al 1986 lawrence 1966 it is necessary to first standardize the inoculum concentration and investigate its effect on the bsp assay prior to the isr studies the inoculum dosage in the traditional bmp assay was reported as 1 3 3 3 g vss l for assessing various substrates maya altamira et al 2008 alzate et al 2012 kafle and kim 2013 awais et al 2016 considering the wider range of substrate preferences the biodegradation performances of the bsp assay with different inoculum concentrations 0 38 3 45 g vss l under an isr of 2 0 were investigated and the results are shown in fig 1 the biodegradation performances of the bsp assay batch tests a1 a7 with different inoculum concentrations 0 38 3 45 g vss l are shown in fig 1 a similar amount of time approximately 6 0 days for reaching bsp1 indicating the completion of the bsp assay was observed for batch tests a2 a7 and the duration of batch test a1 0 38 g vss l inoculum was only 4 5 days fig 1a and 1b meanwhile for all of the scenarios batch tests a1 a7 the sulfide produced from the blank series accounted for only 4 1 16 7 of the total sulfide production fig 1b the findings confirmed that the range of the inoculum concentration from 0 96 g vss l to 3 45 g vss l batch tests a2 a7 did not adversely affect the bsp performance duration while satisfying the stated requirement in the bmp protocol of background metabolite production should be less than 20 of the total final production holliger et al 2016 figure 1c shows the substrate biodegradability extent results of bsp batch test a1 a7 the calculated biodegradability extents of batch tests a2 a7 were all close to each other with an average value of 19 74 0 74 however the value was only 10 64 for batch test a1 which was 46 10 lower than the average value thereby indicating that the assessment quality of the bsp assay was severely affected under this condition no obvious correlations existed between the biodegradability extent test duration and inoculum concentration indicating that an excessive amount of inoculum confers no extra benefits to the enhanced biodegradability extent or the accelerated biodegradation rate but does raise greater concerns over the background sulfide proportion from endogenous decay process which are required to be less than 20 of the total sulfide generation i e bsp1 fig 1d shows the ssa of batch test a the obtained ssa values for batch tests a2 a7 were similar and close to the average value of 0 034 0 003 g codconverted g vssinoculum d the lowest ssa value of 0 018 g codconverted g vssinoculum d was found at the lowest inoculum concentration of 0 38 g vss l in batch test a1 which was 45 5 lower than the average ssa obtained from a2 a7 thereby indicating that the microbial activity was negatively affected under the condition of a1 the results of the substrate biodegradability extent and ssa indicated that it is necessary to keep the inoculum concentration and ssa higher than 0 96 g vss l and 0 018 g codconverted g vssinoculum d respectively it was worhtnoting that the derived minimum threshold of inoculum concentration was from the inoculum and substrate in the specific case of this study and it is recommended bsp assay applications for various kinds of organics should be conducted with several concentration levels of inoculum in parallel like that of required in the bmp assay protocol to avoid the underestimation angelidaki et al 2009 to determine the reasonable isrs in the following bsp assays an inoculum concentration range of 0 96 3 45 g vss l was adopted 3 2 biodegradation performance of was under different isrs 3 2 1 bsp assays under common isr range from 0 5 to 4 0 to investigate the applicable isr range in the bsp assay isrs in the range of 0 5 4 0 batch tests b1 b6 which are commonly studied values in conventional bmp assays were evaluated in the bsp assay fig 2 a depicts the changes in the sulfide generation for reaching the steady state of bsp1 in which no clear lag phase and deviations in test duration fig 2b were observed under all of the isr conditions the percentages of sulfide produced from the blank series of tests b1 b6 is revealed in fig 2b all of the values were less than 20 for batch tests b1 b5 whereas the value reached 45 for batch test b6 moreover the results of the ssa and biodegradability extent for batch tests b1 b6 are illustrated in fig 2c the ssa values presented an inverse proportional trend with the increased isrs in batch tests b1 b6 in which the trendline equation of y 0 0514x 1 07 r 2 0 97 could be obtained for the values that originated from batch tests b1 b5 thereby indicating that an inoculum deficiency did not occur under those isr conditions however the ssa value was lower than 0 018 g codconverted g vssinoculum d under batch test b6 which was the marginal value for the guaranteed inoculum activity although the biodegradability extents under scenarios b1 b6 fig 2c were in the range of 27 40 29 00 28 07 0 77 on average for isrs of 0 5 3 0 they sharply decreased to 21 00 when the isr further increased to 4 0 which was 24 35 lower than the average value of b1 b5 the optimal isr that achieved the maximum organics biodegradation extent was found to be 2 15 from the quadratic equation y 0 0237x 2 0 1018x 0 1865 r 2 0 96 of the biodegradability extent trendline within the studied isr range 0 5 4 0 these values of biodegradability extent for the was substrate were consistent with those in previous publications 13 to 33 wang et al 2013 yun et al 2015 wei et al 2018 mahdy et al 2015 zahedi et al 2017 which are generally considered to be lower than those of primary sludge owing to the high content of recalcitrant and non biodegradable substances lafitte trouqué and forster 2002 the underestimation of the biodegradability extent under batch test b6 isr 4 0 can be attributed to the low microbial activity that was revealed by the ssa fig 2 cossu and raga 2008 ponsá et al 2008 scaglia et al 2010 c furthermore there is evidence that biomass cannot induce hydrolytic enzymes properly under a low substrate load lim and fox 2013 moreover the amplified sulfide production approximately 45 from the blank series at an isr of 4 0 can also affect the reliability of the bsp results the ph values under different isr scenarios batch tests b1 b6 remained approximately neutral within the range of 7 3 7 6 fig 2d and no ph imbalance was observed even at the lowest isr of 0 5 which sustained the highest substrate load thereby showing the sufficient buffering capacity of the bsp assay under low isr conditions specifically the sulfide alkalinity contributed approximately 653 mg caco3 l at an isr of 0 5 compared with the 475 351 300 and 207 mg caco3 l with increasing isrs of 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 3 0 respectively and 110 mg caco3 l at an isr of 4 0 in the conventional bmp assay for sewage sludge co digestion treatment the alkalinities under these anaerobic biodegradation environments were approximately 2000 3000 mg caco3 l nakakihara et al 2014 rao and baral 2011 moretto et al 2020 bolzonella et al 2006 thus under isr condition of 0 5 the sulfide alkalinity accounted for nearly one third to one quarter of the total alkalinity in the sulfidogenesis system which greatly contributed to the increased buffering capacity and process stability in bsp assay thus similar ph values could be maintained for batch tests b1 b6 therefore based on the combined indications by the ssa and biodegradability extent the isr range of 0 5 3 0 was confirmed to be applicable in the bsp assay 3 2 2 bsp assays under extreme isr conditions low to 0 1 as demonstrated in section 3 2 1 the bioprocess of the bsp assay remained stable and effective for biodegradation assessments with an isr as low as 0 5 in view of the increased sulfide alkalinity with a lower isr that might enable an enlarged ph buffering ability in the bsp process extremely low isrs of 0 1 0 5 batch tests c1 c4 were further investigated to explore their feasibility in the bsp assay the effects on biodegradability characterization and further result validation isrs of 1 0 2 0 batch tests c5 c7 therefore the was substrate biodegradation characteristics from different isr scenarios of 0 1 2 0 batch tests c1 c7 were investigated and the results are illustrated in fig 3 first for the bsp system stability under extremely low isrs the ph values under all of the scenarios and digestion times remained between 6 8 and 7 8 fig 3a which were favorable for the metabolism of anaerobic microorganisms thereby demonstrating the ph stability of the bsp bioprocess under extreme isr conditions batch tests c1 c4 the system stability under those extreme isrs batch tests c1 c4 can be attributed to the sulfide alkalinity which was 1 9 3 8 times higher than that under an isr of 1 0 batch test c5 and contributed to the additional strong buffering ability of the bsp process as well as the bicarbonate alkalinity meanwhile the lowest ph values were observed under c6 and c7 conditions resulted from the lowest sulfide production fig 3b under those conditions to enhance the maintenance of system buffering ability as sulfide alkalinity in terms of the substrate biodegradation performance the net sulfide production required a similar duration to approach bsp1 under all of the stable bsp assay scenarios from isrs of 0 1 to 2 0 fig 3b furthermore the substrate solubilization performances were compared and analyzed as illustrated in fig 3c a higher release amount and rate of biodegradable organics was revealed under lower isr conditions within the studied isrs batch tests c1 c7 the higher release rate of more scod at extreme isrs batch tests c1 c4 implied that more cells were decomposed from particulate substrates that consistent with the higher organics concentration added initially and ascribed to the key enzymes relevant to hydrolysis and acidogenesis meanwhile the cod solubilization ratios scod tcod showed that comparable values of 18 3 20 2 were achieved under all of the experimental conditions thereby indicating that the hydrolytic activity of was was not adversely influenced under the extreme isr conditions batch tests c1 c4 fig 3d exhibits the biodegradation extent and ssa results of all of the scenarios batch tests c1 c7 a slightly higher biodegradation extent a comparable value range of 14 65 16 14 was found under extreme isrs of 0 1 0 5 batch tests c1 c4 compared with that of 14 44 under an isr of 2 0 batch test c7 which was the optimum isr within the common isr range of 0 5 4 0 regarding the biodegradability extent section 3 2 1 this implied that under extremely low isrs from 0 1 to 0 5 batch tests c1 c4 the efficacy and robustness of the bsp assay in biodegradation characterization were maintained the ssa results were all higher than the marginal value of 0 018 g codconverted g vssinoculum d for the guaranteed inoculum activity and strongly correlated with the isr trends under the conditions of batch tests c1 c7 thereby implying that the microbial activity was not affected under extreme isr conditions of 0 1 0 5 batch tests c1 c4 it was concluded that the biodegradability extent and ssa were not influenced in the bsp assays under extremely low isrs from 0 1 to 0 5 therefore it was confirmed that the applicable range of isrs for the bsp assay can be extended to 0 1 3 0 3 3 mechanism of the isr role in biodegradability characterization of was to further investigate the underlying reasons for the difference in substrate biodegradation extent under different isr environments the residual organic matter characterized as eps after the bsp assay under different isrs i e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 4 0 6 0 was explored details in si eps are the main constituent of sludge cells and are composed of molecules from cell lysis polymers bond to active and inert biomass or adsorbed attached matter nielsen et al 1997 hsieh et al 1994 in the anaerobic treatment process eps of sludge cells are normally exogenously disintegrated by hydrolytic enzymes and released as small molecules to be further utilized by microorganisms comte et al 2006 bura et al 1998 sheng et al 2010 the two structural types of eps lb eps and tb eps and their major chemical composition pn ps and hs were characterized accordingly figure 4 a shows the concentration variations in residual lb eps and tb eps under different isrs in the bsp assay the lb eps quantities showed a decreasing trend from 20 3 25 8 mg toc g vss under an isr of 0 1 0 5 to 14 3 19 0 mg toc g vss with higher isrs meanwhile the tb eps quantities were appropriately 27 31 6 mg toc g vss under the isr range of 0 1 3 0 and increased to 37 3 mg toc g vss and 42 8 mg toc g vss at an isr of 4 0 and 6 0 the lb eps tb eps ratio showed a decreasing trend from 0 71 0 83 at an isr of 0 1 0 5 to 0 51 0 58 at an isr of 1 0 3 0 and further decreased to 0 48 and 0 44 under isr of 4 0 and 6 0 respectively moreover the major components i e pn ps and hs from both lb eps and tb eps were quantified and are shown in fig 4b and 4c among the three types of organic matter hs pn and ps substantially higher proportions of hs were found in both lb eps and tb eps accounting for 79 95 and 75 87 respectively thereby suggesting that hs was the major component of the residual organics in the was after sulfidogenic degradation in bsp assay it was reported that hs contains refractory phenolic hydroxyl groups alcoholic hydroxyl groups and alkane structure they are also difficult to biodegrade in methanogenesis system liu et al 2019 li et al 2019a similar to the conclusion from section 3 2 that the biodegradability extent was underestimated with isr 4 0 the assessed biodegradability extent in this part was observed as undervalued under both isr 4 0 and 6 0 conditions fig 4d meanwhile the underestimated biodegradability extent under isr scenarios of 4 0 and 6 0 were correlated with low lb eps tb eps ratios 1 21 1 48 times lower than isrs of 0 1 3 0 eps provide colloidal stability to sludge flocs and are closely related to the sludge structural integrity liu and fang 2003 gianico et al 2013 the lower lb eps tb eps ratio indicated that a more compact residual substrate structure was maintained after the bsp process and less soluble substances were released which could have resulted from the lower efficiency of hydrolytic enzymatic activities to investigate this the sulfidogenic biodegradation process in the bsp assay was simulated by the two substrate first order hydrolysis model which segregates the substrate into readily biodegradable and slowly biodegradable organics rao et al 2000 wang et al 2013 table 3 under an isr of 4 0 and 6 0 lower biodegradation rate were observed in the slowly biodegradable organics fraction than that under other isr conditions from 0 1 to 3 0 meanwhile the higher quantities of tb eps and hs under an isr of 4 0 and 6 0 proved that more organic matter in the substrate was not fully hydrolyzed and consumed fig 2c these results verified that the hydrolysis process under an isr of 4 0 in the common isr ranges was adversely influenced thereby demonstrating the negative effect of improper isrs on hydrolysis and the anaerobic biodegradability characterization of the bsp assay thus it was deduced that the underestimated organics biodegradability in the bsp assay under a high isr of 4 0 within the common isrs was correlated with the hindered hydrolysis process resulting from the improper isr the strong correlation between the isr and the hydrolysis process was proved the possible mechanism of the relationship between the isr hydrolysis process and biodegradability characterization results in the bsp assays is shown in fig 5 the eps characteristics under extreme isrs below 0 5 were also analyzed because of the strong tolerance of the bsp assay under extreme isrs for biodegradability characterization under the extreme isrs of 0 1 0 3 the lb eps tb eps ratios were 1 48 1 73 times higher than those under an isr of 4 0 thereby indicating a less compact substrate structure and a more thorough hydrolysis process therefore it was hypothesized that under the isrs of 0 1 0 3 the high cell lysis efficiency enabled substrate depolymerization by the extracellular enzymes secreted from the biomass and thus promoted the release of intracellular materials the cod release performance fig 3c supported this hypothesis furthermore among the determined available isr range from 0 1 to 3 0 higher amounts of hs were observed in lb eps under isrs 0 1 0 3 350 378 mg g vss compared with that of under isrs of 0 5 1 5 286 296 mg g vss and isrs of 2 0 3 0 333 340 mg g vss it was reported that hs have an inhibitory effect on the anaerobic methanogenic biodegradation performance of organics li et al 2019b whereas no influence of hs on the biodegradation performance was observed under an isr of 0 1 0 3 in the bsp assay in this study the threshold concentration of hs and the mechanism of their influence on the bsp results and organic matter structures require further comprehensive investigation 3 4 evaluation of kinetic models in the bsp assay analysis of the kinetics is crucial in studying the anaerobic biodegradation rate as the kinetics is not only connected to many design and operational parameters but also enables the prediction of bioprocess performance in different operating scenarios raposo et al 2011 to determine the most suitable kinetic model for elucidating the biodegradation process in the bsp assay five commonly used kinetic models eqs 1 to 5 were evaluated using the results of the bsp assay with different applicable isrs 0 1 3 0 in which the influence of the isr values on the biodegradation kinetics was also investigated the simulation results of the fitted curves with experimental data under various isrs are shown in fig s3 in the supplementary information si the estimated biodegradation rate k varied with changes in the isr fig 6 a which was in agreement with previous reports that the hydrolysis rate is not a universal constant miron et al 2000 the biodegradation rates from all of the models showed the higher values with isrs of 0 5 2 0 among the isrs of 0 1 3 0 thereby implying the practical feasibility of a reduced retention time and smaller reactor application under those conditions furthermore the estimated biodegradability potentials from the five models were less sensitive to the isr than the biodegradation kinetics in the bsp assay fig 6b a comparison of the simulated ultimate biodegradability potential and the experimental data from the bsp assay is shown in fig 6c high pearson s correlation coefficients rp 0 972 0 981 under all of the isrs suggested a reasonably adequate agreement between the actual and simulated biodegradability extent values the estimated kinetic parameters and indicators r 2 rmse and aicc for accuracy and reliability evaluation of the studied models are presented in table 4 the average highest r 2 0 97 0 03 lowest rmse 20 03 12 44 and lowest aicc 50 09 8 49 were observed in the cone model thereby indicating that it best fits the actual evolution of sulfide production in the bsp assay among the studied models this suggested that the cone model had the minimum deviation for predicting and analyzing the bsp results with the was used in this study followed by the exponential model conversely the average overall lowest r 2 0 94 0 03 highest rmse 31 54 11 08 and highest aicc 61 63 8 13 were observed in the modified gompertz model this implied that the modified gompertz model was not as good as the cone model to simulate the sulfidogenesis biodegradation process in the bsp assay with sufficient accuracy although it has been the most commonly used kinetic model for the methanogenesis process simulation in bmp assays additionally the λ values estimated from the transference model and the gompertz model table 4 were either very small or negative under the varied isrs thereby implying that the analysis of λ in the bsp assay can be omitted to reduce the number of parameters in the computation this further indicated that it was less important to use the transference model and the modified gompertz model in bsp applications therefore the cone model was recommended as the most suitable model for biodegradation kinetics analysis in the bsp assay and the exponential model was ranked second finally a sufficient sampling frequency is required during the bsp assay for kinetics analysis to avoid a reduced statistical robustness and increased uncertainty 3 5 limitation and perspectives from the stoichiometry point of view the steady state bmp and bsp models that were built on mass and electron balances of the methanogenic and sulfidogenic degradation pathways were shown as eq s1 and eq s2 in the si both pathways were based on the assumptions 1 complete methhanogenesis and sulfidogenesis occur in both processes 2 without considering the inoculum influence in both bmp and bsp processes 3 methanogenesis was not present in the sulfidogenesis process and no sulfidogenesis occurred in the methanogenic process from the steady state bmp and bsp models with the assumptions abovementioned it can be calculated by simplification that identical amount of organics a 2 b 8 c 4 3 d 8 5 e 8 64 g cod can be biodegraded from 1 mole of substrate c a h b o c n d p e from the bmp and bsp assays respectively in case of the influence from inoculum was not included however as different inoculum and metabolism pathways were contained in the bsp and bmp assays different biodegradability extent could have occurred considering the inoculum influence which has been compared and validated in our previous study chen et al 2018 in our future study correlation coefficients between bmp values bsp values based on the databased of various organic substrates and different inoculum types could be derived comparably to the correlation coefficients between bmp values and aerobic respiration indexes ponsá et al 2008 cossu and raga 2008 scaglia et al 2010 meanwhile the amount of sulfate chemical dosage could also be a critical factor for bsp assay since the cod sulfate ratio regulates the inoculum activity and therefore affect the biodegradability assessment results besides it is worth noting that the optimized bsp assay is provided as a rapid approach for assessing the anaerobic biodegradability of organic substrates instead of replacing other assays furthermore the assessed biodegradability extent from the bsp assay could achieve the highest resemblance to the biodegradability extent from the conventional bmp results when compared to aerobic respiration methods and physical chemical alternatives e g chemical and elemental analyses uv vis spectroscopic mid infrared spectroscopic near infrared spectroscopic and etc in addition the sulfate chemical is readily available and the inoculum srb cultures cultivation is easily to be operated hence the necessity for bsp assay from those two aspects could be overcome and would not be the critical limiting factors for the implementation of bsp assay moreover shorter experimental durations enhanced measurement accuracy and wider ranges of isr with less inoculum amount provide advantages of bsp assay as a rapid assessment of the anaerobic biodegradability for organic waste the bsp assay additionally contributes to process understanding and risk assessments of broader anaerobic biotechnologies for instance estimation of the optimum ratios between co substrates prediction of the influence of unknown inhibitors on ad efficiency and feasibility studies of pre treatment strategies on digester stability and efficacy 4 conclusions this study provides a detailed examination of the previously unascertained bsp operational conditions for a fast and accurate anaerobic biodegradability assessment of organics including the inoculum concentration and isr and the selection of the most suitable kinetic model for biodegradation kinetics analysis the main conclusions are summarized as follows a minimum threshold of an inoculum concentration of 0 96 g l was verified for the guaranteed activity in the bsp assay and an ssa value of less than 0 018 g codconverted g vssinoculum d was found to adversely affect the biodegradability extent with was and inoculum used in our study the isr had a significant influence on the bsp assay results especially when the isr was higher than 3 0 the utility and superiority of the bsp assay under extreme isrs from 0 1 to 0 5 were highlighted an applicable isr range of 0 1 to 3 0 was confirmed for bsp assay implementation in assessing the organics biodegradability the underlying relationship between the isr and hydrolysis process in the bsp assay was revealed by the eps characteristics of the residual organics and further verified through a two substrate hydrolysis kinetic model the underestimated was biodegradability under an isr of 4 0 was mainly attributed to the hindered hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable organics the statistical analysis showed that the cone model is the most appropriate kinetic model for bsp assay application declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the authors greatly acknowledge dr tsui to

16911,in low strength ammonium wastewater lsaww treatment the application of anammox based process is still limited due to extreme instability and the poor nitrogen removal rate nrr in this work granule sludge comprised of functional microbes and hydroxyapatite hap was inoculated and cultivated in a one stage partial nitritation anammox pna reactor for lsaww treatment the results showed that at the hydraulic retention time hrt of about 1 0 h and the influent ammonium concentration of 63 0 mg l an average nrr of 1 28 kg m3 d was achieved which far exceeds that reported in similar studies the main inorganic matter in sludge was identified as hap through the x ray diffractometer and raman spectrum analysis the tomographic images of wet granule created through computed tomography revealed that the interior density of the granules was uneven and many hollow structures existed in the granule interior combined with the scanning electron microscope images of dry granules it was found that the granules were comprised of hollow sub granules since the biomass in the reactor increased with no obvious increase in the granule size it was inferred that the hollow sub granules had fragile connections with each other and that granules division occurred easily resulting in the high dispersity of sludge florescence in situ hybridization results also showed that the ammonium oxidizing bacteria and anammox bacteria were mainly distributed in the two sides of the sub granule shells and the hap in the middle this kind of structure raised the density of granules and improved the settleability of sludge which made it possible to achieve a high biomass in the reactor at a short hrt therefore the sludge formed in the reactor was concentrated highly dispersive and easily settleable these factors appear to be crucial for achieving the desired nitrogen removal performance this study marks a big leap in lsaww treatment through the one stage pna process and has great

successfully applied in the treatment of high strength ammonium wastewater hsaww like reject water and anaerobic fermentation effluent lackner et al 2014 however in the treatment of low strength ammonium wastewater lsaww the application of anammox based process is still limited largely due to its unstable performance and low nitrogen removal rate nrr cao et al 2017 chen et al 2019a in practice lsaww represents a considerably large share of the total influent nitrogen in a typical domestic wastewater treatment plant wwtp bilyk et al 2012 solving these problems so that the anammox based process could be widely and smoothly adopted to lsaww treatment would be a momentous breakthrough the wide use of the anammox based process in lsaww treatment would result in a considerable reduction in the energy consumption compared to that in the traditional nitrification and denitrification process widely adopted now du et al 2019 li et al 2017 when pursuing a stable and high nrr in lsaww treatment through the anammox based process the fundamental prerequisite is retaining the ample functional microbes in the reactor at short hydraulic retention time hrt gao et al 2012 however as is widely known a high nrr needs a short hrt condition for this reason the washout of sludge with the effluent become a serious problem without a stable ample biomass in reactor a high nrr performance is not sustainable it is necessary to determine a way to maintain a sufficient biomass in reactor at short hrt condition gao et al 2014 a number of strategies have been adopted to achieve effective biomass retention including cultivating the granule sludge chen et al 2019a or biofilm sludge liu et al 2017 in the reactor adopting the membrane reactor huang et al 2016 and the sequencing batch sbr reactor connan et al 2018 despite the relative successes these efforts have also included drawbacks like difficulties in biofilm culturing time consuming granular formation membrane fouling and complex operation conditions cao et al 2017 chen et al 2019a ding et al 2018 besides neither the thick biofilm nor the large granules is ideal for substance transfer at a short hrt zhu et al 2018 in addition the formation of the dead zones inside the large granules would also result in sludge floatation and losses chen et al 2010 even though it is possible to adopt the sludge return strategy the poor settling property of the granules still requires a post settling installation with a large volume which increases the operation cost in another way liu and tay 2004 thus to achieve a high nrr in lsaww treatment the key challenges are retaining ample biomass in the reactor effective biomass retention and high biomass dispersity for efficient substance transfer it was reported that calcium augmented aerobic granules have good settling and strength characteristics jiang et al 2003 in recent years some researchers have also proposed that the hydroxyapatite hap crystallization in sludge through calcium addition and proper ph condition is an effective way to enhance the settleability of sludge in the anammox process and the one stage partial nitritation anammox pna reactor guo and li 2020 johansson et al 2017 lin et al 2019 ma et al 2018 the method of culturing anammox granules immobilized by hap cores has also provided a useful reference for achieving excellent settleability and superior biomass attachment lin et al 2013 a high biomass with mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss of 62 1 g l in reactor has been achieved through this method zhang et al 2018 in the author s previous research on simultaneous nitrogen removal and phosphorus p recovery through one stage pna and hap crystallization process from hsaww the microbes and hap combining granules cultured in reactor were characterized with that the granules were tiny settleability was excellent and the biomass was concentrated guo and li 2020 these qualities show promise in the quest to find a way to meet the key challenges in pursuing a high nrr in lsaww treatment through anammox based process thus in this study in an airlift reactor alr inoculated and cultivated with granule sludge comprised of microbes and hap the nitrogen removal performance for lsaww treatment was investigated to gain a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to the superior reactor performance the scanning electron microscope sem and the computed tomography ct technique were adopted to determine the interior structure of granules the x ray diffusion xrd and raman spectrum analysis were also used to determine the inorganic composition of the sludge in addition the fluorescence in situ hybridization fish technique was conducted to provide details of the spatial distribution of the microbes finally the formation mechanism of granule was proposed to provide a comprehensive understanding of this novel process 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up and experimental condition the apparatus was comprised of a alr unit effective volume 5 l and an inclined plate settling tank unit effective volume 1 l as shown in fig 1 an air pump with the dispenser fixed at the bottom of the reactor was used to oxygenate and agitate the mixed liquid the airflow rate afr was controlled by a flow gauge synthetic lsaww was supplied using a peristaltic pump the settled sludge in the inclined plate unit slipped into the reaction unit through junction channel no sludge discharge was conducted artificially during the whole experiment the temperature of the reactor was controlled at 25 1 c using a heater inserted into the mixed liquid during the whole experiment the ambient temperature was below 20 c as shown in table 1 the whole experiment was divided into 5 phases with the fixed influent nitrogen loading rate nlr of 1 5 kg m3 d from phase i to phase iv and a reduced nlr of 1 0 kg m3 d at phase v during the whole experiment the dissolved oxygen do was controlled below 0 10 mg l in order to avoid the free nitrous acid inhibition on the anammox bacteria guo et al 2020a the aeration rate was regulated at regular intervals in this experiment to ensure no nitrite accumulation through frequent trial and error guo et al 2020c 2 2 synthetic lsaww and inoculum sludge the synthetic lsaww was comprised of nh4cl nahco3 cacl2 and a medium solution the initial medium solution contained the following nutrients l 1 0 081 g kh2po4 0 214 g na2hpo4 12h2o 0 051 g mgcl2 6h2o and 1 ml trace element solution as described previously guo et al 2020b the doses of nh4cl and cacl2 were carried out according to the experimental design shown in table 1 because the designed calcium concentration in phase ⅰ was high hap crystallization readily occurred in the substrate tank if it was dissolved in the tank directly therefore concentrated cacl2 solution prepared in separated tank was supplied to reactor through another peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 2 5 l d guo and li 2020 the nahco3 dosage was equal to the dosage of nh4cl the influent p concentration also varied as shown in table 1 through the dosage adjustment of kh2po4 and na2hpo4 12h2o proportionally the hrt was decreased from 6 h to 1 h from phase i to phase iv and fixed at 1 h at phase ⅴ the naoh solution was used to adjust the ph of substrate the ph in the effluent ranged between 7 8 and 8 5 the seed sludge was harvested from an alr reactor described in an earlier study guo and li 2020 the initial mixed liquor suspended solid mlss concentration was set at approximately 20 0 g l and the mlvss mlss ratio was 0 25 2 3 structure observation of the wet granule by micro ct scan the pretreatment of wet granules selected fresh granules were immobilized in a 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution dehydrated in graded water ethanol solutions then stored in 100 ethanol kobayashi et al 2012 a pipette tip was used to absorb one granule then the granule was mounted on the apex of stage of the ct instrument for analysis the mounted sample was scanned with scanxmate d160tss105 1100 comscantecno co ltd at a voltage of 90 kv and a current of 120 μa and scans were performed over 360 degrees with 1500 projections the resolution of radiographic images was 0 542 μm pixel the tomographic images were reconstructed with conctexpress v 1 76 white rabbit co ltd satria et al 2016 2 4 fish observation fish analysis was adapted to determine the distribution of functional bacteria species in the sludge granule harvested from reactor at end of phase v detailed procedures for the fish observation have been described in an earlier publication guo et al 2020b 2 5 analysis of sludge characteristics the size of the wet granules was analyzed by particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 for the analysis of the organic elements of the sludge including carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen and sulfur the sludge samples were dried at 105 c overnight and tested by elementar vario el cube for the analysis of inorganic elements including p calcium iron magnesium sodium and potassium the sludge samples were first dried at 105 c overnight and then digested by nitric acid in a microwave the digested samples were analyzed by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes system agilent 720 agilent technologies usa the sem analysis was used to observe the dry granule prior to the analysis the sampled wet granule was immobilized in a 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution dehydrated in graded water ethanol solutions then lyophilized and sputter coated with gold kobayashi et al 2012 raman spectroscopy jasco nrs 5100 532 nm laser beam and xrd olympus btx bench x ray diffraction system analysis were used to identify the inorganic matter in the sludge prior to the analysis the sludge was dried at 105 c overnight then ground to reveal the inner part 2 6 microbial community analysis the microbial community in the granules was analyzed by a high throughput sequencing technique briefly dna was extracted and purified with isoil for the beads beating kit nippon gene japan the pcr amplification of prokaryotic 16s rrna gene was performed with the forward primer 515f and reverse primer 806r caporaso et al 2012 the dna sequencing was performed using the miseq reagent kit v2 illumina usa of the miseq system miseq data was deposited into public database of national microbiology data center 2 7 chemical analysis water samples were taken from both the influent and effluent of reactor every other day at the same time corresponding meters were used for the monitoring of ph and do the samples were stored temporarily for measurement at 4 in a refrigerator after being filtered through a 0 45 μm polyether sulfone syringe filter the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n of water samples were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis agilent 7100 liu et al 2017 the mlvss and mlss were analyzed according to apha standard methods yamaguchi et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 the nitrogen removal performance the nitrogen removal performance during the whole experiment is shown in fig 2 and table 2 with the stable nlr of 1 5 kg m3 d and the influent nh4 n concentration decreased from 375 mg l to 63 mg l hrt decreased from 6 h to 1 h the average nitrogen removal efficiency nre was maintained at above 78 even at phase ⅴ with the nlr of 1 0 kg m3 d and the influent nh4 n concentration of 42 mg l a maximum nrr of 0 87 kg m3 d was achieved as shown in table 2 until now the highest nrr reported was 0 72 kg m3 d with an influent nh4 n concentration of 50 mg l chen et al 2019a as shown in table 3 in this study the nrr of 1 28 kg m3 d achieved with the nh4 n concentration of 63 0 mg l represents a new high in lsaww treatment the nrr of 0 66 kg m3 d achieved with the nh4 n concentration of 42 mg l is also desirable from fig 2d no3 n δnr δnr refers to the sum of nh4 n and no2 n removed through anammox reaction was about 0 09 0 1 during almost the entire experiment it was a little high in the last phase which is evidence that the one stage pna process was well conducted guo et al 2020c these are evidence of the excellent nitrogen removal capacity of this system from fig 2e and table 2 p removal occurred to some extent the calcium concentrations in the influent and effluent are shown in fig 2f for phase iv and phase v although excellent nitrogen removal performance was achieved effluent with several tens of milligrams of calcium per liter appeared to present a problem it has been reported that the calcium concentrations in municipal wastewater range from several tens to hundreds milligrams per liter azadiaghdam et al 2020 hafiz et al 2021 lei et al 2019 thus for the actual application of this process the cost of calcium addition into the municipal wastewater is flexible and controllable based on the actual wastewater quality and the calcium in the effluent does not seem too harsh for the environment as stated in the introduction to obtain a high nrr in the one stage pna process the crucial factors are ample biomass in reactor the effective biomass retention and high biomass dispersity thus conducting a detailed analysis of the sludge characteristics in this system was critical to explain the excellent performance of this system 3 2 the sludge characteristics as shown in fig 3 from phase ⅰ to phase ⅴ the mlvss and mlss concentration increased as the experiment proceeded a decrease in the mlvss mlss ratio was an indication that inorganic substances in sludge had accumulated during the whole experiment the mlvss concentration was higher than 5 0 g l which is higher than that reported for other similar studies chen et al 2019a hoekstra et al 2019 as shown in table 3 the concept of the specific nrr was used to understand the metabolic activity of biomass in the reactor a higher nrr mlvss ratio means higher metabolic activity of the biomass from table 3 the nrr mlvss ratio in this research is higher than that in most research indicating the high metabolic activity of biomass in this concentrated sludge environment in an early study a low sludge volume index svi of below 10 ml g was reported to have excellent settleability jiang et al 2003 the high settling velocities of sludge allow the adoption of short hrt in the reactors without the concern of biomass washout beun et al 2000 j h et al 2001 in addition during the whole experiment no obvious sludge washout in the effluent was observed and no obvious sludge accumulation was found in the clarifier which also confirmed that the sludge had excellent settleability at a short hrt of 1 0 h as shown in fig 4 during the whole experiment the sludge granules were smaller than 1000 μm in diameter with a lower mean size and median size these values represented a significant difference from the much larger sizes reported in other studies ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 with a high mlvss concentration and a low distribution range of sludge granule size it was clear that the sludge in reactor was highly dispersed as explained above the three crucial requirements were achieved the high nrr obtained in this study was attributed to these qualities thus a deep and comprehensive analysis of the sludge granule structure was then necessary to decipher the formation mechanism of the sludge granules in this study 3 3 crystallization identification and element analysis in composite granular sludge the results of the xrd and raman analysis are shown in fig 5 the xrd spectrum clearly indicated three main crystal species in the sludge furthermore from the raman spectrum an obvious peak of the phosphate group affiliated to hap was detected with some other noise at a low raman shift the noise in the raman spectrum was likely due to the existence of organic matter finally combining with the results of elemental analysis by icp oes given in table 4 it was concluded that the main inorganic matter in the sludge was hap guo and li 2020 3 4 granule structure identification 3 4 1 sem observation and the shrinkability of granules in this study both the excellent settleability of sludge and high nitrogen removal performance demonstrated that the ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox bacteria were well combined with the hap the sem was adopted to observe the structure and surface morphology of granule from fig 6 a it was obvious that the granules were not compact but rather were aggregations of sub granules the hump structures observed on the surface of one sub granule shown in fig 6b were likely to be bacteria since hap was embedded in the sludge it was considered possible that the contractibility of the sludge granules may have been weaker than ordinary sludge granules thus the contractibility of sludge granule under dehydrated alcohol was investigated a fresh granule from reactor at phase ⅴ showed a dense and stereoscopic structure before dehydration as shown in fig 6c while large humps were observed on the surface of dehydrated granule as shown in fig 6d however in the case of an ordinary sludge granule from another one stage pna reactor with an nrr of about 0 8 kg m3 d for hsaww treatment in our lab the almost transparent structure before dehydration was a flat thin membrane after dehydration as shown in fig 6e and fig 6f this was evidence that there was a support skeletal structure inside the granule as the hap almost has no contractibility under an alcohol environment it could be inferred that the hap served as the support skeletal structure of the granules this kind of structure raised the density of the granules and improved the settleability of the sludge therefore making it possible to achieve a high biomass in the reactor at a short hrt the observed structural morphology of the granule sample for xrd observation in the dry state and the granule sample for microscope observation in the wet state differed significantly however since the sub granules were block shaped in the single granule as shown in fig 6a it could be inferred that the humps were the local structures of sub granules in the granule therefore further observation of the interior of the granule in wet state was necessary to determine the actual structure of the granule 3 4 2 micro ct scan observation the micro ct is a nondestructive technique for visualizing the interior features of solid objects neues and epple 2008 it is based on the different absorption coefficients for x rays in different materials the mineralized material is much brighter than weakly mineralized or non mineralized material in the phase contrast images obtained micro ct is also a versatile tool for high contrast 3d imaging at histological resolutions for developmental biology metscher 2009 from the 3d image based on micro ct scan as shown in fig 7 a the video showing the three dimensional rotation structure is supplied in supplementary material the bright parts in the granule were deemed to be minerals and the gray parts were the main organic matter this indicates that the mass distribution of granule was uneven and the spatial distribution of discrete bright parts were consistent with that of sub granules of dry granule observed by sem considering these observations together with the results provided in section 3 4 1 it was obvious that the bright parts were the sub granules from these it was confirmed that the granule was comprised of sub granules the cross section ct images perpendicular to x axis y axis and z axis of one location in the interior of one sub granule are shown in fig 7b 7c and 7d respectively it was found that there was hollow structure in the selected sub granule this interesting phenomenon was only attributed to the accumulation of gas it was not possible that the gas came from the air since there have been no reports of microbe growth around an air bubble further in this alr reactor the attachment of air bubble to sludge was impossible due to the strong disturbance this led to the conclusion that the only possible source of the gas was microbial activity there were two possibilities anammox reaction and denitrification in the denitrification situation co2 and n2 were produced however the co2 was soluble and could be indirectly used by other autotrophic bacteria or evaporated finally and only the n2 remained however because the no3 n δnr ratio did not suggest that strong denitrification occurred in the reactor it was not possible that the denitrification pathway served as the main route of n2 production considering this the anammox reaction was the only possible reaction which could have produced the n2 in the sludge interior and created the hollow structure with continuous production the pressure of the gas in the hollow portion increased resulting in the expansion of the volume of the hollow portion also the holes on the surface of the sub granule according to the sem observation as shown in fig 6b indicated the eruption of pressured nitrogen gas in the interior as the size distribution range of granules remained stable with the increase of mlvss during the experiment as shown in fig 4 it was obvious that the big granules had divided as previously stated because the distribution range of granule size in similar research by chen et al chen et al 2019a was higher than that in this research as shown in table 2 it is not likely that the divisions were spontaneous thus it could be inferred that the connections between sub granules in granules were fragile and only under this premise could granule division occurred due to the crash among big granules caused by aeration in the alr reactor finally the sludge in the reactor became highly dispersive 3 5 fish observation the results of the fish observation shown in fig 8 a indicated that all the fluorescence patterns of probes were loop like bands which was in good accordance with the hollow structure of granules the enlarged image of one granule comprised of single sub granule as shown in fig 8b clearly showed that aob and anammox bacteria were distributed in the two sides of loop like band however in the middle of loop like band an extremely bright striola was observed since the results thus far have shown that the hap and microbes were well combined it was obvious that these bright striola indicated the location of the hap which served as the granule skeleton therefore it was concluded that both the microbes and hap constituted the shell of the sub granules and that novel microbe hap granules were cultured in this research for numerous one stage pna processes regardless of whether it was a granular type chen et al 2019a or biofilm type chen et al 2019b aob was mainly distributed on the surface of the biomass structure while the anammox bacteria in interior it has been shown that this is decided by the metabolic properties of each bacteria almstrand et al 2014 chen et al 2009 2019a pellicer nàcher et al 2014 in this study the lack of obvious stratification of aob and anammox was likely because the shell thickness of the sub granules was low it was interesting that the distributions of microbes and hap in the granules were not indented and that obvious layering had taken place the stimulation of the hap crystallization by the bio induced effect may have contributed to these attributes it has been reported in earlier anammox hap research that the activity of anammox bacteria could create a more suitable environment for hap crystallization ma et al 2018 3 6 microbial community the microbial community analysis results are shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 9a the planctomycetes affiliated bacteria were mainly from the genus kuenenia and the order phycisphaerales the former was mainly comprised of the anammox bacteria while the latter was the certain heterotrophs which utilized extracellular polysaccharides produced by the anammox bacteria as carbon source lawson et al 2017 zhao et al 2018a chloroflexi chlorobi proteobacteria acidobacteria and bacteroidetes were common microbes in the anammox based reactor bhattacharjee et al 2017 feng et al 2018 lawson et al 2017 zhao et al 2018a these microbes shared symbiotic relationships with anammox metabolism like the growth factor supply like phylum armatimonadetes affiliated bacteria and phylum proteobacteria affiliated bacteria anammox consortium aggregation like phylum chloroflexi affiliated bacteria and anammox metabolite scavenging chlorobi affiliated bacteria zhao et al 2018b it has been reported that bacteroidetes organisms can also remove p and organic matter xu et al 2018 as shown in fig 9b the microbes at genus level with the relative abundance above 0 5 are illustrated the relative abundance of main functional bacteria species are listed in table 5 four kinds of aob bacteria all came from genus nitrosomonas and nitrosococcus were detected and the dominated aob bacteria was the uncultured sp belonged to genus nitrosomonas during the whole experiment the dominant species of anammox bacteria came from the genus kuenenia with a small presence of species from the genus brocadia at phase ⅲ in this study the nitrite limited strategy was thought to be key factor for the inhibition of genus brocadia due to its low affinity to nitrite guo et al 2020c there was no nitrite oxidizing bacteria bacteria species found it was worth noting that microbes belonging to the genus dok59 increased as the experiment proceeded likely through the function of the denitrification reaction tao et al 2020 3 7 proposed formation mechanism of microbe hap granules from the above comprehensive analysis the formation mechanism of microbe hap granules in this reactor was proposed as illustrated in fig 10 first a tiny granule was activated with the accumulation of nitrogen gas as the anammox reaction proceeded with the growth of the microbes and the further increase of the gas volume the granule became larger forming a hollow structure finally due to the high pressure as the nitrogen gas accumulated small holes emerged through which the gas erupted meanwhile in the fractured shell microbes continuously grew and nitrogen gas accumulation occurred again with the growth of these microbes many sub granules with the same hollow structure formed at the thicker locations of the shells meanwhile the anammox bacteria created the local high ph environment which was helpful for hap crystallization enabling hap accumulation to occur in the middle of the sub granule shells in this way after several rounds of growth a large granule formed with fragile connections due to its large size this granule tended to crash into other similar granules with the division of large granules numerous sub granules were released becoming independent smaller granules in the continuous long term operation of the reactor these smaller granules experienced the same growth process repeatedly as the cycle repeated sludge with high dispersity was cultured in the reactor 3 8 enlightenment from this study after careful consideration of the factors contributing to the achievements in this research it was considered a problem that the initial microbe hap granule sludge was inoculated from hsaww treatment reactor the initial formation of the microbe hap granules did not occur in this experiment this raises the issue of access to a mass of microbe hap granules for inoculation in actual applications it stands to reason that the initial formation of microbe hap granule is difficult since the lsaww has a low influent p concentration for hap crystallization to occur to improve the saturation index of hap it is necessary to add a mass of calcium to the reactor which is not considered economical and will inevitably be associated with other problems in actual operation in such situations the cultivation of microbe hap sludge granule in a separate reactor with hsaww is a prerequisite for wwtps the sidestream is the optimal solution to this problem since the well formed microbe hap granules in a one stage pna process for sidestream treatment could be transferred to the one stage pna reactor for lsaww treatment in the worst case situation microbe hap granules with lower settleability due to an error in operation in a one stage pna reactor for lsaww treatment could be returned to hsaww installations to improve settleability with this circulation the long term and stable supply of well formed microbe hap granules to lsaww installation is possible in this study from the p removal performance shown in fig 2e and because the main inorganic matter in the sludge was hap it was obvious that the hap crystallization still occurred at the low influent calcium condition this indicated the concentrated highly dispersive and easily settleable microbe hap granule sludge was cultivated during the whole experiment and the long term stable operation of this system was possible municipal wastewater treatment is an energy intensive industry the transport and treatment of municipal wastewater imposes a significant energy demand consuming 3 of the electrical energy supply in the us and the values for other countries are 3 5 q h zhang et al 2016 the one stage pna process has a saving on the oxygen supply by 60 for the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and there is no demand for organic carbon for denitrification in addition sludge production is reduced by 80 in the one stage pna process chen et al 2021 for the raw municipal wastewater after cod removal by the pretreatment the application of this process has huge potential to significantly reduce energy consumption and to contribute to the sustainable development of society 4 conclusion in this study an efficient solution was proposed to achieve the excellent nrr of one stage pna process for lsaww treatment granules comprised of microbes and hap realized desirable sludge settleability high biomass concentration and effective substance transfer in reactor at short hrt which were the critical factors microbial activity and hap crystallization created a unique granule structure through a special formation mechanism this study presents an innovative approach to lsaww treatment and provides a useful reference for the realization of the wide application of the one stage pna process in the future

16911,in low strength ammonium wastewater lsaww treatment the application of anammox based process is still limited due to extreme instability and the poor nitrogen removal rate nrr in this work granule sludge comprised of functional microbes and hydroxyapatite hap was inoculated and cultivated in a one stage partial nitritation anammox pna reactor for lsaww treatment the results showed that at the hydraulic retention time hrt of about 1 0 h and the influent ammonium concentration of 63 0 mg l an average nrr of 1 28 kg m3 d was achieved which far exceeds that reported in similar studies the main inorganic matter in sludge was identified as hap through the x ray diffractometer and raman spectrum analysis the tomographic images of wet granule created through computed tomography revealed that the interior density of the granules was uneven and many hollow structures existed in the granule interior combined with the scanning electron microscope images of dry granules it was found that the granules were comprised of hollow sub granules since the biomass in the reactor increased with no obvious increase in the granule size it was inferred that the hollow sub granules had fragile connections with each other and that granules division occurred easily resulting in the high dispersity of sludge florescence in situ hybridization results also showed that the ammonium oxidizing bacteria and anammox bacteria were mainly distributed in the two sides of the sub granule shells and the hap in the middle this kind of structure raised the density of granules and improved the settleability of sludge which made it possible to achieve a high biomass in the reactor at a short hrt therefore the sludge formed in the reactor was concentrated highly dispersive and easily settleable these factors appear to be crucial for achieving the desired nitrogen removal performance this study marks a big leap in lsaww treatment through the one stage pna process and has great

successfully applied in the treatment of high strength ammonium wastewater hsaww like reject water and anaerobic fermentation effluent lackner et al 2014 however in the treatment of low strength ammonium wastewater lsaww the application of anammox based process is still limited largely due to its unstable performance and low nitrogen removal rate nrr cao et al 2017 chen et al 2019a in practice lsaww represents a considerably large share of the total influent nitrogen in a typical domestic wastewater treatment plant wwtp bilyk et al 2012 solving these problems so that the anammox based process could be widely and smoothly adopted to lsaww treatment would be a momentous breakthrough the wide use of the anammox based process in lsaww treatment would result in a considerable reduction in the energy consumption compared to that in the traditional nitrification and denitrification process widely adopted now du et al 2019 li et al 2017 when pursuing a stable and high nrr in lsaww treatment through the anammox based process the fundamental prerequisite is retaining the ample functional microbes in the reactor at short hydraulic retention time hrt gao et al 2012 however as is widely known a high nrr needs a short hrt condition for this reason the washout of sludge with the effluent become a serious problem without a stable ample biomass in reactor a high nrr performance is not sustainable it is necessary to determine a way to maintain a sufficient biomass in reactor at short hrt condition gao et al 2014 a number of strategies have been adopted to achieve effective biomass retention including cultivating the granule sludge chen et al 2019a or biofilm sludge liu et al 2017 in the reactor adopting the membrane reactor huang et al 2016 and the sequencing batch sbr reactor connan et al 2018 despite the relative successes these efforts have also included drawbacks like difficulties in biofilm culturing time consuming granular formation membrane fouling and complex operation conditions cao et al 2017 chen et al 2019a ding et al 2018 besides neither the thick biofilm nor the large granules is ideal for substance transfer at a short hrt zhu et al 2018 in addition the formation of the dead zones inside the large granules would also result in sludge floatation and losses chen et al 2010 even though it is possible to adopt the sludge return strategy the poor settling property of the granules still requires a post settling installation with a large volume which increases the operation cost in another way liu and tay 2004 thus to achieve a high nrr in lsaww treatment the key challenges are retaining ample biomass in the reactor effective biomass retention and high biomass dispersity for efficient substance transfer it was reported that calcium augmented aerobic granules have good settling and strength characteristics jiang et al 2003 in recent years some researchers have also proposed that the hydroxyapatite hap crystallization in sludge through calcium addition and proper ph condition is an effective way to enhance the settleability of sludge in the anammox process and the one stage partial nitritation anammox pna reactor guo and li 2020 johansson et al 2017 lin et al 2019 ma et al 2018 the method of culturing anammox granules immobilized by hap cores has also provided a useful reference for achieving excellent settleability and superior biomass attachment lin et al 2013 a high biomass with mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss of 62 1 g l in reactor has been achieved through this method zhang et al 2018 in the author s previous research on simultaneous nitrogen removal and phosphorus p recovery through one stage pna and hap crystallization process from hsaww the microbes and hap combining granules cultured in reactor were characterized with that the granules were tiny settleability was excellent and the biomass was concentrated guo and li 2020 these qualities show promise in the quest to find a way to meet the key challenges in pursuing a high nrr in lsaww treatment through anammox based process thus in this study in an airlift reactor alr inoculated and cultivated with granule sludge comprised of microbes and hap the nitrogen removal performance for lsaww treatment was investigated to gain a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to the superior reactor performance the scanning electron microscope sem and the computed tomography ct technique were adopted to determine the interior structure of granules the x ray diffusion xrd and raman spectrum analysis were also used to determine the inorganic composition of the sludge in addition the fluorescence in situ hybridization fish technique was conducted to provide details of the spatial distribution of the microbes finally the formation mechanism of granule was proposed to provide a comprehensive understanding of this novel process 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up and experimental condition the apparatus was comprised of a alr unit effective volume 5 l and an inclined plate settling tank unit effective volume 1 l as shown in fig 1 an air pump with the dispenser fixed at the bottom of the reactor was used to oxygenate and agitate the mixed liquid the airflow rate afr was controlled by a flow gauge synthetic lsaww was supplied using a peristaltic pump the settled sludge in the inclined plate unit slipped into the reaction unit through junction channel no sludge discharge was conducted artificially during the whole experiment the temperature of the reactor was controlled at 25 1 c using a heater inserted into the mixed liquid during the whole experiment the ambient temperature was below 20 c as shown in table 1 the whole experiment was divided into 5 phases with the fixed influent nitrogen loading rate nlr of 1 5 kg m3 d from phase i to phase iv and a reduced nlr of 1 0 kg m3 d at phase v during the whole experiment the dissolved oxygen do was controlled below 0 10 mg l in order to avoid the free nitrous acid inhibition on the anammox bacteria guo et al 2020a the aeration rate was regulated at regular intervals in this experiment to ensure no nitrite accumulation through frequent trial and error guo et al 2020c 2 2 synthetic lsaww and inoculum sludge the synthetic lsaww was comprised of nh4cl nahco3 cacl2 and a medium solution the initial medium solution contained the following nutrients l 1 0 081 g kh2po4 0 214 g na2hpo4 12h2o 0 051 g mgcl2 6h2o and 1 ml trace element solution as described previously guo et al 2020b the doses of nh4cl and cacl2 were carried out according to the experimental design shown in table 1 because the designed calcium concentration in phase ⅰ was high hap crystallization readily occurred in the substrate tank if it was dissolved in the tank directly therefore concentrated cacl2 solution prepared in separated tank was supplied to reactor through another peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 2 5 l d guo and li 2020 the nahco3 dosage was equal to the dosage of nh4cl the influent p concentration also varied as shown in table 1 through the dosage adjustment of kh2po4 and na2hpo4 12h2o proportionally the hrt was decreased from 6 h to 1 h from phase i to phase iv and fixed at 1 h at phase ⅴ the naoh solution was used to adjust the ph of substrate the ph in the effluent ranged between 7 8 and 8 5 the seed sludge was harvested from an alr reactor described in an earlier study guo and li 2020 the initial mixed liquor suspended solid mlss concentration was set at approximately 20 0 g l and the mlvss mlss ratio was 0 25 2 3 structure observation of the wet granule by micro ct scan the pretreatment of wet granules selected fresh granules were immobilized in a 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution dehydrated in graded water ethanol solutions then stored in 100 ethanol kobayashi et al 2012 a pipette tip was used to absorb one granule then the granule was mounted on the apex of stage of the ct instrument for analysis the mounted sample was scanned with scanxmate d160tss105 1100 comscantecno co ltd at a voltage of 90 kv and a current of 120 μa and scans were performed over 360 degrees with 1500 projections the resolution of radiographic images was 0 542 μm pixel the tomographic images were reconstructed with conctexpress v 1 76 white rabbit co ltd satria et al 2016 2 4 fish observation fish analysis was adapted to determine the distribution of functional bacteria species in the sludge granule harvested from reactor at end of phase v detailed procedures for the fish observation have been described in an earlier publication guo et al 2020b 2 5 analysis of sludge characteristics the size of the wet granules was analyzed by particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 for the analysis of the organic elements of the sludge including carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen and sulfur the sludge samples were dried at 105 c overnight and tested by elementar vario el cube for the analysis of inorganic elements including p calcium iron magnesium sodium and potassium the sludge samples were first dried at 105 c overnight and then digested by nitric acid in a microwave the digested samples were analyzed by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes system agilent 720 agilent technologies usa the sem analysis was used to observe the dry granule prior to the analysis the sampled wet granule was immobilized in a 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution dehydrated in graded water ethanol solutions then lyophilized and sputter coated with gold kobayashi et al 2012 raman spectroscopy jasco nrs 5100 532 nm laser beam and xrd olympus btx bench x ray diffraction system analysis were used to identify the inorganic matter in the sludge prior to the analysis the sludge was dried at 105 c overnight then ground to reveal the inner part 2 6 microbial community analysis the microbial community in the granules was analyzed by a high throughput sequencing technique briefly dna was extracted and purified with isoil for the beads beating kit nippon gene japan the pcr amplification of prokaryotic 16s rrna gene was performed with the forward primer 515f and reverse primer 806r caporaso et al 2012 the dna sequencing was performed using the miseq reagent kit v2 illumina usa of the miseq system miseq data was deposited into public database of national microbiology data center 2 7 chemical analysis water samples were taken from both the influent and effluent of reactor every other day at the same time corresponding meters were used for the monitoring of ph and do the samples were stored temporarily for measurement at 4 in a refrigerator after being filtered through a 0 45 μm polyether sulfone syringe filter the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n of water samples were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis agilent 7100 liu et al 2017 the mlvss and mlss were analyzed according to apha standard methods yamaguchi et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 the nitrogen removal performance the nitrogen removal performance during the whole experiment is shown in fig 2 and table 2 with the stable nlr of 1 5 kg m3 d and the influent nh4 n concentration decreased from 375 mg l to 63 mg l hrt decreased from 6 h to 1 h the average nitrogen removal efficiency nre was maintained at above 78 even at phase ⅴ with the nlr of 1 0 kg m3 d and the influent nh4 n concentration of 42 mg l a maximum nrr of 0 87 kg m3 d was achieved as shown in table 2 until now the highest nrr reported was 0 72 kg m3 d with an influent nh4 n concentration of 50 mg l chen et al 2019a as shown in table 3 in this study the nrr of 1 28 kg m3 d achieved with the nh4 n concentration of 63 0 mg l represents a new high in lsaww treatment the nrr of 0 66 kg m3 d achieved with the nh4 n concentration of 42 mg l is also desirable from fig 2d no3 n δnr δnr refers to the sum of nh4 n and no2 n removed through anammox reaction was about 0 09 0 1 during almost the entire experiment it was a little high in the last phase which is evidence that the one stage pna process was well conducted guo et al 2020c these are evidence of the excellent nitrogen removal capacity of this system from fig 2e and table 2 p removal occurred to some extent the calcium concentrations in the influent and effluent are shown in fig 2f for phase iv and phase v although excellent nitrogen removal performance was achieved effluent with several tens of milligrams of calcium per liter appeared to present a problem it has been reported that the calcium concentrations in municipal wastewater range from several tens to hundreds milligrams per liter azadiaghdam et al 2020 hafiz et al 2021 lei et al 2019 thus for the actual application of this process the cost of calcium addition into the municipal wastewater is flexible and controllable based on the actual wastewater quality and the calcium in the effluent does not seem too harsh for the environment as stated in the introduction to obtain a high nrr in the one stage pna process the crucial factors are ample biomass in reactor the effective biomass retention and high biomass dispersity thus conducting a detailed analysis of the sludge characteristics in this system was critical to explain the excellent performance of this system 3 2 the sludge characteristics as shown in fig 3 from phase ⅰ to phase ⅴ the mlvss and mlss concentration increased as the experiment proceeded a decrease in the mlvss mlss ratio was an indication that inorganic substances in sludge had accumulated during the whole experiment the mlvss concentration was higher than 5 0 g l which is higher than that reported for other similar studies chen et al 2019a hoekstra et al 2019 as shown in table 3 the concept of the specific nrr was used to understand the metabolic activity of biomass in the reactor a higher nrr mlvss ratio means higher metabolic activity of the biomass from table 3 the nrr mlvss ratio in this research is higher than that in most research indicating the high metabolic activity of biomass in this concentrated sludge environment in an early study a low sludge volume index svi of below 10 ml g was reported to have excellent settleability jiang et al 2003 the high settling velocities of sludge allow the adoption of short hrt in the reactors without the concern of biomass washout beun et al 2000 j h et al 2001 in addition during the whole experiment no obvious sludge washout in the effluent was observed and no obvious sludge accumulation was found in the clarifier which also confirmed that the sludge had excellent settleability at a short hrt of 1 0 h as shown in fig 4 during the whole experiment the sludge granules were smaller than 1000 μm in diameter with a lower mean size and median size these values represented a significant difference from the much larger sizes reported in other studies ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 with a high mlvss concentration and a low distribution range of sludge granule size it was clear that the sludge in reactor was highly dispersed as explained above the three crucial requirements were achieved the high nrr obtained in this study was attributed to these qualities thus a deep and comprehensive analysis of the sludge granule structure was then necessary to decipher the formation mechanism of the sludge granules in this study 3 3 crystallization identification and element analysis in composite granular sludge the results of the xrd and raman analysis are shown in fig 5 the xrd spectrum clearly indicated three main crystal species in the sludge furthermore from the raman spectrum an obvious peak of the phosphate group affiliated to hap was detected with some other noise at a low raman shift the noise in the raman spectrum was likely due to the existence of organic matter finally combining with the results of elemental analysis by icp oes given in table 4 it was concluded that the main inorganic matter in the sludge was hap guo and li 2020 3 4 granule structure identification 3 4 1 sem observation and the shrinkability of granules in this study both the excellent settleability of sludge and high nitrogen removal performance demonstrated that the ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox bacteria were well combined with the hap the sem was adopted to observe the structure and surface morphology of granule from fig 6 a it was obvious that the granules were not compact but rather were aggregations of sub granules the hump structures observed on the surface of one sub granule shown in fig 6b were likely to be bacteria since hap was embedded in the sludge it was considered possible that the contractibility of the sludge granules may have been weaker than ordinary sludge granules thus the contractibility of sludge granule under dehydrated alcohol was investigated a fresh granule from reactor at phase ⅴ showed a dense and stereoscopic structure before dehydration as shown in fig 6c while large humps were observed on the surface of dehydrated granule as shown in fig 6d however in the case of an ordinary sludge granule from another one stage pna reactor with an nrr of about 0 8 kg m3 d for hsaww treatment in our lab the almost transparent structure before dehydration was a flat thin membrane after dehydration as shown in fig 6e and fig 6f this was evidence that there was a support skeletal structure inside the granule as the hap almost has no contractibility under an alcohol environment it could be inferred that the hap served as the support skeletal structure of the granules this kind of structure raised the density of the granules and improved the settleability of the sludge therefore making it possible to achieve a high biomass in the reactor at a short hrt the observed structural morphology of the granule sample for xrd observation in the dry state and the granule sample for microscope observation in the wet state differed significantly however since the sub granules were block shaped in the single granule as shown in fig 6a it could be inferred that the humps were the local structures of sub granules in the granule therefore further observation of the interior of the granule in wet state was necessary to determine the actual structure of the granule 3 4 2 micro ct scan observation the micro ct is a nondestructive technique for visualizing the interior features of solid objects neues and epple 2008 it is based on the different absorption coefficients for x rays in different materials the mineralized material is much brighter than weakly mineralized or non mineralized material in the phase contrast images obtained micro ct is also a versatile tool for high contrast 3d imaging at histological resolutions for developmental biology metscher 2009 from the 3d image based on micro ct scan as shown in fig 7 a the video showing the three dimensional rotation structure is supplied in supplementary material the bright parts in the granule were deemed to be minerals and the gray parts were the main organic matter this indicates that the mass distribution of granule was uneven and the spatial distribution of discrete bright parts were consistent with that of sub granules of dry granule observed by sem considering these observations together with the results provided in section 3 4 1 it was obvious that the bright parts were the sub granules from these it was confirmed that the granule was comprised of sub granules the cross section ct images perpendicular to x axis y axis and z axis of one location in the interior of one sub granule are shown in fig 7b 7c and 7d respectively it was found that there was hollow structure in the selected sub granule this interesting phenomenon was only attributed to the accumulation of gas it was not possible that the gas came from the air since there have been no reports of microbe growth around an air bubble further in this alr reactor the attachment of air bubble to sludge was impossible due to the strong disturbance this led to the conclusion that the only possible source of the gas was microbial activity there were two possibilities anammox reaction and denitrification in the denitrification situation co2 and n2 were produced however the co2 was soluble and could be indirectly used by other autotrophic bacteria or evaporated finally and only the n2 remained however because the no3 n δnr ratio did not suggest that strong denitrification occurred in the reactor it was not possible that the denitrification pathway served as the main route of n2 production considering this the anammox reaction was the only possible reaction which could have produced the n2 in the sludge interior and created the hollow structure with continuous production the pressure of the gas in the hollow portion increased resulting in the expansion of the volume of the hollow portion also the holes on the surface of the sub granule according to the sem observation as shown in fig 6b indicated the eruption of pressured nitrogen gas in the interior as the size distribution range of granules remained stable with the increase of mlvss during the experiment as shown in fig 4 it was obvious that the big granules had divided as previously stated because the distribution range of granule size in similar research by chen et al chen et al 2019a was higher than that in this research as shown in table 2 it is not likely that the divisions were spontaneous thus it could be inferred that the connections between sub granules in granules were fragile and only under this premise could granule division occurred due to the crash among big granules caused by aeration in the alr reactor finally the sludge in the reactor became highly dispersive 3 5 fish observation the results of the fish observation shown in fig 8 a indicated that all the fluorescence patterns of probes were loop like bands which was in good accordance with the hollow structure of granules the enlarged image of one granule comprised of single sub granule as shown in fig 8b clearly showed that aob and anammox bacteria were distributed in the two sides of loop like band however in the middle of loop like band an extremely bright striola was observed since the results thus far have shown that the hap and microbes were well combined it was obvious that these bright striola indicated the location of the hap which served as the granule skeleton therefore it was concluded that both the microbes and hap constituted the shell of the sub granules and that novel microbe hap granules were cultured in this research for numerous one stage pna processes regardless of whether it was a granular type chen et al 2019a or biofilm type chen et al 2019b aob was mainly distributed on the surface of the biomass structure while the anammox bacteria in interior it has been shown that this is decided by the metabolic properties of each bacteria almstrand et al 2014 chen et al 2009 2019a pellicer nàcher et al 2014 in this study the lack of obvious stratification of aob and anammox was likely because the shell thickness of the sub granules was low it was interesting that the distributions of microbes and hap in the granules were not indented and that obvious layering had taken place the stimulation of the hap crystallization by the bio induced effect may have contributed to these attributes it has been reported in earlier anammox hap research that the activity of anammox bacteria could create a more suitable environment for hap crystallization ma et al 2018 3 6 microbial community the microbial community analysis results are shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 9a the planctomycetes affiliated bacteria were mainly from the genus kuenenia and the order phycisphaerales the former was mainly comprised of the anammox bacteria while the latter was the certain heterotrophs which utilized extracellular polysaccharides produced by the anammox bacteria as carbon source lawson et al 2017 zhao et al 2018a chloroflexi chlorobi proteobacteria acidobacteria and bacteroidetes were common microbes in the anammox based reactor bhattacharjee et al 2017 feng et al 2018 lawson et al 2017 zhao et al 2018a these microbes shared symbiotic relationships with anammox metabolism like the growth factor supply like phylum armatimonadetes affiliated bacteria and phylum proteobacteria affiliated bacteria anammox consortium aggregation like phylum chloroflexi affiliated bacteria and anammox metabolite scavenging chlorobi affiliated bacteria zhao et al 2018b it has been reported that bacteroidetes organisms can also remove p and organic matter xu et al 2018 as shown in fig 9b the microbes at genus level with the relative abundance above 0 5 are illustrated the relative abundance of main functional bacteria species are listed in table 5 four kinds of aob bacteria all came from genus nitrosomonas and nitrosococcus were detected and the dominated aob bacteria was the uncultured sp belonged to genus nitrosomonas during the whole experiment the dominant species of anammox bacteria came from the genus kuenenia with a small presence of species from the genus brocadia at phase ⅲ in this study the nitrite limited strategy was thought to be key factor for the inhibition of genus brocadia due to its low affinity to nitrite guo et al 2020c there was no nitrite oxidizing bacteria bacteria species found it was worth noting that microbes belonging to the genus dok59 increased as the experiment proceeded likely through the function of the denitrification reaction tao et al 2020 3 7 proposed formation mechanism of microbe hap granules from the above comprehensive analysis the formation mechanism of microbe hap granules in this reactor was proposed as illustrated in fig 10 first a tiny granule was activated with the accumulation of nitrogen gas as the anammox reaction proceeded with the growth of the microbes and the further increase of the gas volume the granule became larger forming a hollow structure finally due to the high pressure as the nitrogen gas accumulated small holes emerged through which the gas erupted meanwhile in the fractured shell microbes continuously grew and nitrogen gas accumulation occurred again with the growth of these microbes many sub granules with the same hollow structure formed at the thicker locations of the shells meanwhile the anammox bacteria created the local high ph environment which was helpful for hap crystallization enabling hap accumulation to occur in the middle of the sub granule shells in this way after several rounds of growth a large granule formed with fragile connections due to its large size this granule tended to crash into other similar granules with the division of large granules numerous sub granules were released becoming independent smaller granules in the continuous long term operation of the reactor these smaller granules experienced the same growth process repeatedly as the cycle repeated sludge with high dispersity was cultured in the reactor 3 8 enlightenment from this study after careful consideration of the factors contributing to the achievements in this research it was considered a problem that the initial microbe hap granule sludge was inoculated from hsaww treatment reactor the initial formation of the microbe hap granules did not occur in this experiment this raises the issue of access to a mass of microbe hap granules for inoculation in actual applications it stands to reason that the initial formation of microbe hap granule is difficult since the lsaww has a low influent p concentration for hap crystallization to occur to improve the saturation index of hap it is necessary to add a mass of calcium to the reactor which is not considered economical and will inevitably be associated with other problems in actual operation in such situations the cultivation of microbe hap sludge granule in a separate reactor with hsaww is a prerequisite for wwtps the sidestream is the optimal solution to this problem since the well formed microbe hap granules in a one stage pna process for sidestream treatment could be transferred to the one stage pna reactor for lsaww treatment in the worst case situation microbe hap granules with lower settleability due to an error in operation in a one stage pna reactor for lsaww treatment could be returned to hsaww installations to improve settleability with this circulation the long term and stable supply of well formed microbe hap granules to lsaww installation is possible in this study from the p removal performance shown in fig 2e and because the main inorganic matter in the sludge was hap it was obvious that the hap crystallization still occurred at the low influent calcium condition this indicated the concentrated highly dispersive and easily settleable microbe hap granule sludge was cultivated during the whole experiment and the long term stable operation of this system was possible municipal wastewater treatment is an energy intensive industry the transport and treatment of municipal wastewater imposes a significant energy demand consuming 3 of the electrical energy supply in the us and the values for other countries are 3 5 q h zhang et al 2016 the one stage pna process has a saving on the oxygen supply by 60 for the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and there is no demand for organic carbon for denitrification in addition sludge production is reduced by 80 in the one stage pna process chen et al 2021 for the raw municipal wastewater after cod removal by the pretreatment the application of this process has huge potential to significantly reduce energy consumption and to contribute to the sustainable development of society 4 conclusion in this study an efficient solution was proposed to achieve the excellent nrr of one stage pna process for lsaww treatment granules comprised of microbes and hap realized desirable sludge settleability high biomass concentration and effective substance transfer in reactor at short hrt which were the critical factors microbial activity and hap crystallization created a unique granule structure through a special formation mechanism this study presents an innovative approach to lsaww treatment and provides a useful reference for the realization of the wide application of the one stage pna process in the future

16912,widespread wastewater pollution is one of the greatest challenges threatening the sustainable management of rivers globally understanding microbial responses to gradients in environmental stressors such as wastewater pollution is crucial to identify thresholds of community change and to develop management strategies that protect ecosystem integrity this study used multiple lines of empirical evidence including a novel combination of microbial ecotoxicology methods in the laboratory and field to link pressure stressor response relationships specifically community based whole effluent toxicity wet testing and environmental genomics were integrated to determine real world community interactions shifts and functional change in response to wastewater pollution here we show that wastewater effluents above moderate 10 concentrations caused consistent significant shifts in bacterial community structure and function these thresholds of community shifts were also linked to changes in the trophic state of receiving waters in terms of nutrient concentrations differences in the community responses along the effluent concentration gradient were primarily driven by two globally relevant bacterial indicator taxa namely malikia spp burkholderiales and hgci clade frankiales species replacement occurred above moderate effluent concentrations with abundances of malikia spp increasing while abundances of hgci clade decreased the responses of malikia spp and hgci clade matched gene patterns associated with globally important nitrogen cycling pathways such as denitrification and nitrogen fixation which linked the core individual taxa to putative function and ecosystem processes rarely achieved in previous studies this study has identified potential

wang et al 2019 the current annual global wastewater volume equals one seventh of the global river volume mateo sagasta et al 2015 wu et al 2019b and is rapidly increasing due to anthropogenic drivers

wastewater management challenges if further impacts on aquatic ecosystems is to be prevented schindler 2006 linking the pressure stressor response relationships in aquatic microbial communities to wastewater impacts on the environment can provide insights to improve management of ecosystem functions traditional microbial ecotoxicological studies have relied on the combination of single algal species toxicity testing and chemical exposure surveys to ascertain the aggregate toxic effect of whole effluent wastewater discharge on microalgae birrer et al 2017 however single species tests have limited ability to accurately predict direct and indirect effects on natural microbial populations and very limited real world relevance to ecosystem level impacts of environmental stressors brandt et al 2004 guckert 1996 the combination of community level whole effluent toxicity wet testing and environmental genomics moves beyond the scenario of single species toxicity testing and provides the opportunity to determine real world community interactions shifts and functional change in response to wastewater pollution ruprecht et al 2020a microbial communities exhibit significant metabolic and

real world stressors could elucidate potential tipping points that may lead to shifts in ecosystem state birrer et al 2017 li et al 2020 romero et al 2019 yang et al 2019 importantly in aquatic ecosystems changes in ecosystem state that affect microbial functioning can result in oligotrophic or low nutrient water bodies becoming eutrophic alexander et al 2017 smith and schindler 2009 smith et al 1999 the main determinants of trophic status in aquatic ecosystems are the macronutrient levels of nitrogen n and phosphorus p hutchinson 1973 smith et al 1999 n and p are often the major limiting nutrients of microbial growth azam et al 1983 cotner et al 2000 elser et al 2007 increased concentrations of these nutrients can significantly influence community structure and function in lakes feng et al 2019 seballos et al 2020 and streams docherty et al 2018 hoellein et al 2010 tank and dodds 2003 microbial growth in freshwater and marine ecosystems can also lead to major water quality changes associated with environmental pollution such as hypoxia pathogenic contamination and the production of greenhouse gases mallin and cahoon 2020 thus there is a pressing need to better understand pressure stressor response relationships in microbial communities particularly those associated with growing global issues such as the very common practice of wastewater discharge into aquatic waterbodies a review of literature reveals no other studies have attempted to address this knowledge gap by using combined evidence from sensitive real world laboratory and field investigations to detect thresholds of community shifts in response to effluent concentration gradients cf supplementary table 1 here we use ecotoxicology wet testing with bacterial communities across a full concentration gradient i e 0 0 1 1 10 50 90 and link the observed changes in community structure and function to field shifts with real world wastewater effluent discharges we sampled tertiary treated effluent from multiple wastewater treatment plants wwtp with nutrient concentrations representative of current global wastewater treatment practices asano et al 2007 we identified indicators of bacterial community and functional shifts as well as changes in the trophic status of disturbed aquatic ecosystems that could have global relevance as potential keystone taxa by keystone taxa we refer to globally relevant species that have a unique and critical role in microbial communities and their removal can cause a dramatic shift in microbiome structure and functioning banerjee et al 2018 while there are over 200 keystone taxa reported globally for soil plant marine and human microbiomes few studies have used empirical evidence for their identification or linked these core taxa to ecosystem processes a central goal in microbial ecology banerjee et al 2018 graham et al 2016 this study has immediate implications for both the management of environmental stressors and protection of natural productivity in aquatic ecosystems 2 methods 2 1 study site and experimental design the hunter river estuary 151 8 e 32 9 s is situated on the temperate southeast coastline of nsw australia and is typical of many regulated estuaries in developed coastal regions globally having been extensively modified by human activity and receives high nutrient point loads from several major wastewater treatment plants wwtp the hunter river wwtp are universally representative of tertiary level wastewater treatment designed to remove excess nutrients of nitrogen and phosphorus field surveys were used to investigate microbial responses to wastewater effluent in receiving environments briefly microbial field studies were performed at two time points in the 2016 17 austral summer surface water samples were collected upstream and downstream from four main wwtp outfalls including farley far wwtp 1 kurri kurri kk wwtp 2 morpeth mor wwtp 3 and raymond terrace rt wwtp 4 the layout of the four wwtp showing the treatment trains are provided in supplementary figs 1 4 downstream sites are in the direction of an observer looking towards the ocean entrance upstream sampling was representative of background bg concentrations in the vicinity of the outfall surface water samples were collected in 2 l sterile whirl paks and stored on ice in the dark until filtering within 24 h full details of environmental conditions downstream of the wwtp outfalls during the field surveys are provided in supplementary table 2 the field surveys were complemented by laboratory dilution experiments to manipulate effluent concentrations and identify thresholds of microbial community shifts across an effluent concentration gradient water sample collection preparation and laboratory testing was completed over three weeks in early 2017 unfiltered sterile effluent post uv treatment was sampled from the same four main wwtp outfalls for the laboratory experiments riverine water was collected upstream of river discharge site 1 fig 1 a water samples were collected on the first day of each test week and stored in a dark constant temperature 25 c room o n to allow for water temperature adjustment to the testing conditions wet testing was performed in triplicate 2 l plastic beakers by mixing the sterile effluents with riverine water providing an initial microbial community to create concentrations of 0 effluent 0 1 effluent 1 effluent 10 effluent 50 effluent and 90 effluent the dilution gradient selected for wet testing was representative of the typical conditions encountered in the estuary based on data from the study site dilutions during typical flow conditions in the main river channel were estimated to be around 100 times i e 1 effluent concentration but could be as high as 10 000 times i e 0 01 effluent concentration in dry low flow periods dilutions in the creeks flowing to the estuary were estimated to be from 2 to 10 times i e effluent concentrations from 50 to 10 respectively experiments were completed over 72 h at a 12 12 hour day night light cycle and a constant temperature of 25 c in accordance with standard procedures us epa test method 1003 0 us epa 2002

supplementary tables 5 and 6 of the experiments to provide new insights into nutrient cycling and identify ecotoxicological tipping points note that filtering for dna extraction followed the same protocol for both the microbial field surveys and community wet tests approximately 500 ml of water was filtered through a 0 22 μm express plus polyethersulfone membrane millipore using a hydraulic pump filters were rolled inserted into bead tubes from the dneasy powerwater kit qiagen and frozen at 80 c until dna extraction and sequencing amplicon sequencing of 16s rrna genes and micro fluidic quantitative polymerase chain reactions mfqpcr were used to determine taxonomic and functional diversity of pelagic microbial communities for the field surveys and community wet tests flow cytometry was also used in the community wet tests used to determine total bacterial cell numbers full details of the methods used with free and open access to the full dataset are provided in ruprecht et al 2019 2020a b 2 2 sequence processing generated 16s rrna gene datasets were initially quality filtered with the trimmomatic tool version 0 36 bolger et al 2014 trimming soft clipping was applied before reads were merged assembled with usearch low quality regions were truncated if the quality dropped below 15 in a sliding window of 4 bp subsequently all reads shorter than 100 bp and orphan reads were removed remaining sequences were merged quality filtered and further processed with usearch version 10 0 240 edgar 2010 filtering included the removal of reads shorter than 360 bp or longer than 585 bp low quality reads with a standard error less than 1 bp and reads with more than one 1 ambitious base as well as low quality regions at the end of the forward and reverse read were also removed after merging all reads shared basically the same length with slight variations due to the naturally occurring variation and started and ended at the same position processed sequences of all samples were concatenated to one 1 file and subsequently dereplicated into unique sequences the processed sequences were denoised with the unoise3 algorithm implemented in usearch edgar 2010 all operational taxonomic units otus consisting of a single sequence were removed the unoise3 algorithm includes an error correction and determines all correct biological sequences in the reads instead of clustering reads based on sequence similarity a de novo chimera removal was included in this step subsequently remaining chimeric sequences were removed using uchime edgar et al 2011 in reference mode with the silva ssuref 128 nr 99 database as reference dataset quast et al 2012 filtered sequences were mapped on the remaining unique sequences to determine the occurrence and abundance of each unique sequence in every sample to assign taxonomy chimera free sequences were classified using the best hit approach with blast and an e value threshold of 1e 20 all non bacterial otus were removed based on their taxonomic classification in the silva database quast et al 2012 for the microbial field surveys a total of 5 339 374 high quality non chimeric 16s bacterial sequences were obtained with an average of 44 495 sequences per sample range 16 781 to 92 324 and 13 175 unique bacterial sequences classified below phylum level as significant differences between the mean sequencing depths per wwtp time and distance were observed kruskal wallis test p 0 05 otu tables were rarefied with 16 781 sequences using the rrarefy function in vegan oksanen et al 2016 for the microbial community wet tests a total of 16 063 342 high quality non chimeric 16s bacterial sequences were obtained with an average of 23 692 sequences per sample range 4 849 to 85 870 and 13 723 unique bacterial sequences classified below phylum level significant differences in sequencing depth among locations p 0 001 and treatments p 0 03 required rarefaction of the dataset to an even sequencing depth of 4 848 sequences per sample only otus occurring in more than two samples and with more than 100 reads were considered for further statistical analysis 2 3 statistical analysis statistical tests were conducted using primer permanova v7 0 13 anderson et al 2008 clarke and gorley 2015 to identify if there was a treatment effect in the community wet tests statistical tests were performed at the endpoint of the experiment i e after 72 h while there was some temporal variability in the observed microbial communities the sequence patterns were consistent at all time points throughout the community wet tests abundances of 2 078 bacterial taxa recorded from 70 samples were analysed in a two factor design effluent type i e wwtp fixed with four levels wwtp1 4 and effluent concentration i e effluent relative to river water control fixed with six levels 0 control 0 1 1 10 50 90 bacterial community and gene differences among treatments and across wwtp discharge sites in the field survey were visualised using non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds the nmds ordination plots were generated from a bray curtis similarity measure on square root transformed abundance data environmental data was log transformed and normalised prior to analysis with euclidean distance used to form similarity matrices to determine whether patterns observed in the bacterial community gene and environmental data ordinations were similar a relate analysis through a spearman rank correlation value rho and significance levels was performed on matching resemblance matrices vectors of significant variables that most likely explained patterns in the biological data were also fitted onto the ordination space using a pearson correlation greater than 0 6 the trophic states of each treatment in the community wet tests was validated by smith et al 1999 based on the average concentrations of tn for streams as provided in table 1 permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was used to test the main and interactive effects of effluent type and concentration on the 16s bacterial communities and genes and obtain p values by permutation where significant differences in the main or interactive effects of treatments were detected pair wise comparisons were used to identify significant differences among levels within each treatment all tests were performed with an a priori significance level of 0 05 i e p value 0 05 using 9 999 random permutations of residuals under the reduced model for pair wise tests however where too few permutations were available monte carlo p values were used in preference to permutation p values statistical relationships between bacterial taxonomic groups genes and environmental variables were also examined using the maximal information based nonparametric exploration mine algorithm minev2 jar v2 0 1 reshef et al 2011 mine calculates the strength of the relationship between each individual variable mic score in addition to descriptors of the relationship such as linearity and regression results were visualized with cytoscape v3 8 shannon et al 2003 in addition to the mfqpcr data tax4fun was used to predict the functional profile and capabilities of microbial communities based on 16s rrna datasets all complete genomes were obtained from the ncbi refseq database https www ncbi nlm nih gov refseq a functional profile was calculated for each single genome using uproc meinicke 2015 and the most recent kegg database kanehisa and goto 2000 rnammer lagesen et al 2007 was used to extract 16s rrna genes sequences from each genome functional profiles were normalised by the number of 16s rrna genes found in each genome by rnammer subsequently all unique bacterial sequences obtained in this study were aligned against the 16s rrna genes of the refseq genomes only hits with a minimum identity of at least 97 were considered for further calculation of functional profiles functional profiles of all genomes which were identified as close matches during blast alignment camacho et al 2009 were multiplied with the abundance of the respective unique sequences and afterwards combined and standardised this procedure was performed for each sample four 4 empty filter samples were used as control of the dna extraction but were removed prior statistical analysis wemheuer et al 2018 wemheuer et al 2020 3 results 3 1 detecting thresholds of community shifts community wet tests identified effluent concentrations that caused significant shifts in the riverine bacterial communities revealing a potential threshold of trophic change associated with wastewater pollution fig 1 b supplementary table 7 specifically bacterial communities differed along the gradient from high i e 50 and 90 to moderate i e 10 and low i e 0 control 0 1 and 1 effluent concentrations on nmds axis 1 fig 1 b nutrient concentrations i e tn tkn nh3 nox tp and bod were largely covariant with effluent concentrations fig 1 c supplementary tables 5 and 6 and showed strong positive correlation r2 0 6 with shifts in the bacterial communities fig 1 d the greatest change in bacterial community structure occurred above moderate 10 effluent concentrations signalling a potential transition from mesotrophic to eutrophic states fig 1 b in addition bacterial community shifts along the gradient of effluent concentrations were positively correlated with genes involved in nitrate reduction napa narg fig 1 e in contrast genes associated with denitrification nirs and sulfate reduction dsra and phsa were positively correlated with nmds axis 2 suggesting links to different effluent types rather than effluent concentration fig 1 e similar bacterial community change also occurred in response to real world effluent discharges fig 2 a supplementary table 8 we observed clear separation in the field sampled community structure among effluent types that were representative of 1 wwtp 3 10 wwtp 1 50 wwtp 4 and 90 wwtp 2 effluent concentrations in the community wet tests fig 2

during both sampling times supplementary table 2 despite some localised variability in tn and tkn nutrient concentrations notably nox generally increased downstream of the outfalls when compared to upstream background values fig 2 b 3 2 indicators of trophic shifts shifts in community dominance were observed in relation to effluent concentration in the community wet tests fig 3 burkholderiales betaproteobacteria was the most abundant bacterial order and represented more than 20 of sequences across all samples while frankiales actinobacteria was in the top 10 of abundant orders and accounted for approximately 3 of sequences in general abundances of burkholderiales increased with increasing effluent concentrations while the opposite was observed for frankiales these differences could be explained by two potential keystone taxa malikia spp the most abundant operational taxonomic unit otu otu1 7 5 across all samples 36 of otus belonging to burkholderiales and hgci clade 2 7 across all samples 98 of otus belonging to frankiales malikia spp were stimulated by moderate effluent concentrations 1 10 effluent concentrations and growth stabilised at higher concentrations 10 90 effluent concentrations indicating potential affinity with mesotrophic and eutrophic conditions fig 4 supplementary fig 5a in contrast hgci clade abundances were stable under oligotrophic conditions low effluent concentrations but were inhibited above 1 effluent concentration fig 4 supplementary fig 5b network analysis identified statistical links between malikia spp and hgci clade abundances of functional genes and environmental conditions in the community wet tests fig 5 a b malikia spp was strongly positively correlated with bod r 0 7 narg gene nitrate reduction r 0 5 as well as nutrient concentrations r 0 4 including tn and nox and weakly positively correlated with tkn r 0 3 and tn tp nutrient ratio r 0 2 in contrast the hgci clade had strong negative correlations with nutrient concentrations r 0 5 including tn tkn and nox mic 1 0 tn tp nutrient ratio r 0 4 narg and napa genes nitrate reduction r 0 4 and was weakly positively correlated with phod gene producing bioavailable phosphorus r 0 3 nirs gene denitrification r 0 2 and dsra gene sulfate reduction r 0 1 in addition malikia spp and hgci clade shared close associations with other less abundant genera of burkholderiales rhodobacterales pseudomonadales and sphingobacteriales providing some additional insight into potential interactions within the microbiome 3 3 shifts in functional diversity gene patterns from the community wet tests and field surveys showed that effluent discharges shifted functional diversity of bacterial communities with the direction of change i e stimulation or growth inhibition linked to effluent concentration and the trophic state of the receiving water to gain deeper insights into the functioning patterns of the potential keystone taxa genes involved in the nitrogen cycle were targeted the gene patterns associated with nitrogen reduction matched the response of malikia spp with stimulation of the species linked with higher effluent concentrations in the community wet tests fig 4 nitrate reduction genes narg napa were stimulated above 50 effluent concentrations in the community wet tests and tended to increase upon effluent discharge across the estuary during the microbial field surveys supplementary figs 6 and 7 this observation was supported by 16s based functional gene analysis using tax4fun where the putative abundance of the predominant nitrate reduction genes increased with increasing effluent concentrations including the three sub units of nitrate reductase ec 1 7 5 1 1 7 99 narg supplementary fig 8 in addition gene abundance of nitrite reductase nirs denitrification step 2 increased at 1 effluent concentrations and decreased at 50 effluent concentrations in the community wet tests supplementary fig 6 while field abundances of the nitrite reductase gene nirk showed some spatiotemporal variability there was evidence of stimulation at lower concentration effluents and inhibition at higher concentration effluents supplementary fig 7 a similar gene pattern for nitrite reductase ec 1 7 2 1 was predicted using tax4fun supplementary fig 8 to complete the denitrification 4 step pathway tax4fun predicted nitric oxide reductases ec 1 7 2 5 norbc denitrification step 3 increased with increasing effluent concentration while nitrous oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 4 nosz denitrification step 4 decreased despite higher putative abundances of these genes in 100 effluent samples supplementary fig 8 the gene patterns associated with nitrogen fixation matched the response of the hgci clade with inhibition of the species exposed to higher effluent concentrations in the community wet tests fig 4 nitrogen fixation genes nifd nifh tended to decrease downstream of effluent discharges during the microbial field surveys supplementary fig 7 tax4fun provided additional evidence to support these findings showing putative abundance of the nitrogenase iron protein nifh ec 1 18 6 1 increased up to 1 effluent concentrations and strongly decreased at and above 10 effluent concentrations supplementary fig 8 other nitrogen cycling genes including ammonia oxidising archaea aoa and bacteria aob and nitrate reduction gene nrfa dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra step 2 all increased at 1 effluent concentration and generally decreased at 50 effluent concentration in the community wet tests supplementary fig 6 tax4fun also predicted the activity of glutamate synthases e g ec 1 4 7 1 and ec 6 3 1 2 would be reduced and the putative abundance of several glutamate dehydrogenases e g ec 1 4 1 2 and ec 1 4 1 4 would be increased under higher effluent concentrations supplementary fig 8 4 discussion understanding microbial responses to gradients in complex real world environmental stressors such as wastewater pollution is crucial to identify community thresholds and potential tipping points of change and to protect ecosystem integrity this study used multiple lines of empirical evidence including a novel combination of community wet tests and repeated field surveys as well as 16s amplicon sequencing mfqpcr and functional gene analysis to link pressure stressor response relationships in riverine microbial communities to wastewater impacts it was found that wastewater effluents caused consistent shifts in bacterial community structure and function above moderate 10 effluent concentrations these thresholds of community shifts were also linked to changes in the trophic status of receiving waters in terms of nutrient concentrations crucially these moderate concentrations of tn 0 7 1 5 mg l and tp 0 03 0 08 mg l from wastewater effluent discharges can change microbiome composition and function in aquatic environments rice and westerhoff 2017 uncovered an alarming trend in the united states showing over 900 rivers receiving effluent discharges had effluent contributions of 50 of the total river flow in these high effluent discharge scenarios romero et al 2019 showed significant changes in sediment bacterial community structure where wwtp effluents account for 50 of the total river flow which is related to nutrient levels ranging 4 6 5 2 mg no3 l and are consistent with our 50 90 treatments in the community wet tests our study suggests riverine communities may be more sensitive than sediment communities along these effluent concentration gradients this study reveals that differences in the community responses along the effluent concentration gradient can be explained by core indicators of changes in trophic status and the functional consequences of wastewater pollution unearthing potentially globally relevant keystone bacterial taxa for freshwater aquatic environments species replacement occurred above moderate effluent concentrations with abundances of malikia spp burkholderiales increasing while abundances of hgci clade frankiales decreased potential impacts of these changes in core species dominance on microbiome composition and function were identified through network scores and co occurrence patterns the responses of malikia spp and hgci clade matched gene patterns associated with globally important nitrogen cycling pathways including denitrification and nitrogen fixation which linked these core individual taxa to environmental variables putative function and ecosystem processes rarely achieved in previous studies banerjee et al 2018 these findings were consistent with several recent field studies in heavily polluted rivers in china liu et al 2020 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 where coupling of community composition and function was detected and hgci clade and malikia spp were identified as major bacterial genera having central roles in the co occurrence networks of the freshwater aquatic ecosystems studied in the marine environment li et al 2020 showed that heterotrophic vibrio communities experienced a gradual change along with trophic state where the nitrogen source nh3 and nox was the main factor significantly influencing community structure in highly eutrophic conditions our work showed that most steps of the nitrogen cycle were activated upon effluent addition while high levels of nutrients particularly nox supplementary fig 9 in the effluents were driving community shifts and inhibited growth of specific bacterial taxa with potentially important community functions such as nitrification this may have implications for the removal of excess nitrogen in receiving waters a common problem downstream of effluent outfalls santos et al 2008 frankiales are associated with common nitrogen fixing oligotrophs found globally in freshwater ecosystems lipko 2020 sen et al 2014 and have previously been inferred as keystone taxa in plant associated microbiota banerjee et al 2018 and riverine communities liu et al 2020 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the community wet tests showed a growth inhibition response when exposed to moderate and high effluent concentrations with a modest stimulatory response up to 1 effluent concentrations in addition hgci clade was strongly negatively correlated to nox mic 1 0 and nitrogen reduction genes and was linked to putative functioning associated with nitrogen fixation a similar real world response of hgci clade showed that abundance decreased downstream of effluent outfalls the strongest decrease in hgci clade abundance was associated with effluents containing high tn concentrations and in particular those effluents comprised of high nox levels suggesting strong species sensitivity to nox toxicity frankiales were identified as the predominant bacterial order accounting for 12 4 of sequences across all samples in the microbial field surveys at a genus level hgci clade was predominant 12 1 across all estuary samples the hgci clade was identified as a potential new keystone taxa likely part of the core microbiome that is consistently present in oligotrophic aquatic ecosystems globally newton et al 2011 by contrast banerjee et al 2018 revealed that various members of burkholderiales are consistently present as keystone taxa across different ecosystems such as grasslands forest or woodlands agricultural

relative abundances of malikia spp were similar across all effluent concentrations at the start of the community wet tests supplementary fig 1a and showed relative increases or decreases over time indicating that it was not the introduction of effluent driving the observed sequence patterns malikia spp was the dominant taxa across the gradient of effluent concentrations in the community wet tests showing a consistently strong stimulation response above moderate effluent concentrations with modest sensitivity to phosphorus availability and nox toxicity malikia spp were evidently strictly aerobic denitrifiers with strong positive correlations to bod nox and nitrogen reduction genes in the community wet tests in this study malikia spp predicted community shifts associated with changes in trophic status and captured real world denitrification dynamics consequently malikia spp are relevant global freshwater indicator species for human impacted aquatic environments and eutrophic

16912,widespread wastewater pollution is one of the greatest challenges threatening the sustainable management of rivers globally understanding microbial responses to gradients in environmental stressors such as wastewater pollution is crucial to identify thresholds of community change and to develop management strategies that protect ecosystem integrity this study used multiple lines of empirical evidence including a novel combination of microbial ecotoxicology methods in the laboratory and field to link pressure stressor response relationships specifically community based whole effluent toxicity wet testing and environmental genomics were integrated to determine real world community interactions shifts and functional change in response to wastewater pollution here we show that wastewater effluents above moderate 10 concentrations caused consistent significant shifts in bacterial community structure and function these thresholds of community shifts were also linked to changes in the trophic state of receiving waters in terms of nutrient concentrations differences in the community responses along the effluent concentration gradient were primarily driven by two globally relevant bacterial indicator taxa namely malikia spp burkholderiales and hgci clade frankiales species replacement occurred above moderate effluent concentrations with abundances of malikia spp increasing while abundances of hgci clade decreased the responses of malikia spp and hgci clade matched gene patterns associated with globally important nitrogen cycling pathways such as denitrification and nitrogen fixation which linked the core individual taxa to putative function and ecosystem processes rarely achieved in previous studies this study has identified potential

wastewater management challenges if further impacts on aquatic ecosystems is to be prevented schindler 2006 linking the pressure stressor response relationships in aquatic microbial communities to wastewater impacts on the environment can provide insights to improve management of ecosystem functions traditional microbial ecotoxicological studies have relied on the combination of single algal species toxicity testing and chemical exposure surveys to ascertain the aggregate toxic effect of whole effluent wastewater discharge on microalgae birrer et al 2017 however single species tests have limited ability to accurately predict direct and indirect effects on natural microbial populations and very limited real world relevance to ecosystem level impacts of environmental stressors brandt et al 2004 guckert 1996 the combination of community level whole effluent toxicity wet testing and environmental genomics moves beyond the scenario of single species toxicity testing and provides the opportunity to determine real world community interactions shifts and functional change in response to wastewater pollution ruprecht et al 2020a microbial communities exhibit significant metabolic and

ecosystems changes in ecosystem state that affect microbial functioning can result in oligotrophic or low nutrient water bodies becoming eutrophic alexander et al 2017 smith and schindler 2009 smith et al 1999 the main determinants of trophic status in aquatic ecosystems are the macronutrient levels of nitrogen n and phosphorus p hutchinson 1973 smith et al 1999 n and p are often the major limiting nutrients of microbial growth azam et al 1983 cotner et al 2000 elser et al 2007 increased concentrations of these nutrients can significantly influence community structure and function in lakes feng et al 2019 seballos et al 2020 and streams docherty et al 2018 hoellein et al 2010 tank and dodds 2003 microbial growth in freshwater and marine ecosystems can also lead to major water quality changes associated with environmental pollution such as hypoxia pathogenic contamination and the production of greenhouse gases mallin and cahoon 2020 thus there is a pressing need to better understand pressure stressor response relationships in microbial communities particularly those associated with growing global issues such as the very common practice of wastewater discharge into aquatic waterbodies a review of literature reveals no other studies have attempted to address this knowledge gap by using combined evidence from sensitive real world laboratory and field investigations to detect thresholds of community shifts in response to effluent concentration gradients cf supplementary table 1 here we use ecotoxicology wet testing with bacterial communities across a full concentration gradient i e 0 0 1 1 10 50 90 and link the observed changes in community structure and function to field shifts with real world wastewater effluent discharges we sampled tertiary treated effluent from multiple wastewater treatment plants wwtp with nutrient concentrations representative of current global wastewater treatment practices asano et al 2007 we identified indicators of bacterial community and functional shifts as well as changes in the trophic status of disturbed aquatic ecosystems that could have global relevance as potential keystone taxa by keystone taxa we refer to globally relevant species that have a unique and critical role in microbial communities and their removal can cause a dramatic shift in microbiome structure and functioning banerjee et al 2018 while there are over 200 keystone taxa reported globally for soil plant marine and human microbiomes few studies have used empirical evidence for their identification or linked these core taxa to ecosystem processes a central goal in microbial ecology banerjee et al 2018 graham et al 2016 this study has immediate implications for both the management of environmental stressors and protection of natural productivity in aquatic ecosystems 2 methods 2 1 study site and experimental design the hunter river estuary 151 8 e 32 9 s is situated on the temperate southeast coastline of nsw australia and is typical of many regulated estuaries in developed coastal regions globally having been extensively modified by human activity and receives high nutrient point loads from several major wastewater treatment plants wwtp the hunter river wwtp are universally representative of tertiary level wastewater treatment designed to remove excess nutrients of nitrogen and phosphorus field surveys were used to investigate microbial responses to wastewater effluent in receiving environments briefly microbial field studies were performed at two time points in the 2016 17 austral summer surface water samples were collected upstream and downstream from four main wwtp outfalls including farley far wwtp 1 kurri kurri kk wwtp 2 morpeth mor wwtp 3 and raymond terrace rt wwtp 4 the layout of the four wwtp showing the treatment trains are provided in supplementary figs 1 4 downstream sites are in the direction of an observer looking towards the ocean entrance upstream sampling was representative of background bg concentrations in the vicinity of the outfall surface water samples were collected in 2 l sterile whirl paks and stored on ice in the dark until filtering within 24 h full details of environmental conditions downstream of the wwtp outfalls during the field surveys are provided in supplementary table 2 the field surveys were complemented by laboratory dilution experiments to manipulate effluent concentrations and identify thresholds of microbial community shifts across an effluent concentration gradient water sample collection preparation and laboratory testing was completed over three weeks in early 2017 unfiltered sterile effluent post uv treatment was sampled from the same four main wwtp outfalls for the laboratory experiments riverine water was collected upstream of river discharge site 1 fig 1 a water samples were collected on the first day of each test week and stored in a dark constant temperature 25 c room o n to allow for water temperature adjustment to the testing conditions wet testing was performed in triplicate 2 l plastic beakers by mixing the sterile effluents with riverine water providing an initial microbial community to create concentrations of 0 effluent 0 1 effluent 1 effluent 10 effluent 50 effluent and 90 effluent the dilution gradient selected for wet testing was representative of the typical conditions encountered in the estuary based on data from the study site dilutions during typical flow conditions in the main river channel were estimated to be around 100 times i e 1 effluent concentration but could be as high as 10 000 times i e 0 01 effluent concentration in dry low flow periods dilutions in the creeks flowing to the estuary were estimated to be from 2 to 10 times i e effluent concentrations from 50 to 10 respectively experiments were completed over 72 h at a 12 12 hour day night light cycle and a constant temperature of 25 c in accordance with standard procedures us epa test method 1003 0 us epa 2002 and the environment canada test method environment canada 2007 concentrations of nh3 nox tkn tn and tp were measured in each treatment at the start 0 h supplementary tables 3 and 4 and endpoint 72 h supplementary tables 5 and 6 of the experiments to provide new insights into nutrient cycling and identify ecotoxicological tipping points note that filtering for dna extraction followed the same protocol for both the microbial field surveys and community wet tests approximately 500 ml of water was filtered through a 0 22 μm express plus polyethersulfone membrane millipore using a hydraulic pump filters were rolled inserted into bead tubes from the dneasy powerwater kit qiagen and frozen at 80 c until dna extraction and sequencing amplicon sequencing of 16s rrna genes and micro fluidic quantitative polymerase chain reactions mfqpcr were used to determine taxonomic and functional diversity of pelagic microbial communities for the field surveys and community wet tests flow cytometry was also used in the community wet tests used to determine total bacterial cell numbers full details of the methods used with free and open access to the full dataset are provided in ruprecht et al 2019 2020a b 2 2 sequence processing generated 16s rrna gene datasets were initially quality filtered with the trimmomatic tool version 0 36 bolger et al 2014 trimming soft clipping was applied before reads were merged assembled with usearch low quality regions were truncated if the quality dropped below 15 in a sliding window of 4 bp subsequently all reads shorter than 100 bp and orphan reads were removed remaining sequences were merged quality filtered and further processed with usearch version 10 0 240 edgar 2010 filtering included the removal of reads shorter than 360 bp or longer than 585 bp low quality reads with a standard error less than 1 bp and reads with more than one 1 ambitious base as well as low quality regions at the end of the forward and reverse read were also removed after merging all reads shared basically the same length with slight variations due to the naturally occurring variation and started and ended at the same position processed sequences of all samples were concatenated to one 1 file and subsequently dereplicated into unique sequences the processed sequences were denoised with the unoise3 algorithm implemented in usearch edgar 2010 all operational taxonomic units otus consisting of a single sequence were removed the unoise3 algorithm includes an error correction and determines all correct biological sequences in the reads instead of clustering reads based on sequence similarity a de novo chimera removal was included in this step subsequently remaining chimeric sequences were removed using uchime edgar et al 2011 in reference mode with the silva ssuref 128 nr 99 database as reference dataset quast et al 2012 filtered sequences were mapped on the remaining unique sequences to determine the occurrence and abundance of each unique sequence in every sample to assign taxonomy chimera free sequences were classified using the best hit approach with blast and an e value threshold of 1e 20 all non bacterial otus were removed based on their taxonomic classification in the silva database quast et al 2012 for the microbial field surveys a total of 5 339 374 high quality non chimeric 16s bacterial sequences were obtained with an average of 44 495 sequences per sample range 16 781 to 92 324 and 13 175 unique bacterial sequences classified below phylum level as significant differences between the mean sequencing depths per wwtp time and distance were observed kruskal wallis test p 0 05 otu tables were rarefied with 16 781 sequences using the rrarefy function in vegan oksanen et al 2016 for the microbial community wet tests a total of 16 063 342 high quality non chimeric 16s bacterial sequences were obtained with an average of 23 692 sequences per sample range 4 849 to 85 870 and 13 723 unique bacterial sequences classified below phylum level significant differences in sequencing depth among locations p 0 001 and treatments p 0 03 required rarefaction of the dataset to an even sequencing depth of 4 848 sequences per sample only otus occurring in more than two samples and with more than 100 reads were considered for further statistical analysis 2 3 statistical analysis statistical tests were conducted using primer permanova v7 0 13 anderson et al 2008 clarke and gorley 2015 to identify if there was a treatment effect in the community wet tests statistical tests were performed at the endpoint of the experiment i e after 72 h while there was some temporal variability in the observed microbial communities the sequence patterns were consistent at all time points throughout the community wet tests abundances of 2 078 bacterial taxa recorded from 70 samples were analysed in a two factor design effluent type i e wwtp fixed with four levels wwtp1 4 and effluent concentration i e effluent relative to river water control fixed with six levels 0 control 0 1 1 10 50 90 bacterial community and gene differences among treatments and across wwtp discharge sites in the field survey were visualised using non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds the nmds ordination plots were generated from a bray curtis similarity measure on square root transformed abundance data environmental data was log transformed and normalised prior to analysis with euclidean distance used to form similarity matrices to determine whether patterns observed in the bacterial community gene and environmental data ordinations were similar a relate analysis through a spearman rank correlation value rho and significance levels was performed on matching resemblance matrices vectors of significant variables that most likely explained patterns in the biological data were also fitted onto the ordination space using a pearson correlation greater than 0 6 the trophic states of each treatment in the community wet tests was validated by smith et al 1999 based on the average concentrations of tn for streams as provided in table 1 permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was used to test the main and interactive effects of effluent type and concentration on the 16s bacterial communities and genes and obtain p values by permutation where significant differences in the main or interactive effects of treatments were detected pair wise comparisons were used to identify significant differences among levels within each treatment all tests were performed with an a priori significance level of 0 05 i e p value 0 05 using 9 999 random permutations of residuals under the reduced model for pair wise tests however where too few permutations were available monte carlo p values were used in preference to permutation p values statistical relationships between bacterial taxonomic groups genes and environmental variables were also examined using the maximal information based nonparametric exploration mine algorithm minev2 jar v2 0 1 reshef et al 2011 mine calculates the strength of the relationship between each individual variable mic score in addition to descriptors of the relationship such as linearity and regression results were visualized with cytoscape v3 8 shannon et al 2003 in addition to the mfqpcr data tax4fun was used to predict the functional profile and capabilities of microbial communities based on 16s rrna datasets all complete genomes were obtained from the ncbi refseq database https www ncbi nlm nih gov refseq a functional profile was calculated for each single genome using uproc meinicke 2015 and the most recent kegg database kanehisa and goto 2000 rnammer lagesen et al 2007 was used to extract 16s rrna genes sequences from each genome functional profiles were normalised by the number of 16s rrna genes found in each genome by rnammer subsequently all unique bacterial sequences obtained in this study were aligned against the 16s rrna genes of the refseq genomes only hits with a minimum identity of at least 97 were considered for further calculation of functional profiles functional profiles of all genomes which were identified as close matches during blast alignment camacho et al 2009 were multiplied with the abundance of the respective unique sequences and afterwards combined and standardised this procedure was performed for each sample four 4 empty filter samples were used as control of the dna extraction but were removed prior statistical analysis wemheuer et al 2018 wemheuer et al 2020 3 results 3 1 detecting thresholds of community shifts community wet tests identified effluent concentrations that caused significant shifts in the riverine bacterial communities revealing a potential threshold of trophic change associated with wastewater pollution fig 1 b supplementary table 7 specifically bacterial communities differed along the gradient from high i e 50 and 90 to moderate i e 10 and low i e 0 control 0 1 and 1 effluent concentrations on nmds axis 1 fig 1 b nutrient concentrations i e tn tkn nh3 nox tp and bod were largely covariant with effluent concentrations fig 1 c supplementary tables 5 and 6 and showed strong positive correlation r2 0 6 with shifts in the bacterial communities fig 1 d the greatest change in bacterial community structure occurred above moderate 10 effluent concentrations signalling a potential transition from mesotrophic to eutrophic states fig 1 b in addition bacterial community shifts along the gradient of effluent concentrations were positively correlated with genes involved in nitrate reduction napa narg fig 1 e in contrast genes associated with denitrification nirs and sulfate reduction dsra and phsa were positively correlated with nmds axis 2 suggesting links to different effluent types rather than effluent concentration fig 1 e similar bacterial community change also occurred in response to real world effluent discharges fig 2 a supplementary table 8 we observed clear separation in the field sampled community structure among effluent types that were representative of 1 wwtp 3 10 wwtp 1 50 wwtp 4 and 90 wwtp 2 effluent concentrations in the community wet tests fig 2 b specifically tn nox and tkn were highly heterogeneous among sampling sites showing a consistent gradient from high i e wwtp 2 to moderate i e wwtp 1 and 4 and low i e wwtp 3 effluent concentrations during both sampling times supplementary table 2 despite some localised variability in tn and tkn nutrient concentrations notably nox generally increased downstream of the outfalls when compared to upstream background values fig 2 b 3 2 indicators of trophic shifts shifts in community dominance were observed in relation to effluent concentration in the community wet tests fig 3 burkholderiales betaproteobacteria was the most abundant bacterial order and represented more than 20 of sequences across all samples while frankiales actinobacteria was in the top 10 of abundant orders and accounted for approximately 3 of sequences in general abundances of burkholderiales increased with increasing effluent concentrations while the opposite was observed for frankiales these differences could be explained by two potential keystone taxa malikia spp the most abundant operational taxonomic unit otu otu1 7 5 across all samples 36 of otus belonging to burkholderiales and hgci clade 2 7 across all samples 98 of otus belonging to frankiales malikia spp were stimulated by moderate effluent concentrations 1 10 effluent concentrations and growth stabilised at higher concentrations 10 90 effluent concentrations indicating potential affinity with mesotrophic and eutrophic conditions fig 4 supplementary fig 5a in contrast hgci clade abundances were stable under oligotrophic conditions low effluent concentrations but were inhibited above 1 effluent concentration fig 4 supplementary fig 5b network analysis identified statistical links between malikia spp and hgci clade abundances of functional genes and environmental conditions in the community wet tests fig 5 a b malikia spp was strongly positively correlated with bod r 0 7 narg gene nitrate reduction r 0 5 as well as nutrient concentrations r 0 4 including tn and nox and weakly positively correlated with tkn r 0 3 and tn tp nutrient ratio r 0 2 in contrast the hgci clade had strong negative correlations with nutrient concentrations r 0 5 including tn tkn and nox mic 1 0 tn tp nutrient ratio r 0 4 narg and napa genes nitrate reduction r 0 4 and was weakly positively correlated with phod gene producing bioavailable phosphorus r 0 3 nirs gene denitrification r 0 2 and dsra gene sulfate reduction r 0 1 in addition malikia spp and hgci clade shared close associations with other less abundant genera of burkholderiales rhodobacterales pseudomonadales and sphingobacteriales providing some additional insight into potential interactions within the microbiome 3 3 shifts in functional diversity gene patterns from the community wet tests and field surveys showed that effluent discharges shifted functional diversity of bacterial communities with the direction of change i e stimulation or growth inhibition linked to effluent concentration and the trophic state of the receiving water to gain deeper insights into the functioning patterns of the potential keystone taxa genes involved in the nitrogen cycle were targeted the gene patterns associated with nitrogen reduction matched the response of malikia spp with stimulation of the species linked with higher effluent concentrations in the community wet tests fig 4 nitrate reduction genes narg napa were stimulated above 50 effluent concentrations in the community wet tests and tended to increase upon effluent discharge across the estuary during the microbial field surveys supplementary figs 6 and 7 this observation was supported by 16s based functional gene analysis using tax4fun where the putative abundance of the predominant nitrate reduction genes increased with increasing effluent concentrations including the three sub units of nitrate reductase ec 1 7 5 1 1 7 99 narg supplementary fig 8 in addition gene abundance of nitrite reductase nirs denitrification step 2 increased at 1 effluent concentrations and decreased at 50 effluent concentrations in the community wet tests supplementary fig 6 while field abundances of the nitrite reductase gene nirk showed some spatiotemporal variability there was evidence of stimulation at lower concentration effluents and inhibition at higher concentration effluents supplementary fig 7 a similar gene pattern for nitrite reductase ec 1 7 2 1 was predicted using tax4fun supplementary fig 8 to complete the denitrification 4 step pathway tax4fun predicted nitric oxide reductases ec 1 7 2 5 norbc denitrification step 3 increased with increasing effluent concentration while nitrous oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 4 nosz denitrification step 4 decreased despite higher putative abundances of these genes in 100 effluent samples supplementary fig 8 the gene patterns associated with nitrogen fixation matched the response of the hgci clade with inhibition of the species exposed to higher effluent concentrations in the community wet tests fig 4 nitrogen fixation genes nifd nifh tended to decrease downstream of effluent discharges during the microbial field surveys supplementary fig 7 tax4fun provided additional evidence to support these findings showing putative abundance of the nitrogenase iron protein nifh ec 1 18 6 1 increased up to 1 effluent concentrations and strongly decreased at and above 10 effluent concentrations supplementary fig 8 other nitrogen cycling genes including ammonia oxidising archaea aoa and bacteria aob and nitrate reduction gene nrfa dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra step 2 all increased at 1 effluent concentration and generally decreased at 50 effluent concentration in the community wet tests supplementary fig 6 tax4fun also predicted the activity of glutamate synthases e g ec 1 4 7 1 and ec 6 3 1 2 would be reduced and the putative abundance of several glutamate dehydrogenases e g ec 1 4 1 2 and ec 1 4 1 4 would be increased under higher effluent concentrations supplementary fig 8 4 discussion understanding microbial responses to gradients in complex real world environmental stressors such as wastewater pollution is crucial to identify community thresholds and potential tipping points of change and to protect ecosystem integrity this study used multiple lines of empirical evidence including a novel combination of community wet tests and repeated field surveys as well as 16s amplicon sequencing mfqpcr and functional gene analysis to link pressure stressor response relationships in riverine microbial communities to wastewater impacts it was found that wastewater effluents caused consistent shifts in bacterial community structure and function above moderate 10 effluent concentrations these thresholds of community shifts were also linked to changes in the trophic status of receiving waters in terms of nutrient concentrations crucially these moderate concentrations of tn 0 7 1 5 mg l and tp 0 03 0 08 mg l from wastewater effluent discharges can change microbiome composition and function in aquatic environments rice and westerhoff 2017 uncovered an alarming trend in the united states showing over 900 rivers receiving effluent discharges had effluent contributions of 50 of the total river flow in these high effluent discharge scenarios romero et al 2019 showed significant changes in sediment bacterial community structure where wwtp effluents account for 50 of the total river flow which is related to nutrient levels ranging 4 6 5 2 mg no3 l and are consistent with our 50 90 treatments in the community wet tests our study suggests riverine communities may be more sensitive than sediment communities along these effluent concentration gradients this study reveals that differences in the community responses along the effluent concentration gradient can be explained by core indicators of changes in trophic status and the functional consequences of wastewater pollution unearthing potentially globally relevant keystone bacterial taxa for freshwater aquatic environments species replacement occurred above moderate effluent concentrations with abundances of malikia spp burkholderiales increasing while abundances of hgci clade frankiales decreased potential impacts of these changes in core species dominance on microbiome composition and function were identified through network scores and co occurrence patterns the responses of malikia spp and hgci clade matched gene patterns associated with globally important nitrogen cycling pathways including denitrification and nitrogen fixation which linked these core individual taxa to environmental variables putative function and ecosystem processes rarely achieved in previous studies banerjee et al 2018 these findings were consistent with several recent field studies in heavily polluted rivers in china liu et al 2020 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 where coupling of community composition and function was detected and hgci clade and malikia spp were identified as major bacterial genera having central roles in the co occurrence networks of the freshwater aquatic ecosystems studied in the marine environment li et al 2020 showed that heterotrophic vibrio communities experienced a gradual change along with trophic state where the nitrogen source nh3 and nox was the main factor significantly influencing community structure in highly eutrophic conditions our work showed that most steps of the nitrogen cycle were activated upon effluent addition while high levels of nutrients particularly nox supplementary fig 9 in the effluents were driving community shifts and inhibited growth of specific bacterial taxa with potentially important community functions such as nitrification this may have implications for the removal of excess nitrogen in receiving waters a common problem downstream of effluent outfalls santos et al 2008 frankiales are associated with common nitrogen fixing oligotrophs found globally in freshwater ecosystems lipko 2020 sen et al 2014 and have previously been inferred as keystone taxa in plant associated microbiota banerjee et al 2018 and riverine communities liu et al 2020 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the community wet tests showed a growth inhibition response when exposed to moderate and high effluent concentrations with a modest stimulatory response up to 1 effluent concentrations in addition hgci clade was strongly negatively correlated to nox mic 1 0 and nitrogen reduction genes and was linked to putative functioning associated with nitrogen fixation a similar real world response of hgci clade showed that abundance decreased downstream of effluent outfalls the strongest decrease in hgci clade abundance was associated with effluents containing high tn concentrations and in particular those effluents comprised of high nox levels suggesting strong species sensitivity to nox toxicity frankiales were identified as the predominant bacterial order accounting for 12 4 of sequences across all samples in the microbial field surveys at a genus level hgci clade was predominant 12 1 across all estuary samples the hgci clade was identified as a potential new keystone taxa likely part of the core microbiome that is consistently present in oligotrophic aquatic ecosystems globally newton et al 2011 by contrast banerjee et al 2018 revealed that various members of burkholderiales are consistently present as keystone taxa across different ecosystems such as grasslands forest or woodlands agricultural lands arctic and antarctic ecosystems and aquatic ecosystems despite its common occurrence as keystone taxa across individual studies most discoveries of burkholderiales were based on computational inference with little or no empirical evidence and none had been linked to ecosystem processes banerjee et al 2018 within the burkholderiales there are two known species of malikia spp found in nature malikia granosa commonly found in activated sludge and malikia spinosa commonly found in river water spring et al 2005 previous studies kutvonen et al 2015 spring et al 2005 found malikia spp favoured nutrient rich conditions performed nitrate reduction and was capable of storing polyphosphate the latter being a putative function important in enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr used in some advanced wwtp stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 in this study no contrasting dynamics were visible between the relative abundances of the different sequence variants affiliated to malikia spp the relative abundances of malikia spp were similar across all effluent concentrations at the start of the community wet tests supplementary fig 1a and showed relative increases or decreases over time indicating that it was not the introduction of effluent driving the observed sequence patterns malikia spp was the dominant taxa across the gradient of effluent concentrations in the community wet tests showing a consistently strong stimulation response above moderate effluent concentrations with modest sensitivity to phosphorus availability and nox toxicity malikia spp were evidently strictly aerobic denitrifiers with strong positive correlations to bod nox and nitrogen reduction genes in the community wet tests in this study malikia spp predicted community shifts associated with changes in trophic status and captured real world denitrification dynamics consequently malikia spp are relevant global freshwater indicator species for human impacted aquatic environments and eutrophic conditions further field and laboratory investigations and detailed analysis berry and widder 2014 are required to confirm the role of malikia spp as a potential keystone species in aquatic ecosystems impacted by wastewater effluent discharges 5 conclusion the thresholds of community shifts revealed here serve to highlight the urgent concern and need for the improved management of aquatic environments receiving wastewater pollution we have highlighted that aquatic microbiomes are highly sensitive to wastewater effluents above moderate 10 concentrations and revealed that core individual species can serve as sentinels of changes to trophic state which can be applied to monitoring wastewater impacts this study has implications for wastewater managers seeking to understand the consequences of effluent discharges for important ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling we anticipate these findings can inform global efforts for integrated catchment planning and management

16913,one of the major challenges in existing wastewater treatment plants wwtps is to comply with the increasingly stringent nutrient discharge limits established by the competent authorities to enhance environmental protection while keeping operation costs as low as possible this paper describes the results obtained from upgrading a full scale wwtp during seven years 2013 2020 applying five different advanced process control apc strategies results show that implementation of apc and the development of ammonia based aeration control aeration non aeration cycles improved internal external recirculation and chemical dosage controls resulted in an improvement in nutrients removal rates 25 48 and 9 25 for nitrogen and phosphorus respectively and in a reduction 21 79 of the specific energy ratio in addition the promotion of an enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr process by apc resulted in an improvement in biological phosphorous removal 43 90 chemical savings 20 00 and nutrient recovery in the dewatered sludge molecular biology tools and laboratory batch tests confirmed the polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos activity specifically tetrasphaera genera finally an

waste activated sludge wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction recent advances in wastewater treatment are focused on the development of new high efficient processes and technologies to achieve the necessary degree of nutrients removal nur nitrogen and phosphorous set by regulations examples of these include nitritation anammox baeten et al 2019 morales et al 2016 pedrouso et al 2018 membrane aerated biofilm reactors castrillo et al 2019 aerobic granular sludge thwaites et al 2018 and phosphorous recovery lizarralde et al 2019 yuan et al 2012 nevertheless wide implementation of these processes and novel technologies are still limited especially in countries where the existing waste water treatment plants wwtps are still providing satisfactory services and the cost associated with their replacement or upgrading is not affordable soares 2020 however many full scale existing wwtps still need to be adapted in order to achieve the stringent regulatory outflow requirements in addition wwtps must reconcile two partially conflicting objectives pollution abatement and energy conservation bernardelli et al 2020 monitoring and advanced process control apc concepts are cost saving alternatives to the extension or revamping of existing wwtps rieger et al 2012 zhu et al 2017 varhely et al 2019 in addition several operational strategies based on the allocation of the inflow organic matter to the anoxic zones for denitrification and to the anaerobic zones for phosphate release have been developed as an efficient way to enhance biological nur martín de la vega et al 2013 solon et al 2017 besides the implementation of controls for regulating alternated aeration non aeration a n a cycles are an alternative for increasing denitrification dn rates but also promoting enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr processes ostace et al 2013 yadav et al 2016 a n a strategies for a flexible control of nitrification and denitrification ndn processes have been widely present in small sized wwtps sánchez et al 2018 santos et al 2020 song et al 2020 regarding larger wwtps 100 000 pe the greater manpower and technical equipment allow the implementation of more complex and adapted apcs but as complexity increases more tools are required to provide the level and quality of control azhar and ali 2014 cortés et al 2000 the combination of conventional control with knowledge based models neuronal networks or fuzzy logic tools can bring significant results in improvements of process control and reliability vanrolleguhem et al 2003 santín et al 2017 vilanova et al 2017 bernardelli et al 2020 this paper presents the results of a full scale wwtp upgrading by the implementation and development of five phases of apc during a period ranging from 2013 to 2020 outflow quality reactor performance waste generation reagents consumption and energy ratios were monitored analysed and compared to highlight the benefits of apc implementation over nur and process efficiency in addition microbial community analysis and laboratory batch tests were conducted to assess the effect of tested strategies at the microbial level finally an economic analysis a summary of the obtained experiences conclusions as well as remaining challenges are presented 2 material methods 2 1 wwtp description the studied municipal wwtp is located in lleida north east of spain utm 489 853 m e 4 694 716 m n the wwtp became operational in 1994 and the water line initially designed only for solids and organic matter removal was upgraded 2009 2010 to conduct nur process based in a bardenpho anoxic oxic anoxic an ox an configuration to summarize expanded wwtp water line is composed by three pre treatment units for screening and grit oil removal 485 m3 three primary settlers 4 350 m3 six activated sludge reactors 20 400 m3 and four secondary settlers 12 000 m3 other wwtp equipment was also upgraded impacting global wwtp efficiency and included 1 ceramic diffusers in reactors were substituted by membrane diffusers pik300 sulzer 2 screw compressors for aeration were substituted by six magnetic bearing blowers zb100 400 atlas copco 3 original archimedes screws for external recirculation er were replaced by increased capacity efficiency submerged centrifugal pumps 30 kw sulzer and 4 four new submerged centrifugal pumps 18 5 kw sulzer were included for internal recirculation ir nevertheless the performed wwtp modifications did not consider anaerobic selectors for biological phosphorous removal therefore a chemical phosphorous removal facility based on ferric salt fecl3 addition was built as well wwtp sludge line was not modified and the thickened primary and secondary sludge continues being digested in two mesophilic anaerobic reactors 4 960 m3 for biogas generation the digested sludge is dewatered using two centrifuges pieralisi jumbo2 37 kw while the reject water and other plant drainages are sent back to the inlet of the wwtp the current treatment capacity of the wwtp is 160 000 pe an actual 2020 schematic representation of the wwtp water line is depicted in fig 1 the wwtp discharge limits set forth by regional authority aca government of catalonia water agency since 2011 are total suspended solids tss 35 mg l 1 biochemical oxygen demand bod5 25 mg l 1 chemical oxygen demand cod 125 mg l 1 total nitrogen tn 15 mg l 1 and total phosphorous tp 1 mg l 1 it is worth noting that at the end of 2019 the wwtp operators reduced the tn limit to 10 mg l 1 to adapt the system to new discharge limits to be established in 2020 20 07 2020 2 2 process control instrumentation and apc description five control strategies have been implemented in the wwtp during the period 2013 2020 table 1 summarizes operation and control strategies tested in the wwtp to assess their effectiveness the wwtp data was divided into six equal operational periods p0 to p5 with a duration of 12 months each to include seasonal variations in wastewater properties and flowrates during the reference period p0 in table 1 there was no apc implemented and nur was achieved based on manual process modifications performed by wwtp operators according to the ammonia values monitored by the wwtp outflow analyser amtaxsc hach operators decided the value of do requirements in oxic zones between 0 5 and 2 0 mg l 1 in order to maintain these values at the desired concentration measured by luminescence sensors ldosc hach operators modified the blowers pressure set point psp or the overture of reactor s aeration valves manually the internal qir and external qer recirculation flows were manually modified by pumps frequency inverters to maintain recirculation ratios qir qwwtp and qer qwwtp close to 1 in addition the activation of fecl3 dosing pumps was performed according to the outflow phosphate analyser values phosphaxsc hach to maintain tp 1 mgtp l 1 table 1 during summer 2014 the wwtp was equipped with new cod uvasplus sc hach tss solitaxsc hach and nitrate no3 n nitrataxsc hach sensors finally a combined tss cod bod and nh4 n sensor carbo lyser and ammo lyser scan were installed at the wwtp inflow in addition nineteen energy meters iem3250 schneider and an energy monitoring platform power logic egx300 schneider were installed after an intense analytical effort a biowin envirosim hamilton model based on asm2 iwa was calibrated and ibm research lab hayfa israel developed the first apc system liquid gold ibm based on that model with the objective of optimizing energy consumption while maintaining outflow quality apcp1 can be considered as a semi continuous system because it receives on line sensors analysers data and produces process recommendations ouputs every 2 h which are to be implemented by plant operators manually as described in p0 the apcp1 control variables were global dissolved oxygen do waste activated sludge was purge qpr and internal recirculation flowrate qir as described in table 1 and graphically in fig 2 an effort to automatize wwtp was conducted during 10 2015 04 2016 period between p1 and p2 a period without apc according table 1 blowers aeration valves internal and external recirculation pumps were connected to new wwtp plc s allowing external analog inputs from future apc systems new ammonia sensors aisesc hach were installed in reactor inflows and at each secondary reactor r2a to r2d fig 1 the energy meters network was increased up to twenty seven energy meters a complete description of wwtp sensors probes and analysers is depicted in table 1s supplementary material these improvements allowed the possibility to start working in may 2016 with the new apcp2 system nutrien sica rasi tools sisltech with the main objective of improving the nur rates phase p2 according to table 1 to summarize the values of nh4 n sensors for each secondary reactor r2a r2b r2c and r2d fig 1 generated individual reactors dynamic dosps to control nitrification which were achieved automatically by blowers and aeration valves according to apcp2 outputs table 1 and fig 3 a it means that the measured nh4 n values at the end of each aerated zone are used by apcp2 to keep the desired ammonia set point nh4 nsp feed back control and to compute the reference value for requested do fig 3a in addition the instantaneous and calculated 24 h average value of nh4 n if under established limits for each secondary reactor r2a to r2d also allowed performing dn cycles by closing valves or reducing blowers frequency inverters during a defined period of time tdn according to fig 3a internal recirculation flows qir modified by apcp2 outputs over frequency inverters of ir pumps for each secondary reactor r2a to r2d were also regulated by instantaneous and 24 h average no3 n

in may 2017 new mass air flow meters t mass 65i b150 endress hausser and aeration valves knife type with triangular profile v g exemd04 pentag hiest orbinox were installed to improve apcp2 regulation response in addition the energy meter network was increased to thirty units after these the apcp2 system was migrated in phase p3 to creapro platform createch360 becoming the apcp3 system apcp3 included an evolution of previously apcp2 described control modules for ndn valves blowers and internal recirculation n control mov control ir control tools createch360 but also included a n a cycles or a n a timing ta n a in primary reactors r1a and r1b fig 1 in order to promote ebpr activity fig 3b external recirculation flow control qer modified by apcp3 outputs over frequency inverters of er pumps or return activated sludge control er control was included in apcp3 based on the ras ratio qer qwwtp set point table 1 and fig 3b in addition a real time control rtc system for tp removal rtc p hach was installed table 1 rtc p system controls fecl3 dosage qdfe based on the continuously measured po4 p outflow concentration values phosphax hach and the wastewater flow rate qwwtp considering the biological phosphorous uptake and calculating the minimum amount of precipitant required ensuring the accomplishment of the tp outflow limit fig 3b in october 2018 phase p4 table 1 the apcp3 or creapro system was modified becoming apcp4 to push ebpr by favouring increased anoxic anaerobic zones in r1a and r1b reactors increasing ta n a limits table 1 the rtc p system was also replaced by a new specific designed tool p control that also considered the oxidation state of each secondary reactor r2a to r2d to modify fecl3 dosage qdfe according to fig 4 a in summary the new p control considered also the operation stage ndnstage and the no3 n concentrations of each secondary reactor in order to select which reactors r2a to r2d were the highest contributors in tp release and manage the individual distribution of fecl3 dosage ri dfe more accurately fig 5 phase p5 table 1 wwtp capacity was tested for the achievement of future outflow requirements tn 10 mg l 1 improved external

with ultrasonic proves sonataxsc hach to increase reduce ras ratios qer qwwtp furthermore er control included continuous estimation and monitoring of sludge retention time srt to ensure the necessary concentration of biomass in reactors according to new outflow requirements finally from the experience acquired in a an a cycles in primary reactors at the end of p5 sep 2020 a new control tool flushing control based on fuzzy logic was developed to couple ndn and ebpr optimization fig 1s supplementary material fig 2s supplementary material present a schematic representation of the architecture of last applied apc system in wwtp or apcp5 2 3 microbial analysis dna extraction was performed using the standard protocol for fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa with the following exceptions 500 µl of sample 480 µl sodium phosphate buffer and 120 µl mt buffer were added to a lysing matrix e tube bead beating was performed at 6 m s for 4 40 s albertsen et al 2015 gel

hs br assay kit thermo fisher scientific usa bacteria 16s v1 3 rrna gene sequencing libraries were prepared by a custom protocol based on caporaso et al 2012 more details can be found in supplementary material 2 4 laboratory batch tests biological phosphorous removal activity was evaluated using a modified phosphorous release and uptake batch test according to tykesson and jansen 2005 and feng et al 2020 two liter bottles with continuous mixing magnetic stirrer were used as batch reactors for the tests the wwtp sludge samples 1 93 mg tss l 1 were pre aerated for 12 h to ensure depletion of any biodegradable cod two carbon sources were considered in order to determine the maximum phosphorus release and uptake rates using i acetate 200 mg ch3coona l 1 as easily degradable carbon source and ii clarified wwtp inflow 150 mg cod l 1 as complex carbon source acetate or wastewater 750 ml were added to the sludge sample 750 ml after flushing the bottles media with nitrogen gas n2 in order to ensure anaerobic conditions additionally an allylthiourea atu wtw solution 10 mg l 1 was added to each vial to suppress nitrification after 2 5 h of anaerobic conditions the aerobic period was activated by aeration air flushing for a period of 3 0 h reactor samples of 10 ml were taken at regular intervals 30 min during all batch tests tp no3 n nh4 n and cod were analysed after sample filtration while ph orp and do were directly measured in batch reactors as further described in analytical methods section all batch tests were performed in duplicate 2 5 analytical methods tss concentrations were measured according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 2540 g apha 2005 cod tp and tn were measured after sample digestion lt200 hach and vis rfid spectrophotometry dr3900 hach using commercial kits lck hach according to table 2 s supplementary material ammonium nh4 n nitrate no3 n and nitrite no2 n were directly measured with previous described vis rfid spectrophotometer and commercial kits table 2s supplementary material finally respirometer caps oxitop system vwr were used for bod determination stoichiometry and equations for chemical and biological tp removal estimation are shown in detail in supplementary materials for laboratory batch test do ph and oxidation reduction potential orp measurements were performed using a field luminescent optical do sensor ldo10 hach ph electrode phc725 hach and orp probe mtc101 hach respectively coupled to a portable multi meter display controller hq40d hach for dewatered sludge samples 4 samples y 1 tp total carbon tc and tn were externally analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes and elemental analysis respectively eurofins iproma 3 results discussion 3 1 process performance table 2 summarizes the major properties of the wwtp inflow outflow reactors performance waste generation chemicals consumption and energy ratios for all studied periods p0 to p5 the relatively high standard deviation for some of the inflow parameters is due to seasonal variations in the wwtp inflow fig 3s in supplementary material while deviation or outliers in outflow values of ts and tn or tp are due to specific severe episodes of filamentous bulking fig 4s in supplementary material the main objective of phase p0 table 1 was the compliance of outflow requirements for nutrient discharge limits tn 15 mg l 1 and tp 1 mg l 1 although p0 mean value for tnout and tpout met the requirements 12 84 5 85 mgtn l 1 and 0 78 0 12 mgtp l 1 respectively table 2 the high deviation obtained indicates that with manual control or no apc it was not always possible to achieve the discharge limits as it is shown in fig 4s however the global energy ratio of the wwtp 0 23 kwhwwtp m 3 table 2 was in the low range when compared with literature 0 18 0 47 kwh m 3 yang et al 2020 which indicates that initial wwtp energy ratio was quite low despite the manual control specific aeration a and nur energy ratios during p0 were estimated as the entire energy meter network was not yet functional at 4 72 kwha kg 1 tnremoved and 6 57 kwhnur kg 1 tnremoved respectively table 2 the output or controlled variables of the semi continuous apc tool tested in p1 apcp1 were do ir and pr as explained in material methods section table 1 and fig 2 apcp1 system promoted an increase on the sludge purge pr that reduced biomass content in reactors tss reduction of 7 29 affecting the final dewatered sludge production 13 27 kgts dws m 3 as shown in table 2 the promoted reduction in global do tss and specially in internal recirculation ratio 20 72 resulted in a reduction of global wwtp energy requirements equal to 4 76 kwhwwtp m 3 equivalent to a 6 46 kwhnur kg 1 tnremoved or to a 14 40 kwha kg 1 tnremoved respectively as presented in table 2 this reduction objective of p2 table 1 did not affect the outflow quality which was improved with mean and deviation values for tnout of 9 80 2 31 mgtn l 1 table 2 and fig 4s different studies have shown the positive effects of apc systems using a model based approach like apcp1 luca et al 2019 zhu et al 2017 guerrero et al 2011 reported an improvement achieved by an apc system using a model based asm2d iwa optimization for an anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o pilot wwtp resulting in an estimated decrease of opex of around 45 new apc system was tested in p2 apcp2 the main objective of apcp2 was to improve nur rates table 1 in this phase each secondary reactor r2a to r2d fig 1 operated with its own established limits nh4 n and no3 n as explained in material and methods section fig 3a tnremoval rate was increased up to a 67 81 25 39 compared to p0 and the tnout mean values further decreased 8 57 2 15 mgtn l 1 according table 2 these results indicate the stability and robustness of the tested apcp2 system improving nur rates and slightly decreasing the global energy ratio 0 23 kwhwwtp m 3 as compared to the reference period p0 table 2 several studies report different advantages of ndn cycles compared to the performance of conventional activated sludge reactors lee et al 2015 demonstrated that reducing the aeration period in an anaerobic buffer intermittently aerated and oxic system aba2 or the adjustment of volume ratio between aerobic and anoxic tanks in an a2 o system clearly resulted in energy savings in the same way kim et al 2014 showed that an aba2 system modified with ndn cycles could result in good performance removing cod tn and tp as well as in energy saving moreover han et al 2018 reported that tn removal efficiencies of pulse aerated reactors were significantly higher than constantly aerated ones this same conclusion was reached in the current apcp2 tested system as apcp2 did not improve tp removal phase p3 aimed at the promotion of ebpr the introduction of a n a cycles in facultative and oxic phases zones of primary reactors r1a and r1b fig 1 during apcp3 table 1 and fig 3b was able to increase anaerobic periods conditions tests with orp probe showed that it was possible to obtain 250 mv values with a n a cycles of 60 min in primary reactors the fact that lower tpout values in p3 0 59 0 17 mgtp l 1 table 2 were achieved without increasing chemical consumption 1 48 0 41 vs 1 58 0 54 kgfe kg 1 tpremoved in p3 and p2 respectively table 2 indicates possible ebpr activity promoted in p3 the estimation of a 21 of biological tpremoval table 2 by tp and chemical fecl3 mass balance see supplementary material did not initially show this improvement with respect to p0 this is the reason why at the end of phase p3 05 03 2018 a reactor sample was collected and processed using illumina dye sequencing as described in material and methods section sequencing results will be discussed in the next section the apcp3 system was also pushed to maximize energy efficiency during p3 by increasing control tn limits as nh4 n and no3 n limits were relaxed higher values of tnout were obtained 10 28 1 80 mgtn l 1 but lower than tn discharge limit still stablished in 15 mgtn l 1 and consequently lower tn removal rates achieved 58 92 07 12 according table 2 nevertheless this configuration had a clear effect on global energy ratio obtaining the lowest reported values of all periods 0 22 kwhwwtp m 3 table 2 fig 5s supplementary material shows the energy ratios for all periods or tested apc systems in fact in august 2017 the lowest monthly global energy ratio was achieved 0 16 kwhwwtp m 3 fig 5s in the same way várhelyi et al 2019 showed that ammonia based aeration and recirculation controls could reduce up to 45 and 37 the aeration and recirculation energy requirements respectively in phase p4 the apcp3 system was modified apcp4 to improve ebpr activity table 1 a n a cycles in primary reactors were optimized and a new apc module for tp removal control p control fig 4a was tested as explained before the dosing of fecl3 was prioritized with this p control tool depending on the oxidation reduction state or n dn cycle in each reactor fig 5 the most relevant result regarding the change from apcp3 to apcp4 was the increase in tp biological removal up to 41 38 an improvement of a 97 05 regarding p3 table 2 this increase in the biological tp removal joint to optimization of fecl3 dosage control was related as expected to a significant reduction in chemical use decreasing its ratio from 1 48 0 41 to 1 17 0 44 kgfe kg 1 tpremoved equivalent to a reduction of 25 68 from p3 to p4 respectively according to table 2 these results indicate that with the new apcp4 system no3 n was quickly removed and anaerobic conditions were reached in primary reactors improving the ebpr activity although results show that simultaneous nur can be achieved using a n a cycles the internal recirculation and the control over no3 n concentration played an important role in improving the ebpr system being internal recirculation the driving force fig 6 s in supplementary material finally wwtp capacity to accomplish with future discharge limits tn 10 mg l 1 was evaluated with the last tested apc system apcp5 apcp5 control is summarized in fig 4b fig 7 s supplementary material shows an example of a 24 h secondary reactor performance r2b as example with apcp5 system as tnremoval was increased by apcp5 the specific aeration energy ratio was reduced to a minimum of 3 67 1 01 kwha kg 1 tnremoved affecting global wwtp energy consumption table 2 figure 8s supplementary material shows the global wwtp energy distribution per process during p5 data was obtained with the complete 35 ud wwtp energy meters network as expected aeration is the most energy intensive process 32 06 according to figure 8s during p5 the improved external recirculation control tool er control table 1 and fig 4b also increased the srt necessary to achieve nur and outflow requirements furthermore during p5 biological ebpr activity showed continuous improvement reducing fecl3 doses down to 1 04 0 36 kgfe kg 1 tpremoved table 2 considering only the last six months of p5 biological tpremoval accounted for 51 33 of the tp removed fig 6s as explained in material and methods section at the end of p5 new a a n control tool for primary reactors flushing control was developed from the acquired experience although its effect is not considered in present results with the objective to couple control over ndn and ebpr processes fig 1s other interesting batch results outcomes of the tested apcs systems related to fecl3 consumption was the quality of produced sewage sludge table 3 shows the major characteristics of dewatering digested sludge obtained in the wwtp results show that the dewatered sludge obtained along the different phases p0 to p5 present a significant decrease in fe tp ratio which represents a 27 27 reduction in the fe content table 3 this reduction in fe content could increase the tp availability in dewatered sludge increasing its value as soil fertilizer krogstad et al 2005 kidd et al 2007 daneshgar et al 2018 wilfert et al 2015 at the end of period p5 13 10 2020 a new sample from wwtp reactors was collected and processed by illumina dye sequencing in addition a biological phosphorous removal activity test was performed as explained in material and methods section sequencing and batch test results will be discussed in next section 3 2 microbial population and batch tests the 30 most abundant genera found in the two samples collected for microbial analysis in march 2018 and october 2020 corresponding to p3 and p5 respectively are listed in table 3s supplementary material ca microthrix also known as filamentous bacteria was the most predominant genera found in the sample from p3 6 73 table 3s filamentous bacteria are normal components of wwtp biomass and can have beneficial effects on floc formation however their proliferation can also lead to operational problems with bulking or foaming as ssout and consequently tnout tpout leak episodes reported in fig 3s its relative abundance decreased up to 1 9 in p5 sample table 3s fig 6 shows the relative abundance of genera belonging to the functional groups associated with nitrification and ebpr nitrosomonas a well known ammonium oxidizer was the main genera present in both samples with a similar abundance 0 55 and 0 40 in the samples of p3 and p5 respectively fig 6 nitrotoga and nitrospira described as nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were found in similar abundances in the sample collected in p3 however nitrotoga was not detected in the sample from p5 while nitrospira substantially increased as compared to its abundance from sample taken in p3 fig 6 the driving forces for the dominance of one species of nob are not fully understood but temperature 12 9 c and 16 5 c for p3 and p5 samples respectively could be a potential factor with nitrotoga being able to grow at lower temperatures wegen et al 2019 the main differences between p3 and p5 is the promotion of intensive a n a cycles in primary reactors by apcp4 and apcp5 this change in reactors operation also promotes a decrease in the internal recirculation flow and no3 n concentration see fig 6s the observed reduction in the internal recirculation and no3 n concentration could have reduced not only the dn activity in the an zones but also increased the availability of a carbon source for pao development regarding pao organisms fig 6 the sample collected in p3 presented a more diverse community of known and putative paos kong et al 2005 nguyen et al 2011 with tetrasphaera being the dominant genera with a relative abundance of 4 0 followed by dechloromonas 1 9 and accumulibacter 0 76 in the sample obtained in p5 there is an increase in the relative abundance of tetrasphaera 6 7 but all the other paos were not detected fig 6 p5 sample also presents a decrease in the overall putative glycogen accumulating organisms gaos which compete with paos for carbon sources but do not accumulate phosphorus fig 6 this gaos reduction is not explained by seasonal temperature differences in which the samples were collected previously reported since at low temperatures paos have growth rates higher than gaos lópez vázquez et al 2009 moreover recent studies have shown that low do concentrations are effective for ebpr promotion by providing an advantage to paos over gaos while high aerobic hrts show a decline in pao population and an increase in gaos activity izadi et al 2020 most of the ebpr knowledge has been obtained from microbial communities enriched in the laboratory with synthetic substrates being the ebpr community very different from that present in reactors operating with real wastewater coats et al 2017 several studies in full scale plants have shown that genus tetrasphaera is as important as candidatus accumulibacter for biological p removal members of tetrasphaera are known to be more versatile in carbon source uptake and capable of utilizing glucose and amino acids izadi et al 2020 oehmen et al 2007 moreover it has been reported that newly discovered pao organisms dechloromonas spp are actively involved in p removal in full scale wwtps and they should be regarded as important paos along with candidatus accumulibacter and tetrasphaera petriglieri et al 2020 the conventional understanding is that p removal in ebpr is performed by putative paos that anaerobically consume vfas and subsequently store it as pha however recent advances in knowledge of common putative paos metabolism and ebpr ecology has questioned the complete understanding on ebpr microbiology nielsen et al 2019 to complement the microbial analysis and validate ebpr activity batch tests were performed as described in material and methods section with the sample obtained in p5 13 10 2020 fig 7 shows the phosphorous release and uptake rates obtained in the batch activity assays while figure 9s supplementary material shows the other measured parameters batch assays show a clear pao phenotype a phosphorus release and uptake rates of 2 11 and 3 50 mgtp g 1 vss h 1 were obtained respectively in the assay using acetate fig 7 gu et al 2008 reported phosphorus release and uptake rates ranging in wwtp samples ranging from 5 6 31 9 to 2 4 9 7 mgtp g 1 vss h 1 respectively moreover feng et al 2020 reported a phosphorus release rate ranging from 2 3 to 10 8 mgtp g 1 tss h 1 and tykesson et al 2002 reported a phosphorus release rate of 6 9 mgtp g 1 tss h 1 although the rates obtained in the present study are below the reported literature values it is important to mention that monitored wwtp does not include anaerobic selectors and wastewater has a limited amount of available carbon for paos activity lower phosphorus release and uptake rates when wastewater was used in batch assays compared with acetate according to fig 7 it has been reported that paos population could represent up to a 40 of active organisms in ebpr systems lópez vázquez et al 2008 while in the present study pao population fraction reached only 6 7 fig 6 3 3 economic analysis from an economic standpoint it is challenging to determine the profitability of the present tested apc systems several factors such as performance through seven years of operation seasonal changes in wastewater properties impact of temperature on microorganism activity changes on discharge limits variations in energy and chemicals costs or the uncertainty in estimating the effect cost associated with some investments such as replacing equipment like pumps membranes valves etc limit a complete economic analysis despite these facts an economic assessment was conducted considering the costs associated with the investments performed in tested apc systems or capital expenses capex and estimating the benefits or operational expenses opex with the obtained wwtp yields from p0 reference period to p5 optimized period as shown in table 4 in addition apc system and sensors annual maintenance costs were also considered to make p0 and p5 comparable the same annual treatment flowrate inflow characteristics tnin and tpin and discharge limits tnout and tpout were considered table 4 despite the high cumulative capex over the seven years of operation 269 226 a positive opex or savings was obtained with the implemented apc systems 51 229 y 1 resulting in a rate of return of capex of 5 26 y table 4 which is economically feasible for a large scale wwtp the economic analysis at this stage did not take into consideration the inclusion of the wwtp energy monitoring platform in the apc tools with real time energy cost estimation which allowed for the inclusion of an electric energy cost strategy table 1 which boosted energy intensive processes such as aeration figure 8s during low energy cost periods which affected the global wwtpopex furthermore other factors such as impact on biogas production waste generation sludge dewatering properties or other potential benefits over global wwtp ratios were not considered 3 4 apc experience learned lessons and new challenges this study shows the implementation of different apc systems during 7 years in a full scale wwtp obtaining several positive practical implications learned lessons and remaining challenges i the main benefit of implementing an apc system is the accomplishment of a continuous process control and the achievement of established discharge limits regardless of inflow or seasonal variations present results show the stability and robustness of the tested apc systems ii results presented in this study show that ammonia based aeration and integration of ndn and a n a cycles tools in wwtp primary and secondary reactors respectively could improve tnremoval yields with a decrease in opex which is a feasible option to adapt wwtps to new discharge limits and optimize energy consumption iii results confirm that it is possible to promote ebpr processes in a wwtp without anaerobic selectors being the control of internal recirculation and a n a cycles by means of an apc system and opportunity to revamp or adapt wwtps to new requirements iv according to the economic analysis and reported data the promotion of ebpr also results in a reduction in chemical consumption and a significant reduction in fe used this fact not only improves the quality of wwtp outflow but also the value of dewatered sludge properties tp availability as soil fertilizer i nevertheless the implementation of a robust apc system requires a high number of sensors analysers actuators and software that require adequate staff training and frequent maintenance specifically sensors required an intensive frequent and costly maintenance cleaning verification and calibration indispensable in order to ensure the proper functioning of apc systems errors in sensor measurements can create significant problems related to achievement of discharge limits chemical overdoses and low energy yields in this regard the deployment of soft sensors technologies can improve sensors predictive maintenance or decision support tools increasing the reliability of apc systems ii with regards to ebpr promotion and microbial analysis more research and sampling to fully understand the ebpr microbiology in full scale wwtp is necessary and it could result in the development of new optimization strategies 4 conclusions implementation of new apc systems along 7 years of wwtp operation including operation strategies or control tools of ammonia based aeration ndn or a n a cycles and improved internal or external recirculation control resulted in an improvement on wwtp nutrient removal rates 25 48 tn and 9 25 tp removal respectively and also on specific energy ratios 21 79 kwhnur kg 1 tnremoved or 22 33 kwha kg 1 tnremoved the promotion by tested apc systems of ebpr process improved the biological tp removal rates up to a 42 12 which represent an estimated reduction in chemical consumption of 20 00 kgfe

16913,one of the major challenges in existing wastewater treatment plants wwtps is to comply with the increasingly stringent nutrient discharge limits established by the competent authorities to enhance environmental protection while keeping operation costs as low as possible this paper describes the results obtained from upgrading a full scale wwtp during seven years 2013 2020 applying five different advanced process control apc strategies results show that implementation of apc and the development of ammonia based aeration control aeration non aeration cycles improved internal external recirculation and chemical dosage controls resulted in an improvement in nutrients removal rates 25 48 and 9 25 for nitrogen and phosphorus respectively and in a reduction 21 79 of the specific energy

waste activated sludge wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction recent advances in wastewater treatment are focused on the development of new high efficient processes and technologies to achieve the necessary degree of nutrients removal nur nitrogen and phosphorous set by regulations examples of these include nitritation anammox baeten et al 2019 morales et al 2016 pedrouso et al 2018 membrane aerated biofilm reactors castrillo et al 2019 aerobic granular sludge thwaites et al 2018 and phosphorous recovery lizarralde et al 2019 yuan et al 2012 nevertheless wide implementation of these processes and novel technologies are still limited especially in countries where the existing waste water treatment plants wwtps are still providing satisfactory services and the cost associated with their replacement or upgrading is not affordable soares 2020 however many full scale existing wwtps still need to be adapted in order to achieve the stringent regulatory outflow requirements in addition wwtps must reconcile two partially conflicting objectives pollution abatement and energy conservation bernardelli et al 2020 monitoring and advanced process control apc concepts are cost saving alternatives to the extension or revamping of existing wwtps rieger et al 2012 zhu et al 2017 varhely et al 2019 in addition several operational strategies based on the allocation of the inflow organic matter to the anoxic zones for denitrification and to the anaerobic zones for phosphate release have been developed as an efficient way to enhance biological nur martín de la vega et al 2013 solon et al 2017 besides the implementation of controls for regulating alternated aeration non aeration a n a cycles are an alternative for increasing denitrification dn rates but also promoting enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr processes ostace et al 2013 yadav et al 2016 a n a strategies for a flexible control of nitrification and denitrification ndn processes have been widely present in small sized wwtps sánchez et al 2018 santos et al 2020 song et al 2020 regarding larger wwtps 100 000 pe the greater manpower and technical equipment allow the implementation of more complex and adapted apcs but as complexity increases more tools are required to provide the level and quality of control azhar and ali 2014 cortés et al 2000 the combination of conventional control with knowledge based models neuronal networks or fuzzy logic tools can bring significant results in improvements of process control and reliability vanrolleguhem et al 2003 santín et al 2017 vilanova et al 2017 bernardelli et al 2020 this paper presents the results of a full scale wwtp upgrading by the implementation and development of five phases of apc during a period ranging from 2013 to 2020 outflow quality reactor performance waste generation reagents consumption and energy ratios were monitored analysed and compared to highlight the benefits of apc implementation over nur and process efficiency in addition microbial community analysis and laboratory batch tests were conducted to assess the effect of tested strategies at the microbial level finally an economic analysis a summary of the obtained experiences conclusions as well as remaining challenges are presented 2 material methods 2 1 wwtp description the studied municipal wwtp is located in lleida north east of spain utm 489 853 m e 4 694 716 m n the wwtp became operational in 1994 and the water line initially designed only for solids and organic matter removal was upgraded 2009 2010 to conduct nur process based in a bardenpho anoxic oxic anoxic an ox an configuration to summarize expanded wwtp water line is composed by three pre treatment units for screening and grit oil removal 485 m3 three primary settlers 4 350 m3 six activated sludge reactors 20 400 m3 and four secondary settlers 12 000 m3 other wwtp equipment was also upgraded impacting global wwtp efficiency and included 1 ceramic diffusers in reactors were substituted by membrane diffusers pik300 sulzer 2 screw compressors for aeration were substituted by six magnetic bearing blowers zb100 400 atlas copco 3 original archimedes screws for external recirculation er were replaced by increased capacity efficiency submerged centrifugal pumps 30 kw sulzer and 4 four new submerged centrifugal pumps 18 5 kw sulzer were included for internal recirculation ir nevertheless the performed wwtp modifications did not consider anaerobic selectors for biological phosphorous removal therefore a chemical phosphorous removal facility based on ferric salt fecl3 addition was built as well wwtp sludge line was not modified and the thickened primary and secondary sludge continues being digested in two mesophilic anaerobic reactors 4 960 m3 for biogas generation the digested sludge is dewatered using two centrifuges pieralisi jumbo2 37 kw while the reject water and other plant drainages are sent back to the inlet of the wwtp the current treatment capacity of the wwtp is 160 000 pe an actual 2020 schematic representation of the wwtp water line is depicted in fig 1 the wwtp discharge limits set forth by regional authority aca government of catalonia water agency since 2011 are total suspended solids tss 35 mg l 1 biochemical oxygen demand bod5 25 mg l 1 chemical oxygen demand cod 125 mg l 1 total nitrogen tn 15 mg l 1 and total phosphorous tp 1 mg l 1 it is worth noting that at the end of 2019 the wwtp operators reduced the tn limit to 10 mg l 1 to adapt the system to new discharge limits to be established in 2020 20 07 2020 2 2 process control instrumentation and apc description five control strategies have been implemented in the wwtp during the period 2013 2020 table 1 summarizes operation and control strategies tested in the wwtp to assess their effectiveness the wwtp data was divided into six equal operational periods p0 to p5 with a duration of 12 months each to include seasonal variations in wastewater properties and flowrates during the reference period p0 in table 1 there was no apc implemented and nur was achieved based on manual process modifications performed by wwtp operators according to the ammonia values monitored by the wwtp outflow analyser amtaxsc hach operators decided the value of do requirements in oxic zones between 0 5 and 2 0 mg l 1 in order to maintain these values at the desired concentration measured by luminescence sensors ldosc hach operators modified the blowers pressure set point psp or the overture of reactor s aeration valves manually the internal qir and external qer recirculation flows were manually modified by pumps frequency inverters to maintain recirculation ratios qir qwwtp and qer qwwtp close to 1 in addition the activation of fecl3 dosing pumps was performed according to the outflow phosphate analyser values phosphaxsc hach to maintain tp 1 mgtp l 1 table 1 during summer 2014 the wwtp was equipped with new cod uvasplus sc hach tss solitaxsc hach and nitrate no3 n nitrataxsc hach sensors finally a combined tss cod bod and nh4 n sensor carbo lyser and ammo lyser scan were installed at the wwtp inflow in addition nineteen energy meters iem3250 schneider and an energy monitoring platform power logic egx300 schneider were installed after an intense analytical effort a biowin envirosim hamilton model based on asm2 iwa was calibrated and ibm research lab hayfa israel developed the first apc system liquid gold ibm based on that model with the objective of optimizing energy consumption while maintaining outflow quality apcp1 can be considered as a semi continuous system because it receives on line sensors analysers data and produces process recommendations ouputs every 2 h which are to be implemented by plant operators manually as described in p0 the apcp1 control variables were global dissolved oxygen do waste activated sludge was purge qpr and internal recirculation flowrate qir as described in table 1 and graphically in fig 2 an effort to automatize wwtp was conducted during 10 2015 04 2016 period between p1 and p2 a period without apc according table 1 blowers aeration valves internal and external recirculation pumps were connected to new wwtp plc s allowing external analog inputs from future apc systems new ammonia sensors aisesc hach were installed in reactor inflows and at each secondary reactor r2a to r2d fig 1 the energy meters network was increased up to twenty seven energy meters a complete description of wwtp sensors probes and analysers is depicted in table 1s supplementary material these improvements allowed the possibility to start working in may 2016 with the new apcp2 system nutrien sica rasi tools sisltech with the main objective of improving the nur rates phase p2

achieved automatically by blowers and aeration valves according to apcp2 outputs table 1 and fig 3 a it means that the measured nh4 n values at the end of each aerated zone are used by apcp2 to keep the desired ammonia set point nh4 nsp feed back control and to compute the reference value for requested do fig 3a in addition the instantaneous and calculated 24 h average value of nh4 n if under established limits for each secondary reactor r2a to r2d also allowed performing dn cycles by closing valves or reducing blowers frequency inverters during a defined period of time tdn according to fig 3a internal recirculation flows qir modified by apcp2 outputs over frequency inverters of ir pumps for each secondary reactor r2a to r2d were also regulated by instantaneous and 24 h average no3 n

in may 2017 new mass air flow meters t mass 65i b150 endress hausser and aeration valves knife type with triangular profile v g exemd04 pentag hiest orbinox were installed to improve apcp2 regulation response in addition the energy meter network was increased to thirty units after these the apcp2 system was migrated in phase p3 to creapro platform createch360 becoming the apcp3 system apcp3 included an evolution of previously apcp2 described control modules for ndn valves blowers and internal recirculation n control mov control ir control tools createch360 but also included a n a cycles or a n a timing ta n a in primary reactors r1a and r1b fig 1 in order to promote ebpr activity fig 3b external recirculation flow control qer modified by apcp3 outputs over frequency inverters of er

the biological phosphorous uptake and calculating the minimum amount of precipitant required ensuring the accomplishment of the tp outflow limit fig 3b in october 2018 phase p4 table 1 the apcp3 or creapro system was modified becoming apcp4 to push ebpr by favouring increased anoxic anaerobic zones in r1a and r1b reactors increasing ta n a limits table 1 the rtc p system was also replaced by a new specific designed tool p control that also considered the oxidation state of each secondary reactor r2a to r2d to modify fecl3 dosage qdfe according to fig 4 a in summary the new p control considered also the operation stage ndnstage and the no3 n concentrations of each secondary reactor in order to select which reactors r2a to r2d were the highest contributors in tp release and manage the individual distribution of fecl3 dosage ri dfe more accurately fig 5 phase p5 table 1 wwtp capacity was tested for the achievement of future outflow requirements tn 10 mg l 1 improved external

hs br assay kit thermo fisher scientific usa bacteria 16s v1 3 rrna gene sequencing libraries were prepared by a custom protocol based on caporaso et al 2012 more details can be found in supplementary material 2 4 laboratory batch tests biological phosphorous removal activity was evaluated using a modified phosphorous release and uptake batch test according to tykesson and jansen 2005 and feng et al 2020 two liter bottles with continuous mixing magnetic stirrer were used as batch reactors for the tests the wwtp sludge samples 1 93 mg tss l 1 were pre aerated for 12 h to ensure depletion of any biodegradable cod two carbon sources were considered in order to determine the maximum phosphorus release and uptake rates using i acetate 200 mg ch3coona l 1 as easily degradable carbon source and ii clarified wwtp inflow 150 mg cod l 1 as complex carbon source acetate or wastewater 750 ml were added to the sludge sample 750 ml after flushing the bottles media with nitrogen gas n2 in order to ensure anaerobic conditions additionally an allylthiourea atu wtw solution 10 mg l 1 was added to each vial to suppress nitrification after 2 5 h of anaerobic conditions the aerobic period was activated by aeration air flushing for a period of 3 0 h reactor samples of 10 ml were taken at regular intervals 30 min during all batch tests tp no3 n nh4 n and cod were analysed after sample filtration while ph orp and do were directly measured in batch reactors as further described in analytical methods section all batch tests were performed in duplicate 2 5 analytical methods tss concentrations were measured according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 2540 g apha 2005 cod tp and tn were measured after sample digestion lt200 hach and vis rfid spectrophotometry dr3900 hach using commercial kits lck hach according to table 2 s supplementary material ammonium nh4 n nitrate no3 n and nitrite no2 n were directly measured with previous described

discussion 3 1 process performance table 2 summarizes the major properties of the wwtp inflow outflow reactors performance waste generation chemicals consumption and energy ratios for all studied periods p0 to p5 the relatively high standard deviation for some of the inflow parameters is due to seasonal variations in the wwtp inflow fig 3s in supplementary material while deviation or outliers in outflow values of ts and tn or tp are due to specific severe episodes of filamentous bulking fig 4s in supplementary material the main objective of phase p0 table 1 was the compliance of outflow requirements for nutrient discharge limits tn 15 mg l 1 and tp 1 mg l 1 although p0 mean value for tnout and tpout met the requirements 12 84 5 85 mgtn l 1 and 0 78 0 12 mgtp l 1 respectively table 2 the high deviation obtained indicates that with manual control or no apc it was not always possible to achieve the discharge limits as it is shown in fig 4s however the global energy ratio of the wwtp 0 23 kwhwwtp m 3 table 2 was in the low range when compared with literature 0 18 0 47 kwh m 3 yang et al 2020 which indicates that initial wwtp energy ratio was quite low despite the manual control specific aeration a and nur energy ratios during p0 were estimated as the entire energy meter network was not yet functional at 4 72 kwha kg 1 tnremoved and 6 57 kwhnur kg 1 tnremoved respectively table 2 the output or controlled variables of the semi continuous apc tool tested in p1 apcp1 were do ir and pr as explained in material methods section table 1 and fig 2 apcp1 system promoted an increase on the sludge purge pr that reduced biomass content in reactors tss reduction of 7 29 affecting the final dewatered sludge production 13 27 kgts dws m 3 as shown in table 2 the promoted reduction in global do tss and specially in internal recirculation ratio 20 72 resulted in a reduction of global wwtp energy requirements equal to 4 76 kwhwwtp m 3 equivalent to a 6 46 kwhnur kg 1 tnremoved or to a 14 40 kwha kg 1 tnremoved respectively as presented in table 2 this reduction objective of p2 table 1 did not affect the outflow quality which was improved with mean and deviation values for tnout of 9 80 2 31 mgtn l 1 table 2 and fig 4s different studies have shown the positive effects of apc systems using a model based approach like apcp1 luca et al 2019 zhu et al 2017 guerrero et al 2011 reported an improvement achieved by an apc system using a model based asm2d iwa optimization for an anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o pilot wwtp resulting in an estimated decrease of opex of around 45 new apc system was tested in p2 apcp2 the main objective of apcp2 was to improve nur rates table 1 in this phase each secondary reactor r2a to r2d fig 1 operated with its own established limits nh4 n and no3 n as explained in material and methods section fig 3a tnremoval rate was increased up to a 67 81 25 39 compared to p0 and the tnout mean values further decreased 8 57 2 15 mgtn l 1 according table 2 these results indicate the stability and robustness of the tested apcp2 system improving nur rates and slightly decreasing the global energy ratio 0 23 kwhwwtp m 3 as compared to the reference period p0 table 2 several studies report different advantages of ndn cycles compared to the performance of conventional activated sludge reactors lee et al 2015 demonstrated that reducing the aeration period in an anaerobic buffer intermittently aerated and oxic system aba2 or the adjustment of volume ratio between aerobic and anoxic tanks in an a2 o system clearly resulted in energy savings in the same way kim et al 2014 showed that an aba2 system modified with ndn cycles could result in good performance removing cod tn and tp as well as in energy saving moreover han et al 2018 reported that tn removal efficiencies of pulse aerated reactors were significantly higher than constantly aerated ones this same conclusion was reached in the current apcp2 tested system as apcp2 did not improve tp removal phase p3 aimed at the promotion of ebpr the introduction of a n a cycles in facultative and oxic phases zones of primary reactors r1a and r1b fig 1 during apcp3 table 1 and fig 3b was able to increase anaerobic periods conditions tests with orp probe showed that it was possible to obtain 250 mv values with a n a cycles of 60 min in primary reactors the fact that lower tpout values in p3 0 59 0 17 mgtp l 1 table 2 were achieved without increasing chemical consumption 1 48 0 41 vs 1 58 0 54 kgfe kg 1 tpremoved in p3 and p2 respectively table 2 indicates possible ebpr activity promoted in p3 the estimation of a 21 of biological tpremoval table 2 by tp and chemical fecl3 mass balance see supplementary material did not initially show this improvement with respect to p0 this is the reason why at the end of phase p3 05 03 2018 a reactor sample was collected and processed using illumina dye sequencing as described in material and methods section sequencing results will be discussed in the next section the apcp3 system was also pushed to maximize energy efficiency during p3 by increasing control tn limits as nh4 n and no3 n limits were relaxed higher values of tnout were obtained 10 28 1 80 mgtn l 1 but lower than tn discharge limit still stablished in 15 mgtn l 1 and consequently lower tn removal rates achieved 58 92 07 12 according table 2 nevertheless this configuration had a clear effect on global energy ratio obtaining the lowest reported values of all periods 0 22 kwhwwtp m 3 table 2 fig 5s supplementary material shows the energy ratios for all periods or tested apc systems in fact in august 2017 the lowest monthly global energy ratio was achieved 0 16 kwhwwtp m 3 fig 5s in the same way várhelyi et al 2019 showed that ammonia based aeration and recirculation controls could reduce up to 45 and 37 the aeration and recirculation energy requirements respectively in phase p4 the apcp3 system was modified apcp4 to improve ebpr activity table 1 a n a cycles in primary reactors were optimized and a new apc module for tp removal control p control fig 4a was tested as explained before the dosing of fecl3 was prioritized with this p control tool depending on the oxidation reduction state or n dn cycle in each reactor fig 5 the most relevant result regarding the change from apcp3 to apcp4 was the increase in tp biological removal up to 41 38 an improvement of a 97 05 regarding p3 table 2 this increase in the biological tp removal joint to optimization of fecl3 dosage control was related as expected to a significant reduction in chemical use decreasing its ratio from 1 48 0 41 to 1 17 0 44 kgfe kg 1 tpremoved equivalent to a reduction of 25 68 from p3 to p4 respectively according to table 2 these results indicate that with the new apcp4 system no3 n was quickly removed and anaerobic conditions were reached in primary reactors improving the ebpr activity although results show that simultaneous nur can be achieved using a n a cycles the internal recirculation and the control over no3 n concentration played an important role in improving the ebpr system being internal recirculation the driving force fig 6 s in supplementary material finally wwtp capacity to accomplish with future discharge limits tn 10 mg l 1 was evaluated with the last tested apc system apcp5 apcp5 control is summarized in fig 4b fig 7 s supplementary material shows an example of a 24 h secondary reactor performance r2b as example with apcp5 system as tnremoval was increased by apcp5 the specific aeration energy ratio was reduced to a minimum of 3 67 1 01 kwha kg 1 tnremoved affecting global wwtp energy consumption table 2 figure 8s supplementary material shows the global wwtp energy distribution per process during p5 data was obtained with the complete 35 ud wwtp energy meters network as expected aeration is the most energy intensive process 32 06 according to figure 8s during p5 the improved external recirculation control tool er control table 1 and fig 4b also increased the srt necessary to achieve nur and outflow requirements furthermore during p5 biological ebpr activity showed continuous improvement reducing fecl3 doses down to 1 04 0 36 kgfe kg 1 tpremoved table 2 considering only the last six months of p5 biological tpremoval accounted for 51 33 of the tp removed fig 6s as explained in material and methods section at the end of p5 new a a n control tool for primary reactors flushing control was developed from the acquired experience although its effect is not considered in present results with the objective to couple control over ndn and ebpr processes fig 1s other interesting batch results outcomes of the tested apcs systems related to fecl3 consumption was the quality of produced sewage sludge table 3 shows the major characteristics of dewatering digested sludge obtained in the wwtp results show that the dewatered sludge obtained along the different phases p0 to p5 present a significant decrease in fe tp ratio which represents a 27 27 reduction in the fe content table 3 this reduction in fe content could increase the tp availability in dewatered sludge increasing its value as soil fertilizer krogstad et al 2005 kidd et al 2007 daneshgar et al 2018 wilfert et al 2015 at the end of period p5 13 10 2020 a new sample from wwtp reactors was collected and processed by illumina dye sequencing in addition a biological phosphorous removal activity test was performed as explained in material and methods section sequencing and batch test results will be discussed in next section 3 2 microbial population and batch tests the 30 most abundant genera found in the two samples collected for microbial analysis in march 2018 and october 2020 corresponding to p3 and p5 respectively are listed in table 3s supplementary material ca microthrix also known as filamentous bacteria was the most predominant genera found in the sample from p3 6 73 table 3s filamentous bacteria are normal components of wwtp biomass and can have beneficial effects on floc formation however their proliferation can also lead to operational problems with bulking or foaming as ssout and consequently tnout tpout leak episodes reported in fig 3s its relative abundance decreased up to 1 9 in p5 sample table 3s fig 6 shows the relative abundance of genera belonging to the functional groups associated with nitrification and ebpr nitrosomonas a well known ammonium oxidizer was the main genera present in both samples with a similar abundance 0 55 and 0 40 in the samples of p3 and p5 respectively fig 6 nitrotoga and nitrospira described as nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were found in similar abundances in the sample collected in p3 however nitrotoga was not detected in the sample from p5 while nitrospira substantially increased as compared to its abundance from sample taken in p3 fig 6 the driving forces for the dominance of one species of nob are not fully understood but temperature 12 9 c and 16 5 c for p3 and p5 samples respectively could be a potential factor with nitrotoga being able to grow at lower temperatures wegen et al 2019 the main differences between p3 and p5 is the promotion of intensive a n a cycles in primary reactors by apcp4 and apcp5 this change in reactors operation also promotes a decrease in the internal recirculation flow and no3 n concentration see fig 6s the observed reduction in the internal recirculation and no3 n concentration could have reduced not only the dn activity in the an zones but also increased the availability of a carbon source for pao development regarding pao organisms fig 6 the sample collected in p3 presented a more diverse community of known and putative paos kong et al 2005 nguyen et al 2011 with tetrasphaera being the dominant genera with a relative abundance of 4 0 followed by dechloromonas 1 9 and accumulibacter 0 76 in the sample obtained in p5 there is an increase in the relative abundance of tetrasphaera 6 7 but all the other paos were not detected fig 6 p5 sample also presents a decrease in the overall putative glycogen accumulating organisms gaos which compete with paos for carbon sources but do not accumulate phosphorus fig 6 this gaos reduction is not explained by seasonal temperature differences in which the samples were collected previously reported since at low temperatures paos have growth rates higher than gaos lópez vázquez et al 2009 moreover recent studies have shown that low do concentrations are effective for ebpr promotion by providing an advantage to paos over gaos while high aerobic hrts show a decline in pao population and an increase in gaos activity izadi et al 2020 most of the ebpr knowledge has been obtained from microbial communities enriched in the laboratory with synthetic substrates being the ebpr community very different from that present in reactors operating with real wastewater coats et al 2017 several studies in full scale plants have shown that genus tetrasphaera is as important as candidatus accumulibacter for biological p removal members of tetrasphaera are known to be more versatile in carbon source uptake and capable of utilizing glucose and amino acids izadi et al 2020 oehmen et al 2007 moreover it has been reported that newly discovered pao organisms dechloromonas spp are actively involved in p removal in full scale wwtps and they should be regarded as important paos along with candidatus accumulibacter and tetrasphaera petriglieri et al 2020 the conventional understanding is that p removal in ebpr is performed by putative paos that anaerobically consume vfas and subsequently store it as pha however recent advances in knowledge of common putative paos metabolism and ebpr ecology has questioned the complete understanding on ebpr microbiology nielsen et al 2019 to complement the microbial analysis and validate ebpr activity batch tests were performed as described in material and methods section with the sample obtained in p5 13 10 2020 fig 7 shows the phosphorous release and uptake rates obtained in the batch activity assays while figure 9s supplementary material shows the other measured parameters batch assays show a clear pao phenotype a phosphorus release and uptake rates of 2 11 and 3 50 mgtp g 1 vss h 1 were obtained respectively in the assay using acetate fig 7 gu et al 2008 reported phosphorus release and uptake rates ranging in wwtp samples ranging from 5 6 31 9 to 2 4 9 7 mgtp g 1 vss h 1 respectively moreover feng et al 2020 reported a phosphorus release rate ranging from 2 3 to 10 8 mgtp g 1 tss h 1 and tykesson et al 2002 reported a phosphorus release rate of 6 9 mgtp g 1 tss h 1 although the rates obtained in the present study are below the reported literature values it is important to mention that monitored wwtp does not include anaerobic selectors and wastewater has a limited amount of available carbon for paos activity lower phosphorus release and uptake rates when wastewater was used in batch assays compared with acetate according to fig 7 it has been reported that paos population could represent up to a 40 of active organisms in ebpr systems lópez vázquez et al 2008 while in the present study pao population fraction reached only 6 7 fig 6 3 3 economic analysis from an economic standpoint it is challenging to determine the profitability of the present tested apc systems several factors such as performance through seven years of operation seasonal changes in wastewater properties impact of temperature on microorganism activity changes on discharge limits variations in energy and chemicals costs or the uncertainty in estimating the effect cost associated with some investments such as replacing equipment like pumps membranes valves etc limit a complete economic analysis despite these facts an economic assessment was conducted considering the costs associated with the investments performed in tested apc systems or capital expenses capex and estimating the benefits or operational expenses opex with the obtained wwtp yields from p0 reference period to p5 optimized period as shown in table 4 in addition apc system and sensors annual maintenance costs were also considered to make p0 and p5 comparable the same annual treatment flowrate inflow characteristics tnin and tpin and discharge limits tnout and tpout were considered table 4 despite the high cumulative capex over the seven years of operation 269 226 a positive opex or savings was obtained with the implemented apc systems 51 229 y 1 resulting in a rate of return of capex of 5 26 y table 4 which is economically feasible for a large scale wwtp the economic analysis at this stage did not take into consideration the inclusion of the wwtp energy monitoring platform in the apc tools with real time energy cost estimation which allowed for the inclusion of an electric energy cost strategy table 1 which boosted energy intensive processes such as aeration figure 8s during low energy cost periods which affected the global wwtpopex furthermore other factors such as impact on biogas production waste generation sludge dewatering properties or other potential benefits over global wwtp ratios were not considered 3 4 apc experience learned lessons and new challenges this study shows the implementation of different apc systems during 7 years in a full scale wwtp obtaining several positive practical implications learned lessons and remaining challenges i the main benefit of implementing an apc system is the accomplishment of a continuous process control and the achievement of established discharge limits regardless of inflow or seasonal variations present results show the stability and robustness of the tested apc systems ii results presented in this study show that ammonia based aeration and integration of ndn and a n a cycles tools in wwtp primary and secondary reactors respectively could improve tnremoval yields with a decrease in opex which is a feasible option to adapt wwtps to new discharge limits and optimize energy consumption iii results confirm that it is possible to promote ebpr processes in a wwtp without anaerobic selectors being the control of internal recirculation and a n a cycles by means of an apc system and opportunity to revamp or adapt wwtps to new requirements iv according to the economic analysis and reported data the promotion of ebpr also results in a reduction in chemical consumption and a significant reduction in fe used this fact not only improves the quality of wwtp outflow but also the value of dewatered sludge properties tp availability as soil fertilizer i nevertheless the implementation of a robust apc system requires a high number of sensors analysers actuators and software that require adequate staff training and frequent maintenance specifically sensors required an intensive frequent and costly maintenance cleaning verification and calibration indispensable in order to ensure the proper functioning of apc systems errors in sensor measurements can create significant problems related to achievement of discharge limits chemical overdoses and low energy yields in this regard the deployment of soft sensors technologies can improve sensors predictive maintenance or decision support tools increasing the reliability of apc systems ii with regards to ebpr promotion and microbial analysis more research and sampling to fully understand the ebpr microbiology in full scale wwtp is necessary and it could result in the development of new optimization strategies 4 conclusions implementation of new apc systems along 7 years of wwtp operation including operation strategies or control tools of ammonia based aeration ndn or a n a cycles and improved internal or external recirculation control resulted in an improvement on wwtp nutrient removal rates 25 48 tn and 9 25 tp removal respectively and also on specific energy ratios 21 79 kwhnur kg 1 tnremoved or 22 33 kwha kg 1 tnremoved the promotion by tested apc systems of ebpr process improved the biological tp removal rates up to a 42 12 which represent an estimated reduction in chemical consumption of 20 00 kgfe kg 1 tpremoved batch test and microbial analysis confirmed biological phosphorous removal activity and identified important nitrifiers and paos functional groups tetrasphera economic analysis showed

16914,the installation of satellite water resource recovery facilities wrrfs has strengthened the ability to provide cheap and reliable recycled water to meet the increasing water demand of expanding cities as a result recent studies have attempted to address the problem of how to optimally integrate satellite systems with other sectors of the urban sphere such as the local economy the power supply and the regional carbon footprint however such studies are merely based on the spatial domain thus neglecting potential time dependent strategies that could further improve the sustainability of metropolitan water systems therefore in this study a new conceptual framework is proposed for the dynamic management of hybrid systems comprised of both centralized and satellite wrrfs furthermore a novel set of integrated real time control rtc strategies are considered to analyze three different scenarios 1 demand response 2 flow equalization of the centralized wrrf and 3 reduction of greenhouse gas emissions data from a case study in california is used to develop an integrated dynamic model of a system of 8 facilities our results show that by dynamically shifting the dry weather influent wastewater flows between hydraulically connected wrrfs a reduction in power demand up to 25 energy use 4 operating costs 8 5 and indirect carbon emissions 4 5 can be achieved therefore this study suggests that a certain degree of hydraulic interconnection coupled with dynamic load shifting strategies can broaden the operational flexibility and overall sustainability of hybrid wrrf systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water energy nexus demand response integrated modeling decentralized wastewater treatment urban water management real time control 1 introduction the continued increase in population density in urbanized areas coupled with today s climatic uncertainty has necessitated the pivot toward more resilient and sustainable urban planning rogers et al 2020 wong and brown 2009 a critical challenge for several metropolises pursuing this shift has been posed by the need to adopt low energy solutions to meet the growing water demand and treat the increasing volumes of generated wastewater qin et al 2018 as a result a multitude of research studies have highlighted various opportunities for the synergistic optimization of the urban water energy system including the implementation of cutting edge technologies castrillo et al 2019 tatinclaux et al 2018 the adoption of energy sensitive water policies kenway et al 2019 xu 2020 and the optimization of existing energy intensive water infrastructure such as pumps and blowers capodaglio and olsson 2020 vakilifard et al 2019 concurrently the traditional idea of a linear urban water system characterized by the collection usage treatment release approach is currently being called into question by the unsustainable exploitation of accessible water resources as such the diversification of the available water resources has been one of the key strategies for providing low energy water supply alternatives in major metropolises such as melbourne low et al 2015 singapore lafforgue and lenouvel 2015 tokyo edwin et al 2014 and los angeles porse et al 2017 in addition to water conservation strategies the introduction of new alternative water sources such as harvested stormwater and water reclamation have shown the promise of improving local water security in a cost effective and energy efficient way sedlak 2014 among the possible water resource alternatives water reclamation represents an attractive solution as it provides a reliable fit for purpose source of water near point of generation while still requiring lower energy and operating costs compared to imported water or costal desalination capodaglio 2020 leverenz et al 2011 moreover the need to implement local water reclamation aimed at quenching the water demand of the growing peri urban areas has shifted the global discourse concerning sustainable water supply toward decentralized water resource recovery facilities wrrfs garrido baserba et al 2018 yerri and piratla 2019 decentralized wrrfs that are hydraulically connected to the centralized sewer collection system are known as satellite wrrfs larsen et al 2013 satellite wrrf systems provide the opportunity to collect treat and reclaim local wastewater thus limiting the need for dual piping systems that stem from a single centralized facility and creating consequent long term cost and energy savings linked to construction and pumping hering et al 2013 moreover satellite wastewater treatment plants allow the production of a variety of treated effluent streams that can be tailored to match the needs of local end use applications such as industrial reuse landscape irrigation groundwater recharge streamflow augmentation and service water used in households sharma et al 2010 satellite wastewater treatment systems can be categorized by three different types i interception type ii extraction type and iii upstream type gikas and tchobanoglous 2009 in the interception type wastewater is intercepted prior entering the sewer laterals diverted to a satellite system for treatment and reused locally the extraction type also known as wastewater mining or scalping differs from the previous type as the wastewater is typically extracted from larger sewer trunk lines or interceptors daigger 2009 gonzález viar et al 2016 the upstream type is usually adopted for suburban communities that experience an increased demand for reclaimed water and are more peripheral with respect to the centralized collection system gikas and tchobanoglous 2009 for such systems the wastewater is collected from the sewer main that pertains the remote community prior to its introduction in the centralized collection system although satellite wastewater facilities are considered self sufficient they typically lack the ability to process the generated solids on site on the contrary the solids are discharged into the hydraulically connected sewer system from which they are transported downstream and processed in a centralized wastewater treatment facility thus taking advantage of the economies of scale associated with biogas production in addition because the expansion of several of these centralized wastewater treatment facilities is often limited due to the adjacent civic and industrial land development satellite wastewater systems also provide the benefit of hydraulically relieving downstream centralized wastewater infrastructure thus deferring capital costs linked to expansion upgrades of centralized infrastructure marlow et al 2013 satellite treatment facilities which are already recognized as a promising way to meet the growing water demand of urban areas do not serve as a replacement for existing centralized water and wastewater infrastructure instead they are projected to be integrated gradually within existing urban water systems thus establishing a hybrid urban water system larsen et al 2013 in fact it is precisely this integration that has been the subject of recent research aimed at assessing the optimal management of hybrid centralized and satellite wastewater treatment systems eggimann et al 2015 opher and friedler 2016 several of these studies perform spatial modeling using site specific conditions and geospatial information for the quantification of sustainability metrics such as greenhouse gas emissions kavvada et al 2016 energy use bradshaw and luthy 2017 and costs eggimann et al 2016 these studies provide the important groundwork for the design and planning of integrated decentralized satellite wastewater systems nonetheless the focus of these recent studies has been posed merely on the spatial domain therefore neglecting the dynamics that characterize the day to day operation of wastewater treatment systems in fact a time invariant analysis of such systems precludes the ability to realistically examine real time control rtc strategies that are based on instrumentation control and automation ica which are fundamentally dynamic yuan et al 2019 it must be underscored that integrated rtc strategies have indeed been proposed for wastewater systems as a whole treatment plants and sewer network however their function has been limited to i the minimization of flooding and combined sewer overflows cso during wet weather events borsányi et al 2008 van daal et al 2017 and ii the minimization of the impact of wastewater on receiving riverine ecosystems meng et al 2017 therefore integrated rtc strategies that target the optimization of energy costs or carbon footprint of hybrid centralized and satellite wastewater treatment systems still remain unexplored thus the goals of this study are i to provide the first example of an integrated dynamic modeling analysis of hybrid wastewater treatment systems ii to develop a set of novel integrated rtc strategies for hybrid wastewater treatment systems iii to quantify the benefits that can be achieved through the adoption of such strategies in terms of energy costs and indirect carbon emissions three different scenarios are considered in this study i demand response ii flow equalization of the centralized wrrf and iii reduction of greenhouse gas ghg emissions each scenario is based on an open loop time of day control strategy which is used to lower the pumping rate at the influent lift stations of the different satellite wrrfs with the intent to dynamically shift the influent loads to the downstream centralized treatment facility a case study of an existing regional hybrid wastewater system is considered herein comprising a set of seven satellite extraction type wrrfs and one centralized facility which are hydraulically connected data and specifications from each facility are utilized in conjunction with specific assumptions for the development of a dynamic process model data from each facility comprises various operational variables i e reactor dimensions influent flows constituent concentrations aeration specifications etc local energy tariff structures are considered in order to estimate the operating costs of the aeration process and influent pumping of each treatment facility in addition dynamic profiles of the carbon intensity ci of the electrical grid are used to estimate the carbon footprint linked to the energy use of the overall system of plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 background and description of the system of wrrfs the system of hydraulically connected wrrfs presented in this study is modeled after the interconnected system of wastewater conveyance and treatment facilities known as the joint outfall system jos which is managed and maintained by the los angeles county sanitation district lacsd the jos provides wastewater treatment services for 4 8 million residents in 73 cities designed to take advantage of the regional topography the jos conveys the collected wastewater to 7 satellite and 1 centralized wrrf mainly by gravity see fig 1 the satellite facilities provide the dual purpose of hydraulically relieving the downstream centralized system and of supplying an alternative water resource to the local communities each of the satellite wrrfs can be categorized as an extraction type because the wastewater is directly mined out of the sewer system the harvested wastewater is subsequently treated to title 22 standards via a treatment train comprising primary sedimentation activated sludge treatment coagulation filtration chlorination and de chlorination the residual solids produced on site are discharged in the main trunk sewers of the jos from which they are transported downstream and treated at the centralized wastewater treatment facility 2 2 modeling framework and boundaries the scope of this study includes a system of hydraulically connected wrrfs with an emphasis on the dynamics of variables such as effluent quality power demand energy use costs and ghg emissions in order to provide a realistic representation of the behavior of each facility dynamic process sub models are adopted along with site specific data used for model inputs and parameters the model boundary includes the typical units found in wrrfs influent pump station primary clarification bio reactor tanks aeration system secondary clarification and control systems the most up to date modeling protocols for wastewater treatment are used as the framework for these sub models rieger et al 2013 additional systems are also modelled such as sewer hydraulics indirect ghg emissions and energy tariff structures each sub model equation was coded in matlab and implemented in the simulink platform using customizable diagram blocks see appendix fig a1 a4 a5 7 a9 10 a12 although the integrated model incorporates detailed features of each wrrf specific assumptions are made to limit the model complexity as well as to reduce excessive computational overhead required for the simulation hence modeling results are always discussed in reference to simulated uncontrolled conditions and not the utility s actual operations such assumptions are presented in detail for each sub model in the following section equations and further description of each sub model are reported in the appendix 2 3 model structure 2 3 1 primary clarification the primary clarification step is modelled by implementing an ideal solid liquid separation sub model such a model is similar to point separation models i e non spatial models with a set percent removal with the exception that the solids mass balance is performed around a defined control volume in order to capture the effects of the primary clarification on the delay and attenuation of the influent dynamics the need for a primary settling model with a specified volume was deemed necessary for more information see appendix 3 2 3 2 bioreactors tanks the activated sludge model 1 asm1 was selected among the available model structures used to describe the bio processes found in activated sludge reactors henze et al 1987 van loosdrecht et al 2015 the selection of the asm1 structure in lieu of other models i e asm2 asm2d asm3 etc is driven by the absence of large anaerobic anoxic zones in each of the facility s bio reactors and by the nonessential need to model the biological phosphorus removal processes as these are not part of the engineered process layout of the facilities considered rieger et al 2013 stochiometric parameters are selected based on typical values found in the literature whereas the kinetic parameters are estimated using temperature correction functions based on average site specific liquid temperatures on average 25 c rieger et al 2013 for the centralized wrrf a modified asm1 model for the high purity oxygen hpo process was adopted based on the structure presented earlier in the literature tzeng et al 2003 2 3 3 air supply model the mechanical power demand from the blower groups is estimated using the adiabatic compression power equation tchobanoglous et al 2014 see appendix eq a29 average wire to air efficiency values were used based on the relative size of the turbomachinery group of each facility range 0 55 0 75 the wire to air efficiency includes the various efficiency losses during the power transfer chain which includes the motor efficiency the mechanical efficiency bearings gears etc and the blower efficiency in addition the power demand of each blower group was estimated by including ambient temperature profiles obtained from local measurements for the period under study sampling frequency of 10 min for each plant a pi do control structure is used in order to maintain an oxygen set point of 2 0 mg l 1 in the last aeration tank with the exception of the centralized wrrf that uses a set point of 4 0 mg l 1 see section 4 3 in the appendix for more information 2 3 4 oxygen transfer model the oxygen transfer rate for each zone is estimated using the equation presented in asce 2018 which incorporates correction factors that account for temperature salinity site elevation diffuser depth diffuser fouling and the effect of surface active agents see appendix eq a18 consistently with previous studies amerlinck et al 2016 reifsnyder et al 2020 a spatiotemporal variable αf factor was implemented based on previously obtained off gas measurements which allows to estimate the oxygen transfer efficiency ote under actual process conditions see appendix section 4 4 1 2 3 5 secondary clarification the sub model for the secondary clarifiers is based on the solids flux between spatially discretized layers the solids mass balance around each layer accounts for the bulk liquid flux and the gravity separation flux based on concentration driven settling behavior takacs et al 1991 torfs et al 2017 the selection of a layered flux clarification model in lieu of an ideal settling model is driven by the desire to capture the variation in solids storage as well as the sludge blanket profile of the clarifier in response to the scheduled hydraulic diversions among the different facilities considered herein typical solids settling parameters have been selected for the activated sludge processes of the satellite facilities whereas the settling parameters for the centralized facilities were chosen based on typical hpo sludge settling characteristics with lower sludge volume indices svis daigger 1995 2 3 6 sewer model in the jos network the wastewater is conveyed primarily via gravity by a system of separate sewer interceptors and trunk lines the biochemical transformations taking place in the sewer system such as hydrolysis and heterotrophic decomposition of organic matter have the potential to affect the wastewater composition hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 however to limit the number of state variables used and therefore the computational time required to numerically solve them the sewer lines were assumed non reactive further information on the sewer model and relative assumptions is reported in appendix 6 2 3 7 pump model wet well pump stations are used at the front head of each plant in order to provide the hydraulic head necessary for transporting the influent wastewater across the various treatment processes in order to capture the diurnal dynamics of the power demand required for the pumps to operate the hydraulic pump power equation is used see appendix eq a31 a total dynamic head of 20 m was assumed for each plant the wire to water wtw efficiency of the pumps was selected based on the size of each facility large η 0 7 medium η 0 6 small η 0 5 2 3 8 flow diversion control the scheduled amount of diverted flow of each satellite wrrf is determined by a two level control structure composed by i an open loop time of day integrated control system which determines when the shifting events of each satellite plant occur and ii an equipment level pi control feedback system used to vary the split ratio of the influent over the diverted flow qinf qdiv in order to maintain the desired influent flow set point of the satellite wrrfs for scenario 1 and 3 the average of the daily minimum flows was selected as a set point for the influent flows entering each satellite facility during the scheduled load diversion see fig 3 lower influent flow set points were not considered as they would drift outside of the normal operating range of each satellite facility a boolean signal is used for the activation of the flow diversion strategy in the specified operating time window 1 on 0 off differently in scenario 2 three different influent flow tiers are considered for the pi control set points see sub section 2 5 2 for more information 2 4 data acquisition and pre processing a combination of site testing operational data and equipment specifications were used for developing the overall hybrid wrrfs system model table 1 shows the equipment specification as well as the average daily operational data that were used to develop a dynamic model for each of the eight wrrfs 2 4 1 influent data diurnal influent flow and concentration profiles for two of the eight facilities sat2 and sat4 were obtained from facility records for the other six facilities the circadian load and concentration curves were constructed consistently from the available profiles see appendix fig a2 the characterization of the influent aggregate variables such as chemical oxygen demand cod and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn was conducted by implementing daily average grab sample measurements in order to ensure that the fractional proportion of each aggregate variable was in the typical range for municipal wastewater the influent fractionation toolbox from sumo v 20 dynamita nyons france was utilized 2 4 2 cost analysis and tariff structure for each of the three scenarios described in section 2 5 the costs are estimated from a costs analysis approach while other economic costs benefits are excluded gonzález viar et al 2016 the main operational costs opex of our analysis derive from the energy use and power demand charge of the blowers and pumps of each facility as these costs are directly impacted when shifting the diurnal influent flows among plants since each scenario does not require the installation of new processes technologies but only a change in operations there are no capital expenses capex in our cost analysis as underscored by previous studies aymerich et al 2015 it is often the case for energy costs to vary throughout the day according to a tier structure set by the energy provider for the system under study a 2 tier energy tariff structure is adopted by a local energy provider with a high energy cost between 16 00 and 21 00 on peak and a lower energy cost during the remaining hours off peak in order to estimate total cost deriving from each facility s energy consumption the delivery and the generation costs were considered for both the weekdays and weekends see fig a11b in addition a maximum power demand charge of 5 08 usd kw 1 is also included in the final energy costs projections see eq 1 where t1 and tfin are the initial and final simulation time respectively 2 4 3 carbon intensity of the electrical grid to account for the diurnal variations of indirect ghg emissions associated with the daily energy consumption dynamic carbon intensity ci profiles also known as carbon output rates were retrieved from historical data made available by the california independent system operator caiso see appendix fig a11c the cumulative carbon footprint of each facility is then calculated by computing the product of the ci and the energy consumption at each time step and then integrating it over the entire simulation period see eq 2 2 c o 2 e q m g t t 1 t f i n c i k g c o 2 e q k w h p o w e r t k w δ t h where t1 and tfin are the initial and final simulation time respectively 2 5 scenarios and evaluation metrics three different scenarios are considered in this study and each is based on shifting the influent load of seven satellite wastewater treatment plants to the centralized treatment facility this is achieved by lowering the pumping rate at the influent lift stations of each satellite facility according to an open loop time of day control strategy by exploiting the hydraulic delay of sewer trunk lines this strategy effectively allows to defer the treatment intensity between hydraulically connected facilities during specific hours of the day the assessment of each scenario is performed in terms of indirect ghg emissions energy use and operating costs additional metrics such as effluent quality and equipment limitation are also taken into consideration the dynamic load shifting strategy of each scenario is illustrated in fig 2 considering a single satellite wrrf and the receiving centralized wrrf the three scenarios are further discussed in the following sections 2 5 1 scenario 1 demand response in the first scenario the scheduled load shifting is implemented as a demand response measure toward peak time based rates that are aimed at shifting the user s energy consumption during the day in this study the demand response strategy is based on the 2 tier time of use tou energy tariff structure previously introduced see section 2 4 2 and fig a11b in the appendix more specifically during grid ramping hours 16 00 21 00 each satellite wrrf diverts the incoming load to the centralized plant while still maintaining their diurnal minimum influent flow according to the control strategy outlined in section 2 3 8 2 5 2 scenario 2 centralized flow equalization the focus of the second scenario is on the equalization of the centralized plant s daily influent flows in general a flow is said to be equalized if the flow is more or less constant with time tchobanoglous et al 2021 for this scenario the diverted flows from each satellite wrrf are scheduled with the intent of increasing the incoming loads of the centralized plant during low loading hours see fig 2 central column the centralized plant thus benefits from having a lower peak to peak amplitude of the influent flow with a resulting improvement in process stability and consequent reduction of the operational variability of mechanical equipment such as pumps and aeration apparatus the shuffled complex self adaptive hybrid evolution sc sahel algorithm also implemented in previous studies rahnamay naeini et al 2018 reifsnyder et al 2020 was used to minimize the variability of the centralized influent flows during low loading hours 02 00 11 00 for this scenario three progressively decreasing influent set points are considered for each of the satellite plants with the lowest being the average minimum daily flow see fig 3 once the daily minimum influent flow time has been set t4 the time intervals i of the three set points are parameterized i 1 i 2 i 3 and i 4 and are used as decision variables during the optimization phase see fig 3 during each simulation the four parameters do not change and are applied to each day of simulation once the convergence to the optimized set of time interval parameters is reached the daily scheduled times of the 3 tier influent flow set points are obtained for each satellite facility t1 t2 and t3 which will remain fixed during the entire 2 week simulation period of scenario 2 additional information on the load shifting strategy for scenario 2 can be found in appendix 9 2 for more information on the sc sahel algorithm see section 10 in the appendix or refer directly to rahnamay naeini et al 2018 2 5 3 scenario 3 greenhouse emissions offset the third scenario targets the curtailment of the indirect daily ghg peak emissions of the system of satellite wrrfs for this scenario the load shifting operations are scheduled during the highest indirect ghg emission hours of each satellite facility with a maximum load diversion time set to 5 h although the peak of indirect ghg emissions varies according to the daily energy contribution from renewables peak emission hours for the considered system of facilities typically fall between 19 00 and 00 00 3 results 3 1 scenario 1 demand response in the first scenario the action of shifting the influent load of the satellite facilities is used as a demand response strategy which allows the deferral of the power required for treatment after grid ramping hours 16 00 to 21 00 it is however important to ensure that effluent quality goals of the centralized facility are met throughout the receiving hours of the diverted flows from the upstream satellite plants the centralized facility primarily targets the abatement of carbonaceous constituents via an hpo process which is not uncommon for large plants in the united states discharge effluent requirements do not require the centralized facility to remove nitrogenous compounds and as such nitrification does not take place in the aeration tanks fig 4 shows the simulated profiles for the main variables of interest in the centralized wrrfs an increase in peak flows to the centralized facility is observed as a result of the scheduled flow diversion nevertheless such flow peaks still maintain values equal or lower than the design capacity of the facility see fig 4a furthermore an increase in power demand is also observed with respect to uncontrolled conditions during the receiving hours of the diverted flows see fig 4b such increase in power demand stems from the need to increase influent pumping rates and also the need to maintain desired oxygen concentrations in the hpo reactors by increasing the speed of the surface agitators fig 4c also shows an increase in the effluent total suspended solids tss concentrations during the receiving hours of the diverted flows yet still complies with the discharge limit 30 mgtss l 1 when considering other effluent metrics such as total nitrogen tn and chemical oxygen demand cod no significant changes are observed see fig 4d and e fig 5 a provides a view of the simulated total power profile of the entire system of wrrfs for 1 week under both the uncontrolled condition dashed black line and scenario 1 continuous line the reduction in power demand during grid ramping hours dashed gray lines is highlighted in yellow such reduction is followed by an increase in total power demand as a result of the shifting in treatment intensity to the centralized facility highlighted in light red however the increase in power demand relative to uncontrolled conditions is lower compared to the achievable power reduction during load shifting operations this occurs as a result of higher efficiency of the larger centralized influent pumps as well as of the typically lower amplitude of the aeration power profile that characterizes the hpo process in the centralized plant wilcox and mcwhirter 1971 the box plots shown in fig 5b provide a comparison between the power distribution for the uncontrolled system and for the demand response strategy scenario 1 during the grid ramping period it can be observed how the flow diversion of the satellite facilities allows the shifting down of the operating power distribution of the overall system of plants with a reduction in mean power demand during grid ramping hours of 3 7 mw the distribution in fig 5c illustrates the probability of achieving a specific reduction in power demand during the load shifting event with an estimated maximum power reduction of 5 5 mw or approximately 25 of the overall system 3 2 scenario 2 centralized flow equalization in scenario 2 the equalization of the influent flow entering the centralized plant is prioritized an approximate 10 000 simulations were required in order to satisfy the convergence criteria of the sc sahel optimization method following the optimization phase the time interval parameters of the 3 tier flow diversions i 1 i 2 i 3 and i 4 of the satellite plants are identified and saved see table 2 these parameters also provide information on the time of day when each influent set point scheduled time t1 t2 and t3 is triggered for each satellite facility the optimized 3 tier scheduling time is used to trigger the flow shifting event of each satellite facility for each day of the entire simulation profiles of the resulting influent flow profiles of each satellite plant for scenario 2 are reported in the appendix fig a13 in fig 6 a and b the 3 tier influent set points of the plants sat2 and sat4 respectively are illustrated for the first 3 days of simulation the scheduling times of the 3 tier influent set points are different for each satellite plant and are mainly dependent on their size and on the relative distance of the sewer line that links the plant to the centralized facility by correctly timing the influent set point according to a 3 tier strategy the compounded diverted flows of all the satellite plants fig 6c allow the significant reduction of the drop in influent flow of the centralized plant during low loading hours as seen in fig 6d it is worth noting that following the optimization phase two of the satellite wrrfs sat1 and sat3 are found to not divert any of their influent flow and thus for the purpose of equalization do not require to be connected to the centralized system the convergence to such a solution can be explained by the relatively long sewer delay time required to transport the diverted flow from sat1 and sat3 to the central facility 8 6 and 9 h respectively in fact for more distant plants like sat1 and sat3 the diversion of any influent flow prior to low loading conditions is likely to end up contributing to the diurnal sanitary peak flow entering the centralized plant past 10 00 11 00 as such any hydraulic disturbance generated from sat1 and sat3 will always overshoot the target time of low loading conditions of the centralized plants 2 00 11 00 from fig 6d it can be observed that although a perfect flow equalization is not achievable for each of the simulated days a significant reduction in the centralized influent flow variability is achieved especially during weekdays 3 3 scenario 3 greenhouse emissions offset for scenario 3 the scheduled flow diversion is deliberately selected to lower the total indirect ghg emissions by targeting the daily peak emission hours of each facility similarly to scenario 1 the influent flow rates of each satellite wrrf are shifted during a 5 hour timeslot 19 00 00 00 fig 7 shows the equivalent co2 emission rates expressed in megagrams or metric tons per hour for the uncontrolled system dashed black line and scenario 3 continuous line during the first week of simulation the avoided ghg emissions during the load shifting dashed gray lines are highlighted in yellow an approximate 17 reduction in ghg emission is achievable during the load shifting event 3 4 overall system performance when considering different scenarios based on inter facility load shifting strategies it is important to also track the volumes of water displaced in fact as oftentimes satellite facilities emerge from the need to reclaim the locally generated wastewater scheduled load diversions can be in conflict with recycled water targets of the individual satellite facility to address this consideration fig 8 a b and c provide a bubble pie chart illustration of the monthly cumulate volumes of water displaced for each scenario the color coded slices of each pie chart exhibit the water volumes shifted from each satellite plant scenario 1 results in the highest volume of water diverted to the centralized plant with an approximate 2 4 106 m3 mo 1 of diverted water or 12 7 of the overall satellite influent fig 8a scenario 3 although assuming a different strategy diverts an equally commensurate volume of water 2 4 106 m3 mo 1 or 12 3 fig 8c conversely the strategy that prioritizes centralized flow equalization scenario 2 displays the lowest amount of diverted water 1 3 106 m3 mo 1 or 6 8 fig 8b figs 8d shows the remaining water volumes available for reuse at each satellite plant location for scenario 1 demand response between 83 sat3 and 89 sat4 of the original influent flows of each individual satellite plant are retained for possible reclamation in scenario 3 an analogous range 83 sat3 and 90 sat4 are also observed the attempt to equalize the centralized flow scenario 2 instead leads to a solution that forsakes diversion of the farthest satellite wrrfs 100 of the original volumes for sat1 and sat3 furthermore when compared to the other scenarios the satellite plants that do participate in the load shifting strategy of scenario 2 still retain between 88 sat2 and 96 sat6 of the original influent flows of the uncontrolled condition thus available for local reclamation the overall performance of the system of eight plants in terms of total costs energy use and ghg emissions is presented in fig 9 d as a result of prioritizing load shifting operations during hours of high energy cost scenario 1 provides the most cost effective option with a monthly savings of 138 000 usd mo 1 with respect to uncontrolled conditions scenario 1 also yields the highest saving in terms of energy use 490 mwh mo 1 although still commensurate to energy savings presented in scenario 3 480 mwh mo 1 scenario 3 curbs ghg emissions to the lowest value among the three scenarios 150 mg co2eq mo 1 by lowering the power demand during the peak indirect emission hours more contained reductions for each performance metric are observed for scenario 2 in addition for the three scenarios an individualized view of the performance of each of the 8 plants is shown by use of radar plots fig 9a b and c for scenario 1 fig 9a the smaller facilities i e sat1 sat2 and sat3 display a higher percent reduction in terms of each of the three metrics 26 28 costs 17 18 energy and 17 18 ghg compared to the larger plants 20 24 costs 12 15 energy and 12 15 ghg such a difference comes as a result of the higher equipment inefficacies pumps blowers etc found in smaller facilities which consequently result in a higher percent savings per mass of load diverted similar considerations are also observed when viewing the individual plant performance under scenario 3 fig 9c compared to the aforementioned scenarios the individual facilities in scenario 2 show a lower percent reduction with the exception of sat 1 and sat 3 which do not display any change since they do not divert any flow black continuous line in the center represents a 0 reduction fig 9b 4 discussion 4 1 general implications and stakeholder breakdown the results obtained from our analysis provide a new facet of discourse to the ongoing dialog on sustainable urban water management moreover this analysis deliberately aims to complement the over decadal discussion on the optimal degree of centralization odc of municipal wastewater infrastructures of growing cities around the world as discussed in detail in eggimann et al 2015 poustie et al 2015 and libralato et al 2012 thus showing that a certain degree of interconnection between facilities can widen their collective operational flexibility which can be tailored to serve a specific shared objective in contrast to previous work the dynamic analysis of hybrid wastewater treatment systems presented here provides the ability to access a holistic set of operational strategies which would not otherwise be achievable via a conventional time invariant analysis through each of the three scenarios we illustrate the ability to use an inter facility influent rtc load shifting strategy that appeals to different stakeholders 4 2 scenario 1 demand response services for electrical grid load flexibility in the first scenario we employ a demand response strategy as a reactive measure to the ramping up of the electrical grid in the late afternoon hours the pronounced electrical grid ramping phenomenon originates from the progressive incorporation of renewable systems into the power generation portfolio of a specific region this condition also known as duck curve has become an increasingly observed trend for several cities worldwide as they transition towards greener sources of energy therefore the evolution of the urban electrical grids toward a more sustainable state bears the challenge of dynamically matching the rapid increase in net power demand in the late afternoon hours to address this emerging challenge in the first scenario we adopt a demand response strategy to lower the power required for wastewater treatment during grid ramping hours by taking advantage of the interconnected nature of a hybrid system of wastewater treatment plants in contrast to other demand response studies that propose the suspension of the treatment operations of a single facility schäfer et al 2017 the integrated multi plant approach proposed here allows wastewater utilities to partake in demand response programs without the need to shutdown treatment operations for the case study considered a maximum reduction of 25 5 5 mw in total power demand was estimated such a finding informs the potential for hybrid wrrf systems to introduce flexibility into the power markets and consequently promotes the opportunity for the wastewater utilities to enter incentive based energy programs such as demand response or time of use tou energy tariff structures thus the prime stakeholders involved in this scenario are the electric grid operators and the sanitation district both of which respectively gain benefits in terms of operational flexibility and economic incentives 4 3 scenario 2 centralized load equalization in the second scenario the equalization of the centralized facility takes priority over other operational schemes the load shifting of each satellite facility was optimized to obtain a satisfactory downstream equalization while also preventing an increase in the number of on off switching events of equipment at the satellite plants the equalization of the centralized influent flow via the dynamic load shifting of each satellite plant provides a resourceful tool for centralized facilities that do not have access to neighbouring land for the construction of equalization tanks as such flow equalization can still be achieved without the need to undertake expensive equalization projects although savings in terms of energy use greenhouse gas emissions and costs are lower compared to the first and third scenario in the second scenario the sanitation district the main stakeholder here gains benefits in terms of process stability and improved asset management at the centralized facility tchobanoglous et al 2021 4 4 scenario 3 emission based demand response the third scenario centres its attention on reducing the indirect ghg emissions linked to the energy use required for treating the wastewater here the load of each satellite facility is shifted downstream to the centralized plant during peak emission hours 19 00 00 00 hence in contrast to isolated decentralized treatment facilities hydraulically connected hybrid systems have the ability to curtail their indirect carbon emissions by shifting their electricity use to periods when the power supplied has a lower carbon intensity such a capability allows the synergistic reduction of the carbon footprint of the system as a whole and therefore expands the ability of local sanitation districts to enter climate change solution initiatives furthermore energy markets that include technologies with different emission factors provide the intriguing ability of hybrid wrrf systems to partake in emission based demand response programs in an emission based demand management program the customer s normal energy consumption pattern is changed in order to avoid emission intensive hours kopsakangas savolainen et al 2017 emission based demand response programs would also provide ancillary benefits such as the reduction of emissions of air pollutants linked to power generation which were not considered in this study but deserve future research it is foreseeable that the enrolment in emission based demand response programs would involve a set of different stakeholders such as the electric grid operators the air emissions regulatory agencies and the sanitation districts 4 5 compatibility with regional water reclamation targets when considering the implementation of inter facility influent load shifting strategies it is important to perform an analysis of the volumes of water displaced in fact as satellite systems often stem from the need to provide locally reclaimed water the diversion of influent flows toward the centralized facility may conflict with the reclamation targets of the individual satellite plant in our study we demonstrated the potential to achieve a reduction in each of the performance metrics considered ghg emissions energy and costs while avoiding an excessive withdrawal of water from the satellite plants 6 8 12 7 of the total influent flow of the satellite plants however it is noteworthy to point out that the constraints posed by water reclamation targets will also vary seasonally with the winter months usually defined by a lower demand for reclaimed water when compared to the summer months therefore inter facility rtc load shifting strategies are expected to also vary according to the seasonal water reclamation constraints of the region this analysis although not considered here should be informed by future studies 4 6 dry weather and wet weather rtc the case study presented herein is characterized by a sewer network that is separate from the storm drainage system therefore the proposed rtc strategy is not expected to be significantly influenced during wet weather events however for combined sewer systems csss or separate sewer systems with a high degree of rainfall derived infiltration and inflow rdii it is expected that the dry weather load shifting rtc strategies proposed here would need to be temporarily suspended throughout the wet weather event or until normal sewer flowrates are re established moreover during heavy precipitation events a possible alternative would be to switch to a wet weather rtc that instead focuses on minimizing csos and reducing the impact on receiving water bodies therefore future studies should address the feasibility of alternating between dry weather and wet weather integrated rtc strategies when considering hybrid systems served by a css or by systems with high levels of rdii 4 7 limitations and future studies several aspects surrounding the dynamic analysis of hybrid wastewater treatment systems have not been investigated in this paper and thus require further examination firstly the analysis herein incorporates specific process models that are characteristic of the case study considered hence future studies on dynamic load strategies of hybrid systems should investigate the improvements that can be achieved in terms of carbon emissions energy and costs under different combinations of process configurations at each facility secondly this study considered a gravity driven non reactive sewer trunk model which allows the significant simplification of the overall model complexity however in reality biochemical transformations taking place in the sewer system will influence the composition of the wastewater during its transit in the sewer lines future studies can provide a complementary contribution to this work by also incorporating in sewer process models in addition for pressurized sewer systems the pumping stations will also contribute to the overall power exerted by the hybrid system of wrrfs therefore subsequent studies should also examine the aforementioned influent load shifting strategies for sewer systems that are predominantly pressurized finally although this study is based on the analysis of a pre existing hybrid wrrf system it also initiates a new discussion on how to plan for future satellite systems the system dynamics need be granted a central role in the infrastructural planning therefore the selection of factors such as site location plant capacity and process design should also be informed by the ability of the plant to interact dynamically with other hydraulically connected facilities 5 conclusions the increased pressure for sustainable water is likely to result in the further implementation of decentralized wrrfs however this ubiquitously observed trend raises the question about the degree of interconnectedness between decentralized and centralized wastewater infrastructure this conundrum has been analysed by previous studies although mainly in terms of spatial optimization herein we have further extended such analysis to the temporal domain and have illustrated a set of novel integrated strategies for the dynamic management of hybrid systems comprised of both satellite and centralized wrrfs the key findings of this study are outlined in the following points we introduce for the first time the analysis of dynamic load shifting strategies for a hybrid system of 8 wrrfs using site specific data and wastewater treatment process models our analysis reveals an untapped opportunity to lower greenhouse gas emissions power demand energy use and costs by dynamically shifting the influent loads among hydraulically connected facilities three different load scheduling strategies are identified each tailored for a specific goal these are demand response services centralized flow equalization and greenhouse gas emission offset the load shifting strategy used to improve the performance metrics in each of the three scenarios i e ghg emissions energy and costs constitutes a relatively simple approach which is based on a scheduled influent flow set point control operation the intrinsic simplicity of the proposed approach offers an appealing feature as it can be easily applied to real systems without the need for complex operations or infrastructure upgrades our study suggests that a certain degree of hydraulic interconnection between wrrfs can broaden their collective operational flexibility in general this paper invites wastewater treatment facilities that would normally operate in isolation to pursue integrated dynamic strategies that align with mutually shared goals which benefit the system as a whole therefore analogous to smart energy grids the dynamic interaction between connected wastewater treatment facilities presented here would provide an important step toward the achievement of a corresponding smart water grid declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

16914,the installation of satellite water resource recovery facilities wrrfs has strengthened the ability to provide cheap and reliable recycled water to meet the increasing water demand of expanding cities as a result recent studies have attempted to address the problem of how to optimally integrate satellite systems with other sectors of the urban sphere such as the local economy the power supply and the regional carbon footprint however such studies are merely based on the spatial domain thus neglecting potential time dependent strategies that could further improve the sustainability of metropolitan water systems therefore in this study a new conceptual framework is proposed for the dynamic management of hybrid systems comprised of both centralized and satellite wrrfs furthermore a novel set of integrated real time control rtc strategies are considered to analyze three different scenarios 1 demand response 2 flow equalization of the centralized wrrf and 3 reduction of greenhouse gas emissions data from a case study in california is used to develop an integrated dynamic model of a system of 8 facilities our results show that by dynamically shifting the dry weather influent wastewater flows between hydraulically connected wrrfs a reduction in power demand up to 25 energy use 4 operating costs 8 5 and indirect carbon emissions 4 5 can be achieved therefore this study suggests that a certain degree of hydraulic interconnection coupled with dynamic load shifting strategies can broaden the operational flexibility and overall sustainability of hybrid wrrf systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water energy nexus demand response integrated modeling decentralized wastewater treatment urban water management real time control 1 introduction the continued increase in population density in urbanized areas coupled with today s climatic uncertainty has necessitated the pivot toward more resilient and sustainable urban planning rogers et al 2020 wong and brown 2009 a critical challenge for several metropolises pursuing this shift has been posed by the need to adopt low energy solutions to meet the growing water demand and treat the increasing volumes of generated wastewater qin et al 2018 as a result a multitude of research studies have highlighted various opportunities for the synergistic optimization of the urban water energy system including the implementation of cutting edge technologies castrillo et al 2019 tatinclaux et al 2018 the adoption of energy sensitive water policies kenway et al 2019 xu 2020 and the optimization of existing energy intensive water infrastructure such as pumps and blowers capodaglio and olsson 2020 vakilifard et al 2019 concurrently the traditional idea of a linear urban water system characterized by the collection usage treatment release approach is currently being called into question by the unsustainable exploitation of accessible water resources as such the diversification of the available water resources has been one of the key strategies for providing low energy water supply alternatives in major metropolises such as melbourne low et al 2015 singapore lafforgue and lenouvel 2015 tokyo edwin et al 2014 and los angeles porse et al 2017 in addition to water conservation strategies the introduction of new alternative water sources such as harvested stormwater and water reclamation have shown the promise of improving local water security in a cost effective and energy efficient way sedlak 2014 among the possible water resource alternatives water reclamation represents an attractive solution as it provides a reliable fit for purpose source of water near point of generation while still requiring lower energy and operating costs compared to imported water or costal desalination capodaglio 2020 leverenz et al 2011 moreover the need to implement local water reclamation aimed at quenching the water demand of the growing peri urban areas has shifted the global discourse concerning sustainable water supply toward decentralized water resource recovery facilities wrrfs garrido baserba et al 2018 yerri and piratla 2019 decentralized wrrfs that are hydraulically connected to the centralized sewer collection system are known as satellite wrrfs larsen et al 2013 satellite wrrf systems provide the opportunity to collect treat and reclaim local wastewater thus limiting the need for dual piping systems that stem from a single centralized facility and creating consequent long term cost and energy savings linked to construction and pumping hering et al 2013 moreover satellite wastewater treatment plants allow the production of a variety of treated effluent streams that can be tailored to match the needs of local end use applications such as industrial reuse landscape irrigation groundwater recharge streamflow augmentation and service water used in households sharma et al 2010 satellite wastewater treatment systems can be categorized by three different types i interception type ii extraction type and iii upstream type gikas and tchobanoglous 2009 in the interception type wastewater is intercepted prior entering the sewer laterals diverted to a satellite system for treatment and reused locally the extraction type also known as wastewater mining or scalping differs from the previous type as the wastewater is typically extracted from larger sewer trunk lines or interceptors daigger 2009 gonzález viar et al 2016 the upstream type is usually adopted for suburban communities that experience an increased demand for reclaimed water and are more peripheral with respect to the centralized collection system gikas and tchobanoglous 2009 for such systems the wastewater is collected from the sewer main that pertains the remote community prior to its introduction in the centralized collection system although satellite wastewater facilities are considered self sufficient they typically lack the ability to process the generated solids on site on the contrary the solids are discharged into the hydraulically connected sewer system from which they are transported downstream and processed in a centralized wastewater treatment facility thus taking advantage of the economies of scale associated with biogas production in addition because the expansion of several of these centralized wastewater treatment facilities is often limited due to the adjacent civic and industrial land development satellite wastewater systems also provide the benefit of hydraulically relieving downstream centralized wastewater infrastructure thus deferring capital costs linked to expansion upgrades of centralized infrastructure marlow et al 2013 satellite treatment facilities which are already recognized as a promising way to meet the growing water demand of urban areas do not serve as a replacement for existing centralized water and wastewater infrastructure instead they are projected to be integrated gradually within existing urban water systems thus establishing a hybrid urban water system larsen et al 2013 in fact it is precisely this integration that has been the subject of recent research aimed at assessing the optimal management of hybrid centralized and satellite wastewater treatment systems eggimann et al 2015 opher and friedler 2016 several of these studies perform spatial modeling using site specific conditions and geospatial information for the quantification of sustainability metrics such as greenhouse gas emissions kavvada et al 2016 energy use bradshaw and luthy 2017 and costs eggimann et al 2016 these studies provide the important groundwork for the design and planning of integrated decentralized satellite wastewater systems nonetheless the focus of these recent studies has been posed merely on the spatial domain therefore neglecting the dynamics that characterize the day to day operation of wastewater treatment systems in fact a time invariant analysis of such systems precludes the ability to realistically examine real time control rtc strategies that are based on instrumentation control and automation ica which are fundamentally dynamic yuan et al 2019 it must be underscored that integrated rtc strategies have indeed been proposed for wastewater systems as a whole treatment plants and sewer network however their function has been limited to i the minimization of flooding and combined sewer overflows cso during wet weather events borsányi et al 2008 van daal et al 2017 and ii the minimization of the impact of wastewater on receiving riverine ecosystems meng et al 2017 therefore integrated rtc strategies that target the optimization of energy costs or carbon footprint of hybrid centralized and satellite wastewater treatment systems still remain unexplored thus the goals of this study are i to provide the first example of an integrated dynamic modeling analysis of hybrid wastewater treatment systems ii to develop a set of novel integrated rtc strategies for hybrid wastewater treatment systems iii to quantify the benefits that can be achieved through the adoption of such strategies in terms of energy costs and indirect carbon emissions three different scenarios are considered in this study i demand response ii flow equalization of the centralized wrrf and iii reduction of greenhouse gas ghg emissions each scenario is based on an open loop time of day control strategy which is used to lower the pumping rate at the influent lift stations of the different satellite wrrfs with the intent to dynamically shift the influent loads to the downstream centralized treatment facility a case study of an existing regional hybrid wastewater system is considered herein comprising a set of seven satellite extraction type wrrfs and one centralized facility which are hydraulically connected data and specifications from each facility are utilized in conjunction with specific assumptions for the development of a dynamic process model data from each facility comprises various operational variables i e reactor dimensions influent flows constituent concentrations aeration specifications etc local energy tariff structures are considered in order to estimate the operating costs of the aeration process and influent pumping of each treatment facility in addition dynamic profiles of the carbon intensity ci of the electrical grid are used to estimate the carbon footprint linked to the energy use of the overall system of plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 background and description of the system of wrrfs the system of hydraulically connected wrrfs presented in this study is modeled after the interconnected system of wastewater conveyance and treatment facilities known as the joint outfall system jos which is managed and maintained by the los angeles county sanitation district lacsd the jos provides wastewater treatment services for 4 8 million residents in 73 cities designed to take advantage of the regional topography the jos conveys the collected wastewater to 7 satellite and 1 centralized wrrf mainly by gravity see fig 1 the satellite facilities provide the dual purpose of hydraulically relieving the downstream centralized system and of supplying an alternative water resource to the local communities each of the satellite wrrfs can be categorized as an extraction type because the wastewater is directly mined out of the sewer system the harvested wastewater is subsequently treated to title 22 standards via a treatment train comprising primary sedimentation activated sludge treatment coagulation filtration chlorination and de chlorination the residual solids produced on site are discharged in the main trunk sewers of the jos from which they are transported downstream and treated at the centralized wastewater treatment facility 2 2 modeling framework and boundaries the scope of this study includes a system of hydraulically connected wrrfs with an emphasis on the dynamics of variables such as effluent quality power demand energy use costs and ghg emissions in order to provide a realistic representation of the behavior of each facility dynamic process sub models are adopted along with site specific data used for model inputs and parameters the model boundary includes the typical units found in wrrfs influent pump station primary clarification bio reactor tanks aeration system secondary clarification and control systems the most up to date modeling protocols for wastewater treatment are used as the framework for these sub models rieger et al 2013 additional systems are also modelled such as sewer hydraulics indirect ghg emissions and energy tariff structures each sub model equation was coded in matlab and implemented in the simulink platform using customizable diagram blocks see appendix fig a1 a4 a5 7 a9 10 a12 although the integrated model incorporates detailed features of each wrrf specific assumptions are made to limit the model complexity as well as to reduce excessive computational overhead required for the simulation hence modeling results are always discussed in reference to simulated uncontrolled conditions and not the utility s actual operations such assumptions are presented in detail for each sub model in the following section equations and further description of each sub model are reported in the appendix 2 3 model structure 2 3 1 primary clarification the primary clarification step is modelled by implementing an ideal solid liquid separation sub model such a model is similar to point separation models i e non spatial models with a set percent removal with the exception that the solids mass balance is performed around a defined control volume in order to capture the effects of the primary clarification on the delay and attenuation of the influent dynamics the need for a primary settling model with a specified volume was deemed necessary for more information see appendix 3 2 3 2 bioreactors tanks the activated sludge model 1 asm1 was selected among the available model structures used to describe the bio processes found in activated sludge reactors henze et al 1987 van loosdrecht et al 2015 the selection of the asm1 structure in lieu of other models i e asm2 asm2d asm3 etc is driven by the absence of large anaerobic anoxic zones in each of the facility s bio reactors and by the nonessential need to model the biological phosphorus removal processes as these are not part of the engineered process layout of the facilities considered rieger et al 2013 stochiometric parameters are selected based on typical values found in the literature whereas the kinetic parameters are estimated using temperature correction functions based on average site specific liquid temperatures on average 25 c rieger et al 2013 for the centralized wrrf a modified asm1 model for the high purity oxygen hpo process was adopted based on the structure presented earlier in the literature tzeng et al 2003 2 3 3 air supply model the mechanical power demand from the blower groups is estimated using the adiabatic compression power equation tchobanoglous et al 2014 see appendix eq a29 average wire to air efficiency values were used based on the relative size of the turbomachinery group of each facility range 0 55 0 75 the wire to air efficiency includes the various efficiency losses during the power transfer chain which includes the motor efficiency the mechanical efficiency bearings gears etc and the blower efficiency in addition the power demand of each blower group was estimated by including ambient temperature profiles obtained from local measurements for the period under study sampling frequency of 10 min for each plant a pi do control structure is used in order to maintain an oxygen set point of 2 0 mg l 1 in the last aeration tank with the exception of the centralized wrrf that uses a set point of 4 0 mg l 1 see section 4 3 in the appendix for more information 2 3 4 oxygen transfer model the oxygen transfer rate for each zone is estimated using the equation presented in asce 2018 which incorporates correction factors that account for temperature salinity site elevation diffuser depth diffuser fouling and the effect of surface active agents see appendix eq a18 consistently with previous studies amerlinck et al 2016 reifsnyder et al 2020 a spatiotemporal variable αf factor was implemented based on previously obtained off gas measurements which allows to estimate the oxygen transfer efficiency ote under actual process conditions see appendix section 4 4 1 2 3 5 secondary clarification the sub model for the secondary clarifiers is based on the solids flux between spatially discretized layers the solids mass balance around each layer accounts for the bulk liquid flux and the gravity separation flux based on concentration driven settling behavior takacs et al 1991 torfs et al 2017 the selection of a layered flux clarification model in lieu of an ideal settling model is driven by the desire to capture the variation in solids storage as well as the sludge blanket profile of the clarifier in response to the scheduled hydraulic diversions among the different facilities considered herein typical solids settling parameters have been selected for the activated sludge processes of the satellite facilities whereas the settling parameters for the centralized facilities were chosen based on typical hpo sludge settling characteristics with lower sludge volume indices svis daigger 1995 2 3 6 sewer model in the jos network the wastewater is conveyed primarily via gravity by a system of separate sewer interceptors and trunk lines the biochemical transformations taking place in the sewer system such as hydrolysis and heterotrophic decomposition of organic matter have the potential to affect the wastewater composition hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 however to limit the number of state variables used and therefore the computational time required to numerically solve them the sewer lines were assumed non reactive further information on the sewer model and relative assumptions is reported in appendix 6 2 3 7 pump model wet well pump stations are used at the front head of each plant in order to provide the hydraulic head necessary for transporting the influent wastewater across the various treatment processes in order to capture the diurnal dynamics of the power demand required for the pumps to operate the hydraulic pump power equation is used see appendix eq a31 a total dynamic head of 20 m was assumed for each plant the wire to water wtw efficiency of the pumps was selected based on the size of each facility large η 0 7 medium η 0 6 small η 0 5 2 3 8 flow diversion control the scheduled amount of diverted flow of each satellite wrrf is determined by a two level control structure composed by i an open loop time of day integrated control system which determines when the shifting events of each satellite plant occur and ii an equipment level pi control feedback system used to vary the split ratio of the influent over the diverted flow qinf qdiv in order to maintain the desired influent flow set point of the satellite wrrfs for scenario 1 and 3 the average of the daily minimum flows was selected as a set point for the influent flows entering each satellite facility during the scheduled load diversion see fig 3 lower influent flow set points were not considered as they would drift outside of the normal operating range of each satellite facility a boolean signal is used for the activation of the flow diversion strategy in the specified operating time window 1 on 0 off differently in scenario 2 three different influent flow tiers are considered for the pi control set points see sub section 2 5 2 for more information 2 4 data acquisition and pre processing a combination of site testing operational data and equipment specifications were used for developing the overall hybrid wrrfs system model table 1 shows the equipment specification as well as the average daily operational data that were used to develop a dynamic model for each of the eight wrrfs 2 4 1 influent data diurnal influent flow and concentration profiles for two of the eight facilities sat2 and sat4 were obtained from facility records for the other six facilities the circadian load and concentration curves were constructed consistently from the available profiles see appendix fig a2 the characterization of the influent aggregate variables such as chemical oxygen demand cod and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn was conducted by implementing daily average grab sample measurements in order to ensure that the fractional proportion of each aggregate variable was in the typical range for municipal wastewater the influent fractionation toolbox from sumo v 20 dynamita nyons france was utilized 2 4 2 cost analysis and tariff structure for each of the three scenarios described in section 2 5 the costs are estimated from a costs analysis approach while other economic costs benefits are excluded gonzález viar et al 2016 the main operational costs opex of our analysis derive from the energy use and power demand charge of the blowers and pumps of each facility as these costs are directly impacted when shifting the diurnal influent flows among plants since each scenario does not require the installation of new processes technologies but only a change in operations there are no capital expenses capex in our cost analysis as underscored by previous studies aymerich et al 2015 it is often the case for energy costs to vary throughout the day according to a tier structure set by the energy provider for the system under study a 2 tier energy tariff structure is adopted by a local energy provider with a high energy cost between 16 00 and 21 00 on peak and a lower energy cost during the remaining hours off peak in order to estimate total cost deriving from each facility s energy consumption the delivery and the generation costs were considered for both the weekdays and weekends see fig a11b in addition a maximum power demand charge of 5 08 usd kw 1 is also included in the final energy costs projections see eq 1 where t1 and tfin are the initial and final simulation time respectively 2 4 3 carbon intensity of the electrical grid to account for the diurnal variations of indirect ghg emissions associated with the daily energy consumption dynamic carbon intensity ci profiles also known as carbon output rates were retrieved from historical data made available by the california independent system operator caiso see appendix fig a11c the cumulative carbon footprint of each facility is then calculated by computing the product of the ci and the energy consumption at each time step and then integrating it over the entire simulation period see eq 2 2 c o 2 e q m g t t 1 t f i n c i k g c o 2 e q k w h p o w e r t k w δ t h where t1 and tfin are the initial and final simulation time respectively 2 5 scenarios and evaluation metrics three different scenarios are considered in this study and each is based on shifting the influent load of seven satellite wastewater treatment plants to the centralized treatment facility this is achieved by lowering the pumping rate at the influent lift stations of each satellite facility according to an open loop time of day control strategy by exploiting the hydraulic delay of sewer trunk lines this strategy effectively allows to defer the treatment intensity between hydraulically connected facilities during specific hours of the day the assessment of each scenario is performed in terms of indirect ghg emissions energy use and operating costs additional metrics such as effluent quality and equipment limitation are also taken into consideration the dynamic load shifting strategy of each scenario is illustrated in fig 2 considering a single satellite wrrf and the receiving centralized wrrf the three scenarios are further discussed in the following sections 2 5 1 scenario 1 demand response in the first scenario the scheduled load shifting is implemented as a demand response measure toward peak time based rates that are aimed at shifting the user s energy consumption during the day in this study the demand response strategy is based on the 2 tier time of use tou energy tariff structure previously introduced see section 2 4 2 and fig a11b in the appendix more specifically during grid ramping hours 16 00 21 00 each satellite wrrf diverts the incoming load to the centralized plant while still maintaining their diurnal minimum influent flow according to the control strategy outlined in section 2 3 8 2 5 2 scenario 2 centralized flow equalization the focus of the second scenario is on the equalization of the centralized plant s daily influent flows in general a flow is said to be equalized if the flow is more or less constant with time tchobanoglous et al 2021 for this scenario the diverted flows from each satellite wrrf are scheduled with the intent of increasing the incoming loads of the centralized plant during low loading hours see fig 2 central column the centralized plant thus benefits from having a lower peak to peak amplitude of the influent flow with a resulting improvement in process stability and consequent reduction of the operational variability of mechanical equipment such as pumps and aeration apparatus the shuffled complex self adaptive hybrid evolution sc sahel algorithm also implemented in previous studies rahnamay naeini et al 2018 reifsnyder et al 2020 was used to minimize the variability of the centralized influent flows during low loading hours 02 00 11 00 for this scenario three progressively decreasing influent set points are considered for each of the satellite plants with the lowest being the average minimum daily flow see fig 3 once the daily minimum influent flow time has been set t4 the time intervals i of the three set points are parameterized i 1 i 2 i 3 and i 4 and are used as decision variables during the optimization phase see fig 3 during each simulation the four parameters do not change and are applied to each day of simulation once the convergence to the optimized set of time interval parameters is reached the daily scheduled times of the 3 tier influent flow set points are obtained for each satellite facility t1 t2 and t3 which will remain fixed during the entire 2 week simulation period of scenario 2 additional information on the load shifting strategy for scenario 2 can be found in appendix 9 2 for more information on the sc sahel algorithm see section 10 in the appendix or refer directly to rahnamay naeini et al 2018 2 5 3 scenario 3 greenhouse emissions offset the third scenario targets the curtailment of the indirect daily ghg peak emissions of the system of satellite wrrfs for this scenario the load shifting operations are scheduled during the highest indirect ghg emission hours of each satellite facility with a maximum load diversion time set to 5 h although the peak of indirect ghg emissions varies according to the daily energy contribution from renewables peak emission hours for the considered system of facilities typically fall between 19 00 and 00 00 3 results 3 1 scenario 1 demand response in the first scenario the action of shifting the influent load of the satellite facilities is used as a demand response strategy which allows the deferral of the power required for treatment after grid ramping hours 16 00 to 21 00 it is however important to ensure that effluent quality goals of the centralized facility are met throughout the receiving hours of the diverted flows from the upstream satellite plants the centralized facility primarily targets the abatement of carbonaceous constituents via an hpo process which is not uncommon for large plants in the united states discharge effluent requirements do not require the centralized facility to remove nitrogenous compounds and as such nitrification does not take place in the aeration tanks fig 4 shows the simulated profiles for the main variables of interest in the centralized wrrfs an increase in peak flows to the centralized facility is observed as a result of the scheduled flow diversion nevertheless such flow peaks still maintain values equal or lower than the design capacity of the facility see fig 4a furthermore an increase in power demand is also observed with respect to uncontrolled conditions during the receiving hours of the diverted flows see fig 4b such increase in power demand stems from the need to increase influent pumping rates and also the need to maintain desired oxygen concentrations in the hpo reactors by increasing the speed of the surface agitators fig 4c also shows an increase in the effluent total suspended solids tss concentrations during the receiving hours of the diverted flows yet still complies with the discharge limit 30 mgtss l 1 when considering other effluent metrics such as total nitrogen tn and chemical oxygen demand cod no significant changes are observed see fig 4d and e fig 5 a provides a view of the simulated total power profile of the entire system of wrrfs for 1 week under both the uncontrolled condition dashed black line and scenario 1 continuous line the reduction in power demand during grid ramping hours dashed gray lines is highlighted in yellow such reduction is followed by an increase in total power demand as a result of the shifting in treatment intensity to the centralized facility highlighted in light red however the increase in power demand relative to uncontrolled conditions is lower compared to the achievable power reduction during load shifting operations this occurs as a result of higher efficiency of the larger centralized influent pumps as well as of the typically lower amplitude of the aeration power profile that characterizes the hpo process in the centralized plant wilcox and mcwhirter 1971 the box plots shown in fig 5b provide a comparison between the power distribution for the uncontrolled system and for the demand response strategy scenario 1 during the grid ramping period it can be observed how the flow diversion of the satellite facilities allows the shifting down of the operating power distribution of the overall system of plants with a reduction in mean power demand during grid ramping hours of 3 7 mw the distribution in fig 5c illustrates the probability of achieving a specific reduction in power demand during the load shifting event with an estimated maximum power reduction of 5 5 mw or approximately 25 of the overall system 3 2 scenario 2 centralized flow equalization in scenario 2 the equalization of the influent flow entering the centralized plant is prioritized an approximate 10 000 simulations were required in order to satisfy the convergence criteria of the sc sahel optimization method following the optimization phase the time interval parameters of the 3 tier flow diversions i 1 i 2 i 3 and i 4 of the satellite plants are identified and saved see table 2 these parameters also provide information on the time of day when each influent set point scheduled time t1 t2 and t3 is triggered for each satellite facility the optimized 3 tier scheduling time is used to trigger the flow shifting event of each satellite facility for each day of the entire simulation profiles of the resulting influent flow profiles of each satellite plant for scenario 2 are reported in the appendix fig a13 in fig 6 a and b the 3 tier influent set points of the plants sat2 and sat4 respectively are illustrated for the first 3 days of simulation the scheduling times of the 3 tier influent set points are different for each satellite plant and are mainly dependent on their size and on the relative distance of the sewer line that links the plant to the centralized facility by correctly timing the influent set point according to a 3 tier strategy the compounded diverted flows of all the satellite plants fig 6c allow the significant reduction of the drop in influent flow of the centralized plant during low loading hours as seen in fig 6d it is worth noting that following the optimization phase two of the satellite wrrfs sat1 and sat3 are found to not divert any of their influent flow and thus for the purpose of equalization do not require to be connected to the centralized system the convergence to such a solution can be explained by the relatively long sewer delay time required to transport the diverted flow from sat1 and sat3 to the central facility 8 6 and 9 h respectively in fact for more distant plants like sat1 and sat3 the diversion of any influent flow prior to low loading conditions is likely to end up contributing to the diurnal sanitary peak flow entering the centralized plant past 10 00 11 00 as such any hydraulic disturbance generated from sat1 and sat3 will always overshoot the target time of low loading conditions of the centralized plants 2 00 11 00 from fig 6d it can be observed that although a perfect flow equalization is not achievable for each of the simulated days a significant reduction in the centralized influent flow variability is achieved especially during weekdays 3 3 scenario 3 greenhouse emissions offset for scenario 3 the scheduled flow diversion is deliberately selected to lower the total indirect ghg emissions by targeting the daily peak emission hours of each facility similarly to scenario 1 the influent flow rates of each satellite wrrf are shifted during a 5 hour timeslot 19 00 00 00 fig 7 shows the equivalent co2 emission rates expressed in megagrams or metric tons per hour for the uncontrolled system dashed black line and scenario 3 continuous line during the first week of simulation the avoided ghg emissions during the load shifting dashed gray lines are highlighted in yellow an approximate 17 reduction in ghg emission is achievable during the load shifting event 3 4 overall system performance when considering different scenarios based on inter facility load shifting strategies it is important to also track the volumes of water displaced in fact as oftentimes satellite facilities emerge from the need to reclaim the locally generated wastewater scheduled load diversions can be in conflict with recycled water targets of the individual satellite facility to address this consideration fig 8 a b and c provide a bubble pie chart illustration of the monthly cumulate volumes of water displaced for each scenario the color coded slices of each pie chart exhibit the water volumes shifted from each satellite plant scenario 1 results in the highest volume of water diverted to the centralized plant with an approximate 2 4 106 m3 mo 1 of diverted water or 12 7 of the overall satellite influent fig 8a scenario 3 although assuming a different strategy diverts an equally commensurate volume of water 2 4 106 m3 mo 1 or 12 3 fig 8c conversely the strategy that prioritizes centralized flow equalization scenario 2 displays the lowest amount of diverted water 1 3 106 m3 mo 1 or 6 8 fig 8b figs 8d shows the remaining water volumes available for reuse at each satellite plant location for scenario 1 demand response between 83 sat3 and 89 sat4 of the original influent flows of each individual satellite plant are retained for possible reclamation in scenario 3 an analogous range 83 sat3 and 90 sat4 are also observed the attempt to equalize the centralized flow scenario 2 instead leads to a solution that forsakes diversion of the farthest satellite wrrfs 100 of the original volumes for sat1 and sat3 furthermore when compared to the other scenarios the satellite plants that do participate in the load shifting strategy of scenario 2 still retain between 88 sat2 and 96 sat6 of the original influent flows of the uncontrolled condition thus available for local reclamation the overall performance of the system of eight plants in terms of total costs energy use and ghg emissions is presented in fig 9 d as a result of prioritizing load shifting operations during hours of high energy cost scenario 1 provides the most cost effective option with a monthly savings of 138 000 usd mo 1 with respect to uncontrolled conditions scenario 1 also yields the highest saving in terms of energy use 490 mwh mo 1 although still commensurate to energy savings presented in scenario 3 480 mwh mo 1 scenario 3 curbs ghg emissions to the lowest value among the three scenarios 150 mg co2eq mo 1 by lowering the power demand during the peak indirect emission hours more contained reductions for each performance metric are observed for scenario 2 in addition for the three scenarios an individualized view of the performance of each of the 8 plants is shown by use of radar plots fig 9a b and c for scenario 1 fig 9a the smaller facilities i e sat1 sat2 and sat3 display a higher percent reduction in terms of each of the three metrics 26 28 costs 17 18 energy and 17 18 ghg compared to the larger plants 20 24 costs 12 15 energy and 12 15 ghg such a difference comes as a result of the higher equipment inefficacies pumps blowers etc found in smaller facilities which consequently result in a higher percent savings per mass of load diverted similar considerations are also observed when viewing the individual plant performance under scenario 3 fig 9c compared to the aforementioned scenarios the individual facilities in scenario 2 show a lower percent reduction with the exception of sat 1 and sat 3 which do not display any change since they do not divert any flow black continuous line in the center represents a 0 reduction fig 9b 4 discussion 4 1 general implications and stakeholder breakdown the results obtained from our analysis provide a new facet of discourse to the ongoing dialog on sustainable urban water management moreover this analysis deliberately aims to complement the over decadal discussion on the optimal degree of centralization odc of municipal wastewater infrastructures of growing cities around the world as discussed in detail in eggimann et al 2015 poustie et al 2015 and libralato et al 2012 thus showing that a certain degree of interconnection between facilities can widen their collective operational flexibility which can be tailored to serve a specific shared objective in contrast to previous work the dynamic analysis of hybrid wastewater treatment systems presented here provides the ability to access a holistic set of operational strategies which would not otherwise be achievable via a conventional time invariant analysis through each of the three scenarios we illustrate the ability to use an inter facility influent rtc load shifting strategy that appeals to different stakeholders 4 2 scenario 1 demand response services for electrical grid load flexibility in the first scenario we employ a demand response strategy as a reactive measure to the ramping up of the electrical grid in the late afternoon hours the pronounced electrical grid ramping phenomenon originates from the progressive incorporation of renewable systems into the power generation portfolio of a specific region this condition also known as duck curve has become an increasingly observed trend for several cities worldwide as they transition towards greener sources of energy therefore the evolution of the urban electrical grids toward a more sustainable state bears the challenge of dynamically matching the rapid increase in net power demand in the late afternoon hours to address this emerging challenge in the first scenario we adopt a demand response strategy to lower the power required for wastewater treatment during grid ramping hours by taking advantage of the interconnected nature of a hybrid system of wastewater treatment plants in contrast to other demand response studies that propose the suspension of the treatment operations of a single facility schäfer et al 2017 the integrated multi plant approach proposed here allows wastewater utilities to partake in demand response programs without the need to shutdown treatment operations for the case study considered a maximum reduction of 25 5 5 mw in total power demand was estimated such a finding informs the potential for hybrid wrrf systems to introduce flexibility into the power markets and consequently promotes the opportunity for the wastewater utilities to enter incentive based energy programs such as demand response or time of use tou energy tariff structures thus the prime stakeholders involved in this scenario are the electric grid operators and the sanitation district both of which respectively gain benefits in terms of operational flexibility and economic incentives 4 3 scenario 2 centralized load equalization in the second scenario the equalization of the centralized facility takes priority over other operational schemes the load shifting of each satellite facility was optimized to obtain a satisfactory downstream equalization while also preventing an increase in the number of on off switching events of equipment at the satellite plants the equalization of the centralized influent flow via the dynamic load shifting of each satellite plant provides a resourceful tool for centralized facilities that do not have access to neighbouring land for the construction of equalization tanks as such flow equalization can still be achieved without the need to undertake expensive equalization projects although savings in terms of energy use greenhouse gas emissions and costs are lower compared to the first and third scenario in the second scenario the sanitation district the main stakeholder here gains benefits in terms of process stability and improved asset management at the centralized facility tchobanoglous et al 2021 4 4 scenario 3 emission based demand response the third scenario centres its attention on reducing the indirect ghg emissions linked to the energy use required for treating the wastewater here the load of each satellite facility is shifted downstream to the centralized plant during peak emission hours 19 00 00 00 hence in contrast to isolated decentralized treatment facilities hydraulically connected hybrid systems have the ability to curtail their indirect carbon emissions by shifting their electricity use to periods when the power supplied has a lower carbon intensity such a capability allows the synergistic reduction of the carbon footprint of the system as a whole and therefore expands the ability of local sanitation districts to enter climate change solution initiatives furthermore energy markets that include technologies with different emission factors provide the intriguing ability of hybrid wrrf systems to partake in emission based demand response programs in an emission based demand management program the customer s normal energy consumption pattern is changed in order to avoid emission intensive hours kopsakangas savolainen et al 2017 emission based demand response programs would also provide ancillary benefits such as the reduction of emissions of air pollutants linked to power generation which were not considered in this study but deserve future research it is foreseeable that the enrolment in emission based demand response programs would involve a set of different stakeholders such as the electric grid operators the air emissions regulatory agencies and the sanitation districts 4 5 compatibility with regional water reclamation targets when considering the implementation of inter facility influent load shifting strategies it is important to perform an analysis of the volumes of water displaced in fact as satellite systems often stem from the need to provide locally reclaimed water the diversion of influent flows toward the centralized facility may conflict with the reclamation targets of the individual satellite plant in our study we demonstrated the potential to achieve a reduction in each of the performance metrics considered ghg emissions energy and costs while avoiding an excessive withdrawal of water from the satellite plants 6 8 12 7 of the total influent flow of the satellite plants however it is noteworthy to point out that the constraints posed by water reclamation targets will also vary seasonally with the winter months usually defined by a lower demand for reclaimed water when compared to the summer months therefore inter facility rtc load shifting strategies are expected to also vary according to the seasonal water reclamation constraints of the region this analysis although not considered here should be informed by future studies 4 6 dry weather and wet weather rtc the case study presented herein is characterized by a sewer network that is separate from the storm drainage system therefore the proposed rtc strategy is not expected to be significantly influenced during wet weather events however for combined sewer systems csss or separate sewer systems with a high degree of rainfall derived infiltration and inflow rdii it is expected that the dry weather load shifting rtc strategies proposed here would need to be temporarily suspended throughout the wet weather event or until normal sewer flowrates are re established moreover during heavy precipitation events a possible alternative would be to switch to a wet weather rtc that instead focuses on minimizing csos and reducing the impact on receiving water bodies therefore future studies should address the feasibility of alternating between dry weather and wet weather integrated rtc strategies when considering hybrid systems served by a css or by systems with high levels of rdii 4 7 limitations and future studies several aspects surrounding the dynamic analysis of hybrid wastewater treatment systems have not been investigated in this paper and thus require further examination firstly the analysis herein incorporates specific process models that are characteristic of the case study considered hence future studies on dynamic load strategies of hybrid systems should investigate the improvements that can be achieved in terms of carbon emissions energy and costs under different combinations of process configurations at each facility secondly this study considered a gravity driven non reactive sewer trunk model which allows the significant simplification of the overall model complexity however in reality biochemical transformations taking place in the sewer system will influence the composition of the wastewater during its transit in the sewer lines future studies can provide a complementary contribution to this work by also incorporating in sewer process models in addition for pressurized sewer systems the pumping stations will also contribute to the overall power exerted by the hybrid system of wrrfs therefore subsequent studies should also examine the aforementioned influent load shifting strategies for sewer systems that are predominantly pressurized finally although this study is based on the analysis of a pre existing hybrid wrrf system it also initiates a new discussion on how to plan for future satellite systems the system dynamics need be granted a central role in the infrastructural planning therefore the selection of factors such as site location plant capacity and process design should also be informed by the ability of the plant to interact dynamically with other hydraulically connected facilities 5 conclusions the increased pressure for sustainable water is likely to result in the further implementation of decentralized wrrfs however this ubiquitously observed trend raises the question about the degree of interconnectedness between decentralized and centralized wastewater infrastructure this conundrum has been analysed by previous studies although mainly in terms of spatial optimization herein we have further extended such analysis to the temporal domain and have illustrated a set of novel integrated strategies for the dynamic management of hybrid systems comprised of both satellite and centralized wrrfs the key findings of this study are outlined in the following points we introduce for the first time the analysis of dynamic load shifting strategies for a hybrid system of 8 wrrfs using site specific data and wastewater treatment process models our analysis reveals an untapped opportunity to lower greenhouse gas emissions power demand energy use and costs by dynamically shifting the influent loads among hydraulically connected facilities three different load scheduling strategies are identified each tailored for a specific goal these are demand response services centralized flow equalization and greenhouse gas emission offset the load shifting strategy used to improve the performance metrics in each of the three scenarios i e ghg emissions energy and costs constitutes a relatively simple approach which is based on a scheduled influent flow set point control operation the intrinsic simplicity of the proposed approach offers an appealing feature as it can be easily applied to real systems without the need for complex operations or infrastructure upgrades our study suggests that a certain degree of hydraulic interconnection between wrrfs can broaden their collective operational flexibility in general this paper invites wastewater treatment facilities that would normally operate in isolation to pursue integrated dynamic strategies that align with mutually shared goals which benefit the system as a whole therefore analogous to smart energy grids the dynamic interaction between connected wastewater treatment facilities presented here would provide an important step toward the achievement of a corresponding smart water grid declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to
