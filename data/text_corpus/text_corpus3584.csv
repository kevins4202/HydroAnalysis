17920,the cr iii organic complexes formed between cr iii and multifunctional group ligands such as polyacrylate are highly water soluble and difficult to be removed from wastewater by common treatments a novel strategy for efficiently removing cr iii poly acrylic acid complex cr iii paa from wastewater without introducing secondary pollution is proposed using a coprecipitation method with polyvalent metal ions al iii fe iii zr iv and ti iv were combined with the carboxyl of cr iii paa to decrease hydrophilia and achieve fast and efficient coprecipitation cr iii paa was efficiently removed from wastewater by using these polyvalent metal ions especially at low ph where the ions exist as monomer the residual concentration of cr iii in treated wastewater under the optimized experimental condition was less than 1 0 mg l no cr vi and negligible amount of polyvalent metal ions were detected in the treated wastewater indicating that almost all of the ions coprecipitated with cr iii paa no secondary pollution also occurred the high reactivity between the polyvalent metal ions and cr iii paa and the sharp decrease in the hydrophilia of the complex contributed to its highly efficient removal from wastewater actual tannery wastewater containing cr iii organic complexes with high solubility and stability was treated through coprecipitation with al iii a high cr iii removal efficiency of 99 0 was obtained this work provides new insights into the removal of soluble cr iii organic complexes from wastewater by using an environment friendly and cost effective method graphical abstract image 1 keywords cr iii poly acrylic acid complex polyvalent metal ions coprecipitation al iii 1 introduction chrome cr has been widely used in many industries such as dyes electroplating paints and leather tanning etc li et al 2019 liu et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 however cr contaminates wastewater thereby polluting the aquatic systems and jeopardizing the environment pan et al 2015 xu et al 2019 the main species of cr in these cr contaminated wastewaters include trivalent chromium cr iii and hexavalent chromium cr vi ding et al 2018 francisco et al 2018 varadharajan et al 2017 despite being less toxic than cr vi cr iii has gained increasing attention because it easily forms soluble cr iii organic complexes such as cr iii poly acrylic acid complex cr iii paa cr iii dissolved organic matter cr iii dom cr iii dye complexes cr iii oxalic acid complex etc in various industrial wastewaters see table s1 gustafsson et al 2014 li et al 2014 wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2005 which increase the difficulty of cr iii removal and the toxicity to microorganisms more than 60 of cr iii in tannery wastewater exists in highly stable and soluble cr iii organic complexes for example nearly all the cr iii in post tanning wastewater of tannery exists as cr iii organic complexes because a large number of unabsorbed organic post tanning agents with carboxyl sulfonic acid group or phenolic hydroxyl combine with cr iii in the wastewater wang et al 2018a paa is a most popular post tanning agent and widely used in leather manufacture due to its good selective filling property that can increase the yield of leathers therefore the highly stable and soluble cr iii paa is a common pollutant in tannery wastewater and a major obstacle in cr removal however the discharge standard of water pollutants for leather making industry in china requires that the total cr concentration of tannery effluent at workshop outlet is below 1 5 mg l walsh and ohalloran 1996 wang et al 2018a therefore how to achieve an effective removal of cr iii complexes from tannery wastewater has become a crucial issue various methods have been developed to remove cr iii from wastewater because of increasing stringent environmental regulations conventional methods such as alkaline precipitation coagulation ion exchange membrane separation and adsorption are applicable for removal of inorganic cr iii ions which have reactive vacant orbitals adusei gyamfi et al 2019 gode and pehlivan 2006 tor et al 2009 wang et al 2013b however these methods are unsuitable for removing water soluble cr iii organic complexes of which vacant orbitals are occupied by organics wang et al 2016 reported that chemical precipitation can remove almost all inorganic cr iii ions from tannery wastewater but not cr iii organic complexes such as cr iii paa the efficient removal of cr iii organic complexes from cr iii contaminated wastewater remains a major challenge some researchers have utilized advanced oxidation processes aops to remove cr iii organic complexes from wastewater by destroying their organic compounds and precipitating cr iii durante et al 2011 huang et al 2019 li et al 2014 wang et al 2018b ye et al 2017 2018 however aops are ineffective for treating cr iii organic complexes because toxic cr vi is generated during oxidation yang et al 2014a 2014b thus an efficient method should be developed for removal of cr iii organic complexes from wastewater without introducing secondary pollution coprecipitation which is a process where chemical agents are added to react with soluble targets in a solution to form insoluble precipitates has been widely used in synthesis separation extraction and environmental fields foster et al 2019 guan et al 2014 liu et al 2013 wang et al 2013a yang et al 2017 for example kang et al 2019 utilized fe3 ion as a coprecipitation agent to convert soluble xanthan gum into insoluble fe xanthan gum hydrogels the strong coordination between fe3 and the carboxyl of xanthan gum occurred which decreased the hydrophilic groups of xanthan gum qi et al 2014 studied the complexation behavior of paa and lanthanide ions they found that soluble paa could complex with lanthanide ions at low concentration but no precipitates generated while sufficient lanthanide ions promoted the formation of insoluble ln paa precipitates cr iii paa similar to xanthan gum and paa is well soluble and stable in water solution because it has many free carboxyl groups inspired by the above studies we speculate that polyvalent metal ions can combine with water soluble cr iii paa to form insoluble precipitates and remove cr iii paa from wastewater notably polyvalent metal ions can be coprecipitated and will not cause secondary pollution this study aimed to efficiently remove cr iii paa from wastewater through coprecipitation with polyvalent metal ions the effects of operating conditions such as solution ph dosage of polyvalent metal ions reaction time reaction temperature and type of polyvalent metal ions on the removal of cr iii paa from wastewater were investigated using residual cr iii concentration as the assessment index the residual concentrations of polyvalent metal ions were also measured to determine whether secondary pollution was generated solid state 27al nuclear magnetic resonance 27al nmr field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermogravimetric analysis tga and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to confirm the underlying mechanism of removing cr iii paa by

tang et al 2018 in brief 3 15 g of paa and 0 25 g of cr2 so4 3 were added into 1000 ml of deionized water the mixture was adjusted to ph 4 0 by adding 1 0 mol l hcl and incubated at 40 c for 2 h after cooling to 20 c and filtering through polyethersulfone membrane 0 22 Î¼m the filtrate was collected as the cr iii paa solution the concentrations of cr iii and total organic carbon toc were 45 6 and 546 1 mg l respectively only cr iii paa and free paa existed in the cr iii paa solution because excess paa was used to completely chelate cr iii the particle sizes of cr iii paa in the solution ranged from 3 nm to 7 nm no tyndall effect was observed when the cr iii paa solution was illuminated by 650 nm laser fig s1 actual tannery wastewater was sampled at the end of post tanning processes from three tanneries in china the properties of wastewater are listed in table 1 2 2 removal of cr iii paa complex from cr iii paa solution by using alcl3 2 2 1 batch experiments batch experiments were conducted to investigate crucial parameters such as solution ph al iii to carboxyl mole ratio al cooh reaction time and reaction temperature that influenced cr iii paa removal efficiency different

atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes optima 8000dv perkinelmer usa and toc analyzer vario elementar germany respectively all the experiments were conducted in triplicate and the results are presented as mean with standard deviation the precipitates were rapidly washed with deionized water to remove excess dissolved species and freeze dried under vacuum the dried precipitates were used for characterization the paa and cr iii paa solutions were freeze dried as control to further understand the cr iii paa removal mechanism by using al iii especially to distinguish the complexation of alcl3 from the coagulation a typical coagulant pac was chosen to treat the cr iii paa solution alcl3 and pac were separately added into the cr iii paa solution where al cooh was 1 2 2 the mixtures were placed at 20 c for 5 min and their ph was maintained at ph 3 5 and 6 0 during the reaction then the mixtures were centrifuged at 5000 r min for 5 min and the supernatants were taken for measurement of cr iii concentration 2 2 2 solid characterization the morphology changes in chemical and electronic states al species and hydrophilia of the precipitates were evaluated and compared with those of paa and cr iii paa to understand the mechanism of cr iii paa removal by using al iii the morphology of the samples was observed by fesem novananosem450 fei company usa changes in the chemical and electronic states of the samples were detected by xps k alpha usa the al species of the samples were recorded by solid state27al nmr avance iii 500 mhz bruker switzerland the hydrophilia

2 4 k m 2 c l c m where f 0 and f are the fluorescence intensities of paa cr iii paa solution before and after the addition of al iii respectively f ml is the limited fluorescence intensity of paa cr iii paa solution at al iii concentration of c m and c l is the total ligand concentration 2 3 coprecipitation of cr iii paa complex with other polyvalent metal ions stock solutions of al2 so4 3 0 63 mmol al l fe2 so4 3 0 63 mmol fe l zr so4 2 0 315 mmol zr l and ti so4 2 0 315 mmol ti l were prepared then different volumes of al2 so4 3 0 5 ml fe2 so4 3 0 5 ml zr so4 2 1 0 ml and ti so4 2 1 0 ml solutions were added into 100 ml of cr iii paa solution the concentrations of these polyvalent metal ions were all 3 15 mmol l here the added volumes of polyvalent metal solutions were different but small enough and therefore their influence was insignificant the ph of the four mixtures was adjusted to their optimal values namely 3 5 2 7 1 5 and 1 5 respectively which were lower than the precipitation ph of the metal ions after reacting for 5 min at 20 c the mixtures were centrifuged at 5000 r min for 5 min to separate the precipitates from the supernatant the residual concentrations of cr iii toc and polyvalent metal ions in the supernatant were analyzed as mentioned above all the experiments were conducted in triplicate and the results are presented as mean with standard deviation moreover the morphology and hydrophilia of the precipitates were characterized 2 4 validation on actual industrial wastewater actual industrial wastewater samples from tanneries were treated with alcl3 to verify the practical application of the coprecipitation method a certain amount of alcl3 solution the concentration of al was 3 70 mmol l was added into 250 ml of actual tannery wastewater the ph of the mixtures was adjusted to 3 5 after reacting for 5 min at 20 c the mixtures were centrifuged at 5000 r min for 5 min to separate the precipitates from the supernatant the supernatant was collected to measure residual cr iii and toc concentrations all the experiments were conducted in triplicate and the results are presented as mean with standard deviation the efficiency of the coprecipitation method for removing cr iii organic complexes from tannery wastewater was compared with those of common methods including pac coagulation and activated carbon adsorption for pac coagulation the ph of tannery wastewater was adjusted to 6 5 and pac 1000 mg l was added to wastewater after stirring at 40 r min for 20 min the mixtures were settled for 30 min for activated carbon adsorption 250 mg of activated carbon was added into 250 ml of tannery wastewater the initial ph was adjusted to 5 0 the mixture was placed in a shaking bath at 20 c for 6 h with 120 r min 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of cr iii paa complex by alcl3 the effect of ph was first investigated because it controls the ionization of carboxyl in cr iii paa and the state of al species of alcl3 duan et al 2014 jiang et al 2019 as shown in fig 1 a at ph 3 5 the residual cr iii and toc concentrations decreased to 5 9 and 95 4 mg l respectively at ph 2 5 the residual cr iii and toc concentrations were higher than those at ph 3 5 because the carboxyl in cr iii paa pka of coo in paa 4 75 was difficult to ionize thereby hindering the reaction between al iii and cr iii paa and the formation of precipitates himstedt et al 2011 at ph 4 5 the vacant orbital of al iii was occupied by hydroxyls oh and al2 oh 2 4 al3 oh 4 5 and al oh 3 were formed fig s2 these compounds inhibited the complexation of al iii with cr iii paa leading to low efficiency for removal of cr iii paa hence the efficient removal of cr iii paa was dependent on the ionization of carboxyl in cr iii paa and the existence of al iii species to further investigate the effect of al species on cr iii paa removal the cr iii removal efficiencies by alcl3 at ph 3 5 and 6 0 were compared with that by pac at ph 6 0 it was found that the cr iii removal efficiency by alcl3 at ph 3 5 was approximately 1 3 times higher than that by alcl3 at ph 6 0 and 2 5 times higher than that by pac at ph of 6 0 fig s3 these results indicated that al3 in alcl3 was more useful in removing cr iii paa compared with polymeric al in pac and also implied that the removal mechanism of coprecipitation with alcl3 was different from that of coagulation with pac the residual al concentration was 1 2 mg l at ph 3 5 indicating that al iii coprecipitated with cr iii paa besides the chemical sludge containing organics cr iii and al iii can be recycled to prepare a polymetallic tanning agent moreover no secondary pollution was generated through the proposed coprecipitation method coprecipitation for removing soluble cr iii paa depends on the reaction between al iii and the free carboxyl groups of cr iii paa the effect of al cooh on cr iii paa removal was investigated fig 1b the cr iii concentration decreased from 38 2 mg l to 0 87 mg l with increasing al cooh and the toc concentration decreased from 458 5 mg l to 61 9 mg l the residual concentrations of cr iii and toc considerably decreased when the al cooh was higher than 1 6 this is because although 1 mol al with coordination number of 6 can theoretically react with 6 mol carboxyl pinkas et al 1994 song et al 2019 steric hindrance and limited reaction conditions adversely affect the reaction between al and carboxyl hence high al cooh 1 6 was required to ensure that the free carboxyl in cr iii paa can be encapsulated by adequate al iii by reducing the hydrophilia of cr iii paa to achieve high cr iii and toc removal efficiencies the effect of reaction time on the residual concentrations of cr iii and toc is shown in fig s4 equilibrium was reached after 5 min indicating that cr iii paa was removed within a short period of time because of the kinetic activity of al iii yu et al 2018 the residual concentrations of cr iii and toc decreased with increasing reaction temperature fig s5 up to 80 of cr iii and toc were removed at a low temperature of 10 c indicating that the coprecipitation method was feasible in low temperatures and had wider universality than biological treatments sulphated castor oil and sulfonated oil were another typical post tanning agents used in tannery and cr iii sulphated castor oil and cr iii sulfonated oil in post tanning wastewater were also difficult to be removed by coagulation method tang et al 2018 however more than 99 0 of cr iii and toc were removed from cr iii sulphated castor oil and cr iii sulfonated oil solutions by using alcl3 under the optimized experimental condition see fig s6 the results indicated that the coprecipitation method is adaptable for removal of other cr iii organic complexes 3 2 mechanism of cr iii paa complex removal through coprecipitation the precipitate of cr iii paa that coprecipitated with al iii was obtained after reacting with al cooh of 1 3 3 at ph 3 5 and 20 c for 5 min and characterized through fesem xps solid state 27al nmr and tga to investigate the mechanism of cr iii paa removal as shown in fig 2 dispersive nanoparticles with average diameter of 55 1 nm were observed in the precipitate this phenomenon implied that complexation occurred between al iii and cr iii paa paa leading to considerable reduction in the hydrophilia of cr iii paa paa and the formation of the precipitate the xps spectrum of the precipitate was compared with those of paa and cr iii paa to identify the complexation between al iii and the free carboxyl of cr iii paa during coprecipitation as shown in fig 3 a the outstanding peak at binding energy of 1072 3 ev attributed to na 1s was reduced in the sequence of the xps spectra of paa cr iii paa and precipitates as shown in fig 3b the high resolution xps spectrum of o 1s in paa can be fitted with two components located at 531 7 and 532 6 ev which correspond to co and c o species respectively for the high resolution xps spectrum of cr iii paa the o 1s peak showed a small shift to 531 9 and 532 9 ev fig 3c the o 1s peak of the precipitate of cr iii paa that coprecipitated with al iii shifted to 532 5 and 533 6 ev fig 3d the al 2p peak can be fitted with only one component located at 74 4 ev which corresponds to al o fig s7 these results demonstrated that the free carboxyls in paa and cr iii paa were blocked by al iii the solid state 27al spectrum of the precipitate is shown in fig 4 a a strong peak at 0 ppm indicated that the monomer al was maintained in the precipitate and al iii was the main contributor that participated in cr iii paa this result is consistent with the data of xps fig s7 and the distribution of al iii species calculated by visual mineql 2 40b version fig s2 hence the predominant species of al iii was the main contributor for removal of cr iii paa from wastewater at ph 3 5 the key point of coprecipitation to achieve highly efficient removal of cr iii paa is to sharply decrease its hydrophilia the hydrophilia of cr iii paa after adding al iii was investigated the hydrophilia of cr iii paa was positively correlated to its free carboxyl number three decomposition processes of paa namely water loss anhydride formation and polymer decomposition sequentially occurred during heating anhydride formation was caused by carboxyl conversion and occurred at approximately 225 c artem v d et al 2004 moharram and allam 2007 therefore the free carboxyl numbers of paa cr iii paa and the precipitate of cr iii paa that coprecipitated with al iii were evaluated based on the weight loss caused by anhydride formation to verify the reduction in the hydrophilia of cr iii paa after reacting with al iii as shown in fig 4b the weight loss of paa associated with carboxyl conversion was 24 9 wt for cr iii paa the weight loss caused by the conversion of carboxyl into anhydride decreased to 9 4 wt because a part of its carboxyl combined with cr iii fig 4c the decomposition peak around 225 c in the dtg curve of the precipitate disappeared fig 4d indicating the presence of few free carboxyl groups in the precipitate this finding could be attributed to the fact that the free carboxyl in cr iii paa was blocked by al iii leading to the sharp decrease in the hydrophilia of cr iii paa and the rapid formation of insoluble precipitates 3 3 the al iii binding ability of cr iii paa complex in aqueous solution in this section we evaluated the al iii binding ability of cr iii paa in an aqueous solution by fluorescence titration here the concentrations of al iii in the paa and cr iii paa solutions were controlled to less than 1 9 10 4 mol l to ensure that no precipitate would be generated after adding alcl3 fig 5 a and b shows the fluorescence emission spectra of the paa and cr iii paa solutions added with different concentrations of al iii the fluorescence intensities of the paa and cr iii paa solutions increased with increasing al iii concentration demonstrating the interaction between paa cr iii paa and al iii and the formation of al iii paa and al iii cr iii paa complexes chen et al 2018 lu et al 2019 ryan and weber 1982 based on the ryan weber model the fitting plots of f f 0 of paa and cr iii paa against al iii concentration are displayed in the insets of fig 5 al iii strongly bonded to paa and cr iii paa with conditional stability constants log k m of 3 17 and 3 18 respectively hence paa and cr iii paa easily reacted with al iii in the aqueous solution the cr iii paa removal mechanism by co precipitation with al iii is illustrated in scheme 1 at ph 4 5 al iii as the main al species combined with the free carboxyl in cr iii paa thereby promoting the considerable reduction in the hydrophilia of cr iii paa and the rapid formation of coprecipitates therefore almost all cr iii paa was removed and few al iii remained 3 4 coprecipitation of cr iii paa complex with other polyvalent metal ions to validate that the proposed coprecipitation method is adaptable for a wider range of polyvalent metal ions we further examined the efficiency of removing cr iii and toc from wastewater by using other polyvalent metal ions such as al iii fe iii zr iv and ti iv fig 6 as predicted the cr iii and toc removal efficiencies when using al2 so4 3 were similar to those when using alcl3 fig 1 hence the types of the anion of polyvalent metal salts exerted limited influence on cr iii paa removal meanwhile polyvalent metal ions namely al iii fe iii zr iv and ti iv removed cr iii paa and their residual cr iii concentrations were all lower than 1 5 mg l the residual concentrations of al iii fe iii zr iv and ti iv were 0 45 1 21 0 71 and 0 94 mg l respectively see table 2 these results provided unambiguous evidence that polyvalent metal ions could coprecipitate with cr iii paa to remove cr iii and toc without introducing secondary pollution the precipitates of cr iii paa that coprecipitated with al iii fe iii zr iv and ti iv were collected and characterized through fesem analysis fig 7 the collected precipitates were dispersive nanoparticles with average sizes of 50 2 32 6 24 5 and 19 1 nm inset of fig 7 tga was conducted to investigate the hydrophilia of the precipitates fig 8 the weight loss caused by carboxyl conversion at 225 c sharply decreased in all of the precipitates hence most carboxyl groups in cr iii paa were blocked by the polyvalent metal ions and the process led to considerable decrease in the hydrophilia of the precipitates this phenomenon provided distinct evidence that polyvalent metal ions exhibited potential for removal of soluble cr iii organic complexes 3 5 validation on actual industrial wastewater the feasibility and applicability of the proposed coprecipitation method for removing cr iii organic complexes were evaluated on wastewater samples from three separate tanneries as listed in table 3 the concentrations of total cr in the three tannery wastewater samples treated with alcl3 were reduced to 0 34 0 87 and 0 73 mg l respectively which met the strict discharge standard of china 1 5 mg l cr vi was not detected in wastewater treated by coprecipitation the concentrations of residual al were 0 98 1 21 and 0 74 mg l pac coagulation and active carbon adsorption were utilized to treat tannery wastewater and compared with the proposed method after pac coagulation and active carbon adsorption the residual cr concentrations were 14 4 and 18 9 mg l respectively and the initial total cr concentration of tannery wastewater was 23 5 mg l hence the proposed coprecipitation method was more applicable for removing soluble cr iii organic complexes from tannery wastewater than coagulation and adsorption with its satisfactory performance coprecipitation is a promising option for efficiently removing cr iii organic complexes from actual wastewater 4 conclusion this study proposed a coprecipitation strategy that uses polyvalent metal ions to efficiently remove soluble organics metal organic complexes aops became popular to remove cr iii organic complexes from wastewater but these processes generated cr vi in our proposed coprecipitation method sufficient polyvalent metal ions blocked the free carboxyl of cr iii paa and resulted in the sharp decrease in the hydrophilia of cr iii paa and the rapid formation of insoluble coprecipitates at the optimum ph in which many vacant orbitals of the polyvalent metal ions were reserved the method efficiently removed highly soluble cr iii paa complexes without introducing secondary pollution the polyvalent metal ions were coprecipitated with cr iii paa without requiring additional operations cr vi was not detected in the treated wastewater in contrast to that in aops indicating the low risk of generating secondary pollution moreover the coprecipitation method efficiently removed water soluble cr iii organic complexes from actual tannery wastewater the cr iii concentration in the treated wastewater satisfied the discharge standard in addition polyvalent metal ions are widely used and are low cost materials in many fields this work provides new insights into removal of soluble organics metal organic complexes and validates that the proposed method exhibits huge potential for efficient removal of cr iii organic complexes

tang et al 2018 in brief 3 15 g of paa and 0 25 g of cr2 so4 3 were added into 1000 ml of deionized water the mixture was adjusted to ph 4 0 by adding 1 0 mol l hcl and incubated at 40 c for 2 h after cooling to 20 c and filtering through polyethersulfone membrane 0 22 Î¼m the filtrate was collected as the cr iii paa solution the concentrations of cr iii and total organic carbon toc were 45 6 and 546 1 mg l respectively only cr iii paa and free paa existed in the cr iii paa solution because excess paa was used to completely chelate cr iii the particle sizes of cr iii paa in the solution ranged from 3 nm to 7 nm no tyndall effect was observed when the cr iii paa solution was illuminated by 650 nm laser fig s1 actual tannery wastewater was sampled at the end of post tanning processes from three tanneries in china the properties of wastewater are listed in table 1 2 2 removal of cr iii paa complex from cr iii paa solution by using alcl3 2 2 1 batch experiments batch experiments were conducted to investigate crucial parameters such as solution ph al iii to carboxyl mole ratio al cooh reaction time and reaction temperature that influenced cr iii paa removal efficiency different

as mean with standard deviation the precipitates were rapidly washed with deionized water to remove excess dissolved species and freeze dried under vacuum the dried precipitates were used for characterization the paa and cr iii paa solutions were freeze dried as control to further understand the cr iii paa removal mechanism by using al iii especially to distinguish the complexation of alcl3 from the coagulation a typical coagulant pac was chosen to treat the cr iii paa solution alcl3 and pac were separately added into the cr iii paa solution where al cooh was 1 2 2 the mixtures were placed at 20 c for 5 min and their ph was maintained at ph 3 5 and 6 0 during the reaction then the mixtures were centrifuged at 5000 r min for 5 min and the supernatants were taken for measurement of cr iii concentration 2 2 2 solid characterization the morphology changes in chemical and electronic states al species and hydrophilia of the precipitates were evaluated and compared

investigate the binding ability of al iii protas et al 2018 in the present study the fluorescence emission spectra of paa solution ph 4 0 toc 546 1 mg l and cr iii paa solution cr iii concentration 45

conditional stability constant k m was calculated by fitting the titration results with the ryan weber equation ryan and weber 1982 1 f f 0 1 f ml f 0 1 1 2 k m c l 1 k m c l k m c m 1 k m c l k m c m 2 4 k m 2 c l c m where f 0 and f are the fluorescence intensities of paa cr iii paa solution before and after the addition of al iii respectively f ml is the limited fluorescence intensity of paa cr iii paa solution at al iii concentration of c m and c l is the total ligand concentration 2 3 coprecipitation of cr iii paa complex with other polyvalent metal ions stock solutions of al2 so4 3 0 63 mmol al l fe2 so4 3 0 63 mmol fe l zr so4 2 0 315 mmol zr l and ti so4 2 0 315 mmol ti l were prepared then different volumes of al2 so4 3 0 5 ml fe2 so4 3 0 5 ml zr so4 2 1 0 ml and ti so4 2 1 0 ml solutions were added into 100 ml of cr iii paa solution the concentrations of these polyvalent metal ions were all 3 15 mmol l here the added volumes of polyvalent metal solutions were different but small enough and therefore their influence was insignificant the ph of the four mixtures was adjusted to their optimal values namely 3 5 2 7 1 5 and 1 5 respectively which were lower than the precipitation ph of the metal ions after reacting for 5 min at 20 c the mixtures were centrifuged at 5000 r min for 5 min to separate the precipitates from the supernatant the residual concentrations of cr iii toc and polyvalent metal ions in the supernatant were analyzed as mentioned above all the experiments were conducted in triplicate and the results are presented as mean with standard deviation moreover the morphology and hydrophilia of the precipitates were characterized 2 4 validation on actual industrial wastewater actual industrial wastewater samples from tanneries were treated with alcl3 to verify the practical application of the coprecipitation method a certain amount of alcl3 solution the concentration of al was 3 70 mmol l was added into 250 ml of actual tannery wastewater the ph of the mixtures was adjusted to 3 5 after reacting for 5 min at 20 c the mixtures were centrifuged at 5000 r min for 5 min to separate the precipitates from the supernatant the supernatant was collected to measure residual cr iii and toc concentrations all the experiments were conducted in triplicate and the results are presented as mean with standard deviation the efficiency of the coprecipitation method for removing cr iii organic complexes from tannery wastewater was compared with those of common methods including pac coagulation and activated carbon adsorption for pac coagulation the ph of tannery wastewater was adjusted to 6 5 and pac 1000 mg l was added to wastewater after stirring at 40 r min for 20 min the mixtures were settled for 30 min for activated carbon adsorption 250 mg of activated carbon was added into 250 ml of tannery wastewater the initial ph was adjusted to 5 0 the mixture was placed in a shaking bath at 20 c for 6 h with 120 r min 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of cr iii paa complex by alcl3 the effect of ph was first investigated because it controls the ionization of carboxyl in cr iii paa and the state of al species of alcl3 duan et al 2014 jiang et al 2019 as shown in fig 1 a at ph 3 5 the residual cr iii and toc concentrations decreased to 5 9 and 95 4 mg l respectively at ph 2 5 the residual cr iii and toc concentrations were higher than those at ph 3 5 because the carboxyl in cr iii paa pka of coo in paa 4 75 was difficult to ionize thereby hindering the reaction between al iii and cr iii paa and the formation of precipitates himstedt et al 2011 at ph 4 5 the vacant orbital of al iii was occupied by hydroxyls oh and al2 oh 2 4 al3 oh 4 5 and al oh 3 were formed fig s2 these compounds inhibited the complexation of al iii with cr iii paa leading to low efficiency for removal of cr iii paa hence the efficient removal of cr iii paa was dependent on the ionization of carboxyl in cr iii paa and the existence of al iii species to further investigate the effect of al species on cr iii paa removal the cr iii removal efficiencies by alcl3 at ph 3 5 and 6 0 were compared with that by pac at ph 6 0 it was found that the cr iii removal efficiency by alcl3 at ph 3 5 was approximately 1 3 times higher than that by alcl3 at ph 6 0 and 2 5 times higher than that by pac at ph of 6 0 fig s3 these results indicated that al3 in alcl3 was more useful in removing cr iii paa compared with polymeric al in pac and also implied that the removal mechanism of coprecipitation with alcl3 was different from that of coagulation with pac the residual al concentration was 1 2 mg l at ph 3 5 indicating that al iii coprecipitated with cr iii paa besides the chemical sludge containing organics cr iii and al iii can be recycled to prepare a polymetallic tanning agent moreover no secondary pollution was generated through the proposed coprecipitation method coprecipitation for removing soluble cr iii paa depends on the reaction between al iii and the free carboxyl groups of cr iii paa the effect of al cooh on cr iii paa removal was investigated fig 1b the cr iii concentration decreased from 38 2 mg l to 0 87 mg l with increasing al cooh and the toc concentration decreased from 458 5 mg l to 61 9 mg l the residual concentrations of cr iii and toc considerably decreased when the al cooh was higher than 1 6 this is because although 1 mol al with coordination number of 6 can theoretically react with 6 mol carboxyl pinkas et al 1994 song et al 2019 steric hindrance and limited reaction conditions adversely affect the reaction between al and carboxyl hence high al cooh 1 6 was required to ensure that the free carboxyl in cr iii paa can be encapsulated by adequate al iii by reducing the hydrophilia of cr iii paa to achieve high cr iii and toc removal efficiencies the effect of reaction time on the residual concentrations of cr iii and toc is shown in fig s4 equilibrium was reached after 5 min indicating that cr iii paa was removed within a short period of time because of the kinetic activity of al iii yu et al 2018 the residual concentrations of cr iii and toc decreased with increasing reaction temperature fig s5 up to 80 of cr iii and toc were removed at a low temperature of 10 c indicating that the coprecipitation method was feasible in low temperatures and had wider universality than biological treatments sulphated castor oil and sulfonated oil were another typical post tanning agents used in tannery and cr iii sulphated castor oil and cr iii sulfonated oil in post tanning wastewater were also difficult to be removed by coagulation method tang et al 2018 however more than 99 0 of cr iii and toc were removed from cr iii sulphated castor oil and cr iii sulfonated oil solutions by using alcl3 under the optimized experimental condition see fig s6 the results indicated that the coprecipitation method is adaptable for removal of other cr iii organic complexes 3 2 mechanism of cr iii paa complex removal through coprecipitation the precipitate of cr iii paa that coprecipitated with al iii was obtained after reacting with al cooh of 1 3 3 at ph 3 5 and 20 c for 5 min and characterized through fesem xps solid state 27al nmr and tga to investigate the mechanism of cr iii paa removal as shown in fig 2 dispersive nanoparticles with average diameter of 55 1 nm were observed in the precipitate this phenomenon implied that complexation occurred between al iii and cr iii paa paa leading to considerable reduction in the hydrophilia of cr iii paa paa and the formation of the precipitate the xps spectrum of the precipitate was compared with those of paa and cr iii paa to identify the complexation between al iii and the free carboxyl of cr iii paa during coprecipitation as shown in fig 3 a the outstanding peak at binding energy of 1072 3 ev attributed to na 1s was reduced in the sequence of the xps spectra of paa cr iii paa and precipitates as shown in fig 3b the high resolution xps spectrum of o 1s in paa can be fitted with two components located at 531 7 and 532 6 ev which correspond to co and c o species respectively for the high resolution xps spectrum of cr iii paa the o 1s peak showed a small shift to 531 9 and 532 9 ev fig 3c the o 1s peak of the precipitate of cr iii paa that coprecipitated with al iii shifted to 532 5 and 533 6 ev fig 3d the al 2p peak can be fitted with only one component located at 74 4 ev which corresponds to al o fig s7 these results demonstrated that the free carboxyls in paa and cr iii paa were blocked by al iii the solid state 27al spectrum of the precipitate is shown in fig 4 a a strong peak at 0 ppm indicated that the monomer al was maintained in the precipitate and al iii was the main contributor that participated in cr iii paa this result is consistent with the data of xps fig s7 and the distribution of al iii species calculated by visual mineql 2 40b version fig s2 hence the predominant species of al iii was the main contributor for removal of cr iii paa from wastewater at ph 3 5 the key point of coprecipitation to achieve highly efficient removal of cr iii paa is to sharply decrease its hydrophilia the hydrophilia of cr iii paa after adding al iii was investigated the hydrophilia of cr iii paa was positively correlated to its free carboxyl number three decomposition processes of paa namely water loss anhydride formation and polymer decomposition sequentially occurred during heating anhydride formation was caused by carboxyl conversion and occurred at approximately 225 c artem v d et al 2004 moharram and allam 2007 therefore the free carboxyl numbers of paa cr iii paa and the precipitate of cr iii paa that coprecipitated with al iii were evaluated based on the weight loss caused by anhydride formation to verify the reduction in the hydrophilia of cr iii paa after reacting with al iii as shown in fig 4b the weight loss of paa associated with carboxyl conversion was 24 9 wt for cr iii paa the weight loss caused by the conversion of carboxyl into anhydride decreased to 9 4 wt because a part of its carboxyl combined with cr iii fig 4c the decomposition peak around 225 c in the dtg curve of the precipitate disappeared fig 4d indicating the presence of few free carboxyl groups in the precipitate this finding could be attributed to the fact that the free carboxyl in cr iii paa was blocked by al iii leading to the sharp decrease in the hydrophilia of cr iii paa and the rapid formation of insoluble precipitates 3 3 the al iii binding ability of cr iii paa complex in aqueous solution in this section we evaluated the al iii binding ability of cr iii paa in an aqueous solution by fluorescence titration here the concentrations of al iii in the paa and cr iii paa solutions were controlled to less than 1 9 10 4 mol l to ensure that no precipitate would be generated after adding alcl3 fig 5 a and b shows the fluorescence emission spectra of the paa and cr iii paa solutions added with different concentrations of al iii the fluorescence intensities of the paa and cr iii paa solutions increased with increasing al iii concentration demonstrating the interaction between paa cr iii paa and al iii and the formation of al iii paa and al iii cr iii paa complexes chen et al 2018 lu et al 2019 ryan and weber 1982 based on the ryan weber model the fitting plots of f f 0 of paa and cr iii paa against al iii concentration are displayed in the insets of fig 5 al iii strongly bonded to paa and cr iii paa with conditional stability constants log k m of 3 17 and 3 18 respectively hence paa and cr iii paa easily reacted with al iii in the aqueous solution the cr iii paa removal mechanism by co precipitation with al iii is illustrated in scheme 1 at ph 4 5 al iii as the main al species combined with the free carboxyl in cr iii paa thereby promoting the considerable reduction in the hydrophilia of cr iii paa and the rapid formation of coprecipitates therefore almost all cr iii paa was removed and few al iii remained 3 4 coprecipitation of cr iii paa complex with other polyvalent metal ions to validate that the proposed coprecipitation method is adaptable for a wider range of polyvalent metal ions we further examined the efficiency of removing cr iii and toc from wastewater by using other polyvalent metal ions such as al iii fe iii zr iv and ti iv fig 6 as predicted the cr iii and toc removal efficiencies when using al2 so4 3 were similar to those when using alcl3 fig 1 hence the types of the anion of polyvalent metal salts exerted limited influence on cr iii paa removal meanwhile polyvalent metal ions namely al iii fe iii zr iv and ti iv removed cr iii paa and their residual cr iii concentrations were all lower than 1 5 mg l the residual concentrations of al iii fe iii zr iv and ti iv were 0 45 1 21 0 71 and 0 94 mg l respectively see table 2 these results provided unambiguous evidence that polyvalent metal ions could coprecipitate with cr iii paa to remove cr iii and toc without introducing secondary pollution the precipitates of cr iii paa that coprecipitated with al iii fe iii zr iv and ti iv were collected and characterized through fesem analysis fig 7 the collected precipitates were dispersive nanoparticles with average sizes of 50 2 32 6 24 5 and 19 1 nm inset of fig 7 tga was conducted to investigate the hydrophilia of the precipitates fig 8 the weight loss caused by carboxyl conversion at 225 c sharply decreased in all of the precipitates hence most carboxyl groups in cr iii paa were blocked by the polyvalent metal ions and the process led to considerable decrease in the hydrophilia of the precipitates this phenomenon provided distinct evidence that polyvalent metal ions exhibited potential for removal of soluble cr iii organic complexes 3 5 validation on actual industrial wastewater the feasibility and applicability of the proposed coprecipitation method for removing cr iii organic complexes were evaluated on wastewater samples from three separate tanneries as listed in table 3 the concentrations of total cr in the three tannery wastewater samples treated with alcl3 were reduced to 0 34 0 87 and 0 73 mg l respectively which met the strict discharge standard of china 1 5 mg l cr vi was not detected in wastewater treated by coprecipitation the concentrations of residual al were 0 98 1 21 and 0 74 mg l pac coagulation and active carbon adsorption were utilized to treat tannery wastewater and compared with the proposed method after pac coagulation and active carbon adsorption the residual cr concentrations were 14 4 and 18 9 mg l respectively and the initial total cr concentration of tannery wastewater was 23 5 mg l hence the proposed coprecipitation method was more applicable for removing soluble cr iii organic complexes from tannery wastewater than coagulation and adsorption with its satisfactory performance coprecipitation is a promising option for efficiently removing cr iii organic complexes from actual wastewater 4 conclusion this study proposed a coprecipitation strategy that uses polyvalent metal ions to efficiently remove soluble organics metal organic complexes aops became popular to remove cr iii organic complexes from wastewater but these processes generated cr vi in our proposed coprecipitation method sufficient polyvalent metal ions blocked the free carboxyl of cr iii paa and resulted in the sharp decrease in the hydrophilia of cr iii paa and the rapid formation of insoluble coprecipitates at the optimum ph in which many vacant orbitals of the polyvalent metal ions were reserved the method efficiently removed highly soluble cr iii paa complexes without introducing secondary pollution the polyvalent metal ions were coprecipitated with cr iii paa without requiring additional operations cr vi was not detected in the treated wastewater in contrast to that in aops indicating the low risk of generating secondary pollution moreover the coprecipitation method efficiently removed water soluble cr iii organic complexes from actual tannery wastewater the cr iii concentration in the treated wastewater satisfied the discharge standard in addition polyvalent metal ions are widely used and are low cost materials in many fields this work provides new insights into removal of soluble organics metal organic complexes and validates that the proposed method exhibits huge potential for efficient removal of cr iii organic complexes

17921,the expansion of invasive alien species ias is a growing concern to the uk water industry because of their diverse impacts on water quality infrastructure and eradication costs new regulations reinforcing the industry s responsibilities beyond operational costs coupled with continued range expansion and establishment of new ias will increase damages to tackle ias effectively the water industry requires reliable information about which species pose the greatest risk to operations and which areas are most vulnerable to invasion here we assess potential biosecurity threats for the 24 water companies in the uk using well established modelling research techniques such as risk assessment and distribution modelling using a consensus approach with environmental managers and water companies we identified 11 ias of concern for the uk water industry including five plants three crustaceans two molluscs and one fish these invaders pose important hazards in terms of water quality flood protection human health integrity of infrastructures recreational and aesthetic values amongst others we used distribution models to predict their potential expansion under current and future 2050 climate scenarios within each of the 24 water companies in the uk water companies in the south east of england cambridge water anglian water affinity water and thames water are under the highest risk of invasional meltdown from multiple ias both now and under future scenarios the quagga mussel poses the most serious risk of immediate spread and may exacerbate the impacts of the widespread zebra mussel for the water industry the information generated in this study can support the prioritization of species and regions at risk so that funds for prevention and eradication of invasions are well allocated ultimately this study demonstrates that scientific risk assessments usually restricted to the academic and public sectors can be extremely useful to guide decision making by the private sector graphical abstract image 1 keywords invasive alien species biosecurity climate change quagga mussel river thames water companies risk assessment 1 introduction invasive alien species ias are any non native animal or plant that has the ability to spread causing damage to the environment our economy human health and the way we live definition of terms according to the gbnnss 2019 they represent a major threat to native species and ecosystems worldwide causing damage worth billions of pounds to the uk economy every year williams et al 2010 aquatic ias are particularly problematic because once introduced they are difficult to detect and challenging if not impossible to control and eradicate gallardo et al 2015 more than 130 freshwater ias are currently present in the uk s freshwater network with ca 40 of them first reported in the thames region a global hotspot of freshwater biological invasions jackson and grey 2013 keller et al 2009 moreover the number of ias in the uk and globally is increasing at an accelerated rate in direct relationship with growing globalization and freight transport seebens et al 2017 climate change may further expand the potential range of warm water species alter pathways of freshwater invasion influence the chance of ias establishment aggravate their impacts and the vulnerability of water ecosystems towards invasion kernan 2015 rahel and olden 2008 direct management costs for freshwater ias in great britain have been estimated at 26 million each year oreska and aldridge 2011 of which at least 4 6 million are borne by the water industry williams et al 2010 these cost estimates are conservative and do not include direct damage to infrastructures and service losses resulting from infestations furthermore under the new legislation responsibilities of the water industry extend beyond impacts on their own operations and will be expected cover wider ecological impacts on water quality ecosystem services aesthetics flood prevention third party users e g anglers boaters land owners and the health and safety of both employees and visitors to its sites eu reg 1143 2014 for this reason continued range expansion of existing ias in the uk coupled with establishment of new invaders means that the overall costs associated with biological invasions are set to increase for the 24 water and sewage companies sharing water management responsibility in the uk to tackle ias cost effectively the water industry needs to have reliable information about which species pose the greatest risk to operations and which areas are most vulnerable to invasion however while there is growing understanding of their general importance globally spatially explicit information on which ias may establish where they may occur and the consequences they may have is extremely patchy formal risk assessment procedures were initially developed to screen weeds and plant pests and are currently applied in a variety of contexts such as the conservation of native biodiversity blackburn et al 2014 the implementation of european regulations roy et al 2018b national black listing of species e g in the uk baker et al 2008 food security efsa 2011 and plant pest protection kenis et al 2012 such assessments are often performed by researchers and to a lesser extent environmental authorities with little contribution from other relevant stakeholders capitalizing their practical experience while at the same time following the quality standards of scientific risk assessments has the potential to optimize the allocation of resources towards biological invasions species distribution models sdm are increasingly used as a complement to risk assessments to locate areas that are most susceptible to invasion now and in the future guisan and thuiller 2005 helping environmental authorities identify and prioritize regions at high risk gallardo and aldridge 2013b in spite of their potential sdms have rarely been applied to support

industry across the uk making use of well established risk assessment and modelling techniques in particular this study aims to i generate a prioritized list of invaders of concern for the water industry and ii map their current and future distribution under 2050 climate change scenarios this information is fundamental for water companies to design effective prevention plans and protect their strategic assets the systematic risk assessment of ias has been shown to produce net economic benefits for the horticulture industry particularly since the economic costs from ias persist for long periods of time keller et al 2007 the application of scientific assessments to the water industry has been more limited yet benefits may be even higher since time lags of aquatic organisms tend to be shorter than for terrestrial plants and the likelihood of control and eradication is even more challenging gallardo et al 2015 the novelty of this study relies in the collaboration with the water

list of 100 of the world s worst ias produced by the invasive species specialist group issg of the iucn lowe et al 2000 step 2 short list of ias the long list was short listed to 29 ias after a first round of consultation with the steering group that included representatives from the environment agency the scottish environment protection agency and 14 water companies short listed species were identified at least once by members of the steering group as causing a negative impact on the water industry in terms of estates and land management raw water sources and supply habitats and wildlife recreation drinking water treatment and waste water treatment step 3 consensus building nineteen water companies then scored the 29 short listed ias according to the following scale 1 minimal risk localised and minor risks easy to reverse impacts 2 minor risk localised and moderate risks difficult to reverse impacts 3 moderate risk regional and moderate risks difficult to reverse impacts 4 major risk regional and major risks difficult to reverse impacts and 5 massive risk widespread and major risks irreversible impacts the evidence of impacts associated with each of the 29 species was discussed and challenged in turn in agreeing a final top 10 the steering group combined the killer shrimp and demon shrimp into one group dikerogammarus spp due to the similarity of their impacts and control however in our study we separated them because of differences in their current distribution in europe and the uk which may affect the results of spatial analysis consequently our final list includes 11 ias of concern 2 3 spatial analysis of risk for the water industry spatial analyses of risk were conducted using species distribution models sdm these models assume that the species currently occupies the whole range of environmental conditions it can tolerate and thus the environmental information from the invaded locations can be used to characterise its ecological niche sdms also assume that distribution depends on a set of abiotic usually climatic variables disregarding limitations related to predation competition and dispersal ability which are rarely limiting for invasive species jeschke et al 2012 2 3 1 data on the species occurrence information on the current global native and invaded spatial distribution of the 11 ias was obtained from the global

meaningfulness to explain the large scale distribution of species we added geographic elevation m to better represent the habitat of aquatic species we chose a 30 arcsecond resolution approximately 1 1 km at the equator for variables used as predictors this is the highest resolution available for global variables and provides best grounds to characterise the bioclimatic niche of species among different global circulation models we chose the community climate system model version 4 ccsm4 and two representative concentration pathways rcp that represent two extremes of the potential range of future conditions ipcc 2013 the optimistic scenario rcp 2 6 considers a future world where greenhouse gas emissions reach a peak and then are reduced substantially over time leading to very low greenhouse gas concentration levels van vuuren et al 2007 the pessimistic scenario rcp 8 5 on the contrary is characterized by increasing emissions over time that lead to high greenhouse gas concentration levels riahi et al 2007 the average global temperature is predicted to increase by 1 5 c and 4 9 c respectively 2 5 model calibration and projection to investigate the climatic suitability of uk to selected ias we used the package biomod version 3 1 64 biodiversity modelling thuiller et al 2009 in the statistical software r cran 3 1 3 r core team 2014 for input biomod models use the dataset of species occurrences and the set of climatic predictors that might affect the likelihood of species establishment four different algorithms were used to model the ecological niche of the species generalized linear models glm generalized boosted models gbm random forest rf and maxent ideally models are calibrated with information on the presence and absence of species absence information is however rarely available and unreliable in the case of ias that are still expanding for this reason we randomly selected 10 000 pseudo absences from the background the common practice in sdm modelling this process was repeated three times to avoid results being affected by any specific set of pseudo absences as no independent data existed to evaluate the predictive performance of the models presence data were split randomly into two subsets 70 of the original data was used for training the models and the remaining 30 for evaluation araÃºjo and new 2007 three cross validations were run to account for the uncertainty associated to such dataset partition thus for each species 36 model replicates were run 4 algorithms x 3 pseudo absence datasets x 3 cross validations an ensemble model thuiller et al 2009 was finally created weighting the 36 model replicates by their predictive performance with a threshold of tss 0 7 several criteria available in biomod were considered for model evaluation the area under the roc curve roc the sensitivity true positives and specificity true negatives of the model the true skill statistic tss and the success rate sr number of testing records correctly predicted by the model after calibration ensemble models were projected onto the focus area to obtain suitability maps suitability is a measure of the match with the climatic conditions of locations currently invaded by a species and ranges from 0 completely dissimilar to 100 perfect match to compare scenarios easily the optimal threshold maximizing the tss of the model maxtss was used to produce binary presence absence maps barbet massin et al 2012 this means that rather than using an arbitrary 50 threshold the optimum value maximizing the sensitivity and specificity of the model is statistically calculated for each individual species binary maps allow the identification of broad geographic regions where suitable climatic conditions may facilitate the successful establishment of an invasive species finally all maps were combined together to produce heat maps useful to describe general spatial patterns at the uk scale and to identify cold and hot spots of invasion heat maps are generated by simply combining binary maps and thus values range from 0 no ias predicted present to 11 all evaluated ias predicted present 2 6 range expansion under climate change to quantify the potential range expansion of ias under climate change we calculated changes in the area occupied by each species under the two future scenarios 2050 optimistic and 2050 pessimistic we also calculated mean suitability scores and their expected evolution over time in each of the 24 water companies calculations were done using spatial statistic tools of arcgis v 10 0 2 7 prioritization of ias and water companies to rank the 11 ias of concern by the cumulative risk they pose to each water company we calculated a risk score r as follows eq 1 1 r 1 1 0 5 current 1 1 0 25 2050 opt 1 1 0 25 2050 pes 1 1 where r1 1 refers to the total risk score posed by species 1 to water company 1 current1 1 is the mean suitability of species 1 within the boundaries of water company 1 under the current scenario and 2050opt1 1 and 2050pes1 1 the mean suitability value under the two future scenarios respectively the index therefore represents the sum of risk scores extracted from the three scenarios weighted so that the current scenario will bear more importance in the final ranking potential r values range from 0 when conditions within a water company are unsuitable for the species under the three scenarios to 100 when conditions are optimum we finally calculated the combined risk associated to the 11 ias for each water company tr total risk score range between 0 and 1100 which allowed us to rank them according to total biosecurity risks 3 results 3 1 invasive species of concern for the uk water industry the final selection of species of concern included five plants three crustaceans two molluscs and one fish table 1 most of the selected ias are already widely spread in the uk particularly the japanese knotweed himalayan balsam and new zealand pigmyweed fig a2 in contrast the quagga mussel is locally restricted to south east england fig a2 and the round goby has not yet been reported in the wild in uk colonization by the 11 ias of concern directly affects operations of the water industry and have major impacts on the environment summarized in table 1 3 2 spatial analysis of risk for the water industry models calibrated with the global occurrence of ias and a set of climatic predictors showed high accuracy roc 0 94 sensitivity between 80 and 95 success rate between 80 and 99 table 2 the most important variables contributing to the models were temperature of the warmest max t and the coldest months min t the predicted suitability for invasive plants and crustaceans was very high for all companies fig 2 and was predicted to remain high or very high under future scenarios mean suitability scores for each water company under current and future scenarios available in table a1 interestingly in spite of their common origin the climatic suitability for the two mussels was markedly different fig 2 it was high in english water companies for the well established zebra mussel with a lower probability of presence in scottish water welsh water and south west water where the species has not been able to establish yet table a1 suitability was considerably lower for the recent invader the quagga mussel currently localized in the thames catchment fig 2 in comparison the killer and demon shrimps showed very similar suitability across water companies very low values across the north and west of uk e g welsh water northern ireland water scottish water south west water united utilities and high in the south east e g anglian water cambridge water affinity water table a1 and fig 2 suitability for the round goby not yet present in uk was very low across all company boundaries fig 2 the total area occupied by ias is predicted to increase under future scenarios by an average 6 and 12 according to the 2050 optimistic and pessimistic scenarios respectively table 3 the two shrimps round goby and floating pennywort are the species predicted to capitalize upon climatic changes the most with increases of up to 18 of their current coverage under the optimistic 2050 scenario and 81 according to the pessimistic 2050 scenario in contrast the signal crayfish is predicted to lose between 3 and 22 of its current coverage in the uk table 3 water companies under the highest overall risk of invasion now and in the future included cambridge water anglian water affinity water and thames water fig 3 and table 4 at the other extreme of the gradient northern ireland water welsh water south west water and scottish water were predicted to be the least affected companies by the species investigated in this study fig 3 and table 4 4 discussion 4 1 water companies under risk of invasional meltdown prioritizing actions requires knowing which species are likely to be most harmful their current distribution and pathways and vectors of spread several of the species evaluated in this study were already widespread in the uk particularly across the south east of england accordingly the heat map points to this area as the most prone to colonization by multiple invaders fig 3 affecting water companies like cambridge water anglian water affinity water and thames water table 4 the concentration of ias in south east england is in accordance to previous studies and has been related to the closeness with mainland europe the location of commercial ports of international relevance a well developed network of canals linking different catchments high population density and intense use of rivers and lakes for recreation chapman et al 2020 gallardo and aldridge 2015 jackson and grey 2013 the fact that first uk records of all recent invaders have been located within the boundaries of some of these companies e g the killer shrimp in cambridge water the quagga mussel in thames water both validates our models and reinforces their prioritization as hotspots of aquatic invasions the widespread distribution of the zebra mussel across south eastern england represents an additional risk factor because it has commonly been suggested to drive invasional meltdowns gallardo and aldridge 2015 this is a situation where one invader favours the establishment of subsequent invaders whose combined impacts exceed those of the individual species simberloff and von holle 1999 zebra mussels provide habitat complexity food sources and refuge to invasive shrimps fish and crayfish and their filtering activities can increase light penetration and therefore encourage invasive aquatic plants sousa et al 2009 2014 certainly many of the aquatic species investigated in this study select zebra mussel beds as habitat including the demon shrimp kobak et al 2009 killer shrimp macneil et al 2010 round goby gaygusuz et al 2007 signal crayfish zu ermgassen and aldridge 2011 as well as several invasive aquatic plants ricciardi 2001 while the consequences of invasional meltdowns have only been investigated in natural habitats and not in the artificial environments created by the water industry it is reasonable to expect multiple invaders to aggravate operational limitations and cause exponential costs of control water companies currently implement species specific monitoring schemes for high profile invaders like the zebra mussel or the signal crayfish but a broader approach on pathway management both within and between catchments could allow companies to manage a suite of ias simultaneously and therefore cost effectively new technologies such as remote sensing ustin et al 2002 environmental dna darling and mahon 2011 rees et al 2014 and drone sampling lally et al 2019 constitute promising instruments for future risk assessment and control 4 2 priority invaders for the uk water industry among the 11 ias evaluated in this study the quagga mussel is possibly one of the most worrying species native from the ponto caspian region it was detected in the thames water region in september 2014 aldridge et al 2014 confirming previous risk assessments pointing to this mussel as the highest threat to british waters gallardo and aldridge 2015 roy et al 2014 initial evaluation suggest that the species is more widely distributed than the current known location in the lower river thames river lea and associated tributaries aldridge 2015 aldridge et al 2014 and that it may establish widely across england western and southern wales and central scotland gallardo and aldridge 2015 natural spread of the quagga mussel is predominantly expected downstream although animals e g waterfowl can also move it upstream reynolds et al 2015 additionally human mediated dispersal is likely to drive the secondary spread of the species associated to boating shipping angling and especially water transfers between the thames and other catchments chapman et al 2020 gallardo and aldridge 2018 smith et al 2020 due to their ability to colonise hard surfaces zebra and quagga mussels constitute first and foremost a major fouling problem for raw water dependent infrastructures causing damage and increased operating expenses molloy 1998 the filtering activity of invasive mussels substantially modifies water quality with positive and negative consequences they increase water transparency and reduce nutrient loads from agriculture mclaughlan and aldridge 2013 but can cause cyanobacterial blooms the growth of actinomycetes and the creation of geosmin causing taste and odour problems that are difficult and costly to correct nerenberg et al 2000 vogel et al 1997 besides water quality and infrastructures quagga and zebra mussels negatively affect recreational water activities in different ways in recreational boats for instance they attach and damage engines causing overheating hull fouling increase fuel consumption because of greater drag and colonization of fishing nets and navigational buoys drags them under the water aldridge et al 2004 minchin et al 2002 sousa et al 2014 the fact that zebra mussels are already widespread across some water companies should not lead to complacency about invasion by their counterparts quinn et al 2014 quagga mussels tend to invade deeper waters than zebra mussels and can quickly outcompete them e g matthews et al 2013 quagga mussels may thus be able to foul intake pipes that take in water too cold for zebra mussels to tolerate increasing costs and jeopardizing the operational capacity of the water industry to provide clean water according to our models anglian water southern water thames water and wessex water are under the highest risk of infestation by quagga mussels and should take this threat seriously fig 2 and table a1 the five invasive plants pose a serious health and safety threat to the water industry and its operations that requires periodic control and eradication for instance rapidly growing japanese knotweed can compromise the integrity of flood defence structures scott and marrs 1984 and dense stands can impede water flow and exacerbate flooding with dead stems swept away and causing blockages downstream lavoie 2017 consequently the cost of japanese knotweed to the uk economy has been estimated at 166 million per year williams et al 2010 dense mats of floating pennywort have limited navigation in some watercourses newman and dawson 1999 carrying a more modest yet important cost of 25 million per year williams et al 2010 himalayan balsam can lead to increased erosion of riverbanks as it leaves soils bare when it dies back in winter greenwood and kuhn 2014 new zealand pigmyweed forms dense mats that impede recreational activities such as boating canoeing fishing and swimming in addition mats of vegetation decrease aesthetic values and can be mistaken as dry land a danger to animals and humans sheppard et al 2006 the presence of giant hogweed poses a serious threat to health any contact of skin with the plant can result in phyto photodermatitis denness et al 2013 essential oils may pose a risk to the eyes skin and respiratory system jakubska busse et al 2013 and the sap can be mutagenic clarke 1975 the five invasive plants are already widespread in uk fig a2 and so the opportunity to prevent their establishment has been long since lost nonetheless it is important to mitigate the impact of widespread invaders which usually bear the highest costs impacts of crayfish and fish are mostly environmental the signal crayfish transmits the crayfish plague aphanomyces astaci which has decimated native european crayfish populations holdich et al 2009 burrowing into riverbanks by signal crayfish can also lead to increased water turbidity bank erosion increased fluvial sediment mobilisation and eventually bank collapse harvey et al 2011 the high predatory pressure of the killer and demon shrimps can reduce the diversity of native amphipods dick and platvoet 2000 and affect the quality and distribution of fisheries casellato et al 2007 for instance observations suggest that trout and perch are feeding increasingly on the killer shrimp which could drive changes in the population and distribution of fish and catchability for anglers madgwick and aldridge 2011 invasive shrimps may also serve as an intermediate host for parasites such as echinorhyneys truttae and pomphorynclus laevis that cause disease in salmonids and reduce fishery value rewicz et al 2014 the round goby is the only invader of concern not yet present in the uk the risk of gobies crossing the british channel from the netherlands has been highlighted by a british horizon scanning performed by parrot et al 2009 the authors warned that when the presence of gobies in the lower rhine reaches a high density they are likely to be transported to other ports likewise a recent assessment predicted 95 probability that the round goby has already crossed the english channel but remains so far unnoticed gallardo and aldridge 2015 the round goby may negatively interfere with anglers as they remove bait from hooks and predate on eggs and juveniles of native fish species corkum et al 2004 the sweeping dominance of ias in aquatic communities may further have implications for river water quality monitoring and compliance with the water framework directive hatton ellis 2008 the priority list of ias assessed here represents those species that are likely to cause the highest impacts to water companies now or in the near future however other species that have not been screened here could also establish and cause unexpected impacts this includes the rest of the 172 long listed ias see 2 2 but also species that are not yet present in the uk in fact seebens et al 2018 estimated that one quarter of all emerging ias were not recorded as invasive before and were therefore almost impossible to anticipate a recent horizon scan of ias not present in europe identified a number of freshwater species that may pose a future risk to the uk water industry roy et al 2018a of greatest concern is the golden mussel limnoperna fortunei this species is native to asia but has established widely throughout south america where it causes biofouling problems comparable to those experienced from zebra and quagga mussels karatayev et al 2007 furthermore changing trade patterns under brexit means that future invasions in the uk may come from novel pathways and vectors browne et al 2019 an important challenge for the water industry is the treatment of large volumes water to ensure either the prevention of movement from one catchment to another or even within a catchment many ias produce small larvae or dispersive cysts that can pass through most filters and the application of biocides may require specific regulatory approvals which make treatment difficult consideration must be made not only of the species to be controlled but also of the impacts of the intervention on non target organisms the wider ecosystem and on other uses of the waterbody oliveira et al 2017 the selection of the most suitable intervention must take into account its wider acceptability to stakeholders and the general public a balance between the cost and likely benefits and an assessment of the likelihood of reinvasion 4 3 increasing invasion risk under climate change climate change models anticipate a substantial increase in annual temperature from 2 to 6 c and precipitation from 16 to 55 mm by 2050 changes that may shift the climatic conditions of the uk closer to many of the invaders optima most of the species in our study with the exception of the signal crayfish exhibited a potential expansion of their coverage with climate change which is especially acute in the case of the killer shrimp demon shrimp and round goby other studies have anticipated the northwards expansion of ias with climate change for instance a recent study suggested a potential 15 20 expansion in the distribution of the zebra mussel in europe gallardo and aldridge 2013a a reasonable figure considering its high ability to adapt to novel climates exemplified by its rapid invasion in the north american and european continents in contrast models suggest a decrease in the suitable climate for signal crayfish which is also in accordance with previous studies gallardo and aldridge 2013a beyond range expansion climate change may also affect water quantity quality and habitat structure which can in turn affect the location of suitable habitats for establishment it has been suggested for instance that climate change will affect river flows sediment loads the mobility and dilution of contaminants oxygen depletion and toxic algal blooms during low flows whitehead et al 2009 changing environments are also likely to modify human activities and could result in increases in or creation of new activities associated with the vectors and pathways of invasion for instance water transfers from the severn to the thames river suggested as an adaptation strategy to climate change to ensure water supply pose a serious risk of inter basin exchange of aquatic invaders gallardo and aldridge 2018 many water companies are introducing biosecurity measures or policy to educate and inform third party users of water industry infrastructure and assets e g the check clean dry campaign introduced for boating and angling uses of sites www nonnativespecies org checkcleandry sutcliffe et al 2018 however this campaign only controls certain potential pathways for exposure to ias additional attention is needed on the introduction and relocation of plant and equipment by both supply chain partners and employees in the carrying out of operational duties as these could transfer ias biosecurity protocols are therefore required across both internal operations and external contractors 4 4 limitation of climate change models although the factors evaluated in this study provide valuable information on the effects of climate change on ias the inclusion of other predictors more directly related to species dispersal and establishment may further improve the predictive capacity of models unfortunately no global dataset has yet been gathered on water chemistry the intensity of inland fishing or recreational and boating activities but see chapman et al 2020 although such information has been successfully used before to inform ias control and management at the local scale e g copp et al 2007 elith et al 2010 we must also note that models reflect suitability that is probabilities of invasion in the event of an introduction and not absolute survival limits a high suitability does not necessarily mean the species will establish but simply that conditions are ideal environmentally suitable areas may never be occupied because of historical dispersal or biotic limitations jimÃ©nez valverde et al 2011 particularly in the case of aquatic species for the purpose of preventing species invasions it is nevertheless preferable to overestimate rather than to underestimate their potential distribution it is also important to recognise that ias have the capacity to occupy wider niches than those predicted from their existing range gallardo et al 2013 and so models may underestimate potential ranges that could be eventually occupied 5 conclusions the most important implications of this study include using tools such as structured risk assessment and sdms can help the water industry allocate resources towards the most important invaders under current and future climate scenarios invasive species of concern for the water industry include five plants three crustaceans two molluscs and one fish these species pose a serious health and safety threat to the water industry and its operations including damage to infrastructures changes in water quality increased risk and severity of floods limited navigation reduced recreational and aesthetic value reduced biodiversity fish kills and altered riverbank stability the south east of england represents a hotspot of aquatic invasions the costs of ias are expected to be especially acute for cambridge water anglian water affinity water and thames water the quagga mussel is the most worrying species this is because of its potential expansion across water companies serious ecological and economic impacts and interaction with existing zebra mussel populations climate change may exacerbate the impacts of biological invasions climate changes may not only expand the areas suitable for invasion but also promote adaptation strategies such as water transfers that may in turn facilitate invasions risk assessments including distribution models support water companies aiming to design effective prevention strategies to protect their strategic assets and to meet legal responsibilities data provided in this study is

17921,the expansion of invasive alien species ias is a growing concern to the uk water industry because of their diverse impacts on water quality infrastructure and eradication costs new regulations reinforcing the industry s responsibilities beyond operational costs coupled with continued range expansion and establishment of new ias will increase damages to tackle ias effectively the water industry requires reliable information about which species pose the greatest risk to operations and which areas are most vulnerable to invasion here we assess potential biosecurity threats for the 24 water companies in the uk using well established modelling research techniques such as risk assessment and distribution modelling using a consensus approach with environmental managers and water companies we identified 11 ias of concern for the uk water industry including five plants three crustaceans two molluscs and one fish these invaders pose important hazards in terms of water quality flood protection human health integrity of infrastructures recreational and aesthetic values amongst others we used distribution models to predict their potential expansion under current and future 2050 climate scenarios within each of the 24 water companies in the uk water companies in the south east of england cambridge water anglian water affinity water and thames water are under the highest risk of invasional meltdown from multiple ias both now and under future scenarios the quagga mussel poses the most serious risk of immediate spread and may exacerbate the impacts of the widespread zebra mussel for the water industry the information generated in this study can support the prioritization of species and regions at risk so that funds for prevention and eradication of invasions are well allocated ultimately this study demonstrates that scientific risk assessments usually restricted to the academic and public sectors can be extremely useful to guide decision making by the private sector graphical abstract image 1 keywords invasive alien species biosecurity climate change quagga mussel river thames water companies risk assessment 1 introduction invasive alien species ias are any non native animal or plant that has the ability to spread causing damage to the environment our economy human health and the way we live definition of terms according to the gbnnss 2019 they represent a major threat to native species and ecosystems worldwide causing damage worth billions of pounds to the uk economy every year williams et al 2010 aquatic ias are particularly problematic because once introduced they are difficult to detect and challenging if not impossible to control and eradicate gallardo et al 2015 more than 130 freshwater ias are currently present in the uk s freshwater network with ca 40 of them first reported in the thames region a global hotspot of freshwater biological invasions jackson and grey 2013 keller et al 2009 moreover the number of ias in the uk and globally is increasing at an accelerated rate in direct relationship with growing globalization and freight transport seebens et al 2017 climate change may further expand the potential range of warm water species alter pathways of freshwater invasion influence the chance of ias establishment aggravate their impacts and the vulnerability of water ecosystems towards invasion kernan 2015 rahel and olden 2008 direct management costs for freshwater ias in great britain have been estimated at 26 million each year oreska and aldridge 2011 of which at least 4 6 million are borne by the water industry williams et al 2010 these cost estimates are conservative and do not include direct damage to infrastructures and service losses resulting from infestations furthermore under the new legislation responsibilities of the water industry extend beyond impacts on their own operations and will be expected cover wider ecological impacts on water quality ecosystem services aesthetics flood prevention third party users e g anglers boaters land owners and the health and safety of both employees and visitors to its sites eu reg 1143 2014 for this reason continued range expansion of existing ias in the uk coupled with establishment of new invaders means that the overall costs associated with biological invasions are set to increase for the 24 water and sewage companies sharing water management responsibility in the uk to tackle ias cost effectively the water industry needs to have reliable information about which species pose the greatest risk to operations and which areas are most vulnerable to invasion however while there is growing understanding of their general importance globally spatially explicit information on which ias may establish where they may occur and the consequences they may have is extremely patchy formal risk assessment procedures were initially developed to screen weeds and plant pests and are currently applied in a variety of contexts such as the conservation of native biodiversity blackburn et al 2014 the implementation of european regulations roy et al 2018b national black listing of species e g in the uk baker et al 2008 food security efsa 2011 and plant pest protection kenis et al 2012 such assessments are often performed by researchers and to a lesser extent environmental authorities with little contribution from other relevant stakeholders capitalizing their practical experience while at the same time following the quality standards of scientific risk assessments has the potential to optimize the allocation of resources towards biological invasions species distribution models sdm are increasingly used as a complement to risk assessments to locate areas that are most susceptible to invasion now and in the future guisan and thuiller 2005 helping environmental authorities identify and prioritize regions at high risk gallardo and aldridge 2013b in spite of their potential sdms have rarely been applied to support decision making in the private sector the horticulture industry is an exception with numerous examples using sdm to anticipate the spread of weeds and plant pests across the world e g xylella fastidiosa in italy bosso et al 2016 the western cherry fruit fly rhagoletis indifferens in california kumar et al 2014 the fruit fly bactrocera invadens in africa de meyer et al 2010 the apple moth epiphyas postvittana in the us lozier and mills 2011 or the the fungus puccinia psidii in australia kriticos et al 2013 the present study aims to assess emerging biosecurity issues for the water industry across the uk making use of well established risk assessment and modelling techniques in particular this study aims to i generate a prioritized list of invaders of concern for the water industry and ii map their current and future distribution under 2050 climate change scenarios this information is fundamental for water companies to design effective prevention plans and protect their strategic assets the systematic risk assessment of ias has been shown to produce net economic benefits for the horticulture industry particularly since the economic costs from ias persist for long periods of time keller et al 2007 the application of scientific assessments to the water industry has been more limited yet benefits may be even higher since time lags of aquatic organisms tend to be shorter than for terrestrial plants and the likelihood of control and eradication is even more challenging gallardo et al 2015 the novelty of this study relies in the collaboration with the water industry benefiting from their direct knowledge about the impacts of ias on water extraction transfer storage distribution treatment waste disposal and third party users e g land owners boaters anglers information that is difficult if not impossible to find in the scientific literature our research framework can be easily applied to other study regions and complemented with cost benefit analyses at different spatio temporal scales 2 methods 2 1 water companies in uk there are 12 major water and sewage companies and another 12 smaller water only companies in the uk for this project we digitised water company boundaries from published maps in arcgis v10 0 fig 1 with 27 476 km2 served anglian water is the largest water company assessed whereas cholderton and district represents the smallest only 21 km2 served 2 2 selection of ias of concern for the water industry a structured forecasting exercise was undertaken to determine the ias most relevant to the uk water industry over the period 2015 2050 the exercise followed the delphi method that involved multiple rounds of consultation and consensus building following roy et al 2018a roy et al 2020 step 1 long list of ias first we identified a long list of 172 ias by screening eight different existing priority lists 1 the horizon scanning for new ias in england parrot et al 2009 2 the list of the worst ias threatening biological diversity in europe compiled by the european environmental agency within the framework of the streamlining european biodiversity indicators for 2010 initiative https biodiversity europa eu

2015 by the uk tag alien species group asg extracted from gbnnss 2019 7 the list of 100 of the worst ias in europe identified by project daisie http www europe aliens org roy et al 2018a and 8 the list of 100 of the world s worst ias produced by the invasive species specialist group issg of the iucn lowe et al 2000 step 2 short list of ias the long list was short listed to 29 ias after a first round of consultation with the steering group that included representatives from the environment agency the scottish environment protection agency and 14 water companies short listed species were identified at least once by members of the steering group as causing a negative impact on the water industry in terms of estates and land management raw water sources and supply habitats and wildlife recreation drinking water treatment and waste water treatment step 3 consensus building nineteen water companies then scored the 29 short listed ias according to the following scale 1 minimal risk localised and minor risks easy to reverse impacts 2 minor risk localised and moderate risks difficult to reverse impacts 3 moderate risk regional and moderate risks difficult to reverse impacts 4 major risk regional and major risks difficult to reverse impacts and 5 massive risk widespread and major risks irreversible impacts the evidence of impacts associated with each of the 29 species was discussed and challenged in turn in agreeing a final top 10 the steering group combined the killer shrimp and demon shrimp into one group dikerogammarus spp due to the similarity of their impacts and control however in our study we separated them because of differences in their current distribution in europe and the uk which may affect the results of spatial analysis consequently our final list includes 11 ias of concern 2 3 spatial analysis of risk for the water industry spatial analyses of risk were conducted using species distribution models sdm these models assume that the species currently occupies the whole range of environmental conditions it can tolerate and thus the environmental information from the invaded locations can be used to characterise its ecological niche sdms also assume that distribution depends on a set of abiotic usually climatic variables disregarding limitations related to predation competition and dispersal ability which are rarely limiting for invasive species jeschke et al 2012 2 3 1 data on the species occurrence information on the current global native and invaded spatial distribution of the 11 ias was obtained from the global

nbn org uk last accessed may 2014 maps for the global occurrence of each of the species evaluated in this report can be consulted in figure a1 2 4 data on climatic predictors to model the potential distribution of ias five global bioclimatic variables were obtained from worldclim http www worldclim org for the present representing the 1950 2000 period and two alternative 2050 scenarios 2046 2065 period maximum temperature of the warmest month max t c minimum temperature of the coldest month min t c precipitation of the wettest month max pp mm precipitation of the driest month min pp mm and precipitation seasonality pp season mm these bioclimatic variables represent annual trends seasonality and extremes that are relevant to explain species survival and were thus selected based on their meaningfulness to explain the large scale distribution of species we added geographic elevation m to better represent the habitat of aquatic species we chose a 30 arcsecond resolution approximately 1 1 km at the equator for variables used as predictors this is the highest resolution available for global variables and provides best grounds to characterise the bioclimatic niche of species among different global circulation models we chose the community climate system model version 4 ccsm4 and two representative concentration pathways rcp that represent two extremes of the potential range of future conditions ipcc 2013 the optimistic scenario rcp 2 6 considers a future world where greenhouse gas emissions reach a peak and then are reduced substantially over time leading to very low greenhouse gas concentration levels van vuuren et al 2007 the pessimistic scenario rcp 8 5 on the contrary is characterized by increasing emissions over time that lead to high greenhouse gas concentration levels riahi et al 2007 the average global temperature is predicted to increase by 1 5 c and 4 9 c respectively 2 5 model calibration and projection to investigate the climatic suitability of uk to selected ias we used the package biomod version 3 1 64 biodiversity modelling thuiller et al 2009 in the statistical software r cran 3 1 3 r core team 2014 for input biomod models use the dataset of species occurrences and the set of climatic predictors that might affect the likelihood of species establishment four different algorithms were used to model the ecological niche of the species generalized linear models glm generalized boosted models gbm random forest rf and maxent ideally models are calibrated with information on the presence and absence of species absence information is however rarely available and unreliable in the case of ias that are still expanding for this reason we randomly selected 10 000 pseudo absences from the background the common practice in sdm modelling this process was repeated three times to avoid results being affected by any specific set of pseudo absences as no independent data existed to evaluate the predictive performance of the models presence data were split randomly into two subsets 70 of the original data was used for training the models and the remaining 30 for evaluation araÃºjo and new 2007 three cross validations were run to account for the uncertainty associated to such dataset partition thus for each species 36 model replicates were run 4 algorithms x 3 pseudo absence datasets x 3 cross validations an ensemble model thuiller et al 2009 was finally created weighting the 36 model replicates by their predictive performance with a threshold of tss 0 7 several criteria available in biomod were considered for model evaluation the area under the roc curve roc the sensitivity true positives and specificity true negatives of the model the true skill statistic tss and the success rate sr number of testing records correctly predicted by the model after calibration ensemble models were projected onto the focus area to obtain suitability maps suitability is a measure of the match with the climatic conditions of locations currently invaded by a species and ranges from 0 completely dissimilar to 100 perfect match to compare scenarios easily the optimal threshold maximizing the tss of the model maxtss was used to produce binary presence absence maps barbet massin et al 2012 this means that rather than using an arbitrary 50 threshold the optimum value maximizing the sensitivity and specificity of the model is statistically calculated for each individual species binary maps allow the identification of broad geographic regions where suitable climatic conditions may facilitate the successful establishment of an invasive species finally all maps were combined together to produce heat maps useful to describe general spatial patterns at the uk scale and to identify cold and hot spots of invasion heat maps are generated by simply combining binary maps and thus values range from 0 no ias predicted present to 11 all evaluated ias predicted present 2 6 range expansion under climate change to quantify the potential range expansion of ias under climate change we calculated changes in the area occupied by each species under the two future scenarios 2050 optimistic and 2050 pessimistic we also calculated mean suitability scores and their expected evolution over time in each of the 24 water companies calculations were done using spatial statistic tools of arcgis v 10 0 2 7 prioritization of ias and water companies to rank the 11 ias of concern by the cumulative risk they pose to each water company we calculated a risk score r as follows eq 1 1 r 1 1 0 5 current 1 1 0 25 2050 opt 1 1 0 25 2050 pes 1 1 where r1 1 refers to the total risk score posed by species 1 to water company 1 current1 1 is the mean suitability of species 1 within the boundaries of water company 1 under the current scenario and 2050opt1 1 and 2050pes1 1 the mean suitability value under the two future scenarios respectively the index therefore represents the sum of risk scores extracted from the three scenarios weighted so that the current scenario will bear more importance in the final ranking potential r values range from 0 when conditions within a water company are unsuitable for the species under the three scenarios to 100 when conditions are optimum we finally calculated the combined risk associated to the 11 ias for each water company tr total risk score range between 0 and 1100 which allowed us to rank them according to total biosecurity risks 3 results 3 1 invasive species of concern for the uk water industry the final selection of species of concern included five plants three crustaceans two molluscs and one fish table 1 most of the selected ias are already widely spread in the uk particularly the japanese knotweed himalayan balsam and new zealand pigmyweed fig a2 in contrast the quagga mussel is locally restricted to south east england fig a2 and the round goby has not yet been reported in the wild in uk colonization by the 11 ias of concern directly affects operations of the water industry and have major impacts on the environment summarized in table 1 3 2 spatial analysis of risk for the water industry models calibrated with the global occurrence of ias and a set of climatic predictors showed high accuracy roc 0 94 sensitivity between 80 and 95 success rate between 80 and 99 table 2 the most important variables contributing to the models were temperature of the warmest max t and the coldest months min t the predicted suitability for invasive plants and crustaceans was very high for all companies fig 2 and was predicted to remain high or very high under future scenarios mean suitability scores for each water company under current and future scenarios available in table a1 interestingly in spite of their common origin the climatic suitability for the two mussels was markedly different fig 2 it was high in english water companies for the well established zebra mussel with a lower probability of presence in scottish water welsh water and south west water where the species has not been able to establish yet table a1 suitability was considerably lower for the recent invader the quagga mussel currently localized in the thames catchment fig 2 in comparison the killer and demon shrimps showed very similar suitability across water companies very low values across the north and west of uk e g welsh water northern ireland water scottish water south west water united utilities and high in the south east e g anglian water cambridge water affinity water table a1 and fig 2 suitability for the round goby not yet present in uk was very low across all company boundaries fig 2 the total area occupied by ias is predicted to increase under future scenarios by an average 6 and 12 according to the 2050 optimistic and pessimistic scenarios respectively table 3 the two shrimps round goby and floating pennywort are the species predicted to capitalize upon climatic changes the most with increases of up to 18 of their current coverage under the optimistic 2050 scenario and 81 according to the pessimistic 2050 scenario in contrast the signal crayfish is predicted to lose between 3 and 22 of its current coverage in the uk table 3 water companies under the highest overall risk of invasion now and in the future included cambridge water anglian water affinity water and thames water fig 3 and table 4 at the other extreme of the gradient northern ireland water welsh water south west water and scottish water were predicted to be the least affected companies by the species investigated in this study fig 3 and table 4 4 discussion 4 1 water companies under risk of invasional meltdown prioritizing actions requires knowing which species are likely to be most harmful their current distribution and pathways and vectors of spread several of the species evaluated in this study were already widespread in the uk particularly across the south east of england accordingly the heat map points to this area as the most prone to colonization by multiple invaders fig 3 affecting water companies like cambridge water anglian water affinity water and thames water table 4 the concentration of ias in south east england is in accordance to previous studies and has been related to the closeness with mainland europe the location of commercial ports of international relevance a well developed network of canals linking different catchments high population density and intense use of rivers and lakes for recreation chapman et al 2020 gallardo and aldridge 2015 jackson and grey 2013 the fact that first uk records of all recent invaders have been located within the boundaries of some of these companies e g the killer shrimp in cambridge water the quagga mussel in thames water both validates our models and reinforces their prioritization as hotspots of aquatic invasions the widespread distribution of the zebra mussel across south eastern england represents an additional risk factor because it has commonly been suggested to drive invasional meltdowns gallardo and aldridge 2015 this is a situation where one invader favours the establishment of subsequent invaders whose combined impacts exceed those of the individual species simberloff and von holle 1999 zebra mussels provide habitat complexity food sources and refuge to invasive shrimps fish and crayfish and their filtering activities can increase light penetration and therefore encourage invasive aquatic plants sousa et al 2009 2014 certainly many of the aquatic species investigated in this study select zebra mussel beds as habitat including the demon shrimp kobak et al 2009 killer shrimp macneil et al 2010 round goby gaygusuz et al 2007 signal crayfish zu ermgassen and aldridge 2011 as well as several invasive aquatic plants ricciardi 2001 while the consequences of invasional meltdowns have only been investigated in natural habitats and not in the artificial environments created by the water industry it is reasonable to expect multiple invaders to aggravate operational limitations and cause exponential costs of control water companies currently implement species specific monitoring schemes for high profile invaders like the zebra mussel or the signal crayfish but a broader approach on pathway management both within and between catchments could allow companies to manage a suite of ias simultaneously and therefore cost effectively new technologies such as remote sensing ustin et al 2002 environmental dna darling and mahon 2011 rees et al 2014 and drone sampling lally et al 2019 constitute promising instruments for future risk assessment and control 4 2 priority invaders for the uk water industry among the 11 ias evaluated in this study the quagga mussel is possibly one of the most worrying species native from the ponto caspian region it was detected in the thames water region in september 2014 aldridge et al 2014 confirming previous risk assessments pointing to this mussel as the highest threat to british waters gallardo and aldridge 2015 roy et al 2014 initial evaluation suggest that the species is more widely distributed than the current known location in the lower river thames river lea and associated tributaries aldridge 2015 aldridge et al 2014 and that it may establish widely across england western and southern wales and central scotland gallardo and aldridge 2015 natural spread of the quagga mussel is predominantly expected downstream although animals e g waterfowl can also move it upstream reynolds et al 2015 additionally human mediated dispersal is likely to drive the secondary spread of the species associated to boating shipping angling and especially water transfers between the thames and other catchments chapman et al 2020 gallardo and aldridge 2018 smith et al 2020 due to their ability to colonise hard surfaces zebra and quagga mussels constitute first and foremost a major fouling problem for raw water dependent infrastructures causing damage and increased operating expenses molloy 1998 the filtering activity of invasive mussels substantially modifies water quality with positive and negative consequences they increase water transparency and reduce nutrient loads from agriculture mclaughlan and aldridge 2013 but can cause cyanobacterial blooms the growth of actinomycetes and the creation of geosmin causing taste and odour problems that are difficult and costly to correct nerenberg et al 2000 vogel et al 1997 besides water quality and infrastructures quagga and zebra mussels negatively affect recreational water activities in different ways in recreational boats for instance they attach and damage engines causing overheating hull fouling increase fuel consumption because of greater drag and colonization of fishing nets and navigational buoys drags them under the water aldridge et al 2004 minchin et al 2002 sousa et al 2014 the fact that zebra mussels are already widespread across some water companies should not lead to complacency about invasion by their counterparts quinn et al 2014 quagga mussels tend to invade deeper waters than zebra mussels and can quickly outcompete them e g matthews et al 2013 quagga mussels may thus be able to foul intake pipes that take in water too cold for zebra mussels to tolerate increasing costs and jeopardizing the operational capacity of the water industry to provide clean water according to our models anglian water southern water thames water and wessex water are under the highest risk of infestation by quagga mussels and should take this threat seriously fig 2 and table a1 the five invasive plants pose a serious health and safety threat to the water industry and its operations that requires periodic control and eradication for instance rapidly growing japanese knotweed can compromise the integrity of flood defence structures scott and marrs 1984 and dense stands can impede water flow and exacerbate flooding with dead stems swept away and causing blockages downstream lavoie 2017 consequently the cost of japanese knotweed to the uk economy has been estimated at 166 million per year williams et al 2010 dense mats of floating pennywort have limited navigation in some watercourses newman and dawson 1999 carrying a more modest yet important cost of 25 million per year williams et al 2010 himalayan balsam can lead to increased erosion of riverbanks as it leaves soils bare when it dies back in winter greenwood and kuhn 2014 new zealand pigmyweed forms dense mats that impede recreational activities such as boating canoeing fishing and swimming in addition mats of vegetation decrease aesthetic values and can be mistaken as dry land a danger to animals and humans sheppard et al 2006 the presence of giant hogweed poses a serious threat to health any contact of skin with the plant can result in phyto photodermatitis denness et al 2013 essential oils may pose a risk to the eyes skin and respiratory system jakubska busse et al 2013 and the sap can be mutagenic clarke 1975 the five invasive plants are already widespread in uk fig a2 and so the opportunity to prevent their establishment has been long since lost nonetheless it is important to mitigate the impact of widespread invaders which usually bear the highest costs impacts of crayfish and fish are mostly environmental the signal crayfish transmits the crayfish plague aphanomyces astaci which has decimated native european crayfish populations holdich et al 2009 burrowing into riverbanks by signal crayfish can also lead to increased water turbidity bank erosion increased fluvial sediment mobilisation and eventually bank collapse harvey et al 2011 the high predatory pressure of the killer and demon shrimps can reduce the diversity of native amphipods dick and platvoet 2000 and affect the quality and distribution of fisheries casellato et al 2007 for instance observations suggest that trout and perch are feeding increasingly on the killer shrimp which could drive changes in the population and distribution of fish and catchability for anglers madgwick and aldridge 2011 invasive shrimps may also serve as an intermediate host for parasites such as echinorhyneys truttae and pomphorynclus laevis that cause disease in salmonids and reduce fishery value rewicz et al 2014 the round goby is the only invader of concern not yet present in the uk the risk of gobies crossing the british channel from the netherlands has been highlighted by a british horizon scanning performed by parrot et al 2009 the authors warned that when the presence of gobies in the lower rhine reaches a high density they are likely to be transported to other ports likewise a recent assessment predicted 95 probability that the round goby has already crossed the english channel but remains so far unnoticed gallardo and aldridge 2015 the round goby may negatively interfere with anglers as they remove bait from hooks and predate on eggs and juveniles of native fish species corkum et al 2004 the sweeping dominance of ias in aquatic communities may further have implications for river water quality monitoring and compliance with the water framework directive hatton ellis 2008 the priority list of ias assessed here represents those species that are likely to cause the highest impacts to water companies now or in the near future however other species that have not been screened here could also establish and cause unexpected impacts this includes the rest of the 172 long listed ias see 2 2 but also species that are not yet present in the uk in fact seebens et al 2018 estimated that one quarter of all emerging ias were not recorded as invasive before and were therefore almost impossible to anticipate a recent horizon scan of ias not present in europe identified a number of freshwater species that may pose a future risk to the uk water industry roy et al 2018a of greatest concern is the golden mussel limnoperna fortunei this species is native to asia but has established widely throughout south america where it causes biofouling problems comparable to those experienced from zebra and quagga mussels karatayev et al 2007 furthermore changing trade patterns under brexit means that future invasions in the uk may come from novel pathways and vectors browne et al 2019 an important challenge for the water industry is the treatment of large volumes water to ensure either the prevention of movement from one catchment to another or even within a catchment many ias produce small larvae or dispersive cysts that can pass through most filters and the application of biocides may require specific regulatory approvals which make treatment difficult consideration must be made not only of the species to be controlled but also of the impacts of the intervention on non target organisms the wider ecosystem and on other uses of the waterbody oliveira et al 2017 the selection of the most suitable intervention must take into account its wider acceptability to stakeholders and the general public a balance between the cost and likely benefits and an assessment of the likelihood of reinvasion 4 3 increasing invasion risk under climate change climate change models anticipate a substantial increase in annual temperature from 2 to 6 c and precipitation from 16 to 55 mm by 2050 changes that may shift the climatic conditions of the uk closer to many of the invaders optima most of the species in our study with the exception of the signal crayfish exhibited a potential expansion of their coverage with climate change which is especially acute in the case of the killer shrimp demon shrimp and round goby other studies have anticipated the northwards expansion of ias with climate change for instance a recent study suggested a potential 15 20 expansion in the distribution of the zebra mussel in europe gallardo and aldridge 2013a a reasonable figure considering its high ability to adapt to novel climates exemplified by its rapid invasion in the north american and european continents in contrast models suggest a decrease in the suitable climate for signal crayfish which is also in accordance with previous studies gallardo and aldridge 2013a beyond range expansion climate change may also affect water quantity quality and habitat structure which can in turn affect the location of suitable habitats for establishment it has been suggested for instance that climate change will affect river flows sediment loads the mobility and dilution of contaminants oxygen depletion and toxic algal blooms during low flows whitehead et al 2009 changing environments are also likely to modify human activities and could result in increases in or creation of new activities associated with the vectors and pathways of invasion for instance water transfers from the severn to the thames river suggested as an adaptation strategy to climate change to ensure water supply pose a serious risk of inter basin exchange of aquatic invaders gallardo and aldridge 2018 many water companies are introducing biosecurity measures or policy to educate and inform third party users of water industry infrastructure and assets e g the check clean dry campaign introduced for boating and angling uses of sites www nonnativespecies org checkcleandry sutcliffe et al 2018 however this campaign only controls certain potential pathways for exposure to ias additional attention is needed on the introduction and relocation of plant and equipment by both supply chain partners and employees in the carrying out of operational duties as these could transfer ias biosecurity protocols are therefore required across both internal operations and external contractors 4 4 limitation of climate change models although the factors evaluated in this study provide valuable information on the effects of climate change on ias the inclusion of other predictors more directly related to species dispersal and establishment may further improve the predictive capacity of models unfortunately no global dataset has yet been gathered on water chemistry the intensity of inland fishing or recreational and boating activities but see chapman et al 2020 although such information has been successfully used before to inform ias control and management at the local scale e g copp et al 2007 elith et al 2010 we must also note that models reflect suitability that is probabilities of invasion in the event of an introduction and not absolute survival limits a high suitability does not necessarily mean the species will establish but simply that conditions are ideal environmentally suitable areas may never be occupied because of historical dispersal or biotic limitations jimÃ©nez valverde et al 2011 particularly in the case of aquatic species for the purpose of preventing species invasions it is nevertheless preferable to overestimate rather than to underestimate their potential distribution it is also important to recognise that ias have the capacity to occupy wider niches than those predicted from their existing range gallardo et al 2013 and so models may underestimate potential ranges that could be eventually occupied 5 conclusions the most important implications of this study include using tools such as structured risk assessment and sdms can help the water industry allocate resources towards the most important invaders under current and future climate scenarios invasive species of concern for the water industry include five plants three crustaceans two molluscs and one fish these species pose a serious health and safety threat to the water industry and its operations including damage to infrastructures changes in water quality increased risk and severity of floods limited navigation reduced recreational and aesthetic value reduced biodiversity fish kills and altered riverbank stability the south east of england represents a hotspot of aquatic invasions the costs of ias are expected to be especially acute for cambridge water anglian water affinity water and thames water the quagga mussel is the most worrying species this is because of its potential expansion across water companies serious ecological and economic impacts and interaction with existing zebra mussel populations climate change may exacerbate the impacts of biological invasions climate changes may not only expand the areas suitable for invasion but also promote adaptation strategies such as water transfers that may in turn facilitate invasions risk assessments including distribution models support water companies aiming to design effective prevention strategies to protect their strategic assets and to meet legal responsibilities data provided in this study is

17922,supplying safe drinking water in humanitarian emergencies is critical and source water chlorination is a commonly implemented intervention to provide safe water we evaluated three different source water chlorination programs bucket in line and piped water chlorination in the ongoing humanitarian response in cox s bazar refugee camps in bangladesh we used a mixed methods research protocol including key informant interviews water point observations focus group discussions household surveys and water quality testing the three evaluated programs were implemented at different response stages and required different levels of staffing infrastructure and community mobilization work in the bucket chlorination program highly contaminated open well water was chlorinated in in line and piped water chlorination programs groundwater was treated overall 71 of bucket 36 of in line and 60 of piped water chlorination households had stored water that met free chlorine residual fcr criteria respectively additionally 71 of bucket 86 of in line and 91 of piped water chlorination households had stored water that met escherichia coli e coli criteria 10 e coli cfu 100 ml regression results indicate presence of fcr serving water by pouring and higher source water ph were associated with meeting e coli criteria our results highlight no individual program fully met international standards as implemented although each partially met standards the importance of understanding beneficiary preferences and behavior change campaigns and the benefits and drawbacks of each source water chlorination program must be considered before implementation overall we found appropriate source water chlorination program choice is a continuum depending on humanitarian phase and context therefore we recommend continuing context and phase appropriate source water chlorination programs emphasizing consistent and acceptable chlorine dosage implementing programmatic improvements and incorporating user preferences to reduce microbial contamination and consequently the risk of waterborne diseases graphical abstract image 1 keywords bucket chlorination humanitarian response in line chlorination piped network emergency transition continuum water treatment 1 introduction providing access to safe drinking water sanitation and hygiene wash is critical to human survival infectious disease control and dignity in humanitarian response connolly et al 2004 salama et al 2004 watson et al 2007 chlorination is widely used to treat water in humanitarian settings due to availability ease of use cost effectiveness ease of verification efficacy in inactivating bacterial and viral pathogens and presence of chlorine residual that protects against recontamination during water storage branz et al 2017 in humanitarian response there are multiple methods for responders to chlorinate source water at or before collection which are not as dependent on individual behavior change such as household water treatment sikder et al 2018b along a continuum of increasing structure these include bucket chlorination batch chlorination chlorine dispensers in line chlorination and centrally chlorinated piped water systems in bucket chlorination trained chlorination agents are stationed at water sources to dose beneficiary water containers with chlorine after water collection yates et al 2018 bucket chlorination programs are often short term and rapidly implemented in the initial phase of humanitarian or outbreak response this program was identified as a commonly implemented but severely under researched intervention yates et al 2018 which found one published evaluation of bucket chlorination implemented in a 2010 cholera outbreak in cameroon murphy et al 2018 in this study only 8 of household water samples treated by bucket chlorination in the past 24 h had free chlorine residual fcr 0 2 mg l ongoing mixed methods evaluations of bucket chlorination programs in six humanitarian responses has found that despite variation in program implementation bucket chlorination programs generally improve the quality of household stored water data in preparation batch chlorination and dispensers can be implemented as an emergency stabilizes when small infrastructure can be installed and programs organized in a batch chlorination program water is treated in large tanks at the source from which users collect water directly who and irc 2003 in one evaluation after the 2015 cholera outbreak in tanzania water vendors were targeted to chlorinate large tanks and detectable fcr was found in 70 of the tanks rajasingham et al 2019 in a dispensers program a container of chlorine with a dosing valve is installed next to a water source and managed by a local promoter who also conducts community education across four evaluations in humanitarian contexts dispenser results varied widely reported dispenser use ranged from 9 to 97 confirmed dispenser use ranged from 5 to 87 and effective use ranged from 0 to 81 yates et al 2018 it was determined dispensers could be but are not always an appropriate source water chlorination intervention in humanitarian contexts in line chlorination is when a passive chlorination device using granulated liquid or tabular chlorine is installed on a water source such as a pipe or borehole water is automatically chlorinated before the point of collection an evaluation of in line chlorination systems in refugee camps in south sudan found it was difficult to maintain recommended fcr in stored household water due to under dosing at the source ali et al 2015 additionally an evaluation of a relief to recovery program after the 2010 earthquake and cholera outbreak in haiti found that none of the in line devices 0 21 0 were operational two to three years after implementation rayner et al 2016 lastly chlorinated water supply using infrastructure storage treatment tank pipe network and tap is commonly assumed to be an effective and reliable drinking water supply system acf 2005 who 2017 however no evaluations of piped chlorinated infrastructure were identified in systematic reviews of interventions implemented in humanitarian response yates et al 2018 as can be seen from the data above there are trade offs that exist between different source chlorination options voluntary versus mandatory chlorination extent of operational involvement amount of infrastructure and opportunity for behavior change there have been ongoing questions in the humanitarian response sector about which interventions are most effective and how to balance these trade off s when selecting a program thus understanding the effectiveness of different source water chlorination programs would assist emergency responders to select and implement context appropriate interventions additionally there is a lack of comparison data between different types of source chlorination interventions due to a lack of appropriate study contexts cox s bazar bangladesh is the largest refugee camp in the world as a result of an influx of rohingya refugees in 2017 haar et al 2019 hossain et al 2019 oxfam is an international non governmental organization working in the wash sector in the refugee camps in cox s bazar since 2017 oxfam s chlorination programming in cox s bazar has evolved from the emergency phase 0 6 months to post emergency and protracted phase 2 years unhcr 2018 thus cox s bazar offered a unique opportunity to study source water chlorination interventions along a continuum from bucket chlorination to piped water chlorination as they were being implemented over time we established a partnership with oxfam and unhcr to study three source water chlorination interventions the objective of this research was to systematically compare the field effectiveness of three source water chlorination interventions bucket in line and piped water chlorination 2 methods 2 1 study design to complete evaluations we developed a mixed methods open protocol including key informant interviews with program staff water collection point observations household surveys with water users water quality testing of source and stored household water and focus group discussions with users over the 18 month time frame for data collection we sent a solicitation to participate in research through the global wash cluster listserv and followed up via regular communications with humanitarian wash partners including personal contacts after oxfam and unhcr chlorination programs in cox s bazar were identified for research inclusion we obtained approvals from the donor the implementing organizations camp refugee representatives for local ethics and tufts social behavioral and educational research institutional review board 1712003 for final ethics camp access and tufts global operations to complete the evaluation after approvals were obtained a tufts ph d student deployed to carryout data collection initially the open protocol was developed for bucket chlorination programs only however in the time period allotted for data collection this opportunity in cox s bazar to compare three source water chlorination interventions was identified as such the protocol was adapted and approved for in line and piped water chlorination 2 2 data collection in cox s bazar we worked with oxfam to plan data collection activities so as not to interfere with response activities and hired local enumerators enumerators were trained in a two day training that covered ethics informed consent study design the household survey tool training on context specific language to use for wash vocabulary training on water quality testing and sample collection and practice completing data collection activities program staff key informant interview kii we conducted key informant interviews kiis with program staff from the implementing organizations after receiving informed consent the kiis included 41 questions on program background reason for selection of source water chlorination program program cost staff management program implementation details monitoring and challenges lessons learned and recommendations 2 3 water collection point observation water collection points were visited in the morning and the following activities were completed 1 using a structured observation checklist tailored for each chlorination program type record how water was supplied source type infrastructure description chlorine type and dosing mechanism presence and duties of staff and queueing time 2 collecting water point geographic coordinates using a garmin etrex garmin ltd olathe ks usa 3 testing ph and fcr of the source water using an apera instruments ec60 probe columbus oh usa and lamotte 1200 colorimeter and dpd 1 reagent chestertown md usa as appropriate respectively and 4 collecting a source water sample in a 300 ml whirl pak thio bag nasco fort atkinson wi usa and storing the sample on ice for later microbiological and turbidity analysis 2 4 household survey at water collection points enumerators approached users after water collection asked if they would like to participate in the study and if so obtained consent enumerators then accompanied consenting participants to their households and administered a 76 question survey on household demographics water safety knowledge and attitudes water collection and storage practices water treatment payment and chlorination program likes and dislikes the survey was translated from english to bengali and administered in local chittagonian language with appropriate wash vocabulary during the household survey respondents were asked may i have a cup of drinking water that came from the chlorinated source at the household enumerators measured ph and collected a microbiological water sample as described above and tested fcr using a cn 66 color disk test kit hach company loveland co usa and dpd 1 reagent detection limit 0 2 3 4 mg l we provided color disk comparator kits to enumerators because of their ease of use usability and inexpensiveness compared to a digital colorimeter which was used to more precisely measure fcr at the source murray and lantagne 2015 the enumerators completed the fcr test at least 30 min after water collection from the source after the survey was completed enumerators returned to the water point and approached another user for consent this cycle was continued until enumerators completed the target number of households or security protocols precluded continuing sampling 2 5 water sample testing microbiological samples were processed within 6 h using the membrane filtration method with m coliblue24 media hach company loveland co usa for simultaneous detection of escherichia coli e coli and total coliforms apha awwa wef 1999 samples were diluted appropriately with sterile buffered water vacuum filtered aseptically through 45 Î¼m filters milliporesigma billerica ma usa placed in plastic petri dishes with media soaked pads and incubated using an nq9plus portable incubator darwin chambers st louis mo usa for 24 h at 35 c for quality control two dilution volumes were processed for each sample 10 of samples were duplicated and 5 of samples were blanks we used hach buffered dilution water pillows hach company loveland co and room temperature boiled water to prepare dilution and blank water colonies were counted and concentrations calculated by averaging plate counts within a countable range 1 200 turbidity was measured in nephelometric turbidity units ntu with a calibrated lamotte 2020 turbidimeter chestertown md usa within 8 h of sample collection using water remaining after microbiological analysis 2 6 focus group discussion we completed focus group discussions fgds with water users fgds included 15 questions on water source before emergency at their households before coming to the refugee camps water collection transportation and treatment practices receipt of behavior change campaigns cost of water collection likes dislikes about the chlorination program and recommendations to improve the program 2 7 data analysis we completed qualitative and quantitative data analysis for qualitative data kii and fgd transcripts were coded and refined in nvivo melbourne australia as themes were defined kiis were summarized under themes relating to reasons for choosing different chlorination programs quality control measures staff involvement in behavior change messaging and implementation challenges fgds were summarized by themes water chlorination and disease reduction chlorine taste and or smell and recommendations for program improvement for quantitative analysis we compared demographics water collection practices turbidity fcr and e coli concentration across the three program using chi square test fisher s exact test or kruskal wallis rank sum test as appropriate for binary and continuous variables respectively we pairwise compared programs against two outcome variables percentage of households with 0 2 mg l fcr and percentage of households with 10 e coli colony forming unit cfu 100 ml in the sample water sphere association 2018 we used 10 e coli cfu 100 ml to align with the sphere indicator which recommends 10 e coli cfu 100 ml at point of delivery unchlorinated water results are presented using an area plot to study factors associated with 10 e coli cfu 100 ml in household water samples we used generalized estimating equations with logit link accounting for the clustering effect of each program first we conducted bivariate analysis between 10 e coli cfu 100 ml and outcome variables variables significantly p 0 05 associated in bivariate analysis were included in multivariate analysis then we applied the backward elimination technique to obtain the final model where all independent variables were significant p 0 05 3 results we completed the three evaluations between august 2018 and may 2019 in five camps in cox s bazar including 13 staff chlorination agent kiis 29 water collection point observations 487 household surveys eight focus group discussions with users and 515 water sample tests table 1 all three programs were implemented by oxfam with support from unhcr in the piped water chlorination program and supplied water free of cost to refugees in the following sections evaluation results are presented including program descriptions key informant interviews water point observations and water quality household surveys and water quality and fgds when camp 22 was formed one implementing organization started a bucket chlorination program to treat water collected from ring wells and maintain residual protection against recontamination the implementation included training local non refugee chlorination agents to 1 prepare 1 chlorine solution using high test calcium hypochlorite hth powder in the morning 2 stand next to ring wells with the solution during the day and 3 dose water with chlorine solution depending on the volume upon water collection by the users agents were paid by the implementing agency the program was then turned over to oxfam some months after beginning we evaluated four months after oxfam took over the program which was one week before oxfam discontinued bucket chlorination to replace it with a piped network distributing centrally chlorinated surface water in camps 12 and 19 refugees used groundwater extracted via handpumps approximately four months before the evaluation to ensure water safety and prevent recontamination oxfam attached purall 50h eason pune mh india in line chlorination devices to handpump spouts fig 1 the purall devices contained a chlorinated isocyanurate cartridge that intended to passively dose 1 mg l chlorine into the outflowing water according to the manufacturer each cartridge had a lifetime capacity of treating 125 000 l of water and contained an end of life indicator that turned red when chlorine was emptied easol 2019 this in line chlorination program was a pilot implementation by oxfam to test the effectiveness of using simple technology and existing water sources to supply chlorinated water we evaluated this program up to four months after in line chlorinator device installation in 2018 2019 oxfam constructed piped water chlorination systems in camp 3 and 4 extension to ensure uniform chlorine dose and improve water access as part of the cox s bazar master plan that aimed to construct chlorinated piped water networks for all camps unhcr and oxfam 2018 the system consisted of 1 a solar energy operated submersible pump to extract groundwater 2 one 95 000 l storage tank 3 a chlorine dosing system including solution storage and dosing pump 4 pipe networks and 5 8 12 distribution tapstands with 2 6 taps per stand groundwater was extracted using a solar pump and stored in the tanks the chlorination system automatically dosed a locally prepared hth chlorine solution from a plastic bucket to the piped network before the water flowed to the storage tanks storage tanks were built in elevated locations in the camps and water was gravity fed to tapstands we evaluated this centralized chlorination program in its fifth month of implementation we completed 13 interviews with implementation staff including eight chlorination agents and two agency staff from the bucket chlorination program two agency staff from the in line chlorination program and one agency staff from the piped water supply program qualitative results were summarized under the themes of 1 reasons for selecting the chlorination program 2 quality control 3 involvement in behavior change activities and 4 implementation challenges 3 1 reason for selecting the chlorination program the primary objective driving the selection of each chlorination program was the same to provide safe water to the refugees respondents from the bucket chlorination program indicated that oxfam had inherited the implementation from a predecessor organization that began bucket chlorination activities to address the acute need of people collecting water from open wells in line chlorination respondents indicated that they were in a piloting phase to determine if in line chlorination could be scaled up in camps as devices could be easily connected to pre existing tubewells without requiring a large investment of resources the piped water supply program was implemented as part of the overall cox s bazar strategy to alleviate high costs associated with maintaining tubewells to ensure stable fcr in the supplied water and to ease the water collection process by refugees 3 2 quality control staff from all three programs noted that equipment needed to implement and maintain chlorination programs and test water quality including hth powder chlorine cartridges buckets plumbing tools color comparator and digital fcr test kits and turbidity tubes were provided by oxfam in bucket chlorination agents reported adjusting the chlorine dose depending on water volume in the transport container in in line chlorination staff reported it was not possible to adjust the chlorine dosage piped water chlorine staff reported oxfam determined appropriate chlorine dosage based on aquifer water testing at program onset staff from the bucket chlorination program reported periodically measuring turbidity at collection points and staff from the in line and piped chlorination programs reported periodically measuring fcr at water collection points staff did not report conducting microbiological tests as part of regular monitoring in any program 3 3 staff involvement with behavior change campaigns the reported interaction between program staff and beneficiaries varied between programs bucket chlorination agents interacted with beneficiaries as a function of delivering chlorine directly to their water collection containers agents were asked by oxfam to deliver messages to the beneficiaries pertaining to drinking treated water waiting 30 min from treatment until use and to collect fresh water each day in line chlorination staff did not report direct interaction with beneficiaries however staff reported separately implementing camp wide hygiene promotion activities to promote drinking chlorinated water the piped water chlorination staff also did not report direct beneficiary interaction as part of daily operations but reported a separate behavior change campaign implemented by oxfam to promote safe water consumption 3 4 implementation challenges the most common challenge reported by staff from all programs was user s objection reluctance to drink chlorinated water because of the chlorine smell additionally the bucket chlorination agents noted the work schedule being difficult as they did 8 h shifts seven days per week they also reported concerns about job security and noted that providing chairs and equipment storage would be helpful in line chlorination staff reported the devices were easy to install and operate with a small team however staff noted that it was not possible to adjust chlorine dosage and the end of life indicator was difficult to read additionally staff noted some tampering of the devices at program installation including attempted removal by beneficiaries piped water chlorination staff mentioned the challenge of relying only on solar energy to operate pumps during the rainy season or on cloudy days the duration of pump function was inadequate to extract enough water for all users staff also mentioned it was difficult for them to find suitable locations to drill and construct plants in the crowded camp setting 3 5 water collection point observations across the three evaluations 29 water collection point observations were completed 10 in bucket 9 in in line and 10 in piped water chlorination programs table 2 unimproved sources ringwells were used in the bucket chlorination program in in line and piped water chlorination programs groundwater was extracted using handpumps and an electric submersible pump respectively hth chlorine solution was prepared daily in the bucket and piped water chlorination programs tablet chlorinated isocyanurate in a cartridge was used in in line chlorination the bucket chlorination program was the only program with staff present at water collection points available during working hours 8 00am 4 30pm in bucket and in line chlorination programs the chlorine solution bottle and cartridge were exposed to the sun across all programs queueing time was either none bucket chlorination or on average 5 min in line and piped water chlorination we measured fcr at the water collection point for in line and piped water chlorination programs but not bucket chlorination because chlorine was dosed directly into the user s transport container table 2 mean fcr was 0 9 mg l range 0 05 3 78 mg l sd 1 3 in in line and 0 2 range 0 07 0 40 mg l sd 0 1 in piped water chlorination geomean e coli was 451 cfu 100 ml in untreated bucket chlorination source water 1 5 cfu 100 ml in chlorinated in line and 1 0 cfu 100 ml in chlorinated piped water samples ph was slightly

surveys between the three programs evaluated the percentage of female respondents 34 44 reported school attendance 16 23 and number of reported beds in the household 2 4 2 6 were not significantly different table 3 the mean age of respondents 25 41 number of people living in the house 5 4 6 6 and percentage reporting diarrhea in the past seven days 11 26 were statistically significant between programs p 0 001 with respondents in the bucket chlorination program reporting the highest diarrhea rate 26 respondents were observed to mainly use metal pots for water storage 54 74 followed by buckets 8 25 jerricans 0 19 and jugs 1 30 almost all respondents from the three programs reported using chlorinated water for drinking 97 99 55 64 also reported using chlorinated water for food washing the percentage of observed covered containers varied across programs 20 34 respondents in the piped water chlorination program had the lowest percentage of covering containers 20 during the survey enumerators asked for a cup of water and observed how the respondent collected water from the container the majority of respondents in all three programs were observed to pour water into the cup 76 91 instead of dipping the cup 9 24 reported household water treatment was low at 0 5 reported receiving behavior change messages was 85 in bucket chlorination programs and 41 in piped water chlorination programs reported chlorine taste and or smell unacceptability decreased from 95 in bucket chlorination respondents to 33 in piped water chlorination respondents the percentage of households with fcr 0 2 mg l was 71 36 and 60 in the bucket in line and piped water chlorination programs respectively p 0 001 the percentage of households with 10 e coli cfu 100 ml was 71 86 and 91 in the bucket in line and piped water chlorination programs respectively p 0 001 for the membrane filtration quality assurance and control measures all blanks were negative and duplicate colony counts were within 10 of the corresponding pair count ph and turbidity varied p 0 001 by program in pairwise comparison in line chlorination respondents had a significantly lower percentage of households with fcr 0 2 mg l compared to both bucket chlorination p 0 001 and piped water chlorination p 0 001 the difference between bucket and piped water was not statistically significant fig 2 table 2 additionally the percentage of households with 10 e coli cfu 100 ml was significantly lower in the bucket chlorination program compared to both in line p 0 002 and piped water chlorination p 0 001 the difference between in line chlorination and piped water chlorination was not significantly different p 0 393 ideal program line marks the target goal for each water quality measure in unadjusted

eight fgds in the three evaluations with a total of 63 participants table 1 three main themes were identified 1 high awareness of the link between unchlorinated water consumption and disease 2 mixed perception of chlorine smell and 3 program feedback high awareness of the link between unchlorinated water consumption and disease fgd participants from all three programs knew the importance of drinking chlorinated water to reduce the risk of waterborne diseases in total 34 participants reported they knew they should drink water from a chlorinated source one participant stated i like that the water has medicine chlorine in it when we drink this water we don t get sick but when we drink from outside sources we get sick and another stated we are not getting sick after drinking this water not getting diarrhea this is very good for us it also means that the water doesn t have any bacteria we feel good when we drink this water we don t get sick we give this water to our children and we drink it 3 8 mixed perception of chlorine smell participants from all three programs reported chlorine smell as an issue however the percentage of complaints declined from bucket chlorination 95 to in line chlorination 66 to piped water chlorination 33 programs one bucket chlorination user stated the water we were drinking before did not have any odor this chlorinated water has bad odor some people can t drink chlorinated water because of the odor an in line chlorination user noted we now tolerate the chlorine smell because we know it is for our own good demonstrating an increased acceptance of chlorination 3 9 program feedback three bucket chlorination participants mentioned that chlorination agents were not present at the time they collected water furthermore 23 bucket chlorination respondents reported water quantity was not sufficient 10 reported the sources were too far from their homes and 5 reported water was not available in summer amongst in line chlorination participants one requested reducing the chlorine concentration in the water and six reported the distance to walk to tubewells was too far specifically one respondent explained tubewells were located downhill making it challenging to carry water home of the piped water chlorination participants one reported they preferred collecting water from the tap because it was easy four reported they liked the water taste although three indicated they would prefer drinking filtered water and one reported there was not enough water particularly in the evening to meet basic needs 4 discussion we evaluated three source water chlorination programs in the ongoing humanitarian response in cox s bazar refugee camps in bangladesh using a mixed methods research protocol the three programs were implemented at different stages of the response and required different levels of staffing infrastructure and community mobilization work to our knowledge this is the first comparison of source water chlorination interventions along a continuum within one context our results highlight that no individual program fully met international standards sphere association 2018 unhcr 2018 as implemented although all partially met standards the importance of behavior change campaigns including on chlorine acceptance and chlorine taste and or smell the benefits and drawbacks of each of each source water chlorination program must be considered prior to implementation and consideration of how the continuum is implemented in water supply in protracted emergencies in humanitarian response and outbreak settings there are various international standards for water provision including access standards queuing time distance quantity standards l person day and quality standards fcr e coli sphere association 2018 unhcr 2018 who 2002 these standards are not consistent across international guidance branz et al 2017 generally these guidance documents recommend good access to a minimum of 15 20 l person day of water with a 0 2 0 5 mg l fcr and 1 10 e coli cfu 100 ml at collection delivery the three source water chlorination programs evaluated herein implemented at different phases of the response with different resource availability all had the objective to meet this general set of standards in our results the access indicator of queuing time was minimal across all three programs distance was mentioned as a concern with suggestions to reduce walking time particularly up and down hills and bucket and in line chlorination beneficiaries both requesting all not just some sources be chlorinated conversely piped chlorination beneficiaries found tapstand access convenient across cox s bazar there is sufficient quantity of water however there were barriers to accessing sufficient quantity of chlorinated water including inability to access chlorinated water when bucket chlorination agents were not present and insufficient quantity of piped water when solar panels were not charging for quality indicators the number of households with fcr 0 2 mg l was highest in bucket chlorination programs 71 compared to in line 36 and piped 60 despite degradation of chlorine solution in sunlight and open well water having relatively higher turbidity typically associated with higher chlorine demand gallandat et al 2019 the higher household fcr amongst bucket chlorination beneficiaries can be attributed to multiple factors the low dosage mean 0 2 mg l at source of the piped chlorination system the high variability mean 0 9 mg l sd 1 3 mg l of in line chlorination dosing which lead to over and under dosing the unreadability of the in line chlorinator s end of life cartridge indicator and poor handling including not mixing of chlorine solutions in the piped water chlorination solution these factors are straightforward to address and it is anticipated with minor improvement fcr at household could be significantly more consistent in the in line and piped water chlorination programs ali et al 2015 furthermore the importance of maintaining fcr in drinking water in humanitarian response was highlighted in our data where insufficient fcr was associated with increased e coli contamination which could come from poor source water quality or recontamination from risky household collection and storage behaviors despite bucket chlorination beneficiaries having the highest number of households with fcr 0 2 mg l they did not have the lowest e coli in household stored water overall 91 of piped chlorination households 86 of in line and 71 of bucket chlorination beneficiaries had 10 e coli cfu 100 ml as we could not obtain a pre chlorination sample for in line or piped water chlorination sources we do not know the pre chlorination e coli concentration of those sources as they are deep groundwater sources the contamination can be assumed to be low ahmed et al 2006 however we do know the bucket chlorination sources were highly contaminated and had the highest turbidity we hypothesize the contamination seen in bucket chlorination households was due to a combination of high source contamination and turbidity throughout our results one theme identified was the importance of behavior change messaging consistent with other research from the same settings sikder et al 2020 first the regression results found water serving practices impacted household e coli concentrations which is consistent with previous research trevett et al 2005 additionally in fgds there was increased knowledge of the need to drink chlorinated water to prevent disease when there was direct interaction with program staff as seen in bucket chlorination programs lastly there was increased acceptance of chlorine dosage over time which can be attributed to multiple factors including 1 users could have become accustomed to the taste smell over time 2 users could have been unaware chlorine was being added in in line and piped programs and 3 fcr was lower in in line and piped chlorination programs than bucket chlorination for chlorinated water supply interventions user s chlorine taste and smell acceptability can be a critical factor to program success branz et al 2017 as research completed in both humanitarian and development settings has emphasized the importance of considering local chlorine concentration thresholds taste and or smell before intervening crider et al 2018 mitro et al 2019 overall our results highlight the importance of incorporating beneficiary preference and behavior change into water supply interventions in humanitarian response it is commonly assumed that temporary source water chlorination programs such as bucket chlorination are not as effective as more permanent programs our results show a more subtle story that there are benefits and drawbacks of each intervention at each phase table 4 the bucket chlorination program required minimal infrastructure was implemented rapidly in the initial emergency phase and provided behavior change messages directly to the users at water collection however dosing was dependent on many individuals adhering correctly to a protocol and being present when water was collected in line chlorination had the benefits of rapid installation on existing infrastructure minimal maintenance and 24 h availability of chlorinated water however the chlorine dosage was not adjustable the infrastructure had to be established and beneficiaries had to walk downhill to collect water as implemented in cox s bazar in both bucket and in line chlorination a drawback was not all sources readily accessible to a household were chlorinated additionally the in line chlorinator selected for cox s bazar had an inadequate end of life indicator and the dosage could not be adjusted it is recommended to ameliorate these concerns by improving this device or selecting an alternate in line chlorinator in the future the piped water chlorination program was implemented in later phases of the response when the camp settlements were stable and responders had both time and resources to design and build the water collection treatment and distribution systems benefits of the piped water chlorination program were that it was systematic and centrally managed it was easy to collect sufficient water and easy to maintain a consistent lower chlorine dosage however it was resource intensive and needed trained staff to operate additionally in cox s bazar as implemented it depended on solar power our results indicate that all these chlorination programs can be appropriate and effective depending on context resources time implementation capacity and emergency phase in the unhcr wash manual priorities are outlined by emergency stage as the emergency phase of the first six months where the goal is to save lives by providing immediate access to basic wash services the transition phase of 6 months 2 years where the goal is to transition to cost efficient wash services and the post emergency protracted phase of 2 years and ongoing where the goal is to transition to durable wash services that align with national priorities unhcr 2018 our evaluations document the progression towards systematically managed centralized drinking water supply systems and represent appropriate wash interventions along this emergency transition post emergency continuum our results emphasize the importance of immediate response with available resources while gradually improving services over time in collaboration with a supportive host government such as bangladesh to implement improved services beyond basic humanitarian response it should be noted lack of support or restrictions imposed by host governments can make it difficult for responders to improve services along this continuum mohammed abu lohom et al 2018 sikder et al 2018a limitations of our study included 1 we did not collect fcr measurements for supplied water during the bucket chlorination evaluation e coli pre chlorination in source water in line and piped water chlorination programs or chlorine solution concentration in piped water 2 the bucket chlorination program was at phase out stage during evaluation and might not have been operating at full capacity 3 because of the cross sectional data collection we could not account for seasonal water quality variation which might impact results 4 our evaluation could have impacted responder actions and led to subject bias 5 water ph can have mixed effects on e coli survival and growth conner and kotrola 1995 sharma et al 2004 and thus the association observed in the analysis should be interpreted with caution and 6 while all evaluations were completed in cox s bazar the specific camps for each program were different we do not feel these limitations impacted the results presented herein 5 conclusion access to safe drinking water is critical in humanitarian response we conducted a mixed methods evaluation of three chlorination programs along the acute transition post emergency continuum in cox s bazar we found that programs partially met humanitarian standards for water access quantity and quality with each having their own benefits and drawbacks depending on phase and context additionally understanding beneficiary preferences and behavior change campaigns were found to be critical to source water chlorination program success overall we found appropriate source water chlorination program choice is a continuum depending on humanitarian phase and context our results emphasize the importance of water chlorination regardless of source type water distribution modality and user behavior in humanitarian settings therefore we recommend continuing context and phase appropriate source water chlorination programs emphasizing consistent and acceptable chlorine dosage implementing programmatic improvements and incorporating user preferences to reduce microbial contamination and consequently

17922,supplying safe drinking water in humanitarian emergencies is critical and source water chlorination is a commonly implemented intervention to provide safe water we evaluated three different source water chlorination programs bucket in line and piped water chlorination in the ongoing humanitarian response in cox s bazar refugee camps in bangladesh we used a mixed methods research protocol including key informant interviews water point observations focus group discussions household surveys and water quality testing the three evaluated programs were implemented at different response stages and required different levels of staffing infrastructure and community mobilization work in the bucket chlorination program highly contaminated open well water was chlorinated in in line and piped water chlorination programs groundwater was treated overall 71 of bucket 36 of in line and 60 of piped water chlorination households had stored water that met free chlorine residual fcr criteria respectively additionally 71 of bucket 86 of in line and 91 of piped water chlorination households had stored water that met escherichia coli e coli criteria 10 e coli cfu 100 ml regression results indicate presence of fcr serving water by pouring and higher source water ph were associated with meeting e coli criteria our results highlight no individual program fully met international standards as implemented although each partially met standards the importance of understanding beneficiary preferences and behavior change campaigns and the benefits and drawbacks of each source water chlorination program must be considered before implementation overall we found appropriate source water chlorination program choice is a continuum depending on humanitarian phase and context therefore we recommend continuing context and phase appropriate source water chlorination programs emphasizing consistent and acceptable chlorine dosage implementing programmatic improvements and incorporating user preferences to reduce microbial contamination and consequently the risk of waterborne diseases graphical abstract image 1 keywords bucket chlorination humanitarian response in line chlorination piped network emergency transition continuum water treatment 1 introduction providing access to safe drinking water sanitation and hygiene wash is critical to human survival infectious disease control and dignity in humanitarian response connolly et al 2004 salama et al 2004 watson et al 2007 chlorination is widely used to treat water in humanitarian settings due to availability ease of use cost effectiveness ease of verification efficacy in inactivating bacterial and viral pathogens and presence of chlorine residual that protects against recontamination during water storage branz et al 2017 in humanitarian response there are multiple methods for responders to chlorinate source water at or before collection which are not as dependent on individual behavior change such as household water treatment sikder et al 2018b along a continuum of increasing structure these include bucket chlorination batch chlorination chlorine dispensers in line chlorination and centrally chlorinated piped water systems in bucket chlorination trained chlorination agents are stationed at water sources to dose beneficiary water containers with chlorine after water collection yates et al 2018 bucket chlorination programs are often short term and rapidly implemented in the initial phase of humanitarian or outbreak response this program was identified as a commonly implemented but severely under researched intervention yates et al 2018 which found one published evaluation of bucket chlorination implemented in a 2010 cholera outbreak in cameroon murphy et al 2018 in this study only 8 of household water samples treated by bucket chlorination in the past 24 h had free chlorine residual fcr 0 2 mg l ongoing mixed methods evaluations of bucket chlorination programs in six humanitarian responses has found that despite variation in program implementation bucket chlorination programs generally improve the quality of household stored water data in preparation batch chlorination and dispensers can be implemented as an emergency stabilizes when small infrastructure can be installed and programs organized in a batch chlorination program water is treated in large tanks at the source from which users collect water directly who and irc 2003 in one evaluation after the 2015 cholera outbreak in tanzania water vendors were targeted to chlorinate large tanks and detectable fcr was found in 70 of the tanks rajasingham et al 2019 in a dispensers program a container of chlorine with a dosing valve is installed next to a water source and managed by a local promoter who also conducts community education across four evaluations in humanitarian contexts dispenser results varied widely reported dispenser use ranged from 9 to 97 confirmed dispenser use ranged from 5 to 87 and effective use ranged from 0 to 81 yates et al 2018 it was determined dispensers could be but are not always an appropriate source water chlorination intervention in humanitarian contexts in line chlorination is when a passive chlorination device using granulated liquid or tabular chlorine is installed on a water source such as a pipe or borehole water is automatically chlorinated before the point of collection an evaluation of in line chlorination systems in refugee camps in south sudan found it was difficult to maintain recommended fcr in stored household water due to under dosing at the source ali et al 2015 additionally an evaluation of a relief to recovery program after the 2010 earthquake and cholera outbreak in haiti found that none of the in line devices 0 21 0 were operational two to three years after implementation rayner et al 2016 lastly chlorinated water supply using infrastructure storage treatment tank pipe network and tap is commonly assumed to be an effective and reliable drinking water supply system acf 2005 who 2017 however no evaluations of piped chlorinated infrastructure were identified in systematic reviews of interventions implemented in humanitarian response yates et al 2018 as can be seen from the data above there are trade offs that exist between different source chlorination options voluntary versus mandatory chlorination extent of operational involvement amount of infrastructure and opportunity for behavior change there have been ongoing questions in the humanitarian response sector about which interventions are most effective and how to balance these trade off s when selecting a program thus understanding the effectiveness of different source water chlorination programs would assist emergency responders to select and implement context appropriate interventions additionally there is a lack of comparison data between different types of source chlorination interventions due to a lack of appropriate study contexts cox s bazar bangladesh is the largest refugee camp in the world as a result of an influx of rohingya refugees in 2017 haar et al 2019 hossain et al 2019 oxfam is an international non governmental organization working in the wash sector in the refugee camps in cox s bazar since 2017 oxfam s chlorination programming in cox s bazar has evolved from the emergency phase 0 6 months to post emergency and protracted phase 2 years unhcr 2018 thus cox s bazar offered a unique opportunity to study source water chlorination interventions along a continuum from bucket chlorination to piped water chlorination as they were being implemented over time we established a partnership with oxfam and unhcr to study three source water chlorination interventions the objective of this research was to systematically compare the field effectiveness of three source water chlorination interventions bucket in line and piped water chlorination 2 methods 2 1 study design to complete evaluations we developed a mixed methods open protocol including key informant interviews with program staff water collection point observations household surveys with water users water quality testing of source and stored household water and focus group discussions with users over the 18 month time frame for data collection we sent a solicitation to participate in research through the global wash cluster listserv and followed up via regular communications with humanitarian wash partners including personal contacts after oxfam and unhcr chlorination programs in cox s bazar were identified for research inclusion we obtained approvals from the donor the implementing organizations camp refugee representatives for local ethics and tufts social behavioral and educational research institutional review board 1712003 for final ethics camp access and tufts global operations to complete the evaluation after approvals were obtained a tufts ph d student deployed to carryout data collection initially the open protocol was developed for bucket chlorination programs only however in the time period allotted for data collection this opportunity in cox s bazar to compare three source water chlorination interventions was identified as such the protocol was adapted and approved for in line and piped water chlorination 2 2 data collection in cox s bazar we worked with oxfam to plan data collection activities so as not to interfere with response activities and hired local enumerators enumerators were trained in a two day training that covered ethics informed consent study design the household survey tool training on context specific language to use for wash vocabulary training on water quality testing and sample collection and practice completing data collection activities program staff key informant interview kii we conducted key informant interviews kiis with program staff from the implementing organizations after receiving informed consent the kiis included 41 questions on program background reason for selection of source water chlorination program program cost staff management program implementation details monitoring and challenges lessons learned and recommendations 2 3 water collection point observation water collection points were visited in the morning and the following activities were completed 1 using a structured observation checklist tailored for each chlorination program type record how water was supplied source type infrastructure description chlorine type and dosing mechanism presence and duties of staff and queueing time 2 collecting water point geographic coordinates using a garmin etrex garmin ltd olathe ks usa 3 testing ph and fcr of the source water using an apera instruments ec60 probe columbus oh usa and lamotte 1200 colorimeter and dpd 1 reagent chestertown md usa as appropriate respectively and 4 collecting a source water sample in a 300 ml whirl pak thio bag nasco fort atkinson wi usa and storing the sample on ice for later microbiological and turbidity analysis 2 4 household survey at water collection points enumerators approached users after water collection asked if they would like to participate in the study and if so obtained consent enumerators then accompanied consenting participants to their households and administered a 76 question survey on household demographics water safety knowledge and attitudes water collection and storage practices water treatment payment and chlorination program likes and dislikes the survey was translated from english to bengali and administered in local chittagonian language with appropriate wash vocabulary during the household survey respondents were asked may i have a cup of drinking water that came from the chlorinated source at the household enumerators measured ph and collected a microbiological water sample as described above and tested fcr using a cn 66 color disk test kit hach company loveland co usa and dpd 1 reagent detection limit 0 2 3 4 mg l we provided color disk comparator kits to enumerators because of their ease of use usability and inexpensiveness compared to a digital colorimeter which was used to more precisely measure fcr at the source murray and lantagne 2015 the enumerators completed the fcr test at least 30 min after water collection from the source after the survey was completed enumerators returned to the water point and approached another user for consent this cycle was continued until enumerators completed the target number of households or security protocols precluded continuing sampling 2 5 water sample testing microbiological samples were processed within 6 h using the membrane filtration method with m coliblue24 media hach company loveland co usa for simultaneous detection of escherichia coli e coli and total coliforms apha awwa wef 1999 samples were diluted appropriately with sterile buffered water vacuum filtered aseptically through 45 Î¼m filters milliporesigma billerica ma usa placed in plastic petri dishes with media soaked pads and incubated using an nq9plus portable incubator darwin chambers st louis mo usa for 24 h at 35 c for quality control two dilution volumes were processed for each sample 10 of samples were duplicated and 5 of samples were blanks we used hach buffered dilution water pillows hach company loveland co and room temperature boiled water to prepare dilution and blank water colonies were counted and concentrations calculated by averaging plate counts within a countable range 1 200 turbidity was measured in nephelometric turbidity units ntu with a calibrated lamotte 2020 turbidimeter chestertown md usa within 8 h of sample collection using water remaining after microbiological analysis 2 6 focus group discussion we completed focus group discussions fgds with water users fgds included 15 questions on water source before emergency at their households before coming to the refugee camps water collection transportation and treatment practices receipt of behavior change campaigns cost of water collection likes dislikes about the chlorination program and recommendations to improve the program 2 7 data analysis we completed qualitative and quantitative data analysis for qualitative data kii and fgd transcripts were coded and refined in nvivo melbourne australia as themes were defined kiis were summarized under themes relating to reasons for choosing different chlorination programs quality control measures staff involvement in behavior change messaging and implementation challenges fgds were summarized by themes water chlorination and disease reduction chlorine taste and or smell and recommendations for program improvement for quantitative analysis we compared demographics water collection practices turbidity fcr and e coli concentration across the three program using chi square test fisher s exact test or kruskal wallis rank sum test as appropriate for binary and continuous variables respectively we pairwise compared programs against two outcome variables percentage of households with 0 2 mg l fcr and percentage of households with 10 e coli colony forming unit cfu 100 ml in the sample water sphere association 2018 we used 10 e coli cfu 100 ml to align with the sphere indicator which recommends 10 e coli cfu 100 ml at point of delivery unchlorinated water results are presented using an area plot to study factors associated with 10 e coli cfu 100 ml in household water samples we used generalized estimating equations with logit link accounting for the clustering effect of each program first we conducted bivariate analysis between 10 e coli cfu 100 ml and outcome variables variables significantly p 0 05 associated in bivariate analysis were included in multivariate analysis then we applied the backward elimination technique to obtain the final model where all independent variables were significant p 0 05 3 results we completed the three evaluations between august 2018 and may 2019 in five camps in cox s bazar including 13 staff chlorination agent kiis 29 water collection point observations 487 household surveys eight focus group discussions with users and 515 water sample tests table 1 all three programs were implemented by oxfam with support from unhcr in the piped water chlorination program and supplied water free of cost to refugees in the following sections evaluation results are presented including program descriptions key informant interviews water point observations and water quality household surveys and water quality and fgds when camp 22 was formed one implementing organization started a bucket chlorination program to treat water collected from ring wells and maintain residual protection against recontamination the implementation included training local non refugee chlorination agents to 1 prepare 1 chlorine solution using high test calcium hypochlorite hth powder in the morning 2 stand next to ring wells with the solution during the day and 3 dose water with chlorine solution depending on the volume upon water collection by the users agents were paid by the implementing agency the program was then turned over to oxfam some months after beginning we evaluated four months after oxfam took over the program which was one week before oxfam discontinued bucket chlorination to replace it with a piped network distributing centrally chlorinated surface water in camps 12 and 19 refugees used groundwater extracted via handpumps approximately four months before the evaluation to ensure water safety and prevent recontamination oxfam attached purall 50h eason pune mh india in line chlorination devices to handpump spouts fig 1 the purall devices contained a chlorinated isocyanurate cartridge that intended to passively dose 1 mg l chlorine into the outflowing water according to the manufacturer each cartridge had a lifetime capacity of treating 125 000 l of water and contained an end of life indicator that turned red when chlorine was emptied easol 2019 this in line chlorination program was a pilot implementation by oxfam to test the effectiveness of using simple technology and existing water sources to supply chlorinated water we evaluated this program up to four months after in line chlorinator device installation in 2018 2019 oxfam constructed piped water chlorination systems in camp 3 and 4 extension to ensure uniform chlorine dose and improve water access as part of the cox s bazar master plan that aimed to construct chlorinated piped water networks for all camps unhcr and oxfam 2018 the system consisted of 1 a solar energy operated submersible pump to extract groundwater 2 one 95 000 l storage tank 3 a chlorine dosing system including solution storage and dosing pump 4 pipe networks and 5 8 12 distribution tapstands with 2 6 taps per stand groundwater was extracted using a solar pump and stored in the tanks the chlorination system automatically dosed a locally prepared hth chlorine solution from a plastic bucket to the piped network before the water flowed to the storage tanks storage tanks were built in elevated locations in the camps and water was gravity fed to tapstands we evaluated this centralized chlorination program in its fifth month of implementation we completed 13 interviews with implementation staff including eight chlorination agents and two agency staff from the bucket chlorination program two agency staff from the in line chlorination program and one agency staff from the piped water supply program qualitative results were summarized under the themes of 1 reasons for selecting the chlorination program 2 quality control 3 involvement in behavior change activities and 4 implementation challenges 3 1 reason for selecting the chlorination program the primary objective driving the selection of each chlorination program was the same to provide safe water to the refugees respondents from the bucket chlorination program indicated that oxfam had inherited the implementation from a predecessor organization that began bucket chlorination activities to address the acute need of people collecting water from open wells in line chlorination respondents indicated that they were in a piloting phase to determine if in line chlorination could be scaled up in camps as devices could be easily connected to pre existing tubewells without requiring a large investment of resources the piped water supply program was implemented as part of the overall cox s bazar strategy to alleviate high costs associated with maintaining tubewells to ensure stable fcr in the supplied water and to ease the water collection process by refugees 3 2 quality control staff from all three programs noted that equipment needed to implement and maintain chlorination programs and test water quality including hth powder chlorine cartridges buckets plumbing tools color comparator and digital fcr test kits and turbidity tubes were provided by oxfam in bucket chlorination agents reported adjusting the chlorine dose depending on water volume in the transport container in in line chlorination staff reported it was not possible to adjust the chlorine dosage piped water chlorine staff reported oxfam determined appropriate chlorine dosage based on aquifer water testing at program onset staff from the bucket chlorination program reported periodically measuring turbidity at collection points and staff from the in line and piped chlorination programs reported periodically measuring fcr at water collection points staff did not report conducting microbiological tests as part of regular monitoring in any program 3 3 staff involvement with behavior change campaigns the reported interaction between program staff and beneficiaries varied between programs bucket chlorination agents interacted with beneficiaries as a function of delivering chlorine directly to their water collection containers agents were asked by oxfam to deliver messages to the beneficiaries pertaining to drinking treated water waiting 30 min from treatment until use and to collect fresh water each day in line chlorination staff did not report direct interaction with beneficiaries however staff reported separately implementing camp wide hygiene promotion activities to promote drinking chlorinated water the piped water chlorination staff also did not report direct beneficiary interaction as part of daily operations but reported a separate behavior change campaign implemented by oxfam to promote safe water consumption 3 4 implementation challenges the most common challenge reported by staff from all programs was user s objection reluctance to drink chlorinated water because of the chlorine smell additionally the bucket chlorination agents noted the work schedule being difficult as they did 8 h shifts seven days per week they also reported concerns about job security and noted that providing chairs and equipment storage would be helpful in line chlorination staff reported the devices were easy to install and operate with a small team however staff noted that it was not possible to adjust chlorine dosage and the end of life indicator was difficult to read additionally staff noted some tampering of the devices at program installation including attempted removal by beneficiaries piped water chlorination staff mentioned the challenge of relying only on solar energy to operate pumps during the rainy season or on cloudy days the duration of pump function was inadequate to extract enough water for all users staff also mentioned it was difficult for them to find suitable locations to drill and construct plants in the crowded camp setting 3 5 water collection point observations across the three evaluations 29 water collection point observations were completed 10 in bucket 9 in in line and 10 in piped water chlorination programs table 2 unimproved sources ringwells were used in the bucket chlorination program in in line and piped water chlorination programs groundwater was extracted using handpumps and an electric submersible pump respectively hth chlorine solution was prepared daily in the bucket and piped water chlorination programs tablet chlorinated isocyanurate in a cartridge was used in in line chlorination the bucket chlorination program was the only program with staff present at water collection points available during working hours 8 00am 4 30pm in bucket and in line chlorination programs the chlorine solution bottle and cartridge were exposed to the sun across all programs queueing time was either none bucket chlorination or on average 5 min in line and piped water chlorination we measured fcr at the water collection point for in line and piped water chlorination programs but not bucket chlorination because chlorine was dosed directly into the user s transport container table 2 mean fcr was 0 9 mg l range 0 05 3 78 mg l sd 1 3 in in line and 0 2 range 0 07 0 40 mg l sd 0 1 in piped water chlorination geomean e coli was 451 cfu 100 ml in untreated bucket chlorination source water 1 5 cfu 100 ml in chlorinated in line and 1 0 cfu 100 ml in chlorinated piped water samples ph was slightly

piped water chlorination mean turbidity was 7 9 ntu sd 14 5 ntu in ringwell water 2 7 ntu sd 2 9 at in line chlorination points and 2 5 ntu sd 1 0 at the taps of the piped water system 3 6 household surveys between the three programs evaluated the percentage of female respondents 34 44 reported school attendance 16 23 and number of reported beds in the household 2 4 2 6 were not significantly different table 3 the mean age of respondents 25 41 number of people living in the house 5 4 6 6 and percentage reporting diarrhea in the past seven days 11 26 were statistically significant between programs p 0 001 with respondents in the bucket chlorination program reporting the highest diarrhea rate 26 respondents were observed to mainly use metal pots for water storage 54 74 followed by buckets 8 25 jerricans 0 19 and jugs 1 30 almost all respondents from the three programs reported using chlorinated water for drinking 97 99 55 64 also reported using chlorinated water for food washing the percentage of observed covered containers varied across programs 20 34 respondents in the piped water chlorination program had the lowest percentage of covering containers 20 during the survey enumerators asked for a cup of water and observed how the respondent collected water from the container the majority of respondents in all three programs were observed to pour water into the cup 76 91 instead of dipping the cup 9 24 reported household water treatment was low at 0 5 reported receiving behavior change messages was 85 in bucket chlorination programs and 41 in piped water chlorination programs reported chlorine taste and or smell unacceptability decreased from 95 in bucket chlorination respondents to 33 in piped water chlorination respondents the percentage of households with fcr 0 2 mg l was 71 36 and 60 in the bucket in line and piped water chlorination programs respectively p 0 001 the percentage of households with 10 e coli cfu 100 ml was 71 86 and 91 in the bucket in line and piped water chlorination programs respectively p 0 001 for the membrane filtration quality assurance and control measures all blanks were negative and duplicate colony counts were within 10 of the corresponding pair count ph and turbidity varied p 0 001 by program in pairwise comparison in line chlorination respondents had a significantly lower percentage of households with fcr 0 2 mg l compared to both bucket chlorination p 0 001 and piped water chlorination p 0 001 the difference between bucket and piped water was not statistically significant fig 2 table 2 additionally the percentage of households with 10 e coli cfu 100 ml was significantly lower in the bucket chlorination program compared to both in line p 0 002 and piped water chlorination p 0 001 the difference between in line chlorination and piped water chlorination was not significantly different p 0 393 ideal program line marks the target goal for each water quality measure in unadjusted

eight fgds in the three evaluations with a total of 63 participants table 1 three main themes were identified 1 high awareness of the link between unchlorinated water consumption and disease 2 mixed perception of chlorine smell and 3 program feedback high awareness of the link between unchlorinated water consumption and disease fgd participants from all three programs knew the importance of drinking chlorinated water to reduce the risk of waterborne diseases in total 34 participants reported they knew they should drink water from a chlorinated source one participant stated i like that the water has medicine chlorine in it when we drink this water we don t get sick but when we drink from outside sources we get sick and another stated we are not getting sick after drinking this water not getting diarrhea this is very good for us it also means that the water doesn t have any bacteria we feel good when we drink this water we don t get sick we give this water to our children and we drink it 3 8 mixed perception of chlorine smell participants from all three programs reported chlorine smell as an issue however the percentage of complaints declined from bucket chlorination 95 to in line chlorination 66 to piped water chlorination 33 programs one bucket chlorination user stated the water we were drinking before did not have any odor this chlorinated water has bad odor some people can t drink chlorinated water because of the odor an in line chlorination user noted we now tolerate the chlorine smell because we know it is for our own good demonstrating an increased acceptance of chlorination 3 9 program feedback three bucket chlorination participants mentioned that chlorination agents were not present at the time they collected water furthermore 23 bucket chlorination respondents reported water quantity was not sufficient 10 reported the sources were too far from their homes and 5 reported water was not available in summer amongst in line chlorination participants one requested reducing the chlorine concentration in the water and six reported the distance to walk to tubewells was too far specifically one respondent explained tubewells were located downhill making it challenging to carry water home of the piped water chlorination participants one reported they preferred collecting water from the tap because it was easy four reported they liked the water taste although three indicated they would prefer drinking filtered water and one reported there was not enough water particularly in the evening to meet basic needs 4 discussion we evaluated three source water chlorination programs in the ongoing humanitarian response in cox s bazar refugee camps in bangladesh using a mixed methods research protocol the three programs were implemented at different stages of the response and required different levels of staffing infrastructure and community mobilization work to our knowledge this is the first comparison of source water chlorination interventions along a continuum within one context our results highlight that no individual program fully met international standards sphere association 2018 unhcr 2018 as implemented although all partially met standards the importance of behavior change campaigns including on chlorine acceptance and chlorine taste and or smell the benefits and drawbacks of each of each source water chlorination program must be considered prior to implementation and consideration of how the continuum is implemented in water supply in protracted emergencies in humanitarian response and outbreak settings there are various international standards for water provision including access standards queuing time distance quantity standards l person day and quality standards fcr e coli sphere association 2018 unhcr 2018 who 2002 these standards are not consistent across international guidance branz et al 2017 generally these guidance documents recommend good access to a minimum of 15 20 l person day of water with a 0 2 0 5 mg l fcr and 1 10 e coli cfu 100 ml at collection delivery the three source water chlorination programs evaluated herein implemented at different phases of the response with different resource availability all had the objective to meet this general set of standards in our results the access indicator of queuing time was minimal across all three programs distance was mentioned as a concern with suggestions to reduce walking time particularly up and down hills and bucket and in line chlorination beneficiaries both requesting all not just some sources be chlorinated conversely piped chlorination beneficiaries found tapstand access convenient across cox s bazar there is sufficient quantity of water however there were barriers to accessing sufficient quantity of chlorinated water including inability to access chlorinated water when bucket chlorination agents were not present and insufficient quantity of piped water when solar panels were not charging for quality indicators the number of households with fcr 0 2 mg l was highest in bucket chlorination programs 71 compared to in line 36 and piped 60 despite degradation of chlorine solution in sunlight and open well water having relatively higher turbidity typically associated with higher chlorine demand gallandat et al 2019 the higher household fcr amongst bucket chlorination beneficiaries can be attributed to multiple factors the low dosage mean 0 2 mg l at source of the piped chlorination system the high variability mean 0 9 mg l sd 1 3 mg l of in line chlorination dosing which lead to over and under dosing the unreadability of the in line chlorinator s end of life cartridge indicator and poor handling including not mixing of chlorine solutions in the piped water chlorination solution these factors are straightforward to address and it is anticipated with minor improvement fcr at household could be significantly more consistent in the in line and piped water chlorination programs ali et al 2015 furthermore the importance of maintaining fcr in drinking water in humanitarian response was highlighted in our data where insufficient fcr was associated with increased e coli contamination which could come from poor source water quality or recontamination from risky household collection and storage behaviors despite bucket chlorination beneficiaries having the highest number of households with fcr 0 2 mg l they did not have the lowest e coli in household stored water overall 91 of piped chlorination households 86 of in line and 71 of bucket chlorination beneficiaries had 10 e coli cfu 100 ml as we could not obtain a pre chlorination sample for in line or piped water chlorination sources we do not know the pre chlorination e coli concentration of those sources as they are deep groundwater sources the contamination can be assumed to be low ahmed et al 2006 however we do know the bucket chlorination sources were highly contaminated and had the highest turbidity we hypothesize the contamination seen in bucket chlorination households was due to a combination of high source contamination and turbidity throughout our results one theme identified was the importance of behavior change messaging consistent with other research from the same settings sikder et al 2020 first the regression results found water serving practices impacted household e coli concentrations which is consistent with previous research trevett et al 2005 additionally in fgds there was increased knowledge of the need to drink chlorinated water to prevent disease when there was direct interaction with program staff as seen in bucket chlorination programs lastly there was increased acceptance of chlorine dosage over time which can be attributed to multiple factors including 1 users could have become accustomed to the taste smell over time 2 users could have been unaware chlorine was being added in in line and piped programs and 3 fcr was lower in in line and piped chlorination programs than bucket chlorination for chlorinated water supply interventions user s chlorine taste and smell acceptability can be a critical factor to program success branz et al 2017 as research completed in both humanitarian and development settings has emphasized the importance of considering local chlorine concentration thresholds taste and or smell before intervening crider et al 2018 mitro et al 2019 overall our results highlight the importance of incorporating beneficiary preference and behavior change into water supply interventions in humanitarian response it is commonly assumed that temporary source water chlorination programs such as bucket chlorination are not as effective as more permanent programs our results show a more subtle story that there are benefits and drawbacks of each intervention at each phase table 4 the bucket chlorination program required minimal infrastructure was implemented rapidly in the initial emergency phase and provided behavior change messages directly to the users at water collection however dosing was dependent on many individuals adhering correctly to a protocol and being present when water was collected in line chlorination had the benefits of rapid installation on existing infrastructure minimal maintenance and 24 h availability of chlorinated water however the chlorine dosage was not adjustable the infrastructure had to be established and beneficiaries had to walk downhill to collect water as implemented in cox s bazar in both bucket and in line chlorination a drawback was not all sources readily accessible to a household were chlorinated additionally the in line chlorinator selected for cox s bazar had an inadequate end of life indicator and the dosage could not be adjusted it is recommended to ameliorate these concerns by improving this device or selecting an alternate in line chlorinator in the future the piped water chlorination program was implemented in later phases of the response when the camp settlements were stable and responders had both time and resources to design and build the water collection treatment and distribution systems benefits of the piped water chlorination program were that it was systematic and centrally managed it was easy to collect sufficient water and easy to maintain a consistent lower chlorine dosage however it was resource intensive and needed trained staff to operate additionally in cox s bazar as implemented it depended on solar power our results indicate that all these chlorination programs can be appropriate and effective depending on context resources time implementation capacity and emergency phase in the unhcr wash manual priorities are outlined by emergency stage as the emergency phase of the first six months where the goal is to save lives by providing immediate access to basic wash services the transition phase of 6 months 2 years where the goal is to transition to cost efficient wash services and the post emergency protracted phase of 2 years and ongoing where the goal is to transition to durable wash services that align with national priorities unhcr 2018 our evaluations document the progression towards systematically managed centralized drinking water supply systems and represent appropriate wash interventions along this emergency transition post emergency continuum our results emphasize the importance of immediate response with available resources while gradually improving services over time in collaboration with a supportive host government such as bangladesh to implement improved services beyond basic humanitarian response it should be noted lack of support or restrictions imposed by host governments can make it difficult for responders to improve services along this continuum mohammed abu lohom et al 2018 sikder et al 2018a limitations of our study included 1 we did not collect fcr measurements for supplied water during the bucket chlorination evaluation e coli pre chlorination in source water in line and piped water chlorination programs or chlorine solution concentration in piped water 2 the bucket chlorination program was at phase out stage during evaluation and might not have been operating at full capacity 3 because of the cross sectional data collection we could not account for seasonal water quality variation which might impact results 4 our evaluation could have impacted responder actions and led to subject bias 5 water ph can have mixed effects on e coli survival and growth conner and kotrola 1995 sharma et al 2004 and thus the association observed in the analysis should be interpreted with caution and 6 while all evaluations were completed in cox s bazar the specific camps for each program were different we do not feel these limitations impacted the results presented herein 5 conclusion access to safe drinking water is critical in humanitarian response we conducted a mixed methods evaluation of three chlorination programs along the acute transition post emergency continuum in cox s bazar we found that programs partially met humanitarian standards for water access quantity and quality with each having their own benefits and drawbacks depending on phase and context additionally understanding beneficiary preferences and behavior change campaigns were found to be critical to source water chlorination program success overall we found appropriate source water chlorination program choice is a continuum depending on humanitarian phase and context our results emphasize the importance of water chlorination regardless of source type water distribution modality and user behavior in humanitarian settings therefore we recommend continuing context and phase appropriate source water chlorination programs emphasizing consistent and acceptable chlorine dosage implementing programmatic improvements and incorporating user preferences to reduce microbial contamination and consequently

17923,in the past decade the characterisation of the microbial community in anaerobic digestion was primarily done by using high throughput short read amplicon sequencing however the short read approach has inherent primer bias and low phylogenetic resolution our previous study using illumina miseq suggested that the heterogeneity of ad microbiome was operation driven to advance our knowledge towards the complexity of the ad microbiome we performed full length 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing using pacbio sequel for a more accurate phylogenetic identification to this end purified dna samples from 19 global anaerobic digesters were sequenced sixteen methanogenic archaea were identified at the species level among them methanosarcina horonobensis and methanosarcina flavescens had significant presence under specific operating conditions methanothrix concilii presented in all digesters sequenced unexpectedly over 90 of the smithella detected were closely related to alkane degrading smithella strains d17 and m82 not smithella propionica using lefse and network analysis the interspecies relationship between the fermentative and syntrophic bacteria was addressed comparison of the short and long read sequencing results were performed and discussed from sample preparation to data analysis this work characterised the digester microbiomes in a superior resolution

pcoa principal coordinate analysis rubisco ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is capable of converting various organic compounds into methane mediated by specific microbial communities for a series of biological reactions conventionally the microbial communities are categorised into fermentative bacteria fermenters syntrophic bacteria syntrophs and methanogenic archaea methanogens one of the critical pathways in ad is the syntrophic association between the methanogens and syntrophs which interact by the change of key metabolites e g acetate formate and hydrogen this mutualism maintains low levels of these key metabolites so that syntrophic metabolism is thermodynamically favourable mcinerney et al 2009 sieber et al 2010 determining the microbial communities involved in syntrophic metabolism is often carried out by 16s rrna gene profiling using the illumina platform e g liu et al 2016 mÃ¼ller et al 2016 you et al 2016 our previous study mei et al 2017 revealed the microbial community structures present in 90 different full scale anaerobic digesters using the illumina platform and suggested that the ad microbiomes composition were operation driven however two major shortcomings of the illumina sequencing approach limit its resolution in taxonomic identification firstly the illumina platform can only produce short read lengths ranging from 50 to 250 bp targeting the different hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene typically 16 33 of the total length because many closely related bacteria share similar sequences in the amplified region fuks et al 2018 the taxonomic classification is often limited to genus level identifications also the non homogeneous distribution of mutation which occurs across the entire hypervariable regions singer et al 2016 prevents confident identification of some short read sequences secondly the v4 v5 primer set is inefficient in amplifying euryarchaeota due to low 16s rrna gene copy number campanaro et al 2018 which contains most of the methanogenic species consequentially the limited phylogenetic resolution obtained with the illumina platform does not allow in most cases the classification of microbes below the genus level kim et al 2011 yarza et al 2014 hence more accurate taxonomic identification is needed to understand the complexities of ad microbial communities to obtain a better resolution of the microbial composition of ad digesters pacific bioscience pacbio single molecule real time smrt sequencing approach was used for full length 16s rrna gene sequences achieving at the species level identification the full length 16s rrna gene sequence covers both hypervariable regions v1 v9 and conserved regions avoids primer bias and provides more considerable phylogenetic information angle et al 2017 earl et al 2018 shin et al 2016 moreover such extended read length enables higher confidence in phylogenetic classifications wagner et al 2016 and offers additional otus for clustering improvement franzÃ©n et al 2015 the circular consensus sequencing ccs approach generates highly accurate sequences via multiple subreads alignments frank et al 2016 travers et al 2010 allowing the use of singletons for diversity profiling and identification of novel phylotype although near full length 16s rrna gene sequences can be obtained through sanger sequencing it is labourious to process a large number of samplesunable to obtain a comprehensive diversity profile youssef et al 2009 additionally smrt sequencing can provide more coverage than sanger sequencing for microbial profiling at a lower cost hebert et al 2018 to this end the full length 16s rrna amplicon sequencing using pacbio sequel was employed to re sequence selected ad samples from our previous study mei et al 2017 the sample preparation and data analysis of the full length 16s rrna amplicon pacbio sequel sequencing can be used as a reference for other future studies the unique diversity in fermenters syntrophs and methanogens of anaerobic digesters associated with operating conditions was addressed overlooked methanogenic archaea including the methanogens outside of euryarchaeota and the comparison to our previous illumina miseq result mei et al 2017 were discussed in this regard results gleamed identify overlooked microbiomes and cross link with digestion

sequences ccs by the smrt analysis function the ccs reads were screened using mothur v 1 39 5 schloss et al 2009 and sequences outside of a range of 1300 bp and 1700 bp were removed as ccs reads could be in mixed orientation a check orientation command was added schloss et al 2016 chimaeras were removed using vsearch rognes et al 2016 the taxonomic alignment was performed using the silva 132 reference quast et al 2013 with 80 cut off value operational taxonomic unit otu classification was performed with a 99 identity cut off taxonomic re classification using the silva 132 reference was also performed on the previous illumina miseq data alpha diversity analysis included calculation of various diversity indices inverse simpson and shannon diversity index richness abundance estimators chao1 and ace evenness indices simpson evenness and shannon evenness and good s coverage principal coordinate analysis pcoa was used to evaluate the beta diversity with weighted and unweighted unifrac distance metrics linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse segata et al 2011 was used in identifying the abundant taxa to characterise the ad microbiome among different operating conditions threshold on the logarithmic lda score for discriminative features was set at 2 with an alpha value set at 0 05 all against all strategy for multi class analysis was selected co occurrence network was constructed using the conet method faust and raes 2016 a table of otu with 99 identity cut off was input for the analysis edges were obtained from the calculation using four similarity measures pearson and spearman rank correlations bray curtis and kullback leibler non parametric dissimilarity indices randomisation was performed with 100 iterations of permutation and bootstrap with a p value threshold of 0 05 the networks were visualised by cytoscape v3 0 shannon et al 2003 positive edges only networks were clustered via cytocluster li et al 2017 using oh pin algorithm wang et al 2012 arb ludwig et al 2004 was used for the phylogenetic tree construction the representative sequences from otu classifications were aligned using sina aligner v1 2 11 pruesse et al 2012 and imported to arb the sequences were inserted to the silva 132 ssu ref nr 99 reference tree using parsimony algorithm phylogenetic trees were built using the neighbour joining algorithm with felsenstein correction the bootstrap value was set at 5000 taxonomic identification was performed by blastn v2 8 1 zhang et al 2000 against the silva 132 reference database using megablast algorithm 3 results and discussion 3 1 overview table s2 summarises the number of sequences obtained from samples extracted from seven operating conditions including high salinity pre treatment temperature thermophilic 30 c 40 c and mesophilic and food waste co digestion high quality ccs reads with an average read score of 0 995 0 0004 99 accuracy were achieved by setting the minimum passes at ten table s2 suggesting that such subread alignment can significantly improve the accuracy of pacbio sequence in total 113 970 ccs reads were obtained after quality filtering and chimaera removal from 19 bacterial and 17 archaeal amplicons among them two archaeal amplicons from ussf and hksw were removed due to exceptionally low ccs reads 455 and 131 despite their high dna quality after the two step purification and confirmed gel imaging the average ccs length for the archaeal and bacterial sequence was 1493 43 81 31 and 1509 32 43 63 bp respectively further we selected the silva rrna gene database for being the most comprehensive 16s reference database with a vast collection of the environmental genome segota and long 2019 we retained singletons for diversity profiling considering the advantage of full length 16s gene sequencing thus 10 490 archaeal and 45 775 bacterial otus were classified using 99 sequence similarity overall the bacterial communities had the shannon diversity h and evenness j of 5 27 0 88 and 0 78 0 10 respectively while archaeal communities had values of 2 95 0 79 and 0 60 0 05 respectively for these indices similarly chao 1 richness ace richness inverse simpson and inverse simpson evenness were higher in bacterial communities than archaeal ones table s3 indicating a higher alpha diversity in bacterial communities over its counterpart also the pcoa results showed that the archaeal communities mostly clustered according to the operating conditions while the distribution of bacterial communities was more random fig s1 for the identification the results were varied among different microbial groups nearly half of the methanogen related otus abundance 1 had percent identities higher than 98 7 yarza et al 2014 achieving the identification at the species level lower percent identities were observed in most syntroph related otus the results still generate somewhat insights at species level on the other hand the remaining fermenter related otus could be identified at the genus level in regard to profile the ad community it is more practical to focus on identifying methanogens from archaeal amplicon at this stage 3 2 diversity of the archaeal population with archaea specific primers used the majority of the otus 10 446 out of 10 490 otus could represent 99 76 of total archaeal sequences most were associated with the phylum euryarchaeota so far all the cultivated methanogens are classified to seven orders within euryarchaeota among these seven orders three orders were not observed in the present dataset i e methanocelles methanopyrales and methanococcales fig 1 a methanocelles species have been obtained from rice paddy fields lu and conrad 2005 lÃ¼ and lu 2012 sakai et al 2008 2010 whereas isolates of methanopyrales and methanococcales were all obtained from marine environments especially geothermally heated ecosystems e g deep sea hydrothermal vents huber et al 1982 kurr et al 1991 stewart et al 2015 takai et al 2004 it is thus expected the absence of these three orders in anaerobic digesters conditions the remaining four orders i e methanomicrobiales methanosarcinales methanobacteriales and methanomassiliicoccales contained otus were detected in this study fig 3b most otus were assigned to 14 different genera with cultivated representatives among them methanothrix 4450 otus methanolinea 1673 otus and methanosarcina 1086 otus were the most abundant accounting for 38 14 17 92 and 12 33 of total archaeal sequences respectively distinctly there are sequences related to two candidate genera found in highly enriched cultures have not been isolated yet i e ca methanogranum and ca methanoplasma both belong to the order methanomassiliicoccales and include two lineages lacking cultivated representatives within the family methanomethylophilaceae and methanomassiliicoccaceae the otus associated with methanomassiliicoccales were commonly observed in our study they are abundant in nedr 50 c and esra 30 c with 11 91 and 11 27 of the archaeal population respectively methanomassiliicoccales require hydrogen for methylated compounds metabolisation such as methanol methylamines and methylated thiols adam et al 2017 suggesting its linking carbon nitrogen and sulphur cycles in methanogenesis besides the aforementioned orders being cultivated a class level clade ca methanofastidiosales previously known as wsa2 or arci chouari et al 2005 hugenholtz 2002 is capable of performing methanogenesis via methylated thiol reduction nobu et al 2016 many otus 1048 otus related to this clade were detected with relative abundances ranging from 7 26 to 40 23 among the digesters sampled fig s2a the otus in this clade were phylogenetically diverse and spanned six genus or family level lineages shadowed in fig s2a our data reveal that ca methanofastidiosales is a significant player in anaerobic digestion albeit being overlooked previously in addition to euryarchaeota the sequences related to other archaeal phyla fig s2b were observed twenty two observed otus forming five genus and family level lineages are affiliated with ca bathyarchaeota containing members capable of methanogenesis based on a metagenomics study evans et al 2015 while the members of ca bathyarchaeota are mostly associated with natural environments e g marine and freshwater ecosystems zhou et al 2018 their presence in engineered systems warrants further investigations to understand the metabolism fully likewise the phylum ca verstraetearchaeota not yet been detected in digesters previously was observed in our mesophilic digesters it is believed to be one of the few examples of non euryarchaeota methanogens vanwonterghem et al 2016 seven otus were closely related to the proposed methylotrophic ca methanomethylicus in this phylum in addition fourteen otus associated with ca lokiarchaeota and one otu associated with ca odinarchaeota were detected but no evidence is available about their methanogenic capacity or ecological functions in digesters collectively with the high resolution of the full length sequences a few of the overlooked methanogens were identified further attention is required to understand their roles in ad 3 3 operation driven methanogenic species considering species level identification performed on 35 abundant archaeal otus with relative abundance 1 fig 2 table s4a all had high alignment score 2451 17 96 45 query cover percentage 99 86 0 69 and percent identity 98 35 1 26 to known archaeal species this allows further exploration of their potential functions such as methanogenic pathways optimal growth conditions and substrate utilisation table s5 below we highlight three species by cross referencing the dominance of certain methanogens with the digester operating conditions 3 3 1 methanosarcina horonobensis in the high salinity digester an otu related to methanosarcina horonobensis with 98 67 identity percentage was identified and represented 72 51 of the archaeal population in the high salinity digester hktp as a member of methanosarcina it is generally assumed that it can conduct both hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis on the contrary a physiology study reported that no methane was produced with h2 and co2 by m horonobensis shimizu et al 2011 although according to the genome mapping in kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes m horonobensis contains the key enzymes of utilising h2 and co2 for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis these genes were likely not transcribed another interesting finding reported by shimizu et al 2011 is that m horonobensis grows optimally at 1 05 nacl and can tolerate up to 1 75 nacl while our general understanding is that high salinity has an inhibitory effect on methanogenesis liu and boone 1991 patell and roth 1977 pattnaik et al 2000 it can also grow on dimethylsulfide shimizu et al 2011 which is plentiful in hktp in any event it is rational to link that hktp at a salinity of 0 8 and the high content of dimethylsulfide might serve as the selection measures for the dominance of m horonobensis detected in this study this observation of such a methanogen with the ability to thrive in a particular environment can serve as a guide for inoculum selection when treating specific substrate 3 3 2 methanosarcina flavescens in the thermophilic digesters methanosarcina flavescens was the most abundant species 27 96 in the thermophilic digesters along with other thermophilic species including methanobacterium thermaggregans methanothermobacter tenebrarum methanoculleus receptaculi and methanothrix thermophila cheng et al 2008 kamagata et al 2009 mauerhofer et al 2018 takahashi et al 2012 methanosarcina contains cytochrome c a high intermembrane electron transfer medium serving as a distinguished character compared with other methanogens it is thus postulated that cytochrome c containing methanosarcina could withstand high hydrogen partial pressures compared to methanogens without cytochrome c thauer et al 2008 as thermophilic condition facilitates the production of hydrogen mir et al 2016 it provides a favourable environment for the abundant presence of m flavescens in thermophilic environments albeit the operating temperature 55 c is higher than its optimal growth temperature 45 c kern et al 2016 3 3 3 methanothrix concilii aceticlastic methanothrix concilii sequences olson et al 2011 patell and sprott 1990 were present in digesters under all operating conditions with an average abundance of 18 63 accounting nearly half of the methanothrix population except for that in thermophilic digesters its universal presence leads us to the genome plasticity of methanothrix by elongating the genome methanothrix enriches the favourable phenotypes to adapt to the changing environment maeder et al 2006 methanothrix contains cytochrome c as does methanosarina and both genera are often reported to involve direct interspecies electron transfer diet with geobacter holmes et al 2017 yang et al 2019 moreover a recent metatranscriptomics analysis showed that the diet pathway is associated with ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco mediated co2 reduction and cell synthesis in methanothrix concilii resulting in a high and efficient methane yield olson et al 2011 patell and sprott 1990 this pathway was found to be active in a highly efficient pilot scale anaerobic fluidised bed membrane bioreactor using real sewage as feed demonstrating that it is possible to generate energy from such dilute stream yang et al 2019 whether the enzyme systems involved in diet are unclear however co2 reduction to methane via diet requires coupling with exoelectrogenic geobacter species in the samples of this study geobacter was low in abundance suggesting the methane yield was mainly via the acetoclastic pathway 3 4 diversity of the syntrophic population among the 1601 syntroph related otus detected they were associated with the following phyla proteobacteria 1339 otus firmicutes 229 otus synergistetes 9 otus and ca cloacimonetes 24 otus syntroph related otus represented 4 69 3 88 of the bacterial population with 10 17 in mesophilic digesters and 10 04 in digesters operated at 40 c table s6 noticeably we also observed that their abundance in high salinity 2 70 and thermophilic 2 94 conditions were low in an attempt to obtain taxonomic identification at species level we selected syntroph related otus clustered in the same lineage with cultivated species in the phylogenetic tree for blast as a result seven out of forty six of those syntroph related otus were identified at species level table s4b the average percent identity for taxonomic identification was 96 15 2 09 overall most syntroph related otus were classified under fourteen genera the remaining otus formed uncultured lineages within the families syntrophomonadaceae syntrophaceae and syntrophobacteraceae fig 3a within proteobacteria mesophilic smithella was the most abundant genus accounting for 38 3 47 5 of the syntrophic population in the pre treatment digesters operated at 30 c 40 c and mesophilic condition six uncultured lineages within the genus smithella were detected under various conditions indicating its universal presence fig s2c specifically over 90 of the smithella related otus were closely related to smithella strains d17 and m82 and only one is closely related to smithella propionica notably s propionica possesses a unique propionate degradation pathway 3 mol of hydrogen produced per mol of propionate degraded distinguished from the methylmalonyl coa pathway 1 mol of hydrogen per mol of propionate consumed dolfing 1987 koch et al 1983 even so the lack of key genes like succinate dehydrogenase in strain m82 indicates its inability to degrade propionate qin et al 2017 as was smithella strain d17 tan et al 2014 instead strains d17 and m82 may be involved in alkanes degradation based on their draft genomes embree et al 2014 qin et al 2017 wawrik et al 2016 this interesting observation is divergent from our previous understanding of the genus smithella metabolising in methanogenic propionate degradation bergey et al 2005 as for the otus formed five uncultured lineages within the family syntrophaceae they are phylogenetically closely related to syntrophus fig s2d known for benzoate and fatty acids degradation jackson et al 1999 liu et al 1999 in addition the otus related to the aromatic compound degrading syntrophorhabdus qiu et al 2008 were also in all digesters except for the co digestion of food waste on the opposite the otus related to acetate oxidising syntrophaceticus westerholm et al 2010 and fatty acid oxidising syntrophothermus sekiguchi et al 2000 were uniquely detected in thermophilic digesters at low abundance 0 1 other low abundance syntroph related otus were identified under the proteobacteria genera including desulfovibrio geobacter pelobacter syntrophus and syntrophobacter were in low relative abundance table s6 these results show the diverse survival niches of syntrophs in the various engineered systems sequenced the abundance of ca cloacimonas related otus was seconded to smithella related otus in the syntrophic population within this genus otu 12 identified as ca cloacimonas acidaminovorans 99 74 identity was abundant at 40 c 2 14 out of 4 27 and mesophilic conditions 1 96 out of 3 79 the implication of its pivotal role in propionate degradation and amino acid fermentation pelletier et al 2008b were supported by a few of studies calusinska et al 2018 solli et al 2014 xia et al 2018 ziels et al 2018 moreover three otus within synergistets were identified as thermanaerovibrio acidaminovorans chovatia et al 2009 with a percent identity of 99 93 99 10 and 97 15 t acidaminovorans ferments a range of amino acids to acetate and propionate with hydrogen as the only reduced end product guangsheng et al 1992 they were present in high salinity thermophilic and 40 c operated digesters at low abundance 0 5 only the fatty acid degrading syntrophomonas related otus were detected crossing all the operating conditions syntrophomonas sapovorans and syntrophomonas palmitatica were identified in the mesophilic digesters with a percentage identity of 98 26 and 100 respectively potentially utilise fatty acids with 4 18 carbon atoms hatamoto et al 2007 inclusively our results show the importance of syntrophy in amino acids degradation in digestion 3 5 characterisation of the bacterial communities covering 23 established and 30 candidate phyla in the list of prokaryotic names with standing in nomenclature parte 2018 fifty three bacterial phyla fig s3 table s7 were identified the taxa recovered in the studies using sanger sequencing chouari et al 2005 riviÃ¨re et al 2009 zhang et al 2014 were observed in our result bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria with broad metabolic potentials were ubiquitous and abundant fortunately due to the expansion of the constructed draft genome done herein somewhat metabolic interpretation of candidate phyla is possible plant polysaccharide degrading ca patescibacteria taubert et al 2019 was particularly abundant in pre treatment digesters 19 71 digesters operated at 30 c 21 49 and hksw 30 56 the candidate phyla acetothermia atribacteria brc1 proposed name sumerlaeota cloacimonetes hydrogenedentes margulisbacteria modulibacteria and zixibacteria are likely involved in fermentative reaction and acetate and or hydrogen formation balashov et al 2018 castelle et al 2013 eijsink et al 2016 hao et al 2018 kadnikov et al 2019 nobu et al 2015 pelletier et al 2008a sekiguchi et al 2015 utami et al 2019 moreover eleven candidate phyla with metabolically reconstructed genomic information are not associated with methanogenesis while the genomic information of the remaining eleven is not available other than these further information is unavailable alternatively to illustrate their taxonomic profiling further we used the lefse analysis to characterise the ad microbiome specific to particular operating conditions as shown in fig 3a taxa highlighted by small circles and shadings in the cladogram were discriminately abundant in the respective conditions to supplement it we performed a co occurrence network analysis to explore the potential interspecies interactions fig 4 this generates fifty eight subnetworks clustering into 433 nodes and 972 edges fig s4 using the all against all strategy the lefse analysis revealed that a diverse group of the class clostridia including lanchnospiracea peptococcaceae ruminococcaceae and uncultured d8a 2 groups had a more significant role in the thermophilic digesters fig 3a representative species of these genera can survive under extreme conditions such as high temperature environment yutin and galperin 2013 notably in one of the sub networks these clostridia related otus were co present with a group of coprothermobacteraeota related otus fig 4a together we hypothesise that they are the potential volatile fatty acids vfas producers mainly propionate and acetate in the thermophilic digesters another group of fermentative anaerolineae related otus was abundant in the high salinity digester fig 3a this lineage was also observed in a study with high abundance in high salinity environments yang et al 2016 in addition fig 4b shows the close connection between the otus related to anaerolineae and propionibacteriaceae via rikenellaceae such synergetic association could be due to one s end products can be used as the substrates for others e g acetate propionate and alcohol prior to methanogenesis graf 2014 mcilroy et al 2017 stackebrandt 2014 other than the aforementioned fig 4c showed the syntroph related otus e g smithella ca cloaimonas and uncultured syntrophaceae were connected with the otus related to kiritimatiellaeota spirochaetes and acidobacteria via brc1 related otus in the mesophilic condition they are also directly associated with the otus related to vadinha17 group and other bacteroidetes fig 4d although the function of vadinha17 group remains unknown its wide appearance with its connection with syntrophs suggested that it involves in vfas production in order to characterise the bacterial composition at species level taxonomic identification using blast was performed on the otus with a relative abundance 1 six out of sixty one otus were identified with an average percent identity of 86 05 7 65 interestingly three of the identified bacteria coprothermobacter proteolyticus acetomicrobium mobile and defluviitoga tunisiensis were isolated from anaerobic digesters alexiev et al 2014 ben hania et al 2016 hania et al 2012 to fill the gap a customised reference dataset derived from the specific environment is necessary because the classical cultivation based microbiological methods for digestion systems are challenging in compliance with the full length 16s rrna sequences constructing draft genome from cultivation free whole metagenomic sequencing is one of the practical options therefore such reference dataset for species level identification cross mapping with operating conditions and performance would facilitate unprecedented digestion optimisation 3 6 comparison to the previous short read result the comparison between the bacterial long read sequences from pacbio sequel and short read sequences v4 v5 from illumina miseq in diversity profiling and taxonomic classification is performed for alpha diversity the boxplots indicate that the overall distribution of shannon diversity h of the long read result albeit having a lower coverage value fig s5b is slightly higher than the short read one fig s5a to improve the coverage of the long read approach it is suggested to increase the data output of the sequence data as demonstrated by callahan et al 2019 and wagner et al 2016 accordingly the long read approach could provide sufficient coverage equivalent to the short read approach to evaluate beta diversity dendrograms show the microbial clusters with weighted unifrac as distance matrix fig s6 both results showed similar clustering particularly the thermophilic digesters and the digesters operated at 40 c were clustered in the same manner overall the difference in alpha and beta diversity are marginal for the taxonomic classification 15 additional otus were observed in the long read result within the abundant otus relative abundance 2 table s8 presents the heatmap of the percentage difference between the long read and short read results in the ten most abundant phyla the results show that the short read approach underestimates certain phyla for instance in the same samples the composition of ca patescribacteria in the short read results were from 0 34 to 2 75 while it ranged from 20 96 to 42 87 in the long read result another noticeable discrepancy is the distribution of thermophilic phyla thermotogae and ca coprothermobacteraeota in the thermophilic digesters thermotogae recovered from the short read sequences were 15 03 27 55 more than the long read sequences while the ca coprothermobacteraeota detected in the long read sequences was 2 98 8 24 more in addition the misclassification in the short read result was found for example the genus ca coprothermobacter from phylum ca coprothermobacteraeota in the long read result was misclassified as fervidobacterium from phylum thermotogae in the short read one this might be due to the two genera described as sister in phylogenetic placement potentially contributed to the discrepancy in taxonomic classification kunath et al 2019 pavan et al 2018 also singer et al 2016 reported the overrepresentation of fervidobacterium using v4 region amplicon considering the physiologies of ca coprothermobacter and fervidobacterium the former is potentially involved in hydrogen production while the latter is a sulphur reducing bacterium that completes with methanogens for substrates given that both were the second most abundant otus it could lead to inappropriate interpretations in microbial composition and digester performance external validation may be required to determine the accuracy of both sequencing approaches for such observations 4 conclusion this study demonstrated the methodology in dealing with low quality environmental dna samples for the full length 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing using pacbio sequel the results provide a higher resolution on the identification facilitating the description of the microbial composition of anaerobic digestion the highlighted methanogenic species i e methanosarcina horonobensis methanosarcina flavescens were dominant in their respective environments manifesting the value of species level specificity through the expansion of the genome database and improvement of the sequencing protocol and chemical the application of the full length

17923,in the past decade the characterisation of the microbial community in anaerobic digestion was primarily done by using high throughput short read amplicon sequencing however the short read approach has inherent primer bias and low phylogenetic resolution our previous study using illumina miseq suggested that the heterogeneity of ad microbiome was operation driven to advance our knowledge towards the complexity of the ad microbiome we performed full length 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing using pacbio sequel for a more accurate phylogenetic identification to this end purified dna samples from 19 global anaerobic digesters were sequenced sixteen methanogenic archaea were identified at the species level among them methanosarcina horonobensis and methanosarcina flavescens had significant presence under specific operating conditions methanothrix concilii presented in all digesters sequenced unexpectedly over 90 of the smithella detected were closely related to alkane degrading smithella strains d17 and m82 not smithella propionica using lefse and network analysis the interspecies relationship between the fermentative and syntrophic bacteria was addressed comparison of the short and long read sequencing results were performed and discussed from sample preparation to data analysis this work characterised the digester microbiomes in a superior resolution

mediated by specific microbial communities for a series of biological reactions conventionally the microbial communities are categorised into fermentative bacteria fermenters syntrophic bacteria syntrophs and methanogenic archaea methanogens one of the critical pathways in ad is the syntrophic association between the methanogens and syntrophs which interact by the change of key metabolites e g acetate formate and hydrogen this mutualism maintains low levels of these key metabolites so that syntrophic metabolism is thermodynamically favourable mcinerney et al 2009 sieber et al 2010 determining the microbial communities involved in syntrophic metabolism is often carried out by 16s rrna gene profiling using the illumina platform e g liu et al 2016 mÃ¼ller et al 2016 you et al 2016 our previous study mei et al 2017 revealed the microbial community structures present in 90 different full scale anaerobic digesters using the illumina platform and suggested that the ad microbiomes composition were operation driven however two major shortcomings of the illumina sequencing approach limit its resolution in taxonomic identification firstly the illumina platform can only produce short read lengths ranging from 50 to 250 bp targeting the different hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene typically 16 33 of the total length because many closely related bacteria share similar sequences in the amplified region fuks et al 2018 the taxonomic classification is often limited to genus level identifications also the non homogeneous distribution of mutation which occurs across the entire hypervariable regions singer et al 2016 prevents confident identification of some short read sequences secondly the v4 v5 primer set is inefficient in amplifying euryarchaeota due to low 16s rrna gene copy number campanaro et al 2018 which contains most of the methanogenic species consequentially the limited phylogenetic resolution obtained with the illumina platform does not allow in most cases the classification of microbes below the genus level kim et al 2011 yarza et al 2014 hence more accurate taxonomic identification is needed to understand the complexities of ad microbial communities to obtain a better resolution of the microbial composition of ad digesters pacific bioscience pacbio single molecule real time smrt sequencing approach was used for full length 16s rrna gene sequences achieving at the species level identification the full length 16s rrna gene sequence covers both hypervariable regions v1 v9 and conserved regions avoids primer bias and provides more considerable phylogenetic information angle et al 2017 earl et al 2018 shin et al 2016 moreover such extended read length enables higher confidence in phylogenetic classifications wagner et al 2016 and offers additional otus for clustering improvement franzÃ©n et al 2015 the circular consensus sequencing ccs approach generates highly accurate sequences via multiple subreads alignments frank et al 2016 travers et al 2010 allowing the use of singletons for diversity profiling and identification of novel phylotype although near full length 16s rrna gene sequences can be obtained through sanger sequencing it is labourious to process a large number of samplesunable to obtain a comprehensive diversity profile youssef et al 2009 additionally smrt sequencing can provide more coverage than sanger sequencing for microbial profiling at a lower cost hebert et al 2018 to this end the full length 16s rrna amplicon sequencing using pacbio sequel was employed to re sequence selected ad samples from our previous study mei et al 2017 the sample preparation and data analysis of the full length 16s rrna amplicon pacbio sequel sequencing can be used as a reference for other future studies the unique diversity in fermenters syntrophs and methanogens of anaerobic digesters associated with operating conditions was addressed overlooked methanogenic archaea including the methanogens outside of euryarchaeota and the comparison to our previous illumina miseq result mei et al 2017 were discussed in this regard results gleamed identify overlooked microbiomes and cross link with digestion operations 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection a total of 19 anaerobic digester sludge dna samples were collected from different full scale municipal wastewater treatment plants in 5

sequences ccs by the smrt analysis function the ccs reads were screened using mothur v 1 39 5 schloss et al 2009 and sequences outside of a range of 1300 bp and 1700 bp were removed as ccs reads could be in mixed orientation a check orientation command was added schloss et al 2016 chimaeras were removed using vsearch rognes et al 2016 the taxonomic alignment was performed using the silva 132 reference quast et al 2013 with 80 cut off value operational taxonomic unit otu classification was performed with a 99 identity cut off taxonomic re classification using the silva 132 reference was also performed on the previous illumina miseq data alpha diversity analysis included calculation of various diversity indices inverse simpson and shannon diversity index richness abundance estimators chao1 and ace evenness indices simpson evenness and shannon evenness and good s coverage principal coordinate analysis pcoa was used to evaluate the beta diversity with weighted and unweighted unifrac distance metrics linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse segata et al 2011 was used in identifying the abundant taxa to characterise the ad microbiome among different operating conditions threshold on the logarithmic lda score for discriminative features was set at 2 with an alpha value set at 0 05 all against all strategy for multi class analysis was selected co occurrence network was constructed using the conet method faust and raes 2016 a table of otu with 99 identity cut off was input for the analysis edges were obtained from the calculation using four similarity measures pearson and spearman rank correlations bray curtis and kullback leibler non parametric dissimilarity indices randomisation was performed with 100 iterations of permutation and bootstrap with a p value threshold of 0 05 the networks were visualised by cytoscape v3 0 shannon et al 2003 positive edges only networks were clustered via cytocluster li et al 2017 using oh pin algorithm wang et al 2012 arb ludwig et al 2004 was used for the phylogenetic tree construction the representative sequences from otu classifications were aligned using sina aligner v1 2 11 pruesse et al 2012 and imported to arb the sequences were inserted to the silva 132 ssu ref nr 99 reference tree using parsimony algorithm phylogenetic trees were built using the neighbour joining algorithm with felsenstein correction the bootstrap value was set at 5000 taxonomic identification was performed by blastn v2 8 1 zhang et al 2000 against the silva 132 reference database using megablast algorithm 3 results and discussion 3 1 overview table s2 summarises the number of sequences obtained from samples extracted from seven operating conditions including high salinity pre treatment temperature thermophilic 30 c 40 c and mesophilic and food waste co digestion high quality ccs reads with an average read score of 0 995 0 0004 99 accuracy were achieved by setting the minimum passes at ten table s2 suggesting that such subread alignment can significantly improve the accuracy of pacbio sequence in total 113 970 ccs reads were obtained after quality filtering and chimaera removal from 19 bacterial and 17 archaeal amplicons among them two archaeal amplicons from ussf and hksw were removed due to exceptionally low ccs reads 455 and 131 despite their high dna quality after the two step purification and confirmed gel imaging the average ccs length for the archaeal and bacterial sequence was 1493 43 81 31 and 1509 32 43 63 bp respectively further we selected the silva rrna gene database for being the most comprehensive 16s reference database with a vast collection of the environmental genome segota and long 2019 we retained singletons for diversity profiling considering the advantage of full length 16s gene sequencing thus 10 490 archaeal and 45 775 bacterial otus were classified using 99 sequence similarity overall the bacterial communities had the shannon diversity h and evenness j of 5 27 0 88 and 0 78 0 10 respectively while archaeal communities had values of 2 95 0 79 and 0 60 0 05 respectively for these indices similarly chao 1 richness ace richness inverse simpson and inverse simpson evenness were higher in bacterial communities than archaeal ones table s3 indicating a higher alpha diversity in bacterial communities over its counterpart also the pcoa results showed that the archaeal communities mostly clustered according to the operating conditions while the distribution of bacterial communities was more random fig s1 for the identification the results were varied among different microbial groups nearly half of the methanogen related otus abundance 1 had percent identities higher than 98 7 yarza et al 2014 achieving the identification at the species level lower percent identities were observed in most syntroph related otus the results still generate somewhat insights at species level on the other hand the remaining fermenter related otus could be identified at the genus level in regard to profile the ad community it is more practical to focus on identifying methanogens from archaeal amplicon at this stage 3 2 diversity of the archaeal population with archaea specific primers used the majority of the otus 10 446 out of 10 490 otus could represent 99 76 of total archaeal sequences most were associated with the phylum euryarchaeota so far all the cultivated methanogens are classified to seven orders within euryarchaeota among these seven orders three orders were not observed in the present dataset i e methanocelles methanopyrales and methanococcales fig 1 a methanocelles species have been obtained from rice paddy fields lu and conrad 2005 lÃ¼ and lu 2012 sakai et al 2008 2010 whereas isolates of methanopyrales and methanococcales were all obtained from marine environments especially geothermally heated ecosystems e g deep sea hydrothermal vents huber et al 1982 kurr et al 1991 stewart et al 2015 takai et al 2004 it is thus expected the absence of these three orders in anaerobic digesters conditions the remaining four orders i e methanomicrobiales methanosarcinales methanobacteriales and methanomassiliicoccales contained otus were detected in this study fig 3b most otus were assigned to 14 different genera with cultivated representatives among them methanothrix 4450 otus methanolinea 1673 otus and methanosarcina 1086 otus were the most abundant accounting for 38 14 17 92 and 12 33 of total archaeal sequences respectively distinctly there are sequences related to two candidate genera found in highly enriched cultures have not been isolated yet i e ca methanogranum and ca methanoplasma both belong to the order methanomassiliicoccales and include two lineages lacking cultivated representatives within the family methanomethylophilaceae and methanomassiliicoccaceae the otus associated with methanomassiliicoccales were commonly observed in our study they are abundant in nedr 50 c and esra 30 c with 11 91 and 11 27 of the archaeal population respectively methanomassiliicoccales require hydrogen for methylated compounds metabolisation such as methanol methylamines and methylated thiols adam et al 2017 suggesting its linking carbon nitrogen and sulphur cycles in methanogenesis besides the aforementioned orders being cultivated a class level clade ca methanofastidiosales previously known as wsa2 or arci chouari et al 2005 hugenholtz 2002 is capable of performing methanogenesis via methylated thiol reduction nobu et al 2016 many otus 1048 otus related to this clade were detected with relative abundances ranging from 7 26 to 40 23 among the digesters sampled fig s2a the otus in this clade were phylogenetically diverse and spanned six genus or family level lineages shadowed in fig s2a our data reveal that ca methanofastidiosales is a significant player in anaerobic digestion albeit being overlooked previously in addition to euryarchaeota the sequences related to other archaeal phyla fig s2b were observed twenty two observed otus forming five genus and family level lineages are affiliated with ca bathyarchaeota containing members capable of methanogenesis based on a metagenomics study evans et al 2015 while the members of ca bathyarchaeota are mostly associated with natural environments e g marine and freshwater ecosystems zhou et al 2018 their presence in engineered systems warrants further investigations to understand the metabolism fully likewise the phylum ca verstraetearchaeota not yet been detected in digesters previously was observed in our mesophilic digesters it is believed to be one of the few examples of non euryarchaeota methanogens vanwonterghem et al 2016 seven otus were closely related to the proposed methylotrophic ca methanomethylicus in this phylum in addition fourteen otus associated with ca lokiarchaeota and one otu associated with ca odinarchaeota were detected but no evidence is available about their methanogenic capacity or ecological functions in digesters collectively with the high resolution of the full length sequences a few of the overlooked methanogens were identified further attention is required to understand their roles in ad 3 3 operation driven methanogenic species considering species level identification performed on 35 abundant archaeal otus with relative abundance 1 fig 2 table s4a all had high alignment score 2451 17 96 45 query cover percentage 99 86 0 69 and percent identity 98 35 1 26 to known archaeal species this allows further exploration of their potential functions such as methanogenic pathways optimal growth conditions and substrate utilisation table s5 below we highlight three species by cross referencing the dominance of certain methanogens with the digester operating conditions 3 3 1 methanosarcina horonobensis in the high salinity digester an otu related to methanosarcina horonobensis with 98 67 identity percentage was identified and represented 72 51 of the archaeal population in the high salinity digester hktp as a member of methanosarcina it is generally assumed that it can conduct both hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis on the contrary a physiology study reported that no methane was produced with h2 and co2 by m horonobensis shimizu et al 2011 although according to the genome mapping in kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes m horonobensis contains the key enzymes of utilising h2 and co2 for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis these genes were likely not transcribed another interesting finding reported by shimizu et al 2011 is that m horonobensis grows optimally at 1 05 nacl and can tolerate up to 1 75 nacl while our general understanding is that high salinity has an inhibitory effect on methanogenesis liu and boone 1991 patell and roth 1977 pattnaik et al 2000 it can also grow on dimethylsulfide shimizu et al 2011 which is plentiful in hktp in any event it is rational to link that hktp at a salinity of 0 8 and the high content of dimethylsulfide might serve as the selection measures for the dominance of m horonobensis detected in this study this observation of such a methanogen with the ability to thrive in a particular environment can serve as a guide for inoculum selection when treating specific substrate 3 3 2 methanosarcina flavescens in the thermophilic digesters methanosarcina flavescens was the most abundant species 27 96 in the thermophilic digesters along with other thermophilic species including methanobacterium thermaggregans methanothermobacter tenebrarum methanoculleus receptaculi and methanothrix thermophila cheng et al 2008 kamagata et al 2009 mauerhofer et al 2018 takahashi et al 2012 methanosarcina contains cytochrome c a high intermembrane electron transfer medium serving as a distinguished character compared with other methanogens it is thus postulated that cytochrome c containing methanosarcina could withstand high hydrogen partial pressures compared to methanogens without cytochrome c thauer et al 2008 as thermophilic condition facilitates the production of hydrogen mir et al 2016 it provides a favourable environment for the abundant presence of m flavescens in thermophilic environments albeit the operating temperature 55 c is higher than its optimal growth temperature 45 c kern et al 2016 3 3 3 methanothrix concilii aceticlastic methanothrix concilii sequences olson et al 2011 patell and sprott 1990 were present in digesters under all operating conditions with an average abundance of 18 63 accounting nearly half of the methanothrix population except for that in thermophilic digesters its universal presence leads us to the genome plasticity of methanothrix by elongating the genome methanothrix enriches the favourable phenotypes to adapt to the changing environment maeder et al 2006 methanothrix contains cytochrome c as does methanosarina and both genera are often reported to involve direct interspecies electron transfer diet with geobacter holmes et al 2017 yang et al 2019 moreover a recent metatranscriptomics analysis showed that the diet pathway is associated with ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco mediated co2 reduction and cell synthesis in methanothrix concilii resulting in a high and efficient methane yield olson et al 2011 patell and sprott 1990 this pathway was found to be active in a highly efficient pilot scale anaerobic fluidised bed membrane bioreactor using real sewage as feed demonstrating that it is possible to generate energy from such dilute stream yang et al 2019 whether the enzyme systems involved in diet are unclear however co2 reduction to methane via diet requires coupling with exoelectrogenic geobacter species in the samples of this study geobacter was low in abundance suggesting the methane yield was mainly via the acetoclastic pathway 3 4 diversity of the syntrophic population among the 1601 syntroph related otus detected they were associated with the following phyla proteobacteria 1339 otus firmicutes 229 otus synergistetes 9 otus and ca cloacimonetes 24 otus syntroph related otus represented 4 69 3 88 of the bacterial population with 10 17 in mesophilic digesters and 10 04 in digesters operated at 40 c table s6 noticeably we also observed that their abundance in high salinity 2 70 and thermophilic 2 94 conditions were low in an attempt to obtain taxonomic identification at species level we selected syntroph related otus clustered in the same lineage with cultivated species in the phylogenetic tree for blast as a result seven out of forty six of those syntroph related otus were identified at species level table s4b the average percent identity for taxonomic identification was 96 15 2 09 overall most syntroph related otus were classified under fourteen genera the remaining otus formed uncultured lineages within the families syntrophomonadaceae syntrophaceae and syntrophobacteraceae fig 3a within proteobacteria mesophilic smithella was the most abundant genus accounting for 38 3 47 5 of the syntrophic population in the pre treatment digesters operated at 30 c 40 c and mesophilic condition six uncultured lineages within the genus smithella were detected under various conditions indicating its universal presence fig s2c specifically over 90 of the smithella related otus were closely related to smithella strains d17 and m82 and only one is closely related to smithella propionica notably s propionica possesses a unique propionate degradation pathway 3 mol of hydrogen produced per mol of propionate degraded distinguished from the methylmalonyl coa pathway 1 mol of hydrogen per mol of propionate consumed dolfing 1987 koch et al 1983 even so the lack of key genes like succinate dehydrogenase in strain m82 indicates its inability to degrade propionate qin et al 2017 as was smithella strain d17 tan et al 2014 instead strains d17 and m82 may be involved in alkanes degradation based on their draft genomes embree et al 2014 qin et al 2017 wawrik et al 2016 this interesting observation is divergent from our previous understanding of the genus smithella metabolising in methanogenic propionate degradation bergey et al 2005 as for the otus formed five uncultured lineages within the family syntrophaceae they are phylogenetically closely related to syntrophus fig s2d known for benzoate and fatty acids degradation jackson et al 1999 liu et al 1999 in addition the otus related to the aromatic compound degrading syntrophorhabdus qiu et al 2008 were also in all digesters except for the co digestion of food waste on the opposite the otus related to acetate oxidising syntrophaceticus westerholm et al 2010 and fatty acid oxidising syntrophothermus sekiguchi et al 2000 were uniquely detected in thermophilic digesters at low abundance 0 1 other low abundance syntroph related otus were identified under the proteobacteria genera including desulfovibrio geobacter pelobacter syntrophus and syntrophobacter were in low relative abundance table s6 these results show the diverse survival niches of syntrophs in the various engineered systems sequenced the abundance of ca cloacimonas related otus was seconded to smithella related otus in the syntrophic population within this genus otu 12 identified as ca cloacimonas acidaminovorans 99 74 identity was abundant at 40 c 2 14 out of 4 27 and mesophilic conditions 1 96 out of 3 79 the implication of its pivotal role in propionate degradation and amino acid fermentation pelletier et al 2008b were supported by a few of studies calusinska et al 2018 solli et al 2014 xia et al 2018 ziels et al 2018 moreover three otus within synergistets were identified as thermanaerovibrio acidaminovorans chovatia et al 2009 with a percent identity of 99 93 99 10 and 97 15 t acidaminovorans ferments a range of amino acids to acetate and propionate with hydrogen as the only reduced end product guangsheng et al 1992 they were present in high salinity thermophilic and 40 c operated digesters at low abundance 0 5 only the fatty acid degrading syntrophomonas related otus were detected crossing all the operating conditions syntrophomonas sapovorans and syntrophomonas palmitatica were identified in the mesophilic digesters with a percentage identity of 98 26 and 100 respectively potentially utilise fatty acids with 4 18 carbon atoms hatamoto et al 2007 inclusively our results show the importance of syntrophy in amino acids degradation in digestion 3 5 characterisation of the bacterial communities covering 23 established and 30 candidate phyla in the list of prokaryotic names with standing in nomenclature parte 2018 fifty three bacterial phyla fig s3 table s7 were identified the taxa recovered in the studies using sanger sequencing chouari et al 2005 riviÃ¨re et al 2009 zhang et al 2014 were observed in our result bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria with broad metabolic potentials were ubiquitous and abundant fortunately due to the expansion of the constructed draft genome done herein somewhat metabolic interpretation of candidate phyla is possible plant polysaccharide degrading ca patescibacteria taubert et al 2019 was particularly abundant in pre treatment digesters 19 71 digesters operated at 30 c 21 49 and hksw 30 56 the candidate phyla acetothermia atribacteria brc1 proposed name sumerlaeota cloacimonetes hydrogenedentes margulisbacteria modulibacteria and zixibacteria are likely involved in fermentative reaction and acetate and or hydrogen formation balashov et al 2018 castelle et al 2013 eijsink et al 2016 hao et al 2018 kadnikov et al 2019 nobu et al 2015 pelletier et al 2008a sekiguchi et al 2015 utami et al 2019 moreover eleven candidate phyla with metabolically reconstructed genomic information are not associated with methanogenesis while the genomic information of the remaining eleven is not available other than these further information is unavailable alternatively to illustrate their taxonomic profiling further we used the lefse analysis to characterise the ad microbiome specific to particular operating conditions as shown in fig 3a taxa highlighted by small circles and shadings in the cladogram were discriminately abundant in the respective conditions to supplement it we performed a co occurrence network analysis to explore the potential interspecies interactions fig 4 this generates fifty eight subnetworks clustering into 433 nodes and 972 edges fig s4 using the all against all strategy the lefse analysis revealed that a diverse group of the class clostridia including lanchnospiracea peptococcaceae ruminococcaceae and uncultured d8a 2 groups had a more significant role in the thermophilic digesters fig 3a representative species of these genera can survive under extreme conditions such as high temperature environment yutin and galperin 2013 notably in one of the sub networks these clostridia related otus were co present with a group of coprothermobacteraeota related otus fig 4a together we hypothesise that they are the potential volatile fatty acids vfas producers mainly propionate and acetate in the thermophilic digesters another group of fermentative anaerolineae related otus was abundant in the high salinity digester fig 3a this lineage was also observed in a study with high abundance in high salinity environments yang et al 2016 in addition fig 4b shows the close connection between the otus related to anaerolineae and propionibacteriaceae via rikenellaceae such synergetic association could be due to one s end products can be used as the substrates for others e g acetate propionate and alcohol prior to methanogenesis graf 2014 mcilroy et al 2017 stackebrandt 2014 other than the aforementioned fig 4c showed the syntroph related otus e g smithella ca cloaimonas and uncultured syntrophaceae were connected with the otus related to kiritimatiellaeota spirochaetes and acidobacteria via brc1 related otus in the mesophilic condition they are also directly associated with the otus related to vadinha17 group and other bacteroidetes fig 4d although the function of vadinha17 group remains unknown its wide appearance with its connection with syntrophs suggested that it involves in vfas production in order to characterise the bacterial composition at species level taxonomic identification using blast was performed on the otus with a relative abundance 1 six out of sixty one otus were identified with an average percent identity of 86 05 7 65 interestingly three of the identified bacteria coprothermobacter proteolyticus acetomicrobium mobile and defluviitoga tunisiensis were isolated from anaerobic digesters alexiev et al 2014 ben hania et al 2016 hania et al 2012 to fill the gap a customised reference dataset derived from the specific environment is necessary because the classical cultivation based microbiological methods for digestion systems are challenging in compliance with the full length 16s rrna sequences constructing draft genome from cultivation free whole metagenomic sequencing is one of the practical options therefore such reference dataset for species level identification cross mapping with operating conditions and performance would facilitate unprecedented digestion optimisation 3 6 comparison to the previous short read result the comparison between the bacterial long read sequences from pacbio sequel and short read sequences v4 v5 from illumina miseq in diversity profiling and taxonomic classification is performed for alpha diversity the boxplots indicate that the overall distribution of shannon diversity h of the long read result albeit having a lower coverage value fig s5b is slightly higher than the short read one fig s5a to improve the coverage of the long read approach it is suggested to increase the data output of the sequence data as demonstrated by callahan et al 2019 and wagner et al 2016 accordingly the long read approach could provide sufficient coverage equivalent to the short read approach to evaluate beta diversity dendrograms show the microbial clusters with weighted unifrac as distance matrix fig s6 both results showed similar clustering particularly the thermophilic digesters and the digesters operated at 40 c were clustered in the same manner overall the difference in alpha and beta diversity are marginal for the taxonomic classification 15 additional otus were observed in the long read result within the abundant otus relative abundance 2 table s8 presents the heatmap of the percentage difference between the long read and short read results in the ten most abundant phyla the results show that the short read approach underestimates certain phyla for instance in the same samples the composition of ca patescribacteria in the short read results were from 0 34 to 2 75 while it ranged from 20 96 to 42 87 in the long read result another noticeable discrepancy is the distribution of thermophilic phyla thermotogae and ca coprothermobacteraeota in the thermophilic digesters thermotogae recovered from the short read sequences were 15 03 27 55 more than the long read sequences while the ca coprothermobacteraeota detected in the long read sequences was 2 98 8 24 more in addition the misclassification in the short read result was found for example the genus ca coprothermobacter from phylum ca coprothermobacteraeota in the long read result was misclassified as fervidobacterium from phylum thermotogae in the short read one this might be due to the two genera described as sister in phylogenetic placement potentially contributed to the discrepancy in taxonomic classification kunath et al 2019 pavan et al 2018 also singer et al 2016 reported the overrepresentation of fervidobacterium using v4 region amplicon considering the physiologies of ca coprothermobacter and fervidobacterium the former is potentially involved in hydrogen production while the latter is a sulphur reducing bacterium that completes with methanogens for substrates given that both were the second most abundant otus it could lead to inappropriate interpretations in microbial composition and digester performance external validation may be required to determine the accuracy of both sequencing approaches for such observations 4 conclusion this study demonstrated the methodology in dealing with low quality environmental dna samples for the full length 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing using pacbio sequel the results provide a higher resolution on the identification facilitating the description of the microbial composition of anaerobic digestion the highlighted methanogenic species i e methanosarcina horonobensis methanosarcina flavescens were dominant in their respective environments manifesting the value of species level specificity through the expansion of the genome database and improvement of the sequencing protocol and chemical the application of the full length sequencing on mixed culture environmental and engineering samples can be more promising declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

fluid dynamics and discrete element method cfd dem modeling verified that the selection pressure created by the tst separator contributed to the retention of heavy granules 1 011 kg m3 density in st 1 zone and the withdrawal of light flocs 1 011 kg m3 density from st 2 zone therefore the segregation of biomass using the tst system provides an opportunity to select for desired microbial populations and to optimize the nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance of the a2o tst reactor this study could add a guiding sight into the application of two sludge system based on ags technology for upgrading traditional a2o process graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge a2o tst cfd dem modeling microbial differentiation nutrient removal real sewage 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags is a well established microbial immobilization method in biological wastewater treatment allowing the formation of sludge with higher biomass retention as well as improved settleability and resistance to shock loading or toxic compounds compared to conventional activated sludge pronk et al 2015b ags aggregates can be operated under switching redox conditions and are applicable on a large scale for wastewater treatment including carbon removal nitrogen and phosphorus elimination the layered structure of ags supports multiple biological processes liu et al 2020 with the oxygen mass transfer resistance inducing the growth of aerobic bacteria e g nitrifiers in the outer layer while facultative or anaerobic organisms e g polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos and denitrifying bacteria exist towards the interior of granules bao et al 2011 pronk et al 2015a bengtsson et al 2018 until recently some factors have been considered to be important in granulation such as alternating feast famine conditions selection pressure based on granule size or settling velocity and hydraulic shear stress kent et al 2018 to date ags have commonly been studied and engineered in sequential batch reactors sbrs which are considered to provide ideal feast famine conditions for the formation of aerobic granules liu and tay 2015 with an anaerobic feeding phase followed by aerobic treatment however in the operation of a municipal wastewater treatment plant there is a high need for cultivation of ags in continuous flow reactors cfrs which is the most commonly engineered process for nutrient removal across the world and provides several advantages with batch operation such as simple operation and control methods the capacity to tolerate heavy processing loads and the requirement for low installation investment juang et al 2010 corsino et al 2016a chen et al 2017 the existing knowledge acquired from aerobic granulation studies in sbrs provide sufficient knowledge for understanding of the formation mechanisms for aerobic granules in cfrs many attempts to cultivate ags in cfrs have been made based on the selection pressure created by the different size or settling time of granules for instance liu et al 2012 reported the use of a downstream sieve screen which allows small flocs size 0 1 mm to pass through while larger aggregates remain for the promotion of ags cultivation in a continuous membrane biological reactor li et al 2016 utilized an external settling tank with adjustable outlet locations to achieve selective segregation of biomass with different densities and settling times in a continuous phosphorous removal system nevertheless the application of ags in cfr remains difficult due to the different operational environments and ags cultivation conditions in cfrs compared to in sbrs thus hydrodynamic behaviors and granule selective approaches need further investigation to comprehensively understand the mechanisms of ags cultivation in cfrs the recent reported findings provide a reliable approach to promote the formation of ags in continuous aerobic reactor using a two zone sedimentation tank tst treating real low strength wastewater zou et al 2018b the tst system design ensures the effective settling of granules retained in the reactor while the poorly settled biomass is removed during sludge discharge however the aerobic granulation study in cfr using tst system has been performed in a single aerobic tank which possesses the oxidation of ammonium and organic matter but lack of the capacity for nitrogen and phosphorus removal zou et al 2018b considering the demand for n and p removal in practice and the fact that anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o process is most widely used in the full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps jin et al 2014 the feasibility for ags formation in a2o process using tst system is need further investigation furthermore the effect of aerobic granulation on the nutrient removal and microbial community structure of a2o reactor is as yet unclear in ags system different biological niches for functional groups can be generated within one reactor compartment because of segregation of differently sized microbial aggregates i e flocs small granule and large granule pronk et al 2015b previous research has shown that the biomass in ags reactor is not homogeneously distributed over the height of the settled sludge bed with large granules often more concentrate at the bottom and flocs remain at the top ali et al 2019 different microbial communities can occur as a function of different depths in the sludge bed due to the differences of habitat conditions at certain depths e g substrate concentrations environmental factors winkler et al 2011b selective sludge withdrawal from different locations of sludge bed can be used to control the microbial competition between paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos winkler et al 2011a or between nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria winkler et al 2011b in granular sludge reactor in traditional a2o process there is a well known contradiction that nitrifiers need higher sludge retention times srts than paos for maintaining nitrification activity if the ags system can be applied in the a2o process it remains unclear that the well known contradiction of srts between nitrifiers and paos can be resolved in this study the cultivation of ags through the selective pressure created by the presence of two sequential settling zones was investigated in a continuous a2o reactor with a tst separator treating municipal sewage the characteristics of sludge and nutrient removal performance e g carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in the reactor were monitored and the differences in bacterial community structure among the two settling zones were analyzed to reveal the different biological niches of bacteria present in the a2o tst reactor furthermore a mathematical modeling tool based on computational fluid dynamics cfd and discrete element method dem coupling model was applied to simulate the hydrodynamic transport of granules for understanding the granulation mechanisms in the tst system 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater and seed sludge the real sewage used in this study was collected from the primary sedimentation tank at gaobeidian wwtp in beijing china the main characteristics of the wastewater were as follows ph 7 2 0 2 total chemical oxygen demand tcod concentration of 294 1 75 5 mg l soluble cod scod of 244 5 46 1 mg l biochemical oxygen demand bod5 of 125 2 27 8 mg l ammonium nitrogen nh4 n concentration of 37 9 4 8 mg l total nitrogen tn concentration of 42 5 6 2 mg l total phosphorus tp concentration of 5 5 0 8 mg l total suspended solids tss concentration of 170 33 mg l the combined presence of acetate and propionate in the influent favors the metabolism of pao over gao lopez vazquez et al 2009 thus in order to acquire excellent effluent quality and rapid granulation external carbon source composed of sodium acetate naac and sodium propionate napr at a mass concentration ratio of 10 1 was added into the influent to compensate the shortfall in the readily biodegradable organic matter during operation seed sludge taken from the returned sludge groove at the gaobeidian wwtp presented a well settling capacity due to the higher inorganic content in the sludge the initial tss and volatile suspended solids vss concentration were 4000 100 and 2500 100 mg l respectively the sludge volume index after 30 min svi30 and mean particle size for seed sludge were 75 1 2 0 ml g and 42 Î¼m respectively 2 2 reactor setup and operation a pilot scale rectangular a2o tst reactor 83 cm 74 cm 60 cm with a working volume of 202 l was used in this study fig 1 and the real setup diagram of reactor is delineated in fig s1 the reactor was constructed of plexiglass and contained an anaerobic zone an anoxic zone and an aerobic zone with volumes of 30 l 45 l and 127 l respectively the sedimentation tank consisted of two identical settling zones denoted as st 1 and st 2 respectively equivalent to an advection sedimentation tank to provide the selection pressure for aerobic granulation in the cfr a moveable baffle above the st 1 zone was set to adjust the selection pressure sludge recirculation external recycling from the st 1 zone to the anaerobic zone and nitrite nitrate recirculation internal recycling from the aerobic zone to the anoxic zone were conducted using a diaphragm pump to avoid the disintegration of ags by conventional peristaltic pumps the sufficient mixing speed 100 rpm and high aeration driving force 80 l h provide the required shear stress for granulation in the reactor agitation was applied in the anaerobic and anoxic zones to maintain uniform mixtures air was supplied to the aerobic zone via sand bubble diffusers placed at the bottom of the reactor the operation of the a2o tst reactor was divided into three stages over 115 days as summarized in table 1 at the end of phase i the influent cod concentration was increased from 341 20 to 441 35 mg l by the addition of an external carbon source while the hydraulic retention time hrt in the reactor decreased from 13 5 to 10 1 h as the result the volumetric organic loading rate olr during the experimental period increased from 0 61 to 1 05 kg cod m3 d fig s2 from day 71 onwards the moveable baffle in the st 1 zone was removed to intensify the selection pressure for further promoting aerobic granulation in the reactor at the end of each operational stage sludge samples were withdrawn from the aerobic zone to investigate the variation in particle size and content of extracellular polymeric substances eps in granular sludge besides on day 115 all the sludge present in the st 1 and st 2 zones were discharged from the bottom of settling zone and then respectively mixed as the representative sludge samples for analysis of sludge properties e g particle size and eps content and nucleotide extraction during the whole experimental period the dissolved oxygen do content in the aeration zone was manually controlled to 3 4 mg l and the temperature ranged from 20 to 30 c with seasonal temperature changes the srt which was calculated on the basis of the equation in the section 1 of the supplementary material has varied in a broad range between 5 and 60 days the external recycling ratio and internal recycling ratio were set at 100 and 200 respectively 2 3 sample collection and analytical procedures during the experimental period liquid samples in the feed reactor and effluent were filtered periodically using 0 45 Î¼m filters minisart sartorius stedim biotech germany and analyzed to monitor the reactor performance svi5 and svi30 was measured twice or thrice per week using a sludge sample 0 2 l taken from the aerobic zone concentrations of tcod scod bod5 nh4 n tn tp svi tss and vss were analyzed according to the standard methods apha 2005 nitrite nitrogen no2 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n were measured by ion chromatography ics 1100 thermo fisher scientific usa sludge morphology was visualized with a magnification of 40 using an optical microscope cx31 olympus japan sludge samples taken from the aerobic zone 40 d 70 d and 115 d and settling zones 115 d were applied to conduct particle size measurement using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer bettersize 3000plus better china each measurement was repeated for 3 times and the average value was presented in figures temperature ph and do were monitored using a wtw multi 340i meter wtw company germany the eps content of sludge samples from aerobic zone 0 d 40 d 70 d and 115 d and settling zones 115 d was extracted via a heating method zou et al 2015 the sludge suspension was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min in a volume of 40 ml tube and washed three times with deionized water after removed the supernatant the sludge samples were then resuspended into 15 ml of 0 05 nacl solution subsequently the sludge mixture was placed in a water bath at 80 c for 30 min followed by centrifuging 8000 rpm for 15 min finally the supernatant filtered through a 0 22 Î¼m cellulose membrane minisart sartorius stedim biotech germany was collected to analyze the eps content the protein pn content of eps was measured via the bicinchoninic acid method with bovine albumin serum used as a standard smith et al 1985 the polysaccharide ps content of eps was measured via the anthrone method using glucose as a standard wu et al 2010 2 4 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing data analysis three sludge samples acquired from seed sludge sludge in st 1 and st 2 zones sampled on 115 d were freeze dried for nucleotide extraction the dna was extracted from 0 1 g of each freeze dried sludge samples using fast dna spin kits for soil mp biomedicals usa according to manufacturer s instructions liu et al 2017b the extracted dna samples were sent to allwegene medical technology co ltd beijing china for high throughput sequencing using the illumina miseqpe300 platform illumina usa the v3 v4 regions of bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified using the 338f actcctacgggaggcagca and 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat primers allowing the original sequence data to be generated following this the low quality sequences and chimeras were removed to obtain the effective sequences and the sequences of all samples were homogenized to ensure that they were analyzed and compared at the same sequencing depth sequence analysis was carried out using qiime software and the operational classification units otu with a similarity of 97 were separated using the usearch algorithm the alpha diversity including rarefaction curves shannon diversity index species richness estimator of chao1 and diversity coverage were calculated in mothur for each sample the silva database was used to annotate the specific otu species and the diversity and community composition of taxonomic information was analyzed the raw sequence data was uploaded to the genbank database under accession number srr10814980 srr10814981 and srr10814982 2 5 cfd dem simulation methods and conditions in this study a cfd dem modeling was applied to simulate the sludge settling and separating performance in the tst separator the flowing fluid and moving particles in the tst were regarded as the continuous phase and discrete phase as described by the local averaged navier stokes equations and newton s second law respectively the eulerian method was used to describe the interface between water and particles and the k epsilon model was applied as the turbulence model el emam et al 2019 the governing equations for fluid and solid phase are given in section 2 of the supplementary material the fluid was segmented into multiple cells before calculation within each iteration step cfd was used to model the fluid flow in cells while dem was applied to calculate the interactive force of each particle and their location in cells using the physical parameters e g velocity and pressure produced by cfd for the realization of the cfd dem simulations the mesh and boundary conditions used in this study are shown in fig s3 taking into account the accuracy of result and the computation time the tst fluid zone was divided into 373218 tetrahedral cells the fluid phase was regarded as incompressible water at 20 c for the boundary the inlet velocity and the reflux ratio were set at 5 10 2 m s and 100 respectively the characteristics of particles are outlined in table 2 for the discrete phase ags and flocs entered the tst from the position of the water inlet compared with flocs ags has a more regular shape with a more compact structure and higher density therefore for a simple distinction the shape of ags was assumed to be a sphere while flocs were described as being composed of an irregular geometry consisting of four spheres fig s4 after calculations were finished the performance of the tst separator was evaluated by the distribution proportions of particles with different densities and sizes between st 1 and st 2 zones to verify the reliability of cfd dem modeling the experimental data in regard with the percentages of settled ags with diverse mean particle size 100 200 300 400 Î¼m in st 1 and st 2 zones was applied the screening strategy of ags with specified diameter test method and assessment criteria are described in section 3 of the supplementary material 3 results 3 1 formation of ags in the a2o tst reactor aerobic granulation in the cfr was successfully achieved based on the setup of a two zone sedimentation region at the terminal of the a2o tst reactor fig 2 unlike with traditional a2o reactor the existing sludge in sedimentation tank is divided into two parts the sludge in st 1 zone as recycling sludge is continuously returned to the anaerobic zone and the sludge in st 2 zone as excess sludge is periodically washed out from the reactor fig 2d from day 1 to day 20 of operational phase i the tss concentration sharply decreased from 3980 to 1637 mg l indicating that almost 75 of the original sludge was excluded due to the settling based selection pressure then the tss concentration gradually improved and stabilized at 2303 136 mg l by the end of phase i fig 2a while the average particle size of sludge increased from 42 to 114 Î¼m fig 2b and the svi30 decreased from 73 4 to 49 0 ml g during phase i fig 2a during phase ii the influent volumetric olr was enhanced to increase the granule diameter and sludge concentration as a result the tss concentration increased from 2282 to 3448 mg l while the ags mean particle size was further enlarged to 154 Î¼m by day 70 and the svi5 svi30 ratio remained stable at about 1 imaging showed that a larger uneven and irregular structure of granules was formed in the cfr in comparison with the sludge aggregates observed in phase i fig s5 furthermore the concentrations of ps and pn in sludge eps were gradually increased from 34 4 3 4 and 54 1 8 4 mg g vss on day 1 68 4 2 9 and 137 7 13 2 mg g vss on day 70 respectively fig 2c in phase iii the selection pressure in the reactor reached a maximum when the moveable baffle was removed from above the st 1 zone following this a considerable loss of biomass was observed in the initial stage of phase iii but biomass recovered to 3490 mg l after one week of adaption fig 2a finally tss concentration and svi30 stabilized respectively at 3540 58 mg l and 47 5 1 0 ml g and ps and pn concentrations have a slight decrease to 62 7 4 6 and 126 2 10 0 mg g vss on day 115 respectively moreover the appearance of ags shifted from a loose irregular structure to a dense round structure with the size of granules 200 500 Î¼m in the reactor becoming more homogeneous fig s5 at the end of phase iii the distribution of particle size showed that ags with a larger particle size was settled in the st 1 zone than in the st 2 zone with the overall mean ags particle size in the reactor increasing to 210 Î¼m fig 2b 3 2 performance of nutrient removal in the reactor the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance of the a2o tst reactor are shown in fig 3 the cod removal efficiency generally remained higher than 90 during the whole operational process independent of the sludge characteristics and influent volumetric olrs in the reactor fig 3c for n removal the removal capacity had a positive relationship with the degree of sludge granulation in the reactor the average tn removal efficiency was 82 3 3 7 in phase i increasing stepwise to 86 8 3 9 in phase ii and to 91 4 3 4 in phase iii accompanied by the formation of ags in the reactor fig 3a a similar trend of variation were observed for phosphorus removal in both periods with the average tp removal efficiency increasing from 88 0 2 3 to 95 8 1 2 fig 3b after stabilizing an excellent nutrient removal performance was achieved with effluent cod tn and tp concentrations of 22 8 5 9 3 5 1 2 and 0 2 0 1 mg l respectively in contrast the effluent nutrient concentrations in the reactor were superior to that in the full scale ags sbr process for the treatment of domestic wastewater pronk et al 2015b which might be related to the lesser effluent suspended solids due to the settling of flocs in st 2 zone to elucidate the nutrient removal mechanism in the a2o tst reactor a typical variation of cod tn tp and no x no2 no3 concentrations alongside the reactor on day 115 are shown in fig 3d and the mass balances calculations for n and p are summarized in table s1 it is found that in the anoxic tank the tn and tp concentration were both rapidly decreased indicating that denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms dpaos might present at the system base on the p mass balance the proportion of p removal functioned by dpaos accounted for 12 7 furthermore the majority of p removal 86 6 was conducted by paos in the aerobic zone table s1 for n removal the tn concentration gradually reduced from 50 3 to 5 8 mg n l alongside the reactor in the aerobic zone ammonium is almost converted entirely to nitrate while a portion of n is simultaneously denitrified indicating that the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd might occur due to the layered structure of granular sludge liu et al 2020 in the anaerobic zone readily biodegradable organic matters are stored as intracellular polymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates phas data not shown acting as electron donor for endogenous denitrification that occur in the inner of granules under aerobic condition the addition of external carbon source e g naac and napr in the influent promoted the function of snd resulting in that the contribution of snd to n removal was about 17 9 on basis of the n mass balance table s1 the synergistic effects of snd in the aerobic zone and denitrifying phosphorus removal dnpr in the anoxic zone optimized the n and p removal capacity in the continuous granule reactor 3 3 microbial community structure analysis high throughput sequencing based on bacterial 16s rrna genes was applied to analyze the microbial community structure in samples of seed sludge along with sludge from st 1 and st 2 the coverage values for each sample were above 98 suggesting that the sequencing depths were sufficient to cover the whole community table s2 the species richness as evaluated by the chao1 index was 1282 for seed sludge 786 for st 1 and 708 for st 2 indicating that the microbial diversity of sludge gradually decreased throughout the cfr granulation process the shannon diversity index is generally used to evaluate the abundance and evenness of microbial species of the sludge samples du et al 2019 the shannon index value of seed sludge 8 42 was higher than that of both st 1 7 92 and st 2 6 58 implying that the abundance and evenness of species in seed sludge also declined after granulation the phylogenetic classifications of microbial communities in all three samples are summarized at the phylum fig 4 and genus levels fig 5 the two most abundant phyla in seed sludge st 1 and st 2 were proteobacteria 44 66 50 79 and 60 58 respectively and bacteroidetes 20 63 20 48 and 33 51 respectively proteobacteria and bacteroidetes play an important role in the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycles and have been reported to be the most common phylum in activated sludge processes liu et al 2017a other main phyla observed in the seed sludge were chloroflexi 12 16 acidobacteria 4 70 and actinobacteria 3 18 in contrast the other dominant phyla in sludge from st 1 and st 2 were firmicutes 6 63 and 2 24 respectively nitrospirae 4 70 and 0 27 respectively and chloroflexi 4 18 and 0 69 respectively fig 4 the microbial community of seed sludge changed significantly after ags formation while the dominant taxa in sludge sample in the two settling zones st 1 and st 2 also exhibited larger differences at the genus level the main genera groups identified in the st 1 zone were nitrospira 4 70 om27 clade 4 13 thauera 3 0 and dokdonella 2 68 while in the st 2 zone flavobacterium 8 56 arcobacter 7 69 dechloromoas 7 47 halomonas 3 51 and ca accumulibacter 2 71 were identified fig 5 in general nitrosomonas and nitrospira are genera representing typical ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nob respectively compared to seed sludge in st 1 the relative abundance of aob decreased from 2 80 to 1 12 while the relative abundance of nob increased from 1 58 to 4 70 in contrast nitrifying bacteria almost completely disappeared from the community in st 2 0 28 of aob and 0 27 of nob furthermore the most abundant genera observed in the sludge of st 2 were related to microorganisms performing the phosphorus and organic matter removal process ca accumulibacter belonging to the well known paos acevedo et al 2012 was dominant in the continuously discharged sludge of st 2 with a relative abundance of 2 71 but was less abundant in the sludge of st 1 at only 0 06 dechloromonas function as important bacterium for dnpr stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 and exhibited a higher abundance in st 2 at 7 47 than in st 1 at 0 25 or seed sludge at 0 59 similarly ca competibacter and defluviicoccus categorized as gaos also exhibited a higher abundance in the sludge of st 2 than either st 1 or seed sludge in addition ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos including flavobacterium arcobacter and halomonas which function as organic removal bacteria also dominated in the sludge of st 2 with the proliferation of these heterotrophic organisms after inoculation potentially being due to the use of an external carbon source in the experiment collado et al 2010 li et al 2014 pronk et al 2014 3 4 simulating the granules selection mechanism of the tst using cfd dem modeling for evaluation of the sludge separating performance of the tst separator the distribution of settled particles with different densities and sizes in the st 1 and st 2 zones were obtained from cfd dem simulation and experimental data fig 6 the experimental results are utilized to validate the accuracy of cfd dem model established in this study indicating that the simulation curve possesses rather high prediction precision and can represents the separation characteristic of ags with different particle sizes in the tst separator fig 6b the simulated results showed that heavier or larger particles density 1 011 kg m3 or particle size 350 Î¼m were all settled in the st 1 zone while lighter and smaller particles density 1 011 kg m3 or particle size 350 Î¼m were random distributed across the two settling zones for lighter or smaller flocs the proportion of settled particles in the st 2 zone gradually increases with the reduction of the density and size of particles the turbulent intensity reflected by turbulent kinetic energy showed that turbulent region merely occurred in the connected hole reflux and water outlet of the tst separator and the vast majority of regions in the fluid zone exhibited stable laminar flow which provides a well stratified environment for particle separation fig s6 the settling velocity and motional trajectory of flocs and granular sludge were traced by simulating the flow of particles in the fluid zone fig 7 a three dimensional simulation of the flow of particles showed that the horizontal and longitudinal velocities of particles play an important role in driving the particles to move from the inlet to the outlet furthermore it can be seen that two significant areas of downward longitudinal velocity favored the layering and settling of particles in the st 1 zone fig 7b the compounding forces from gravity buoyancy and interactional collision forces of particle particle or particle wall cause the particles to vertically rise or sink in the tst separator ma et al 2019 thus the presence of the baffle changed the direction of flow and accelerated the settling of particles promoting the retention of ags with a higher density 1 020 kg m3 which could settle rapidly in the st 1 zone fig 7d however the trajectory of flocs with a lower density 1 003 kg m3 varied when entering into the tst separator from a different entrance the flocs entering from an upper position could bypass the reflux controlled area and enter the st 2 zone with the fluid flow while the flocs entering from a lower position would be caught by the reflux controlled area and returned from the st 1 zone to the front of the anaerobic zone fig 7e and 7f 4 discussion 4 1 successful granulation can be achieved in the a2o tst reactor several pilot and full scale ags plants performed in sbrs are currently in operation worldwide but few information are available regarding the successful granulation in continuous flow our study aimed at cultivating of ags in continuous a2o reactor combined with a two zone sedimentation tank during the treatment of municipal sewage the design of tst system was successful in cultivating ags in cfr with a larger particle size 210 Î¼m and good settling property low svi30 of 47 5 ml g both the long term operational data fig 2b and simulation results fig 6 all showed that the selection pressure created by tst separator contributed to the separation of heavy granules and light flocs the less dense and lighter biomass was washed out from the st 2 zone while the denser and heavier biomass settled in the st 1 zone and was recycled to the reactor which is consistent with previous study findings zou et al 2018b xu et al 2020 different from the external nucleating agent addition e g micropowder natural drying sludge it should however be noticed that the well settling seed sludge svi30 of 75 1 ml g in this study provided a good initial separating condition for tst system promoting the rapid sludge granulation in the continuous system sludge size is closely correlated with settling velocity and the eps synthesis which is very important for the granulation and settling ability of sludge corsino et al 2016b zhang et al 2016b during the granulation process eps synthesis by the aggregated microorganisms was observed because of the remarkable increase of eps content in the sludge sample after exposed to the elevated influent olr fig 2c this confirmed the previous findings that high volumetric olr can induce eps secretion to promote the growth of ags with large particle sizes liu and tay 2015 in addition the selective pressure of tst system promotes the retention of granules with higher ps and pn concentrations 74 4 3 1 and 144 9 4 6 mg g vss respectively in the st 1 zone and the withdrawal of flocs with lower ps and pn concentrations 53 9 6 7 and 101 8 4 5 mg g vss respectively from the st 2 zone fig 2c more eps synthesis facilitates the adhesion of cell cell or cell particulates into a microbial aggregate in which the particulates e g chemical precipitation influent particulate materials act as nuclei for cell attachment sarma et al 2017 furthermore the composition of eps e g ps and pn also varied significantly and the raised pn ps ratio from 1 57 on day 1 2 01 on day 115 verified that granular sludge possesses higher pn content in eps than flocculent sludge which can improve the hydrophobicity and stability of ags aggregates zou et al 2018b different settling velocity between granules and flocs provides a strong selective pressure for selection of granules as dominant form of biomass in the ags system zhang et al 2016b in this study the sludge settling velocity consisted of horizontal longitudinal and vertical velocities in three dimensional reference system fig 7 would be equal to the flow rate divided by the cross sectional area the simulation results showed that granules with higher density 1 020 kg m3 in certain regions around the baffle reflux outlet of st 1 zone could reach to the high downward longitudinal velocity 72 144 m h fig 7d within the range of the typical granule settling velocity 12 145 m h in ags sbr system winkler et al 2012 it could however be observed that the settling velocity of flocs with lower density 1 003 kg m3 entering from an upper position was merely in the range between 0 and 14 4 m h along the downward longitudinal direction fig 7e this leads to that granules with higher settling velocity could be retained in the st 1 zone while flocs are washed out with the fluid flow to the st 2 zone therefore the successive two zone sedimentation tank layout provides a good opportunity for the separation of ags and flocs resulting in the effective formation of aerobic granulation in the cfr 4 2 microbial differentiation achieved by the selective sludge discharge in tst system since the selective sludge discharge is accomplished from the st 2 zone in the a2o tst reactor it is evident that st 1 granules have a longer sludge age than the averaged srt 20 11 d while the sludge age of flocs in st 2 zone is very low different srts of granules and flocs in the two settling zones resulted in the microbial differentiation in the same reactor compartment the granules of st 1 zone were enriched with slow growing autotrophic organisms like aobs and nobs while flocs of st 2 zone were dominated by fast growing heterotrophic organisms including paos gaos and ohos fig 5 previous study has reported that both nitrosomonas and nitrospira are categorized as chemoautotrophic bacteria which require long srts to be enriched munz et al 2011 therefore the longer sludge age of granular sludge in the st 1 zone provides an opportunity for the growth of nitrifying bacteria furthermore thauera dokdonella and zoogloea were the dominant denitrifying bacteria in the reactor with the function of exopolysaccharide secretion promoting granulation shinoda et al 2004 pishgar et al 2019 the higher abundance of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in the granular sludge of st 1 promoted the snd performance during the aerobic phase which is closely related to the n removal capacity of the reactor phosphate removing bacteria e g ca accumulibacter and dechloromonas in the reactor were mainly centralized in flocs of the st 2 zone and regular sludge discharge from this region was conducive to p removal excess p was absorbed by either paos in the aeration zone or dpaos in the anoxic zone then being discharged from the st 2 zone avoiding secondary p release due to the long srt in the settling tank therefore timely discharge of p enriched sludge from the st 2 zone ensured the p removal performance of the reactor and thus a higher abundance of paos than gaos were identified fig 5 however this result contradicts the conventional understanding that paos are more easily enriched in granular sludge due to the intracellular polymers like polyphosphate phas and glycogen stored inside the paos cytoplasm winkler et al 2011a li et al 2016 the short srt of sludge in the st 2 zone contributes to the paos metabolism which might be the reason for this abnormal phenomenon some genera capable of organic carbon removal e g flavobacterium arcobacter and halomonas were also observed in st 2 sludge supporting that carbon sources removal was more likely to be performed by flocs than granules lashkarizadeh et al 2015 zou et al 2018a these results suggest that the segregation of diverse size and density granules through additional selective pressure resulted in microbial differentiation while different srts resulted in a two sludge system which could optimize the nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance of the a2o tst reactor 4 3 significance for upgrading a2o process with a two zone sedimentation tank the unique design of two zone sedimentation tank plays an important role in achieving aerobic granulation and biomass segregation in continuous a2o reactor selective sludge removal at different settling zones can be applied to construct a two sludge system for desired microbial populations in the a2o tst process fig 2d in traditional a2o processes the functional bacteria related to nitrogen and phosphorus removal coexist in one mixed sludge system leading to the contradiction of srts between nitrifiers and paos the different biological niches of bacteria induced by the tst system could help to unravel the intrinsic contradiction of srts involved in nitrogen and phosphorus removal in traditional a2o process similarly previous findings have reported that a two sludge system integrating an a2o reactor and biological contact oxidation bco has been developed to achieve biological niche separation resulting in paos was dominant bacteria in the a2o reactor while nitrifiers enriched in the bco reactor zhang et al 2016a however the utilization of biofilm carriers in bco reactors increases operational and capital costs in contrast ags involves the self immobilization of microorganisms which could avoid the need for large economic inputs for upgrading the traditional a2o process furthermore the modification of secondary sedimentation tank by tst system in existing a2o facilities is a simple and cost effective method to promote ags formation and to optimize the n and p removal capacity in the cfrs 5 conclusion in this study a continuous pilot scale a2o reactor equipped with a tst system was developed to investigate the formation of ags in cfrs the tst separator provided selection pressure to achieve effective settling and retention of ags and wash out of the poor settling flocs resulting in the svi30 eventually reaching 47 5 ml g a satisfactory nutrient removal capacity was also achieved in the reactor with effluent cod tn and tp concentrations of 22 8 3 5 and 0 2 mg l respectively bacterial community analysis showed that the dominant bacteria in st 1 were capable of nitrification and denitrification while the dominant bacteria in st 2 were capable of phosphorus and organics removal furthermore cfd dem modeling indicated that density and size were the critical parameters for particle segregation in the tst separator the two sludge system caused by the tst separator

17924,a continuous pilot scale a2o reactor with a two zone sedimentation tank a2o tst was constructed for the formation of aerobic granular sludge ags to treat real municipal sewage the characteristics of sludge nutrient removal performance and the corresponding microbial ecology dynamics were studied during granulation process experimental results indicated that ags with a mean particle size of 210 Î¼m and sludge volume index after 30 min of 47 5 ml g was successfully formed with effluent cod total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations in the reactor reaching 22 8 3 5 and 0 2 mg l respectively furthermore high throughput data indicated that granules in settling tank 1 st 1 harbored slow growing autotrophic organisms like nitrosomonas and nitrospira while the flocs in settling tank 2 st 2 were dominated by fast growing heterotrophic organisms including ca accumulibacter dechloromonas flavobacterium arcobacter and halomonas simulation results using computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method cfd dem modeling verified that the selection pressure created by the tst separator contributed to the retention of heavy granules 1 011 kg m3 density in st 1 zone and the withdrawal of light flocs 1 011 kg m3 density from st 2 zone therefore the segregation of biomass using the tst system provides an opportunity to select for desired microbial populations and to optimize the nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance of the a2o tst reactor this study could add a guiding sight into the application of two sludge system based on ags technology for upgrading traditional a2o process graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge a2o tst cfd dem modeling microbial differentiation nutrient removal real sewage 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags is a well established microbial immobilization method in biological wastewater treatment allowing the formation of sludge with higher biomass retention as well as improved settleability and resistance to shock loading or toxic compounds compared to conventional activated sludge pronk et al 2015b ags aggregates can be operated under switching redox conditions and are applicable on a large scale for wastewater treatment including carbon removal nitrogen and phosphorus elimination the layered structure of ags supports multiple biological processes liu et al 2020 with the oxygen mass transfer resistance inducing the growth of aerobic bacteria e g nitrifiers in the outer layer while facultative or anaerobic organisms e g polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos and denitrifying bacteria exist towards the interior of granules bao et al 2011 pronk et al 2015a bengtsson et al 2018 until recently some factors have been considered to be important in granulation such as alternating feast famine conditions selection pressure based on granule size or settling velocity and hydraulic shear stress kent et al 2018 to date ags have commonly been studied and engineered in sequential batch reactors sbrs which are considered to provide ideal feast famine conditions for the formation of aerobic granules liu and tay 2015 with an anaerobic feeding phase followed by aerobic treatment however in the operation of a municipal wastewater treatment plant there is a high need for cultivation of ags in continuous flow reactors cfrs which is the most commonly engineered process for nutrient removal across the world and provides several advantages with batch operation such as simple operation and control methods the capacity to tolerate heavy processing loads and the requirement for low installation investment juang et al 2010 corsino et al 2016a chen et al 2017 the existing knowledge acquired from aerobic granulation studies in sbrs provide sufficient knowledge for understanding of the formation mechanisms for aerobic granules in cfrs many attempts to cultivate ags in cfrs have been made based on the selection pressure created by the different size or settling time of granules for instance liu et al 2012 reported the use of a downstream sieve screen which allows small flocs size 0 1 mm to pass through while larger aggregates remain for the promotion of ags cultivation in a continuous membrane biological reactor li et al 2016 utilized an external settling tank with adjustable outlet locations to achieve selective segregation of biomass with different densities and settling times in a continuous phosphorous removal system nevertheless the application of ags in cfr remains difficult due to the different operational environments and ags cultivation conditions in cfrs compared to in sbrs thus hydrodynamic behaviors and granule selective approaches need further investigation to comprehensively understand the mechanisms of ags cultivation in cfrs the recent reported findings provide a reliable approach to promote the formation of ags in continuous aerobic reactor using a two zone sedimentation tank tst treating real low strength wastewater zou et al 2018b the tst system design ensures the effective settling of granules retained in the reactor while the poorly settled biomass is removed during sludge discharge however the aerobic granulation study in cfr using tst system has been performed in a single aerobic tank which possesses the oxidation of ammonium and organic matter but lack of the capacity for nitrogen and phosphorus removal zou et al 2018b considering the demand for n and p removal in practice and the fact that anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o process is most widely used in the full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps jin et al 2014 the feasibility for ags formation in a2o process using tst system is need further investigation furthermore the effect of aerobic granulation on the nutrient removal and microbial community structure of a2o reactor is as yet unclear in ags system different biological niches for functional groups can be generated within one reactor compartment because of segregation of differently sized microbial aggregates i e flocs small granule and large granule pronk et al 2015b previous research has shown that the biomass in ags reactor is not homogeneously distributed over the height of the settled sludge bed with large granules often more concentrate at the bottom and flocs remain at the top ali et al 2019 different microbial communities can occur as a function of different depths in the sludge bed due to the differences of habitat conditions at certain depths e g substrate concentrations environmental factors winkler et al 2011b selective sludge withdrawal from different locations of sludge bed can be used to control the microbial competition between paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos winkler et al 2011a or between nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria winkler et al 2011b in granular sludge reactor in traditional a2o process there is a well known contradiction that nitrifiers need higher sludge retention times srts than paos for maintaining nitrification activity if the ags system can be applied in the a2o process it remains unclear that the well known contradiction of srts between nitrifiers and paos can be resolved in this study the cultivation of ags through the selective pressure created by the presence of two sequential settling zones was investigated in a continuous a2o reactor with a tst separator treating municipal sewage the characteristics of sludge and nutrient removal performance e g carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in the reactor were monitored and the differences in bacterial community structure among the two settling zones were analyzed to reveal the different biological niches of bacteria present in the a2o tst reactor furthermore a mathematical modeling tool based on computational fluid dynamics cfd and discrete element method dem coupling model was applied to simulate the hydrodynamic transport of granules for understanding the granulation mechanisms in the tst system 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater and seed sludge the real sewage used in this study was collected from the primary sedimentation tank at gaobeidian wwtp in beijing china the main characteristics of the wastewater were as follows ph 7 2 0 2 total chemical oxygen demand tcod concentration of 294 1 75 5 mg l soluble cod scod of 244 5 46 1 mg l biochemical oxygen demand bod5 of 125 2 27 8 mg l ammonium nitrogen nh4 n concentration of 37 9 4 8 mg l total nitrogen tn concentration of 42 5 6 2 mg l total phosphorus tp concentration of 5 5 0 8 mg l total suspended solids tss concentration of 170 33 mg l the combined presence of acetate and propionate in the influent favors the metabolism of pao over gao lopez vazquez et al 2009 thus in order to acquire excellent effluent quality and rapid granulation external carbon source composed of sodium acetate naac and sodium propionate napr at a mass concentration ratio of 10 1 was added into the influent to compensate the shortfall in the readily biodegradable organic matter during operation seed sludge taken from the returned sludge groove at the gaobeidian wwtp presented a well settling capacity due to the higher inorganic content in the sludge the initial tss and volatile suspended solids vss concentration were 4000 100 and 2500 100 mg l respectively the sludge volume index after 30 min svi30 and mean particle size for seed sludge were 75 1 2 0 ml g and 42 Î¼m respectively 2 2 reactor setup and operation a pilot scale rectangular a2o tst reactor 83 cm 74 cm 60 cm with a working volume of 202 l was used in this study fig 1 and the real setup diagram of reactor is delineated in fig s1 the reactor was constructed of plexiglass and contained an anaerobic zone an anoxic zone and an aerobic zone with volumes of 30 l 45 l and 127 l respectively the sedimentation tank consisted of two identical settling zones denoted as st 1 and st 2 respectively equivalent to an advection sedimentation tank to provide the selection pressure for aerobic granulation in the cfr a moveable baffle above the st 1 zone was set to adjust the selection pressure sludge recirculation external recycling from the st 1 zone to the anaerobic zone and nitrite nitrate recirculation internal recycling from the aerobic zone to the anoxic zone were conducted using a diaphragm pump to avoid the disintegration of ags by conventional peristaltic pumps the sufficient mixing speed 100 rpm and high aeration driving force 80 l h provide the required shear stress for granulation in the reactor agitation was applied in the anaerobic and anoxic zones to maintain uniform mixtures air was supplied to the aerobic zone via sand bubble diffusers placed at the bottom of the reactor the operation of the a2o tst reactor was divided into three stages over 115 days as summarized in table 1 at the end of phase i the influent cod concentration was increased from 341 20 to 441 35 mg l by the addition of an external carbon source while the hydraulic retention time hrt in the reactor decreased from 13 5 to 10 1 h as the result the volumetric organic loading rate olr during the experimental period increased from 0 61 to 1 05 kg cod m3 d fig s2 from day 71 onwards the moveable baffle in the st 1 zone was removed to intensify the selection pressure for further promoting aerobic granulation in the reactor at the end of each operational stage sludge samples were withdrawn from the aerobic zone to investigate the variation in particle size and content of extracellular polymeric substances eps in granular sludge besides on day 115 all the sludge present in the st 1 and st 2 zones were discharged from the bottom of settling zone and then respectively mixed as the representative sludge samples for analysis of sludge properties e g particle size and eps content and nucleotide extraction during the whole experimental period the dissolved oxygen do content in the aeration zone was manually controlled to 3 4 mg l and the temperature ranged from 20 to 30 c with seasonal temperature changes the srt which was calculated on the basis of the equation in the section 1 of the supplementary material has varied in a broad range between 5 and 60 days the external recycling ratio and internal recycling ratio were set at 100 and 200 respectively 2 3 sample collection and analytical procedures during the experimental period liquid samples in the feed reactor and effluent were filtered periodically using 0 45 Î¼m filters minisart sartorius stedim biotech germany and analyzed to monitor the reactor performance svi5 and svi30 was measured twice or thrice per week using a sludge sample 0 2 l taken from the aerobic zone concentrations of tcod scod bod5 nh4 n tn tp svi tss and vss were analyzed according to the standard methods apha 2005 nitrite nitrogen no2 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n were measured by ion chromatography ics 1100 thermo fisher scientific usa sludge morphology was visualized with a magnification of 40 using an optical microscope cx31 olympus japan sludge samples taken from the aerobic zone 40 d 70 d and 115 d and settling zones 115 d were applied to conduct particle size measurement using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer bettersize 3000plus better china each measurement was repeated for 3 times and the average value was presented in figures temperature ph and do were monitored using a wtw multi 340i meter wtw company germany the eps content of sludge samples from aerobic zone 0 d 40 d 70 d and 115 d and settling zones 115 d was extracted via a heating method zou et al 2015 the sludge suspension was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min in a volume of 40 ml tube and washed three times with deionized water after removed the supernatant the sludge samples were then resuspended into 15 ml of 0 05 nacl solution subsequently the sludge mixture was placed in a water bath at 80 c for 30 min followed by centrifuging 8000 rpm for 15 min finally the supernatant filtered through a 0 22 Î¼m cellulose membrane minisart sartorius stedim biotech germany was collected to analyze the eps content the protein pn content of eps was measured via the bicinchoninic acid method with bovine albumin serum used as a standard smith et al 1985 the polysaccharide ps content of eps was measured via the anthrone method using glucose as a standard wu et al 2010 2 4 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing data analysis three sludge samples acquired from seed sludge sludge in st 1 and st 2 zones sampled on 115 d were freeze dried for nucleotide extraction the dna was extracted from 0 1 g of each freeze dried sludge samples using fast dna spin kits for soil mp biomedicals usa according to manufacturer s instructions liu et al 2017b the extracted dna samples were sent to allwegene medical technology co ltd beijing china for high throughput sequencing using the illumina miseqpe300 platform illumina usa the v3 v4 regions of bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified using the 338f actcctacgggaggcagca and 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat primers allowing the original sequence data to be generated following this the low quality sequences and chimeras were removed to obtain the effective sequences and the sequences of all samples were homogenized to ensure that they were analyzed and compared at the same sequencing depth sequence analysis was carried out using qiime software and the operational classification units otu with a similarity of 97 were separated using the usearch algorithm the alpha diversity including rarefaction curves shannon diversity index species richness estimator of chao1 and diversity coverage were calculated in mothur for each sample the silva database was used to annotate the specific otu species and the diversity and community composition of taxonomic information was analyzed the raw sequence data was uploaded to the genbank database under accession number srr10814980 srr10814981 and srr10814982 2 5 cfd dem simulation methods and conditions in this study a cfd dem modeling was applied to simulate the sludge settling and separating performance in the tst separator the flowing fluid and moving particles in the tst were regarded as the continuous phase and discrete phase as described by the local averaged navier stokes equations and newton s second law respectively the eulerian method was used to describe the interface between water and particles and the k epsilon model was applied as the turbulence model el emam et al 2019 the governing equations for fluid and solid phase are given in section 2 of the supplementary material the fluid was segmented into multiple cells before calculation within each iteration step cfd was used to model the fluid flow in cells while dem was applied to calculate the interactive force of each particle and their location in cells using the physical parameters e g velocity and pressure produced by cfd for the realization of the cfd dem simulations the mesh and boundary conditions used in this study are shown in fig s3 taking into account the accuracy of result and the computation time the tst fluid zone was divided into 373218 tetrahedral cells the fluid phase was regarded as incompressible water at 20 c for the boundary the inlet velocity and the reflux ratio were set at 5 10 2 m s and 100 respectively the characteristics of particles are outlined in table 2 for the discrete phase ags and flocs entered the tst from the position of the water inlet compared with flocs ags has a more regular shape with a more compact structure and higher density therefore for a simple distinction the shape of ags was assumed to be a sphere while flocs were described as being composed of an irregular geometry consisting of four spheres fig s4 after calculations were finished the performance of the tst separator was evaluated by the distribution proportions of particles with different densities and sizes between st 1 and st 2 zones to verify the reliability of cfd dem modeling the experimental data in regard with the percentages of settled ags with diverse mean particle size 100 200 300 400 Î¼m in st 1 and st 2 zones was applied the screening strategy of ags with specified diameter test method and assessment criteria are described in section 3 of the supplementary material 3 results 3 1 formation of ags in the a2o tst reactor aerobic granulation in the cfr was successfully achieved based on the setup of a two zone sedimentation region at the terminal of the a2o tst reactor fig 2 unlike with traditional a2o reactor the existing sludge in sedimentation tank is divided into two parts the sludge in st 1 zone as recycling sludge is continuously returned to the anaerobic zone and the sludge in st 2 zone as excess sludge is periodically washed out from the reactor fig 2d from day 1 to day 20 of operational phase i the tss concentration sharply decreased from 3980 to 1637 mg l indicating that almost 75 of the original sludge was excluded due to the settling based selection pressure then the tss concentration gradually improved and stabilized at 2303 136 mg l by the end of phase i fig 2a while the average particle size of sludge increased from 42 to 114 Î¼m fig 2b and the svi30 decreased from 73 4 to 49 0 ml g during phase i fig 2a during phase ii the influent volumetric olr was enhanced to increase the granule diameter and sludge concentration as a result the tss concentration increased from 2282 to 3448 mg l while the ags mean particle size was further enlarged to 154 Î¼m by day 70 and the svi5 svi30 ratio remained stable at about 1 imaging showed that a larger uneven and irregular structure of granules was formed in the cfr in comparison with the sludge aggregates observed in phase i fig s5 furthermore the concentrations of ps and pn in sludge eps were gradually increased from 34 4 3 4 and 54 1 8 4 mg g vss on day 1 68 4 2 9 and 137 7 13 2 mg g vss on day 70 respectively fig 2c in phase iii the selection pressure in the reactor reached a maximum when the moveable baffle was removed from above the st 1 zone following this a considerable loss of biomass was observed in the initial stage of phase iii but biomass recovered to 3490 mg l after one week of adaption fig 2a finally tss concentration and svi30 stabilized respectively at 3540 58 mg l and 47 5 1 0 ml g and ps and pn concentrations have a slight decrease to 62 7 4 6 and 126 2 10 0 mg g vss on day 115 respectively moreover the appearance of ags shifted from a loose irregular structure to a dense round structure with the size of granules 200 500 Î¼m in the reactor becoming more homogeneous fig s5 at the end of phase iii the distribution of particle size showed that ags with a larger particle size was settled in the st 1 zone than in the st 2 zone with the overall mean ags particle size in the reactor increasing to 210 Î¼m fig 2b 3 2 performance of nutrient removal in the reactor the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance of the a2o tst reactor are shown in fig 3 the cod removal efficiency generally remained higher than 90 during the whole operational process independent of the sludge characteristics and influent volumetric olrs in the reactor fig 3c for n removal the removal capacity had a positive relationship with the degree of sludge granulation in the reactor the average tn removal efficiency was 82 3 3 7 in phase i increasing stepwise to 86 8 3 9 in phase ii and to 91 4 3 4 in phase iii accompanied by the formation of ags in the reactor fig 3a a similar trend of variation were observed for phosphorus removal in both periods with the average tp removal efficiency increasing from 88 0 2 3 to 95 8 1 2 fig 3b after stabilizing an excellent nutrient removal performance was achieved with effluent cod tn and tp concentrations of 22 8 5 9 3 5 1 2 and 0 2 0 1 mg l respectively in contrast the effluent nutrient concentrations in the reactor were superior to that in the full scale ags sbr process for the treatment of domestic wastewater pronk et al 2015b which might be related to the lesser effluent suspended solids due to the settling of flocs in st 2 zone to elucidate the nutrient removal mechanism in the a2o tst reactor a typical variation of cod tn tp and no x no2 no3 concentrations alongside the reactor on day 115 are shown in fig 3d and the mass balances calculations for n and p are summarized in table s1 it is found that in the anoxic tank the tn and tp concentration were both rapidly decreased indicating that denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms dpaos might present at the system base on the p mass balance the proportion of p removal functioned by dpaos accounted for 12 7 furthermore the majority of p removal 86 6 was conducted by paos in the aerobic zone table s1 for n removal the tn concentration gradually reduced from 50 3 to 5 8 mg n l alongside the reactor in the aerobic zone ammonium is almost converted entirely to nitrate while a portion of n is simultaneously denitrified indicating that the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd might occur due to the layered structure of granular sludge liu et al 2020 in the anaerobic zone readily biodegradable organic matters are stored as intracellular polymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates phas data not shown acting as electron donor for endogenous denitrification that occur in the inner of granules under aerobic condition the addition of external carbon source e g naac and napr in the influent promoted the function of snd resulting in that the contribution of snd to n removal was about 17 9 on basis of the n mass balance table s1 the synergistic effects of snd in the aerobic zone and denitrifying phosphorus removal dnpr in the anoxic zone optimized the n and p removal capacity in the continuous granule reactor 3 3 microbial community structure analysis high throughput sequencing based on bacterial 16s rrna genes was applied to analyze the microbial community structure in samples of seed sludge along with sludge from st 1 and st 2 the coverage values for each sample were above 98 suggesting that the sequencing depths were sufficient to cover the whole community table s2 the species richness as evaluated by the chao1 index was 1282 for seed sludge 786 for st 1 and 708 for st 2 indicating that the microbial diversity of sludge gradually decreased throughout the cfr granulation process the shannon diversity index is generally used to evaluate the abundance and evenness of microbial species of the sludge samples du et al 2019 the shannon index value of seed sludge 8 42 was higher than that of both st 1 7 92 and st 2 6 58 implying that the abundance and evenness of species in seed sludge also declined after granulation the phylogenetic classifications of microbial communities in all three samples are summarized at the phylum fig 4 and genus levels fig 5 the two most abundant phyla in seed sludge st 1 and st 2 were proteobacteria 44 66 50 79 and 60 58 respectively and bacteroidetes 20 63 20 48 and 33 51 respectively proteobacteria and bacteroidetes play an important role in the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycles and have been reported to be the most common phylum in activated sludge processes liu et al 2017a other main phyla observed in the seed sludge were chloroflexi 12 16 acidobacteria 4 70 and actinobacteria 3 18 in contrast the other dominant phyla in sludge from st 1 and st 2 were firmicutes 6 63 and 2 24 respectively nitrospirae 4 70 and 0 27 respectively and chloroflexi 4 18 and 0 69 respectively fig 4 the microbial community of seed sludge changed significantly after ags formation while the dominant taxa in sludge sample in the two settling zones st 1 and st 2 also exhibited larger differences at the genus level the main genera groups identified in the st 1 zone were nitrospira 4 70 om27 clade 4 13 thauera 3 0 and dokdonella 2 68 while in the st 2 zone flavobacterium 8 56 arcobacter 7 69 dechloromoas 7 47 halomonas 3 51 and ca accumulibacter 2 71 were identified fig 5 in general nitrosomonas and nitrospira are genera representing typical ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nob respectively compared to seed sludge in st 1 the relative abundance of aob decreased from 2 80 to 1 12 while the relative abundance of nob increased from 1 58 to 4 70 in contrast nitrifying bacteria almost completely disappeared from the community in st 2 0 28 of aob and 0 27 of nob furthermore the most abundant genera observed in the sludge of st 2 were related to microorganisms performing the phosphorus and organic matter removal process ca accumulibacter belonging to the well known paos acevedo et al 2012 was dominant in the continuously discharged sludge of st 2 with a relative abundance of 2 71 but was less abundant in the sludge of st 1 at only 0 06 dechloromonas function as important bacterium for dnpr stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 and exhibited a higher abundance in st 2 at 7 47 than in st 1 at 0 25 or seed sludge at 0 59 similarly ca competibacter and defluviicoccus categorized as gaos also exhibited a higher abundance in the sludge of st 2 than either st 1 or seed sludge in addition ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos including flavobacterium arcobacter and halomonas which function as organic removal bacteria also dominated in the sludge of st 2 with the proliferation of these heterotrophic organisms after inoculation potentially being due to the use of an external carbon source in the experiment collado et al 2010 li et al 2014 pronk et al 2014 3 4 simulating the granules selection mechanism of the tst using cfd dem modeling for evaluation of the sludge separating performance of the tst separator the distribution of settled particles with different densities and sizes in the st 1 and st 2 zones were obtained from cfd dem simulation and experimental data fig 6 the experimental results are utilized to validate the accuracy of cfd dem model established in this study indicating that the simulation curve possesses rather high prediction precision and can represents the separation characteristic of ags with different particle sizes in the tst separator fig 6b the simulated results showed that heavier or larger particles density 1 011 kg m3 or particle size 350 Î¼m were all settled in the st 1 zone while lighter and smaller particles density 1 011 kg m3 or particle size 350 Î¼m were random distributed across the two settling zones for lighter or smaller flocs the proportion of settled particles in the st 2 zone gradually increases with the reduction of the density and size of particles the turbulent intensity reflected by turbulent kinetic energy showed that turbulent region merely occurred in the connected hole reflux and water outlet of the tst separator and the vast majority of regions in the fluid zone exhibited stable laminar flow which provides a well stratified environment for particle separation fig s6 the settling velocity and motional trajectory of flocs and granular sludge were traced by simulating the flow of particles in the fluid zone fig 7 a three dimensional simulation of the flow of particles showed that the horizontal and longitudinal velocities of particles play an important role in driving the particles to move from the inlet to the outlet furthermore it can be seen that two significant areas of downward longitudinal velocity favored the layering and settling of particles in the st 1 zone fig 7b the compounding forces from gravity buoyancy and interactional collision forces of particle particle or particle wall cause the particles to vertically rise or sink in the tst separator ma et al 2019 thus the presence of the baffle changed the direction of flow and accelerated the settling of particles promoting the retention of ags with a higher density 1 020 kg m3 which could settle rapidly in the st 1 zone fig 7d however the trajectory of flocs with a lower density 1 003 kg m3 varied when entering into the tst separator from a different entrance the flocs entering from an upper position could bypass the reflux controlled area and enter the st 2 zone with the fluid flow while the flocs entering from a lower position would be caught by the reflux controlled area and returned from the st 1 zone to the front of the anaerobic zone fig 7e and 7f 4 discussion 4 1 successful granulation can be achieved in the a2o tst reactor several pilot and full scale ags plants performed in sbrs are currently in operation worldwide but few information are available regarding the successful granulation in continuous flow our study aimed at cultivating of ags in continuous a2o reactor combined with a two zone sedimentation tank during the treatment of municipal sewage the design of tst system was successful in cultivating ags in cfr with a larger particle size 210 Î¼m and good settling property low svi30 of 47 5 ml g both the long term operational data fig 2b and simulation results fig 6 all showed that the selection pressure created by tst separator contributed to the separation of heavy granules and light flocs the less dense and lighter biomass was washed out from the st 2 zone while the denser and heavier biomass settled in the st 1 zone and was recycled to the reactor which is consistent with previous study findings zou et al 2018b xu et al 2020 different from the external nucleating agent addition e g micropowder natural drying sludge it should however be noticed that the well settling seed sludge svi30 of 75 1 ml g in this study provided a good initial separating condition for tst system promoting the rapid sludge granulation in the continuous system sludge size is closely correlated with settling velocity and the eps synthesis which is very important for the granulation and settling ability of sludge corsino et al 2016b zhang et al 2016b during the granulation process eps synthesis by the aggregated microorganisms was observed because of the remarkable increase of eps content in the sludge sample after exposed to the elevated influent olr fig 2c this confirmed the previous findings that high volumetric olr can induce eps secretion to promote the growth of ags with large particle sizes liu and tay 2015 in addition the selective pressure of tst system promotes the retention of granules with higher ps and pn concentrations 74 4 3 1 and 144 9 4 6 mg g vss respectively in the st 1 zone and the withdrawal of flocs with lower ps and pn concentrations 53 9 6 7 and 101 8 4 5 mg g vss respectively from the st 2 zone fig 2c more eps synthesis facilitates the adhesion of cell cell or cell particulates into a microbial aggregate in which the particulates e g chemical precipitation influent particulate materials act as nuclei for cell attachment sarma et al 2017 furthermore the composition of eps e g ps and pn also varied significantly and the raised pn ps ratio from 1 57 on day 1 2 01 on day 115 verified that granular sludge possesses higher pn content in eps than flocculent sludge which can improve the hydrophobicity and stability of ags aggregates zou et al 2018b different settling velocity between granules and flocs provides a strong selective pressure for selection of granules as dominant form of biomass in the ags system zhang et al 2016b in this study the sludge settling velocity consisted of horizontal longitudinal and vertical velocities in three dimensional reference system fig 7 would be equal to the flow rate divided by the cross sectional area the simulation results showed that granules with higher density 1 020 kg m3 in certain regions around the baffle reflux outlet of st 1 zone could reach to the high downward longitudinal velocity 72 144 m h fig 7d within the range of the typical granule settling velocity 12 145 m h in ags sbr system winkler et al 2012 it could however be observed that the settling velocity of flocs with lower density 1 003 kg m3 entering from an upper position was merely in the range between 0 and 14 4 m h along the downward longitudinal direction fig 7e this leads to that granules with higher settling velocity could be retained in the st 1 zone while flocs are washed out with the fluid flow to the st 2 zone therefore the successive two zone sedimentation tank layout provides a good opportunity for the separation of ags and flocs resulting in the effective formation of aerobic granulation in the cfr 4 2 microbial differentiation achieved by the selective sludge discharge in tst system since the selective sludge discharge is accomplished from the st 2 zone in the a2o tst reactor it is evident that st 1 granules have a longer sludge age than the averaged srt 20 11 d while the sludge age of flocs in st 2 zone is very low different srts of granules and flocs in the two settling zones resulted in the microbial differentiation in the same reactor compartment the granules of st 1 zone were enriched with slow growing autotrophic organisms like aobs and nobs while flocs of st 2 zone were dominated by fast growing heterotrophic organisms including paos gaos and ohos fig 5 previous study has reported that both nitrosomonas and nitrospira are categorized as chemoautotrophic bacteria which require long srts to be enriched munz et al 2011 therefore the longer sludge age of granular sludge in the st 1 zone provides an opportunity for the growth of nitrifying bacteria furthermore thauera dokdonella and zoogloea were the dominant denitrifying bacteria in the reactor with the function of exopolysaccharide secretion promoting granulation shinoda et al 2004 pishgar et al 2019 the higher abundance of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in the granular sludge of st 1 promoted the snd performance during the aerobic phase which is closely related to the n removal capacity of the reactor phosphate removing bacteria e g ca accumulibacter and dechloromonas in the reactor were mainly centralized in flocs of the st 2 zone and regular sludge discharge from this region was conducive to p removal excess p was absorbed by either paos in the aeration zone or dpaos in the anoxic zone then being discharged from the st 2 zone avoiding secondary p release due to the long srt in the settling tank therefore timely discharge of p enriched sludge from the st 2 zone ensured the p removal performance of the reactor and thus a higher abundance of paos than gaos were identified fig 5 however this result contradicts the conventional understanding that paos are more easily enriched in granular sludge due to the intracellular polymers like polyphosphate phas and glycogen stored inside the paos cytoplasm winkler et al 2011a li et al 2016 the short srt of sludge in the st 2 zone contributes to the paos metabolism which might be the reason for this abnormal phenomenon some genera capable of organic carbon removal e g flavobacterium arcobacter and halomonas were also observed in st 2 sludge supporting that carbon sources removal was more likely to be performed by flocs than granules lashkarizadeh et al 2015 zou et al 2018a these results suggest that the segregation of diverse size and density granules through additional selective pressure resulted in microbial differentiation while different srts resulted in a two sludge system which could optimize the nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance of the a2o tst reactor 4 3 significance for upgrading a2o process with a two zone sedimentation tank the unique design of two zone sedimentation tank plays an important role in achieving aerobic granulation and biomass segregation in continuous a2o reactor selective sludge removal at different settling zones can be applied to construct a two sludge system for desired microbial populations in the a2o tst process fig 2d in traditional a2o processes the functional bacteria related to nitrogen and phosphorus removal coexist in one mixed sludge system leading to the contradiction of srts between nitrifiers and paos the different biological niches of bacteria induced by the tst system could help to unravel the intrinsic contradiction of srts involved in nitrogen and phosphorus removal in traditional a2o process similarly previous findings have reported that a two sludge system integrating an a2o reactor and biological contact oxidation bco has been developed to achieve biological niche separation resulting in paos was dominant bacteria in the a2o reactor while nitrifiers enriched in the bco reactor zhang et al 2016a however the utilization of biofilm carriers in bco reactors increases operational and capital costs in contrast ags involves the self immobilization of microorganisms which could avoid the need for large economic inputs for upgrading the traditional a2o process furthermore the modification of secondary sedimentation tank by tst system in existing a2o facilities is a simple and cost effective method to promote ags formation and to optimize the n and p removal capacity in the cfrs 5 conclusion in this study a continuous pilot scale a2o reactor equipped with a tst system was developed to investigate the formation of ags in cfrs the tst separator provided selection pressure to achieve effective settling and retention of ags and wash out of the poor settling flocs resulting in the svi30 eventually reaching 47 5 ml g a satisfactory nutrient removal capacity was also achieved in the reactor with effluent cod tn and tp concentrations of 22 8 3 5 and 0 2 mg l respectively bacterial community analysis showed that the dominant bacteria in st 1 were capable of nitrification and denitrification while the dominant bacteria in st 2 were capable of phosphorus and organics removal furthermore cfd dem modeling indicated that density and size were the critical parameters for particle segregation in the tst separator the two sludge system caused by the tst separator promotes the selection of desired microbial populations optimizing the n and p removal performance in a continuous a2o reactor declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
