granular matrix sensors at shallow and deep depths to compare infiltration of irrigation and rain in subsoiled and non subsoiled plots the second objective was to find any significant differences in maize yield between subsoiling irrigation treatments and to identify the relationship between subsoiling irrigation and yield performance the third objective was to perform a partial budget analysis to determine which treatment combination produced the highest profit under two maize price scenarios 2 methods 2 1 field experiment this study analyzed data from 2000 to 2004 for maize grown on a

low frequency irrigation li and high frequency irrigation hi 2 2 soil water an electrical resistance block sensor that indirectly measures soil water tension was used to schedule irrigation and monitor soil water status the watermark 200ss irrometer riverside ca usa five replicates each of only the ns hi and es li treatments contained a set of four watermark sensors that were installed in the crop row at soil depths of 0 15 0 30 0 46 and 0 61 m the tension readings were retrieved using a handheld meter every two to five days for the li irrigation level irrigation was triggered when the es li average tension across all four sensor depths reached 50 70 kpa after the soil had been rewetted to field capacity because of heavy rainfall typically 60 mm irrigation was triggered for the hi irrigation level when the ns hi average tension across the top two sensor depths reached 50 70 kpa after the soil had been rewetted to field capacity because of heavy rainfall in the absence of heavy rainfall irrigation was generally triggered once a week for both li and hi levels until approximately seven days before physiological maturity a k a black layer for each irrigation event water was applied for two additional hours at a lower flow rate once it advanced to the end of the furrow from 2000 2001 every interior furrow was irrigated from 2002 2004 every other interior furrow all non trafficked was irrigated to avoid water advancing too quickly in trafficked furrows consequently more irrigation events occurred with a smaller volume of water per event during the latter three years table 1 in 2003 season long malfunctioning of the flow meter prevented measurement of irrigation water amounts so a 49 mm depth per irrigation application was assumed based on 2002 and 2004 averages the effect of subsoiling on infiltration can be inferred by comparing soil water tension changes in the ns hi and es li treatments over a time interval when the two treatments received the same amount and timing of rain and gross irrigation the treatment with more infiltration would experience a larger decrease in tension paired t tests were performed using sas 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc usa to summarize such comparisons of tension changes throughout all five years of the experiment in total there were 68 block time intervals i e pairs of consecutive watermark measurement dates when both treatments were irrigated identically and received no rain whereas there were 79 block time intervals when both treatments received rain but no irrigation the two groups of time intervals were analyzed separately to assess the effect of subsoiling on infiltration of irrigation and of rain respectively for each group of time intervals one paired t test compared tension changes across the entire profile average of 0 15 0 30 0 46 and 0 61 m sensor readings while another paired t test compared tension changes in the subsoil only average of 0 46 and 0 61 m sensor readings 2 3 yield two or three center rows in each plot were mechanically harvested using a small commercial combine a weigh wagon was used to measure the grain weight for each plot the yield of each plot was adjusted to a standard moisture content of 155 g kg 1 based on the measured moisture content of subsamples the sas mixed linear model procedure proc mixed using the kenward roger method of approximating denominator degrees of freedom was performed to analyze maize yield the fixed effects were subsoiling level irrigation level year and their two way and three way interactions the random effects include year block and residual error the slice statement was used to apply fisher s least significant difference test to treatment yields within the same year 2 4 profitability partial budget analysis was performed for each of the treatment combinations on a unit area basis the specified costs of each treatment in each year were calculated based on the mississippi state budget generator laughlin and spurlock 2006 whose assumptions are summarized below the li and hi levels incurred fixed costs for irrigation equipment well pump engine pipeline etc which was 109 86 ha 1 y 1 the cost for subsoiling every year was 28 ha 1 y 1 while it was 14 ha 1 y 1 for subsoiling every other year whether before cotton or maize the variable costs for irrigation fuel labor were 0 203 ha 1 mm 1 two maize price scenarios 118 11 mg 1 and 236 22 mg 1 were used 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water soil water tension differences between the ns hi and the es li treatments were evident in fig 1 the most noticeable difference was how the es li treatment had generally lower soil water tension i e contained more moisture in the crop root zone despite less irrigation than the ns hi treatment the black line for es li tended to be below the blue line for ns hi fig 1 especially as rainfall dwindled in the reproductive period the tension difference between ns hi and es li continued to increase for example in 2001 between june 6 and june 27 ns hi experienced a net increase of 69 kpa without any observed decreases while es li experienced a net increase of 31 kpa with four instances of decreases assuming similar rates of crop evapotranspiration these observations would suggest preliminarily that subsoiling increases soil water availability by improving infiltration the infiltration benefit of subsoiling is supported by statistical analyses the irrigation response results showed a 95 confidence interval from 7 to 15 kpa for the mean difference ns hi minus es li in profile tension changes ns hi was less responsive than es li to irrigation by an average of 11 kpa with a two tail p value of 0 0001 against the null hypothesis of no difference the subsoil results revealed a 95 confidence interval from 1 to 9 kpa the subsoil tension increases in ns hi were 5 kpa larger on average than those in es li with a two tail p value of 0 016 thus the results from both paired t tests suggest that subsoiling improves infiltration of irrigation water interestingly subsoiling enhanced soil water gains at the 0 15 and 0 30 m depths more than at the 0 46 and 0 61 m in contrast there was no significant positive effect on rainfall infiltration from subsoiling the mean difference ns hi minus es li in profile tension changes after a rainfall showed a 95 confidence interval of 11 0 kpa the profile tension increases in ns hi were 6 kpa smaller on average than those in es li with a two tailed p value of 0 0417 at the subsoil depths the 95 confidence interval was from 3 7 kpa the subsoil tension increases in ns hi were 2 kpa smaller on average than those in es li with a two tailed p value of 0 5061 in this experiment subsoiling did not improve infiltration from rainfall particularly the larger rainfall events in each season reduced the high ns hi shallow tension readings to within proximity of the es li shallow tension readings how irrigation water infiltrates into the furrow in a subsoiled field is important in row subsoiling can improve infiltration during a furrow irrigation event in a different manner as opposed to other subsoiler implements as described by tupper 1995 and sojka et al 1992 in row subsoiling is designed for minimal soil disturbance in the furrow and for promotion of preferential flow or piping of the water along the diagonally fractured path from the furrow to below the center of the bed fig 2 bryant et al 2020 found that in row subsoiling significantly improved irrigation application efficiency and irrigation water use efficiency for furrow irrigated soybean in the mississippi delta on the other hand in row subsoiling failed to increase the infiltration of large rainfall amounts in the present experiment two phenomena may have contributed to this finding first in a full maize canopy stemflow funnels and concentrates rainwater onto the soil surface along the crop row dolan et al 2001 where the soil moisture sensors were placed and where in row subsoiling never disturbed these factors may have enabled the ns hi sensors to exhibit strong wetting responses to rainfall reducing the tension difference between the two treatments after larger rainfall events second the ns hi treatment generally had higher tension throughout the maize growing season compared to the es li treatment therefore ns hi may have had stronger capillary forces due to drier soil conditions resulting in higher infiltration rates radcliffe and simunek 2010 compared to es li for both rain infiltration and irrigation infiltration in this study subsoiling effects appeared to be larger at the depths disturbed by subsoiling than at the depths further below subsoiling fractures the soil between 0 and 0 4 m and thus changes the soil properties in this layer odey and manuwa 2018 one of the major soil properties that is expected to be altered is macroporosity which would increase saturated hydraulic conductivity and stored soil water at these shallow depths drewry and paton 2000 past subsoiling studies in the southeast u s and beyond found similar results sene et al 1985 concluded that the largest increases in maize yield from subsoiling were attributed to significantly increasing saturated hydraulic conductivity and decreasing bulk density in the a horizon rather than in the e and b horizons popp et al 2001 indicated that subsoiling effects on volumetric water content vwc in rainfed fields varied by soil type and soil depth at 0 0 15 m subsoiling significantly increased vwc in both heavy clay and silt loam at the 0 15 0 30 m subsoiling caused minimal vwc difference in both soil types at 0 30 0 60 m subsoiling led to no vwc differences in the heavy clay but a 0 079 m3 m 3 higher vwc in silt loam on two different soil types in new zealand the more persistent increases in macroporosity and air permeability were found at a soil depth range of 0 18 0 24 m and at 0 06 m and beyond in their respective studies drewry and paton 2000 drewry et al 2000 these findings suggest an increase in pore sizes for the soil depth disturbed from mechanical intervention that allows more infiltration deeper soil depths beyond the total subsoiling depth did not significantly change in macroporosity in conclusion subsoiling seems to improve the soil water availability at fractured depths as opposed to beyond the reach of the subsoiler shanks 3 2 maize yield analysis of variance for maize yield found that the subsoiling irrigation year interaction was statistically significant table 2 mean maize yields for each of the twelve treatments from 2000 to 2004 are given in table 3 instead of one factor with four levels ns cs ms es subsoiling frequency could be expressed alternatively as the interaction between two factors with two levels each the first factor would be whether or not subsoiling occurred before maize one off season ago and the second factor would be whether or not subsoiling occurred before cotton two off seasons ago with this alternate model the type iii p value was 0 02 for the second factor and was greater than 0 05 for all interaction terms involving the second factor meanwhile the type iii p values for the first factor irrigation year and all their two way and three way interactions were less than 0 0001 the relatively large p values associated with the second factor indicate that fall in row subsoiling two off seasons ago did not appear to affect maize yield results by raper et al 2005 suggested that subsoiling must be performed annually and not biennially or triennially to reduce bulk densities likewise clark et al 1993 concluded that paratill should be as frequent as every year rather than alternate years for increasing infiltration rates given these considerations the second factor was excluded from the statistical model to simplify the interpretation of yield results which led to pooling of ns with cs and of ms with es for fig 3 based on fig 3 the first finding is that subsoiling significantly improved non irrigated maize yield for all five years as a form of non inversion tillage subsoiling in the non irrigated crop row allows for increased infiltration of precipitation and reduced runoff cassel and edwards 1985 conducted a multi year subsoiling irrigation study in the southeast united states that reported significant maize yield differences in three consecutive years between the non irrigated conventional tillage treatment and the non irrigated in row subsoiling treatment on an average dry year for non irrigated land in row subsoiling had a 119 higher maize yield than conventional tillage box and langdale 1984 found in two consecutive years under non irrigated conditions two separate in row subsoiling treatments both delivered significantly higher maize yields compared to a disk harrow only and fluted coulter only treatments the average yield differences seen were 13 and 9 respectively according to fig 3 subsoiling without irrigation improved the average maize yield by 21 compared to ns ni and cs ni the previously mentioned studies were all conducted on a similar coastal loam soil as soil type can influence the maize yield response for a non irrigated maize field an alternative to developing irrigation is to practice in row subsoiling to improve maize yield because more soil water will be available in the root zone for short term droughts subsoiling does not remove the need to irrigate but may require less frequent irrigation applications this second finding was evident because li was sufficient to maximize maize yield when in row subsoiling was performed for four out of the five years ibrahim and miller 1989 discovered no significant differences in maize yield between weekly and biweekly irrigation in a deep tilled loam soil furthermore fig 3 shows that a combination of low frequency irrigation and subsoiling produced a significantly higher maize yield than subsoiling alone cassel and edwards 1985 observed similarly that subsoiling irrigation produced 24 higher mean yield than subsoiling alone box and langdale 1984 found that two separate in row subsoiling irrigation treatments yielded 46 higher than the non irrigated in row subsoiling treatments in conclusion in row subsoiling in the southeast u s complements rather than eliminates the need for irrigation of maize reducing the number of necessary irrigation applications by increasing irrigation infiltration the third finding is that for three out of the five years 2000 2001 and 2003 the high frequency irrigation level was the most favorable for achieving profitable maize yields when subsoiling was not practiced irrigation frequency is critical during periods of low rainfall and high evapotranspiration demands according to table 1 cumulative rainfall for the 80 day period before maize maturity was less than 300 mm for 2000 2003 fig 1 visually details the minimal rainfall that triggered a larger number of irrigations in the reproductive period for these dry years although 2002 was dry the li and hi irrigation levels received almost identical irrigation amounts and timing starting from 19 days before tasseling which was earlier than any other year and would have minimized the yield benefit of the hi level rainfall during 2004 is characterized as above average with only three hi applications and two li applications amidst abundant rainfall the literature presents similar results regarding the impacts of irrigation on maize without the practice of subsoiling in a maize irrigation study in the mississippi delta bruns et al 2003 found that one of the key yield components kernel count can be especially affected by irrigation two of the three years in the study found that irrigation significantly increased kernel count by 20 and 14 in 1999 and 2001 respectively compared to rainfed cassel and edwards 1985 found a mean maize yield difference of 136 between irrigated and non irrigated conventional tillage treatments these past findings concur with the present study that for a non subsoiled field more frequent irrigation to compensate for the lack of rainfall tends to increase maize yields above no or minimal irrigation 3 3 profitability subsoiling in the offseason prior to a maize crop the following spring promoted high profitability in maize production the ms level achieved the highest average profit across five years for all irrigation levels with low associated risk i e interannual standard deviation compared to cs and ns the cs level achieved the lowest average profit across five years for all irrigation levels with high associated risk tables 4 and 5 these two economic observations are applicable to both maize price scenarios because a profit advantage was observed regardless of the maize price scenario or irrigation frequency low till parabolic subsoiling in the previous offseason before a maize crop may be a generally profitable practice in similar regions of the world in contrast the profit benefit of irrigation was dependent on maize price and subsoiling level for ns and cs the profit increased with increasing irrigation frequency and this increase was larger at the higher maize price at a low maize price the average profit for ms and es does not increase substantially as the irrigation frequency increases table 4 on the other hand the average profit for ms and es at a high maize price has a notable increase in profit from no irrigation to low frequency irrigation table 5 at both maize prices both low and high irrigation frequency reduced profit risk compared to no irrigation in conclusion maize grain price and irrigation frequency can impact maize profitability depending on if and when subsoiling is practiced 4 conclusion the analysis of the watermark sensor data suggests that subsoiling improves infiltration of irrigation water specifically in contrast subsoiling did not significantly increase infiltration of rainfall on the other hand the selected year for fall subsoiling in a maize cotton rotation system does have implications the ms level produces a high average maize yield as well as a high average profit compared to the cs es and ns levels low frequency irrigation is sufficient to produce profitable yields if the ms treatment is performed on an irrigated field this finding is encouraging for groundwater conservation considering the ms li treatment reduces the irrigation requirement of maize on soils prone to compaction if subsoiling is not used irrigation has substantial value in achieving profitable yields as cotton production acreage has decreased in the last several decades with a shift toward maize and soybean rotations lo and pringle 2021 future research could further quantify water infiltration depth in a subsoiled field across several soil types under a maize soybean rotation the incorporation of soil moisture monitoring technologies in deep tillage studies can reveal the extent of water infiltration throughout soil

whose assumptions are summarized below the li and hi levels incurred fixed costs for irrigation equipment well pump engine pipeline etc which was 109 86 ha 1 y 1 the cost for subsoiling every year was 28 ha 1 y 1 while it was 14 ha 1 y 1 for subsoiling every other year whether before cotton or maize the variable costs for irrigation fuel labor were 0 203 ha 1 mm 1 two maize price scenarios 118 11 mg 1 and 236 22 mg 1 were used 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water soil water tension differences between the ns hi and the es li treatments were evident in fig 1 the most noticeable difference was how the es li treatment had generally lower soil water tension i e contained more moisture in the crop root zone despite less irrigation than the ns hi treatment the black line for es li tended to be below the blue line for ns hi fig 1 especially as rainfall dwindled in the reproductive period the tension difference between ns hi and es li continued to increase for example in 2001 between june 6 and june 27 ns hi experienced a net increase of 69 kpa without any observed decreases while es li experienced a net increase of 31 kpa with four instances of decreases assuming similar rates of crop evapotranspiration these observations would suggest preliminarily that subsoiling increases soil water availability by improving infiltration the infiltration benefit of subsoiling is supported by statistical analyses the irrigation response results showed a 95 confidence interval from 7 to 15 kpa for the mean difference ns hi minus es li in profile tension changes ns hi was less responsive than es li to irrigation by an average of 11 kpa with a two tail p value of 0 0001 against the null hypothesis of no difference the subsoil results revealed a 95 confidence interval from 1 to 9 kpa the subsoil tension increases in ns hi were 5 kpa larger on average than those in es li with a two tail p value of 0 016 thus the results from both paired t tests suggest that subsoiling improves infiltration of irrigation water interestingly subsoiling enhanced soil water gains at the 0 15 and 0 30 m depths more than at the 0 46 and 0 61 m in contrast there was no significant positive effect on rainfall infiltration from subsoiling the mean difference ns hi minus es li in profile tension changes after a rainfall showed a 95 confidence interval of 11 0 kpa the profile tension increases in ns hi were 6 kpa smaller on average than those in es li with a two tailed p value of 0 0417 at the subsoil depths the 95 confidence interval was from 3 7 kpa the subsoil tension increases in ns hi were 2 kpa smaller on average than those in es li with a two tailed p value of 0 5061 in this experiment subsoiling did not improve infiltration from rainfall particularly the larger rainfall events in each season reduced the high ns hi shallow tension readings to within proximity of the es li shallow tension readings how irrigation water infiltrates into the furrow in a subsoiled field is important in row subsoiling can improve infiltration during a furrow irrigation event in a different manner as opposed to other subsoiler implements as described by tupper 1995 and sojka et al 1992 in row subsoiling is designed for minimal soil disturbance in the furrow and for promotion of preferential flow or piping of the water along the diagonally fractured path from the furrow to below the center of the bed fig 2 bryant et al 2020 found that in row subsoiling significantly improved irrigation application efficiency and irrigation water use efficiency for furrow irrigated soybean in the mississippi delta on the other hand in row subsoiling failed to increase the infiltration of large rainfall amounts in the present experiment two phenomena may have contributed to this finding first in a full maize canopy stemflow funnels and concentrates rainwater onto the soil surface along the crop row dolan et al 2001 where the soil moisture sensors were placed and where in row subsoiling never disturbed these factors may have enabled the ns hi sensors to exhibit strong wetting responses to rainfall reducing the tension difference between the two treatments after larger rainfall events second the ns hi treatment generally had higher tension throughout the maize growing season compared to the es li treatment therefore ns hi may have had stronger capillary forces due to drier soil conditions resulting in higher infiltration rates radcliffe and simunek 2010 compared to es li for both rain infiltration and irrigation infiltration in this study subsoiling effects appeared to be larger at the depths disturbed by subsoiling than at the depths further below subsoiling fractures the soil between 0 and 0 4 m and thus changes the soil properties in this layer odey and manuwa 2018 one of the major soil properties that is expected to be altered is macroporosity which would increase saturated hydraulic conductivity and stored soil water at these shallow depths drewry and paton 2000 past subsoiling studies in the southeast u s and beyond found similar results sene et al 1985 concluded that the largest increases in maize yield from subsoiling were attributed to significantly increasing saturated hydraulic conductivity and decreasing bulk density in the a horizon rather than in the e and b horizons popp et al 2001 indicated that subsoiling effects on volumetric water content vwc in rainfed fields varied by soil type and soil depth at 0 0 15 m subsoiling significantly increased vwc in both heavy clay and silt loam at the 0 15 0 30 m subsoiling caused minimal vwc difference in both soil types at 0 30 0 60 m subsoiling led to no vwc differences in the heavy clay but a 0 079 m3 m 3 higher vwc in silt loam on two different soil types in new zealand the more persistent increases in macroporosity and air permeability were found at a soil depth range of 0 18 0 24 m and at 0 06 m and beyond in their respective studies drewry and paton 2000 drewry et al 2000 these findings suggest an increase in pore sizes for the soil depth disturbed from mechanical intervention that allows more infiltration deeper soil depths beyond the total subsoiling depth did not significantly change in macroporosity in conclusion subsoiling seems to improve the soil water availability at fractured depths as opposed to beyond the reach of the subsoiler shanks 3 2 maize yield analysis of variance for maize yield found that the subsoiling irrigation year interaction was statistically significant table 2 mean maize yields for each of the twelve treatments from 2000 to 2004 are given in table 3 instead of one factor with four levels ns cs ms es subsoiling frequency could be expressed alternatively as the interaction between two factors with two levels each the first factor would be whether or not subsoiling occurred before maize one off season ago and the second factor would be whether or not subsoiling occurred before cotton two off seasons ago with this alternate model the type iii p value was 0 02 for the second factor and was greater than 0 05 for all interaction terms involving the second factor meanwhile the type iii p values for the first factor irrigation year and all their two way and three way interactions were less than 0 0001 the relatively large p values associated with the second factor indicate that fall in row subsoiling two off seasons ago did not appear to affect maize yield results by raper et al 2005 suggested that subsoiling must be performed annually and not biennially or triennially to reduce bulk densities likewise clark et al 1993 concluded that paratill should be as frequent as every year rather than alternate years for increasing infiltration rates given these considerations the second factor was excluded from the statistical model to simplify the interpretation of yield results which led to pooling of ns with cs and of ms with es for fig 3 based on fig 3 the first finding is that subsoiling significantly improved non irrigated maize yield for all five years as a form of non inversion tillage subsoiling in the non irrigated crop row allows for increased infiltration of precipitation and reduced runoff cassel and edwards 1985 conducted a multi year subsoiling irrigation study in the southeast united states that reported significant maize yield differences in three consecutive years between the non irrigated conventional tillage treatment and the non irrigated in row subsoiling treatment on an average dry year for non irrigated land in row subsoiling had a 119 higher maize yield than conventional tillage box and langdale 1984 found in two consecutive years under non irrigated conditions two separate in row subsoiling treatments both delivered significantly higher maize yields compared to a disk harrow only and fluted coulter only treatments the average yield differences seen were 13 and 9 respectively according to fig 3 subsoiling without irrigation improved the average maize yield by 21 compared to ns ni and cs ni the previously mentioned studies were all conducted on a similar coastal loam soil as soil type can influence the maize yield response for a non irrigated maize field an alternative to developing irrigation is to practice in row subsoiling to improve maize yield because more soil water will be available in the root zone for short term droughts subsoiling does not remove the need to irrigate but may require less frequent irrigation applications this second finding was evident because li was sufficient to maximize maize yield when in row subsoiling was performed for four out of the five years ibrahim and miller 1989 discovered no significant differences in maize yield between weekly and biweekly irrigation in a deep tilled loam soil furthermore fig 3 shows that a combination of low frequency irrigation and subsoiling produced a significantly higher maize yield than subsoiling alone cassel and edwards 1985 observed similarly that subsoiling irrigation produced 24 higher mean yield than subsoiling alone box and langdale 1984 found that two separate in row subsoiling irrigation treatments yielded 46 higher than the non irrigated in row subsoiling treatments in conclusion in row subsoiling in the southeast u s complements rather than eliminates the need for irrigation of maize reducing the number of necessary irrigation applications by increasing irrigation infiltration the third finding is that for three out of the five years 2000 2001 and 2003 the high frequency irrigation level was the most favorable for achieving profitable maize yields when subsoiling was not practiced irrigation frequency is critical during periods of low rainfall and high evapotranspiration demands according to table 1 cumulative rainfall for the 80 day period before maize maturity was less than 300 mm for 2000 2003 fig 1 visually details the minimal rainfall that triggered a larger number of irrigations in the reproductive period for these dry years although 2002 was dry the li and hi irrigation levels received almost identical irrigation amounts and timing starting from 19 days before tasseling which was earlier than any other year and would have minimized the yield benefit of the hi level rainfall during 2004 is characterized as above average with only three hi applications and two li applications amidst abundant rainfall the literature presents similar results regarding the impacts of irrigation on maize without the practice of subsoiling in a maize irrigation study in the mississippi delta bruns et al 2003 found that one of the key yield components kernel count can be especially affected by irrigation two of the three years in the study found that irrigation significantly increased kernel count by 20 and 14 in 1999 and 2001 respectively compared to rainfed cassel and edwards 1985 found a mean maize yield difference of 136 between irrigated and non irrigated conventional tillage treatments these past findings concur with the present study that for a non subsoiled field more frequent irrigation to compensate for the lack of rainfall tends to increase maize yields above no or minimal irrigation 3 3 profitability subsoiling in the offseason prior to a maize crop the following spring promoted high profitability in maize production the ms level achieved the highest average profit across five years for all irrigation levels with low associated risk i e interannual standard deviation compared to cs and ns the cs level achieved the lowest average profit across five years for all irrigation levels with high associated risk tables 4 and 5 these two economic observations are applicable to both maize price scenarios because a profit advantage was observed regardless of the maize price scenario or irrigation frequency low till parabolic subsoiling in the previous offseason before a maize crop may be a generally profitable practice in similar regions of the world in contrast the profit benefit of irrigation was dependent on maize price and subsoiling level for ns and cs the profit increased with increasing irrigation frequency and this increase was larger at the higher maize price at a low maize price the average profit for ms and es does not increase substantially as the irrigation frequency increases table 4 on the other hand the average profit for ms and es at a high maize price has a notable increase in profit from no irrigation to low frequency irrigation table 5 at both maize prices both low and high irrigation frequency reduced profit risk compared to no irrigation in conclusion maize grain price and irrigation frequency can impact maize profitability depending on if and when subsoiling is practiced 4 conclusion the analysis of the watermark sensor data suggests that subsoiling improves infiltration of irrigation water specifically in contrast subsoiling did not significantly increase infiltration of rainfall on the other hand the selected year for fall subsoiling in a maize cotton rotation system does have implications the ms level produces a high average maize yield as well as a high average profit compared to the cs es and ns levels low frequency irrigation is sufficient to produce profitable yields if the ms treatment is performed on an irrigated field this finding is encouraging for groundwater conservation considering the ms li treatment reduces the irrigation requirement of maize on soils prone to compaction if subsoiling is not used irrigation has substantial value in achieving profitable yields as cotton production acreage has decreased in the last several decades with a shift toward maize and soybean rotations lo and pringle 2021 future research could further quantify water infiltration depth in a subsoiled field across several soil types under a maize soybean rotation the incorporation of soil moisture monitoring technologies in deep tillage studies can reveal the extent of water infiltration throughout soil profiles that have recently been fractured subsoiling should be used to its maximum effectiveness and performed at the right time to produce the best results declaration of competing interest the

9231,a knitted sock geotextile envelope is commonly used in the usa canada and parts of europe to prevent sediment entry into agricultural subsurface drain pipes sand slot pipes have a narrow width to prevent sediment from moving into the drain pipe and they are used in the usa and canada as a cheaper alternative to knitted sock wrapped pipes the type of drain pipe sand slot or sock wrapped is important in subsurface drainage design because it affects the entrance head loss caused by the convergence of flowlines toward the drain perforations thereby influencing the effective radius of the pipe which in turn affects drain inflow although the theoretical effective radius of a knitted sock wrapped pipe can be estimated based on analytical equations no study has experimentally measured it to verify the theoretical equations this study had two objectives 1 experimentally measure the effective radius of sock wrapped and sand slot pipes to verify the theoretical method and 2 comparatively evaluate the drain inflow performance of a sock wrapped pipe and a sand slot pipe we tested the pipe materials in a sand tank experiment equipped with manometers the results showed that the measured and theoretical effective radii were 5 5 and 5 6 cm for the sock wrapped pipe 0 7 and 0 7 cm for the 4 row sand slot pipe and 1 6 and 1 6 cm for the 8 row sand slot pipe respectively this agreement confirmed that the theoretical method reliably estimated the effective radius of the pipes the sock wrapped pipe had a considerably lower entrance head loss 0 4 cm than the 8 row 6 1 cm and 4 row 10 4 cm sand slot pipes thereby increasing the effective radius of the sock wrapped pipe the estimated drain inflow of the sock wrapped pipe was 12 and 20 higher than that of the 8 row and 4 row sand slot pipes respectively in conclusion we verified that the theoretical method accurately estimated the effective radius of the pipes and demonstrated that the sock wrapped pipe had considerably higher drain inflow than the sand slot pipe keywords agricultural drainage drain envelope effective radius entrance resistance perforation sand slot pipe data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agricultural subsurface drainage systems remove excess water from the soil profile to provide proper conditions for crop production evans and fausey 1999 ghane et al 2016 they also provide improved soil strength for field operations mante et al 2018 these drainage systems are comprised of perforated lateral drain pipes to remove water these perforated drains are installed at a certain drain depth and spacing to achieve the design rate of water removal ghane et al 2021 ghane and askar 2021 drain spacing critically affects drainage system performance thus it is an important drainage design decision skaggs 2007 the hooghoudt 1940 steady state equation is commonly used to determine the drain spacing in humid regions ayars and evans 2015 to determine the drain spacing using the hooghoudt equation a parameter called effective radius is required which is the radius of an imaginary pipe without walls skaggs 1978 the effective radius accounts for the entrance head loss caused by the convergence of flowlines toward the drain perforations dierickx and van der molen 1981 the effective radius of a drain pipe depends on the perforation characteristics and the drain envelope dierickx 1999 dierickx and van der molen 1981 gaj and madramootoo 2020 stuyt and dierickx 2006 drain envelopes come in three types granular mineral organic and synthetic the synthetic envelopes have two types pre wrapped loose material and pre wrapped geotextile stuyt and dierickx 2006 there are three types of geotextile envelopes nonwoven woven and knitted geotextile envelopes are primarily used to prevent the entry of fine sand and silt into the drain thereby avoiding clogging of the drain pipe with sediment rollin et al 1987 geotextile envelopes also increase water flow into the drain pipe because they reduce the entrance head loss thereby increasing the effective radius of the drain oyarce et al 2017 stuyt et al 2005 if soil and drainage design depth and spacing remain the same increasing the effective radius of a pipe increases the drain inflow skaggs 1978 therefore the type of drain pipe with or without geotextile envelope is important in subsurface drainage design because it affects the effective radius of the pipe which in turn affects drain inflow previous studies have evaluated the hydraulic performance and clogging of nonwoven and woven geotextile envelopes khorramian et al 2022 2021 li et al 2022 markiewicz et al 2022 odabasi et al 2022 whereas less attention has been given to knitted sock envelopes the knitted geotextile envelope is the most used envelope for agricultural drainage in the usa and canada stuyt et al 2005 the theoretical effective radius of a knitted sock wrapped pipe has been estimated by ghane 2022 based on the analytical equations developed by dierickx 1999 however to our knowledge no study has experimentally measured the effective radius of drain pipes wrapped with a knitted sock envelope measuring the effective radius of a drain pipe is a resource intensive process that requires a sand tank experiment if the theoretical method is verified with experimentally measured data the theoretical method can be used to readily estimate the effective radius of any pipe diameter wrapped with a knitted sock envelope which then can be used to calculate drain spacing in subsurface drainage design therefore there is a need to experimentally measure the effective radius of a sock wrapped and sand slot pipes so that it can be used to verify the theoretical method drain inflow of a pipe is important in deciding which pipe to use in drainage design to our knowledge we found only one study that had compared the drain inflow performance of a knitted sock wrapped and sand slot pipes in a laboratory study in that study broughton et al 1987 measured considerably higher drain inflow in a knitted sock wrapped pipe compared to a sand slot pipe however the authors did not quantify the effective radius of the sock wrapped and sand slot pipes the increase in drain inflow of the sock wrapped pipe compared to the sand slot pipe depends on the effective radius of the pipe drainage design drain depth and spacing and soil properties therefore the value of quantifying the effective radius of the pipe is that it can be used to calculate drain inflow for any soil and drainage design conditions we conducted a sand tank experiment with two objectives 1 experimentally measure the effective radius of sock wrapped and sand slot pipes to verify the theoretical method and 2 comparatively evaluate the drain inflow performance of a sock wrapped pipe and a sand slot pipe the value of this study is that it will inform subsurface design decision about the suitability of knitted sock geotextile envelopes for increasing drain inflow 2 materials and methods 2 1 properties of the sand used in the sand tank experiment we determined the properties of the sand to verify the need for a drain envelope to keep sediments out of the pipe section 3 1 cation exchange capacity was determined at the soil plant and nutrient lab at michigan state university table 1 we used astm standard sieves to conduct dry sieving in triplicate we used a sieve shaker ro tap model rx 29 for 15 min with the following screen sizes 0 063 0 075 0 125 0 25 0 5 0 85 2 4 and 9 mm dry sieving results were used to plot the particle size distribution to determine the d10 d60 and d90 for each of the three replicates and average values are reported in table 1 particle size distribution curves are presented in supplementary

coefficient of uniformity was calculated as the ratio of d 60 d 10 when the coefficient of uniformity of the sand is less than 6 the soil is not well graded as is the sand used in our experiment

type a circular knitted socks are commonly used for agricultural drainage in the usa and canada 2 4 sand tank experiment 2 4 1 sand tank construction a steel tank was constructed to withstand the combined pressure of the sand and water the sand tank measured 110 cm long 50 cm wide and 100 cm tall fig 3 a 10 cm diameter hole was made cut in the middle of the tank to insert the drain pipe horizontally supplementary fig s2 the sand tank was fitted with a 5 0 cm diameter overflow pipe to maintain a somewhat similar water level over the sand among the various pipe experiments a valve near the bottom of the tank was used to drain the water 2 4 2 hydraulic head measurement we used manometers to measure the hydraulic head fig 3 the manometers were constructed by inserting through wall straight connectors into a hole on the steel tank high pressure rigid plastic tubing was inserted into the through wall connectors to measure the hydraulic head 10 cm away from the wall we used a weather resistant rubber sealing washer on the inside and outside of the connectors to prevent leaks on the outside of the tank a soft clear vinyl tubing was inserted into the barbed side of the through wall connectors and mounted on the side of the tank where head measurements were read using a meter stick supplementary fig s3 the manometer m 0 was inserted from the outside of the tank into the bottom of the pipe to measure the hydraulic head inside the drain pipe fig 3 to measure the hydraulic head just outside of the pipe in the sand a manometer was installed at three positions in the pipe wall bottom b 1 right r 1 and top t 1 manometers r 2 to r 5 were installed at the same level as the drain center and spaced horizontally on the right side at 10 21 32 and 43 cm from the center of the 10 cm diameter drain pipe respectively manometers b 3 and b 4 were installed at the bottom 21 and 32 cm from the center of the drain pipe respectively manometers t 3 and t 4 were installed on the top 21 and 32 cm from the center of the drain pipe respectively manometer t 5 was installed above the sand surface in the water to measure the hydraulic head at the source hydraulic head is equal to elevation head plus pressure head in our experiment the reference elevation i e fixed datum was 5 3 cm below the invert of the pipe 2 4 3 drain configuration the drain was configured according to the method outlined in mohammad and skaggs 1983 briefly the 10 cm diameter pipes were inserted into the 10 cm diameter hole in the tank at 0 slope the opposite end of the drain which was inside the sand tank was sealed with waterproof tape the other end of the drain was open to convey water out of the sand tank fig 3 outside of the tank the perforated pipe was connected to an l shaped pvc pipe using a rubber coupler to create a submerged outlet condition for measuring the hydraulic heads the l shaped pvc pipe was designed to be detached from the perforated pipe to allow free drainage for assessing the pattern of flowlines toward the sock wrapped pipe supplementary fig s4 section 3 7 2 4 4 filling and saturating the tank before filling the tank the l shaped pvc pipe was connected to the perforated outlet pipe to prevent water from leaving the pipe during the saturation process the tank was filled with sand in 5 cm layer increments after the addition of each sand layer we gradually saturated the layer by adding water from the bottom until water reached the surface of the sand layer then we added another sand layer followed by another incremental and gradual rise of the water table we repeated this process over course of two days to fill the tank and allow air bubbles to escape 2 4 5 simulating drain flow after filling and saturating the tank municipal water was conveyed to the top of the sand tank via a hose and was spread on the sand surface through a perforated pvc manifold supplementary fig s5 subsequently the hole on the outflow pvc pipe was opened to allow water to flow out of the pipe under submerged condition flow through the pvc manifold was adjusted to create a ponding condition over the sand bypass water flowed out through the overflow pipe we simulated flow for 24 h before recording the flow rate and hydraulic head measurements to ensure that the system had reached a steady state condition we measured the flow rate by measuring the time required to fill a volume of water in a beaker in duplicate then the average flow rate was used as the measured drain flow rate 2 5 measuring the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil surrounding the pipe k s after the sand tank experiment was completed a well mixed sand sample was extracted to measure the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil surrounding the pipe based on the constant head method astm d 2434 19 2019 we used a 76 mm 3 in astm standard constant head permeameter gilson company inc fig 4 see supplementary section s1 for experiment details when flow through soil is laminar darcy s law can be written as 1 q k s i where q is specific discharge cm h k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil surrounding the pipe cm h and i is hydraulic gradient that is the ratio of head loss h to length over which head loss has occurred l 7 3 cm specific discharge is the flow rate divided by the cross sectional area of the soil cylinder a plot of specific discharge versus hydraulic gradient was created for the series of measurements the permeameter experiment was repeated two additional times by repacking well mixed sand samples to obtain three k s values the three experiments were conducted at water temperatures ranging from 17 c to 20 c for each experiment the hydraulic conductivity was converted to that of 18 c by multiplying the measured k s by the ratio of dynamic viscosity of water at the test temperature to dynamic viscosity of water at 18 c astm d 2434 19 2019 the average k s of the three experiments was used to represent the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil surrounding the pipe at 18 c 2 6 criteria for evaluating the suitability the knitted sock envelope we evaluated three literature recommended criteria to determine the suitability of the knitted sock envelope to prevent drain sedimentation this section describes these criteria 2 6 1 hydraulic criterion the purpose of the hydraulic criterion is to ensure that the hydraulic conductivity of the knitted sock envelope will not restrict water entry into the pipe the hydraulic criterion requires that the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the envelope is much greater than that of the soil surrounding the pipe vlotman et al 2020 the recommended hydraulic criterion is written as 2 k ks k s 10 where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil surrounding the pipe cm h and k ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the knitted sock envelope cm h 2 6 2 anti clogging criterion the purpose of the anti clogging criterion is to prevent sediment from clogging the openings of the knitted sock envelope dierickx 1987 if drain envelopes do not meet the anti clogging criterion because of excessively small openings they would prevent clay particles from moving through the envelope thereby creating a filter cake stuyt and dierickx 2006 a filter cake is the accumulation of fine clay particles at the envelope soil interface which creates a barrier for water entry into the drain pipe a filter cake has a much lower saturated hydraulic conductivity than the original soil surrounding the drain we used the anti clogging criterion originally developed by dierickx 1993 and recommended by stuyt and dierickx 2006 the recommended anti clogging criterion is written as 3 o 90 0 20 mm where o 90 is the envelope pore size for which 90 of pores are smaller 2 6 3 retention criterion the purpose of the retention criterion also known as filter criterion or bridging criterion is to retain the soil in place at the soil envelope interface so that soil does not move into the drain pipe even though some clay particles go through the envelope vlotman et al 2020 we used the retention criterion originally developed by dierickx 1993 and recommended by stuyt and dierickx 2006 for thin geotextile envelopes less than 1 mm thick the recommended retention criterion is written as 4 1 o 90 d 90 2 5 where d 90 is the diameter for which 90 of soil particles are finer 2 7 parameter calculations 2 7 1 theoretical effective radius of a drain pipe with an envelope r ef the effective radius of the drain is the radius of an imaginary drain pipe with a completely open wall ghane 2022 found that perforation area is not a good predictor of effective radius two pipes with equal perforation area can have different effective radii because effective radius depends on perforation shape and pattern dierickx 1999 therefore it is important to use the analytical equations developed by dierickx 1999 to estimate effective radius that accounts for perforation shape and pattern dierickx 1999 derived a theoretical analytical equation to calculate the effective radius of a sock wrapped pipe in units of centimeter which is written as 5 r ef r o k s k ks r o d ks k s k ks 1 exp 2 π k s α e k ks where ro is the outer radius of pipe cm ri is the inner radius of pipe cm k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil surrounding the pipe cm h k ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the knitted sock envelope cm h d ks is the thickness of the knitted sock envelope cm and α e is the theoretical entrance resistance factor of a drain pipe dimensionless 2 7 2 theoretical effective radius of a drain pipe without an envelope r ef the theoretical effective radius of a drain pipe without an envelope is calculated as dierickx 1999 6 r ef r 0 exp 2 π α e where r 0 is the outer radius of the drain pipe cm and α e is the theoretical entrance resistance factor of a drain pipe dimensionless 2 7 3 theoretical entrance resistance factor of a drain pipe α e the dimensionless entrance resistance factor α e is calculated using the theoretical equation developed by dierickx 1999 the theoretical analytical equation for a corrugated drain pipe is written as 7 α e c 2 π 2 r o ln 2 c π β v c 4 π r o c 2 π n λ p ln 2 sinh 2 π r o r i β v sin 2 π β s 2 β v 1 2 π ln r o r i where r o is the outer radius of pipe cm r i is the inner radius of pipe cm c is the perforation spacing cm n is the number of longitudinal rows of perforation β s is the perforation width cm β v is the valley width cm and λ p is the perforation length cm the drain material with the smallest entrance resistance factor will have the largest effective radius 2 7 4 measured water entrance resistance w e we calculated the water entrance resistance for the drain pipe with and without an envelope w e from the entrance head loss h e head loss occurs when water moves from midway between the drains to the inside of the drain total head loss h t was calculated according to dierickx 1999 8 h t h v h h h r h e where h v is the vertical head loss h h is the horizontal head loss h r is the radial head loss and h e is the entrance head loss the vertical head loss is assumed to be negligible due to the short vertical path of water skaggs 1980 the other three head losses horizontal radial and entrance are important in drainage theory and modeling the convergences of flowlines toward the pipe perforations causes entrance head loss which depends on the soil and drain perforation characteristics in our experiment entrance head loss h e was calculated as dierickx 1999 vlotman et al 2020 9 h e h t 1 h m 0 where h t 1 is the hydraulic head of manometer t 1 that is on the top of the pipe wall in the sand cm and h m 0 is the hydraulic head of manometer m 0 that is inside the pipe cm the hydraulic head of manometer t 1 top of the pipe wall was used to represent the hydraulic head outside of the pipe the h t 1 includes radial head loss of flowlines moving from the soil surface to the outside of the pipe the water entrance resistance w e was calculated as dierickx 1993 10 w e h e q l where h e is the measured entrance head loss cm w e is the water entrance resistance day cm and q l is the measured flow rate per unit length of the drain pipe cm2 day we calculated q l as 11 q l q l p where l p is the length of the pipe with open perforations cm and q is the measured drain flow rate cm3 day 2 7 5 measured entrance resistance factor α e the dimensionless entrance resistance factor for the drain pipe α e is calculated as dierickx 1999 12 α e 24 k s w e where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil surrounding the pipe cm h w e is the water entrance resistance of the drain pipe day cm 2 7 6 measured effective radius of a drain pipe with or without an envelope r ef we calculated the measured effective radius of the drain pipe with or without an envelope as dierickx 1999 13 r ef r 0 exp 2 π α e where r ef is the measured effective radius of the drain pipe cm r 0 is the outer radius of the drain pipe cm and α e is the measured entrance resistance factor dimensionless 2 8 estimating the drain inflow of the pipes in the sand tank experiment ponding depth over the sand varied slightly among each experiment depending on the flow rate of the municipal tap water this was because water level over the sand was allowed to vary within the diameter of the overflow pipe also height of sand over the pipe varied slightly from one experiment to another consequently the drain flow rates q were measured under varying hydraulic heads at manometer t 5 i e varying ponding depths therefore we cannot compare the q l values of different pipes to evaluate their drain inflow performance because a higher ponding depth would result in a higher q l consequently q l was not a suitable measure for evaluating the drain inflow performance we conducted a three step analysis to evaluate the drain inflow performance of the three pipes step 1 we calculated the drainage intensity as defined by skaggs 2017 drainage intensity is the rate of water removal when the water table midway between the lateral drain pipes is at the soil surface the drainage intensity can be written as ghane et al 2021 14 di 24 8 k e d e d d 4 k e d d 2 s 2 where di is the drainage intensity cm day s is the drain spacing cm k e is the equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile cm h d d is the drain depth cm and d e is the equivalent depth cm the equivalent depth accounts for radial head loss due to convergence of flowlines toward the drain pipe skaggs 1991 we used the equivalent depth equation developed by van der molen and wesseling 1991 this equation is written as 15 d e π s 8 ln s π r ef f x where r ef is the effective radius of the drain pipe cm when x 0 5 f x can be approximated by 16 f x π 2 4 x ln x 2 π where x 2 π d s and d is the distance from the drain center to the restrictive layer cm for the drainage intensity calculation we assumed similar drain spacing of 1500 cm drain depth of 75 cm and depth to restrictive layer of 200 cm for each of the three pipes for each pipe we calculated drainage intensity for a wide range of soils with saturated hydraulic conductivities from 1 to 6 cm h step 2 we estimated drain inflow per unit length of the lateral drain as huffman et al 2013 17 q d di a d where q d is the estimated drain inflow per unit length of the lateral drain pipe cm2 day and a d is the area drained by one lateral drain pipe with a unit length cm2 cm the a d is calculated as the multiplication of drain spacing s by unit length of the lateral drain 100 cm step 3 we compared the estimated drain inflow per unit length of each drain pipe sock wrapped 4 row sand slot and 8 row sand slot assuming all soil and drainage conditions were identical except for the drain pipe material the only difference between the pipes was the r ef which is unique to the drain pipe material 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification that the drain envelope was necessary we used the envelope need flowchart developed by vlotman et al 2000 to verify that the drain envelope was necessary the first assessment evaluated percent clay content and we determined that our soil had 2 6 clay content soil with less than 30 clay content requires assessment of the plasticity index so we evaluated the plasticity index of our soil when plasticity index is greater than 12 an envelope is not needed however the plasticity index of our soil indicated that it was non plastic which means it had poor stability i e soil particles do not stick together and required an envelope to prevent sediment from entering the drain pipe therefore the sand used in our sand tank experiment required the use of a knitted sock envelope to keep sediment out of the drain pipe the envelope need flowchart developed by vlotman et al 2000 has been incorporated into a user friendly online decision support tool entitled drain sedimentation tool available at https www egr msu edu bae water drainage drainage design tools this tool requires drainage intensity drain spacing cation exchange capacity bulk density and percent sand silt and clay to determine if sedimentation of the drain pipe is a problem 3 2 saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil surrounding the pipe the results of the three constant head permeability experiments showed that the relationship between specific discharge and hydraulic gradient followed the laminar darcian law for the range of hydraulic gradients from 0 04 to 0 38 fig 5 experiment 1 resulted in k s of 41 9 cm h at 18 c experiment 2 resulted in k s of 43 3 cm h at 18 c and experiment 3 resulted in k s of 41 1 cm h at 18 c the average k s of the three experiments was 42 1 cm h at 18 c 3 3 suitability of the knitted sock envelope to prevent drain sedimentation 3 3 1 hydraulic criterion the result of the hydraulic criterion showed that the carriff knitted sock envelope had a ratio of k ks k s 1404 42 1 33 3 thus the hydraulic criterion of the knitted sock envelope was met because the ratio was greater than 10 this means that the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the knitted sock envelope was much greater than that of the sand surrounding the drain and it did not restrict water entry into the pipe 3 3 2 anti clogging criterion the carriff knitted sock envelope had a maximum filtration opening size o 95 of 0 45 mm based on the ratio of o95 o90 1 2 vlotman et al 2000 o 95 0 45 mm translates to o 90 0 38 mm consequently the anti clogging criterion of o 90 0 20 mm was satisfied this means that the knitted sock envelope had large enough openings to allow passage of fine clay particles and avoid clogging the sock openings in our 24 hour sand tank experiment we only observed clay particles wash out in the drain inflow during the first few hours of flow rollin et al 1987 found no evidence of sediment clogging the thin knitted sock openings after 3 years of draining of a silty clay loam soil in canada broughton et al 1987 found no evidence of knitted sock clogging in a wide range of soils from fine sand to silt loam in a sand tank experiment in civil engineering corrugated perforated drain pipes can be wrapped with a knitted sock geotextile to drain water from the downstream toe of dams swihart 2000 studied toe drains and did not find any evidence of a knitted sock envelope clogging with a sand gravelly soil in a laboratory experiment if knitted sock envelopes are properly installed in a soil with a drain sedimentation problem i e non cohesive or weakly cohesive soil their openings are not expected to clog stuyt et al 2005 chemical clogging of geotextile envelopes i e iron ochre calcium carbonate lime and gypsum can be a problem so those should be investigated prior to drain pipe installation guo et al 2021 2020 we recommend long term field investigations of the knitted sock envelope clogging with various soil types to better inform their applications in drainage design 3 3 3 retention criterion the carriff sock thickness less than 1 mm had a maximum o 90 of 0 38 mm for the known o 90 0 38 mm and the d 90 1 43 mm the ratio of o 90 d 90 0 3 which meets the retention criterion 1 o 90 d 90 2 5 the lower limit of the retention criterion is to minimize the risk for mineral clogging stuyt and dierickx 2006 generally knitted sock envelopes are used in non cohesive and weakly cohesive soil sand loamy sand sandy loam silt and silt loam in our sand tank experiment the knitted sock and sand slot pipes were able to retain the sand and prevent it from moving into the drain based on visual observations broughton et al 1987 compared sock wrapped and sand slot pipes in a wide range of soils medium fine sand fine sandy loam very fine sandy loam and silt loam the authors found that even though some sediment entered both sock wrapped and sand slot pipes both pipes provided adequate protection against sediment clogging of the pipe however the authors found that the sock wrapped pipe consistently kept more sediment out of the pipe than the sand slot pipe in each of the tested soils 3 4 verifying the theoretical effective radius we simulated flow for 24 h to reach a steady state condition after which we measured the drain flow rate and hydraulic head of the manometers supplementary section s2 then we calculated the entrance resistance factor and effective radius of the pipe table 4 the theoretical α e of the sock wrapped 3 row regular perforated drain pipe depends on the k s thus we used k s of 42 1 cm h at 18 c to calculate the theoretical α e of the sock wrapped pipe section 3 2 we chose 18 c because the drain inflow temperature for the two sand slot pipes and sock wrapped pipe ranged from 17 5 c to 18 0 c for the experiments of the three pipes comparison of the measured and theoretical effective radius shows that the values are in close agreement and the minor differences can be explained by experimental error therefore our results verify the theoretical method presented by dierickx 1999 for estimating the effective radius of both sand slot and sock wrapped pipes previous studies measured the entrance resistance factor of perforated pipes gaj and madramootoo 2020 and prewrapped loose synthetic envelopes wesseling and homma 1967 sekendar 1984 measured an effective radius of 2 5 cm after wrapping a 5 cm diameter 8 row perforation pvc pipe with synthetic fiber envelope rimidis and dierickx 2004 found that a nonwoven geotextile envelope reduced entrance head loss in a field experiment in lithuania but they did not quantify the effective radius of the nonwoven geotextile wrapped pipe to our knowledge our study is the first to experimentally measure the effective radius of the commonly manufactured sock wrapped pipe 3 5 effective radius of the drain pipes the results showed that the measured entrance head loss of the sock wrapped pipe was only 0 4 cm whereas that of the 8 row sand slot pipe was 6 1 cm and that of the 4 row sand slot pipe was 10 4 cm table 4 the higher entrance head loss of the 4 row and 8 row sand slot pipes resulted in a greater measured entrance resistance factor than that of the sock wrapped pipe consequently the sock wrapped pipe had the largest measured effective radius 5 5 cm followed by the 8 row sand slot pipe 1 6 cm and the 4 row sand slot pipe 0 7 cm therefore the knitted sock envelope had a considerably lower entrance head loss than the sand slot pipe thereby increasing the effective radius of the pipe in drain pipes without a knitted sock envelope entrance head loss occurs due to the convergence of flowlines toward the pipe perforations fig 6 wrapping a knitted sock envelope around a regular perforated drain considerably reduces the convergence of flowlines toward the drain perforations so that entrance resistance factor becomes negligible skaggs 1978 the very small entrance head loss of the sock wrapped pipe 0 4 cm showed that the knitted sock envelope reduced the entrance resistance factor to near zero i e 0 012 as a result the effective radius of the sock wrapped pipe 5 5 cm was close to its maximum value which was the outer radius of the drain pipe 5 9 cm other studies reported a negligible entrance resistance factor for prewrapped loose woven and nonwoven envelopes in an early study bravo and schwab 1977 investigated the effect of perforations on flow into corrugated drains based on an electric analog model the authors postulated that corrugated drain pipes wrapped with a porous covering such as a nylon mesh could represent a completely open drain later sekendar 1984 measured an effective radius of 2 5 cm for an 8 row pvc pipe with 2 5 cm radius wrapped with synthetic fiber in a sand tank experiment which indicated that their synthetic wrapped pipe functioned as a completely open pipe without walls wesseling and homma 1967 also measured negligible entrance resistance factor of 0 020 i e resulting in the maximum effective radius for a prewrapped loose synthetic envelope to our knowledge our study is the first to experimentally show that the effective radius of a sock wrapped pipe is approximately equal to the outer radius of the drain thereby functioning almost as a completely open pipe without walls 3 6 drain inflow performance of the pipes the results showed that the estimated drain inflow of the sock wrapped pipe was higher than that of the 8 row and 4 row sand slot pipes fig 7 the drain inflow per unit length of the sock wrapped pipe increased by 132 cm2 day and 199 cm2 day compared to the 8 row and 4 row sand slot pipes respectively at saturated hydraulic conductivity of 1 0 cm h the differences in the drain inflows per unit length of the drain pipes increased as the saturated hydraulic conductivity increased from 1 0 to 6 0 cm h however the percent increase in drain inflow remained constant across a wide range of the soils overall drain inflow of the sock wrapped pipe was 12 and 20 higher than that of the 8 row and 4 row sand slot pipes respectively although we calculated the drain inflow for an assumed drain spacing and depth the trend of higher drain inflow for the sock wrapped pipe than the sand slot pipe will remain the same for other combinations of drain depth and spacing broughton et al 1987 also measured considerably higher drain inflow in a knitted sock wrapped pipe compared to a sand slot pipe in a laboratory experiment but they did not quantify the effective radius of either pipe the reason that the sock wrapped pipe had the highest drain inflow is because wrapping a knitted sock envelope around a pipe considerably reduces the convergence of flowlines toward the pipe perforations thereby reducing entrance head loss to near zero in other words flowlines will not be concentrated toward the sock wrapped pipe perforations fig 6 instead flowlines will move parallel to each other toward the sock wrapped pipe thereby considerably reducing entrance head loss to near zero once water passes through the knitted sock envelope it moves toward the perforations with negligible head loss the convergence of flowlines toward the pipe perforations affects drain inflow dierickx 1999 a pipe with a greater subdivision of openings has less convergence of flowlines decreasing entrance head loss thereby increasing drain inflow for a given open area of a pipe drain inflow will be higher for the pipe with the greater subdivision of openings dierickx 1999 a greater subdivision of openings can be achieved by increasing the number of rows of perforations the 8 row and 4 row pipes had 496 and 232 number of perforations per meter table 2 respectively which shows that the 8 row pipe has a greater subdivision of openings than the 4 row pipe therefore the reason for the higher drain inflow of 8 row pipes is its greater subdivision of openings than 4 row pipes similar to the entrance head loss that is caused by water entering the pipe perforations exit head loss occurs when water is forced out of the perforated pipe design of conservation drainage practices are affected by entrance and exit head losses saturated buffers woodchip bioreactors and phosphorus removal structures are affected by entrance and exit head losses if the designer desires to treat a higher volume of water they should use a pipe that causes the least exit and entrance head losses in other words a pipe with a larger effective radius should be used to improve the performance of saturated buffers woodchip bioreactors and phosphorus removal structures 3 7 flowline pattern toward the drain pipes immediately after the flow rates and hydraulic heads were measured to calculate the effective radius of the sock wrapped pipe section 3 4 we detached the l shaped pvc pipe from the perforated pipe to allow free drainage we observed that only the bottom half of the sock wrapped pipe interior was wet this shows that water only entered the pipe from the bottom half of the perforations under free drainage we also used a cloth to verify that the top half of the pipe interior was fully dry to determine the pattern of the flowlines for the sock wrapped pipe under free drainage with a ponding condition we repeated the sand tank experiment for the sock wrapped pipe using a water finding paste to assure that water was entering the knitted sock from the top of the pipe we injected a blue dye under the sand surface see supplementary section s3 for water finding paste and dye experiment details after excavating the sand we found traces of the blue dye around the sock wrapped pipe proving that water entered the sock from all directions supplementary fig s6 after uncovering the knitted sock we found traces of water flowlines in the valleys moving from the top to the bottom perforations without entering the perforations on the top half of the pipe fig 8 water droplets passed through the knitted sock from the top of the pipe fell into the valleys and then flowed downward within the valleys toward the bottom half of the pipe perforations where water entered the pipe water droplets did not enter the pipe through the perforations on the top half of the pipe because of the strong adhesion of water to the plastic pipe in other words the force of adhesion between water and plastic was stronger than the force of gravity pulling the water droplets downward through the perforations on the top half of the pipe therefore water only entered the sock wrapped pipe through the perforations in the bottom half of the pipe under free drainage with a ponding condition we found only one study that had reported the flowline pattern toward a pipe wrapped with a geotextile envelope alavi et al 2021 the authors investigated the clogging feature of a 4 9 mm thick prewrapped loose geotextile envelope wrapped around a 10 cm diameter regular perforated pipe in a sand tank under free drainage with a ponding condition the authors presented a diagram showing flowlines entering the perforations on the top half and bottom half of the pipe which contradicts our finding however the authors did not verify that water was entering the pipe from the top half of the pipe perforation personal communication 2021 seyed abdollah alavi in our study we verified that water entered the pipe only through the perforations on the bottom half of the pipe immediately after the drain flow rate and hydraulic head readings were measured to calculate the effective radius of the 3 row sand slot pipe section 3 4 we detached the l shaped pvc pipe from the perforated pipe to allow free drainage we observed that water droplets were dripping from perforations in the top half of the pipe supplementary video the reason for this was likely the presence of soil within the valleys that helped water droplets overcome the force of adhesion between water and plastic thereby the force of gravity pulled the water droplets downward through the perforations on the top half of the pipe supplementary fig s7 therefore under free drainage with a ponding condition water entered the sand slot pipe from all directions the following is the supplementary material related to this article video 1 under typical field conditions with free drainage the water table above the drain quickly drops to the drain level and the water table midway between the lateral drains slowly lowers in other words under free drainage without ponding it is common that there is no water table above the pipe under these conditions the entrance and radial head loss of the top half of the pipe can be neglected because only the perforations in the bottom half of the pipe contribute to flow skaggs 1999 4 conclusions we conducted a sand tank experiment to comparatively evaluate the commonly manufactured knitted sock wrapped and sand slot pipes our study resulted in the following key conclusions the knitted sock envelope met the literature recommended hydraulic anti clogging and retention criteria for the sand used in our experiment the measured effective radius closely agreed with the theoretical effective radius for the sock wrapped and sand slot pipes this validated the theoretical equation developed by dierickx 1999 the sock wrapped pipe had a considerably lower entrance head loss 0 4 cm than the 8 row 6 1 cm and 4 row 10 4 cm sand slot pipes thereby increasing the effective radius of the sock wrapped pipe the entrance resistance factor for the sock wrapped pipe was so small 0 012 that the effective radius was approximately equal to its maximum value 5 5 cm which was the outer radius of the pipe 5 9 cm thus the 10 cm diameter sock wrapped pipe functioned almost as a completely open pipe without walls the drain inflow of the sock wrapped pipe was 12 and 20 higher than that of the 8 row and 4 row sand slot pipes respectively under free drainage with a ponding condition water only entered the sock wrapped pipe through the perforations in the bottom half of the pipe in conclusion a knitted sock envelope increases the effective radius of the pipe thereby increasing drain inflow compared to sand slot pipes the increased drain inflow of the sock wrapped pipe can be beneficial by removing water more quickly than sand slot pipes when installed at the same depth and spacing thereby reducing the risk of crop damage from waterlogging after heavy rainfall the value of this study is that it will

9231,a knitted sock geotextile envelope is commonly used in the usa canada and parts of europe to prevent sediment entry into agricultural subsurface drain pipes sand slot pipes have a narrow width to prevent sediment from moving into the drain pipe and they are used in the usa and canada as a cheaper alternative to knitted sock wrapped pipes the type of drain pipe sand slot or sock wrapped is important in subsurface drainage design because it affects the entrance head loss caused by the convergence of flowlines toward the drain perforations thereby influencing the effective radius of the pipe which in turn affects drain inflow although the theoretical effective radius of a knitted sock wrapped pipe can be estimated based on analytical equations no study has experimentally measured it to verify the theoretical equations this study had two objectives 1 experimentally measure the effective radius of sock wrapped and sand slot pipes to verify the theoretical method and 2 comparatively evaluate the drain inflow performance of a sock wrapped pipe and a sand slot pipe we tested the pipe materials in a sand tank experiment equipped with manometers the results showed that the measured and theoretical effective radii were 5 5 and 5 6 cm for the sock wrapped pipe 0 7 and 0 7 cm for the 4 row sand slot pipe and 1 6 and 1 6 cm for the 8 row sand slot pipe respectively this agreement confirmed that the theoretical method reliably estimated the effective radius of the pipes the sock wrapped pipe had a considerably lower entrance head loss 0 4 cm than the 8 row 6 1 cm and 4 row 10 4 cm sand slot pipes thereby increasing the effective radius of the sock wrapped pipe the estimated drain inflow of the sock wrapped pipe was 12 and 20 higher than that of the 8 row and 4 row sand slot pipes respectively in conclusion we verified that the theoretical method accurately estimated the effective radius of the pipes and demonstrated that the sock wrapped pipe had considerably higher drain inflow than the sand slot pipe keywords agricultural drainage drain envelope effective radius entrance resistance perforation sand slot pipe data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agricultural subsurface drainage systems remove excess water from the soil profile to provide proper conditions for crop production evans and fausey 1999 ghane et al 2016 they also provide improved soil strength for field operations mante et al 2018 these drainage systems are comprised of perforated lateral drain pipes to remove water these perforated drains are installed at a certain drain depth and spacing to achieve the design rate of water removal ghane et al 2021 ghane and askar 2021 drain spacing critically affects drainage system performance thus it is an important drainage design decision skaggs 2007 the hooghoudt 1940 steady state equation is commonly used to determine the drain spacing in humid regions ayars and evans 2015 to determine the drain spacing using the hooghoudt equation a parameter called effective radius is required which is the radius of an imaginary pipe without walls skaggs 1978 the effective radius accounts for the entrance head loss caused by the convergence of flowlines toward the drain perforations dierickx and van der molen 1981 the effective radius of a drain pipe depends on the perforation characteristics and the drain envelope dierickx 1999 dierickx and van der molen 1981 gaj and madramootoo 2020 stuyt and dierickx 2006 drain envelopes come in three types granular mineral organic and synthetic the synthetic envelopes have two types pre wrapped loose material and pre wrapped geotextile stuyt and dierickx 2006 there are three types of geotextile envelopes nonwoven woven and knitted geotextile envelopes are primarily used to prevent the entry of fine sand and silt into the drain thereby avoiding clogging of the drain pipe with sediment rollin et al 1987 geotextile envelopes also increase water flow into the drain pipe because they reduce the entrance head loss thereby increasing the effective radius of the drain oyarce et al 2017 stuyt et al 2005 if soil and drainage design depth and spacing remain the same increasing the effective radius of a pipe increases the drain inflow skaggs 1978 therefore the type of drain pipe with or without geotextile envelope is important in subsurface drainage design because it affects the effective radius of the pipe which in turn affects drain inflow previous studies have evaluated the hydraulic performance and clogging of nonwoven and woven geotextile envelopes khorramian et al 2022 2021 li et al 2022 markiewicz et al 2022 odabasi et al 2022 whereas less attention has been given to knitted sock envelopes the knitted geotextile envelope is the most used envelope for agricultural drainage in the usa and canada stuyt et al 2005 the theoretical effective radius of a knitted sock wrapped pipe has been estimated by ghane 2022 based on the analytical equations developed by dierickx 1999 however to our knowledge no study has experimentally measured the effective radius of drain pipes wrapped with a knitted sock envelope measuring the effective radius of a drain pipe is a resource intensive process that requires a sand tank experiment if the theoretical method is verified with experimentally measured data the theoretical method can be used to readily estimate the effective radius of any pipe diameter wrapped with a knitted sock envelope which then can be used to calculate drain spacing in subsurface drainage design therefore there is a need to experimentally measure the effective radius of a sock wrapped and sand slot pipes so that it can be used to verify the theoretical method drain inflow of a pipe is important in deciding which pipe to use in drainage design to our knowledge we found only one study that had compared the drain inflow performance of a knitted sock wrapped and sand slot pipes in a laboratory study in that study broughton et al 1987 measured considerably higher drain inflow in a knitted sock wrapped pipe compared to a sand slot pipe however the authors did not quantify the effective radius of the sock wrapped and sand slot pipes the increase in drain inflow of the sock wrapped pipe compared to the sand slot pipe depends on the effective radius of the pipe drainage design drain depth and spacing and soil properties therefore the value of quantifying the effective radius of the pipe is that it can be used to calculate drain inflow for any soil and drainage design conditions we conducted a sand tank experiment with two objectives 1 experimentally measure the effective radius of sock wrapped and sand slot pipes to verify the theoretical method and 2 comparatively evaluate the drain inflow performance of a sock wrapped pipe and a sand slot pipe the value of this study is that it will inform subsurface design decision about the suitability of knitted sock geotextile envelopes for increasing drain inflow 2 materials and methods 2 1 properties of the sand used in the sand tank experiment we determined the properties of the sand to verify the need for a drain envelope to keep sediments out of the pipe section 3 1 cation exchange capacity was determined at the soil plant and nutrient lab at michigan state university table 1 we used astm standard sieves to conduct dry sieving in triplicate we used a sieve shaker ro tap model rx 29 for 15 min with the following screen sizes 0 063 0 075 0 125 0 25 0 5 0 85 2 4 and 9 mm dry sieving results were used to plot the

type a circular knitted socks are commonly used for agricultural drainage in the usa and canada 2 4 sand tank experiment 2 4 1 sand tank construction a steel tank was constructed to withstand the combined pressure of the sand and water the sand tank measured 110 cm long 50 cm wide and 100 cm tall fig 3 a 10 cm diameter hole was made cut in the middle of the tank to insert the drain pipe horizontally supplementary fig s2 the sand tank was fitted with a 5 0 cm diameter overflow pipe to maintain a somewhat similar water level over the sand among the various pipe experiments a valve near the bottom of the tank was used to drain the water 2 4 2 hydraulic head measurement we used manometers to measure the hydraulic head fig 3 the manometers were constructed by inserting through wall straight connectors into a hole on the steel tank high pressure rigid plastic tubing was inserted into the through wall connectors to measure the hydraulic head 10 cm away from the wall we used a weather resistant rubber sealing washer on the inside and outside of the connectors to prevent leaks on the outside of the tank a soft clear vinyl tubing was inserted into the barbed side of the through wall connectors and mounted on the side of the tank where head measurements were read using a meter stick supplementary fig s3 the manometer m 0 was inserted from the outside of the tank into the bottom of the pipe to measure the hydraulic head inside the drain pipe fig 3 to measure the hydraulic head just outside of the pipe in the sand a manometer was installed at three positions in the pipe wall bottom b 1 right r 1 and top t 1 manometers r 2 to r 5 were installed at the same level as the drain center and spaced horizontally on the right side at 10 21 32 and 43 cm from the center of the 10 cm diameter drain pipe respectively manometers b 3 and b 4 were installed at the bottom 21 and 32 cm from the center of the drain pipe respectively manometers t 3 and t 4 were installed on the top 21 and 32 cm from the center of the drain pipe respectively manometer t 5 was installed above the sand surface in the water to measure the hydraulic head at the source hydraulic head is equal to elevation head plus pressure head in our experiment the reference elevation i e fixed datum was 5 3 cm below the invert of the pipe 2 4 3 drain configuration the drain was configured according to the method outlined in mohammad and skaggs 1983 briefly the 10 cm diameter pipes were inserted into the 10 cm diameter hole in the tank at 0 slope the opposite end of the drain which was inside the sand tank was sealed with waterproof tape the other end of the drain was open to convey water out of the sand tank fig 3 outside of the tank the perforated pipe was connected to an l shaped pvc pipe using a rubber coupler to create a submerged outlet condition for measuring the hydraulic heads the l shaped pvc pipe was designed to be detached from the perforated pipe to allow free drainage for assessing the pattern of flowlines toward the sock wrapped pipe supplementary fig s4 section 3 7 2 4 4 filling and saturating the tank before filling the tank the l shaped pvc pipe was connected to the perforated outlet pipe to prevent water from leaving the pipe during the saturation process the tank was filled with sand in 5 cm layer increments after the addition of each sand layer we gradually saturated the layer by adding water from the bottom until water reached the surface of the sand layer then we added another sand layer followed by another incremental and gradual rise of the water table we repeated this process over course of two days to fill the tank and allow air bubbles to escape 2 4 5 simulating drain flow after filling and saturating the tank municipal water was conveyed to the top of the sand tank via a hose and was spread on the sand surface through a perforated pvc manifold supplementary fig s5 subsequently the hole on the outflow pvc pipe was opened to allow water to flow out of the pipe under submerged condition flow through the pvc manifold was adjusted to create a ponding condition over the sand bypass water flowed out through the overflow pipe we simulated flow for 24 h before recording the flow rate and hydraulic head measurements to ensure that the system had reached a steady state condition we measured the flow rate by measuring the time required to fill a volume of water in a beaker in duplicate then the average flow rate was used as the measured drain flow rate 2 5 measuring the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil surrounding the pipe k s after the sand tank experiment was completed a well mixed sand sample was extracted to measure the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil surrounding the pipe based on the constant head method astm d 2434 19 2019 we used a 76 mm 3 in astm standard constant head permeameter gilson company inc fig 4 see supplementary section s1 for experiment details when flow through soil is laminar darcy s law can be written as 1 q k s i where q is specific discharge cm h k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil surrounding the pipe cm h and i is hydraulic gradient that is the ratio of head loss h to length over which head loss has occurred l 7 3 cm specific discharge is the flow rate divided by the cross sectional area of the soil cylinder a plot of specific discharge versus hydraulic gradient was created for the series of measurements the permeameter experiment was repeated two additional times by repacking well mixed sand samples to obtain three k s values the three experiments were conducted at water temperatures ranging from 17 c to 20 c for each experiment the hydraulic conductivity was converted to that of 18 c by multiplying the measured k s by the ratio of dynamic viscosity of water at the test temperature to dynamic viscosity of water at 18 c astm d 2434 19 2019 the average k s of the three experiments was used to represent the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil surrounding the pipe at 18 c 2 6 criteria for evaluating the suitability the knitted sock envelope we evaluated three literature recommended criteria to determine the suitability of the knitted sock envelope to prevent drain sedimentation this section describes these criteria 2 6 1 hydraulic criterion the purpose of the hydraulic criterion is to ensure that the hydraulic conductivity of the knitted sock envelope will not restrict water entry into the pipe the hydraulic criterion requires that the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the envelope is much greater than that of the soil surrounding the pipe vlotman et al 2020 the recommended hydraulic criterion is written as 2 k ks k s 10 where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil surrounding the pipe cm h and k ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the knitted sock envelope cm h 2 6 2 anti clogging criterion the purpose of the anti clogging criterion is to prevent sediment from clogging the openings of the knitted sock envelope dierickx 1987 if drain envelopes do not meet the anti clogging criterion because of excessively small openings they would prevent clay particles from moving through the envelope thereby creating a filter cake stuyt and dierickx 2006 a filter cake is the accumulation of fine clay particles at the envelope soil interface which creates a barrier for water entry into the drain pipe a filter cake has a much lower saturated hydraulic conductivity than the original soil surrounding the drain we used the anti clogging criterion originally developed by dierickx 1993 and recommended by stuyt and dierickx 2006 the recommended anti clogging criterion is written as 3 o 90 0 20 mm where o 90 is the envelope pore size for which 90 of pores are smaller 2 6 3 retention criterion the purpose of the retention criterion also known as filter criterion or bridging criterion is to retain the soil in place at the soil envelope interface so that soil does not move into the drain pipe even though some clay particles go through the envelope vlotman et al 2020 we used the retention criterion originally developed by dierickx 1993 and recommended by stuyt and dierickx 2006 for thin geotextile envelopes less than 1 mm thick the recommended retention criterion is written as 4 1 o 90 d 90 2 5 where d 90 is the diameter for which 90 of soil particles are finer 2 7 parameter calculations 2 7 1 theoretical effective radius of a drain pipe with an envelope r ef the effective radius of the drain is the radius of an imaginary drain pipe with a completely open wall ghane 2022 found that perforation area is not a good predictor of effective radius two pipes with equal perforation area can have different effective radii because effective radius depends on perforation shape and pattern dierickx 1999 therefore it is important to use the analytical equations developed by dierickx 1999 to estimate effective radius that accounts for perforation shape and pattern dierickx 1999 derived a theoretical analytical equation to calculate the effective radius of a sock wrapped pipe in units of centimeter which is written as 5 r ef r o k s k ks r o d ks k s k ks 1 exp 2 π k s α e k ks where ro is the outer radius of pipe cm ri is the inner radius of pipe cm k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil surrounding the pipe cm h k ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the knitted sock envelope cm h d ks is the thickness of the knitted sock envelope cm and α e is the theoretical entrance resistance factor of a drain pipe dimensionless 2 7 2 theoretical effective radius of a drain pipe without an envelope r ef the theoretical effective radius of a drain pipe without an envelope is calculated as dierickx 1999 6 r ef r 0 exp 2 π α e where r 0 is the outer radius of the drain pipe cm and α e is the theoretical entrance resistance factor of a drain pipe dimensionless 2 7 3 theoretical entrance resistance factor of a drain pipe α e the dimensionless entrance resistance factor α e is calculated using the theoretical equation developed by dierickx 1999 the theoretical analytical equation for a corrugated drain pipe is written as 7 α e c 2 π 2 r o ln 2 c π β v c 4 π r o c 2 π n λ p ln 2 sinh 2 π r o r i β v sin 2 π β s 2 β v 1 2 π ln r o r i where r o is the outer radius of pipe cm r i is the inner radius of pipe cm c is the perforation spacing cm n is the number of longitudinal rows of perforation β s is the perforation width cm β v is the valley width cm and λ p is the perforation length cm the drain material with the smallest entrance resistance factor will have the largest effective radius 2 7 4 measured water entrance resistance w e we calculated the water entrance resistance for the drain pipe with and without an envelope w e from the entrance head loss h e head loss occurs when water moves from midway between the drains to the inside of the drain total head loss h t was calculated according to dierickx 1999 8 h t h v h h h r h e where h v is the vertical head loss h h is the horizontal head loss h r is the radial head loss and h e is the entrance head loss the vertical head loss is assumed to be negligible due to the short vertical path of water skaggs 1980 the other three head losses horizontal radial and entrance are important in drainage theory and modeling the convergences of flowlines toward the pipe perforations causes entrance head loss which depends on the soil and drain perforation characteristics in our experiment entrance head loss h e was calculated as dierickx 1999 vlotman et al 2020 9 h e h t 1 h m 0 where h t 1 is the hydraulic head of manometer t 1 that is on the top of the pipe wall in the sand cm and h m 0 is the hydraulic head of manometer m 0 that is inside the pipe cm the hydraulic head of manometer t 1 top of the pipe wall was used to represent the hydraulic head outside of the pipe the h t 1 includes radial head loss of flowlines moving from the soil surface to the outside of the pipe the water entrance resistance w e was calculated as dierickx 1993 10 w e h e q l where h e is the measured entrance head loss cm w e is the water entrance resistance day cm and q l is the measured flow rate per unit length of the drain pipe cm2 day we calculated q l as 11 q l q l p where l p is the length of the pipe with open perforations cm and q is the measured drain flow rate cm3 day 2 7 5 measured entrance resistance factor α e the dimensionless entrance resistance factor for the drain pipe α e is calculated as dierickx 1999 12 α e 24 k s w e where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil surrounding the pipe cm h w e is the water entrance resistance of the drain pipe day cm 2 7 6 measured effective radius of a drain pipe with or without an envelope r ef we calculated the measured effective radius of the drain pipe with or without an envelope as dierickx 1999 13 r ef r 0 exp 2 π α e where r ef is the measured effective radius of the drain pipe cm r 0 is the outer radius of the drain pipe cm and α e is the measured entrance resistance factor dimensionless 2 8 estimating the drain inflow of the pipes in the sand tank experiment ponding depth over the sand varied slightly among each experiment depending on the flow rate of the municipal tap water this was because water level over the sand was allowed to vary within the diameter of the overflow pipe also height of sand over the pipe varied slightly from one experiment to another consequently the drain flow rates q were measured under varying hydraulic heads at manometer t 5 i e varying ponding depths therefore we cannot compare the q l values of different pipes to evaluate their drain inflow performance because a higher ponding depth would result in a higher q l consequently q l was not a suitable measure for evaluating the drain inflow performance we conducted a three step analysis to evaluate the drain inflow performance of the three pipes step 1 we calculated the drainage intensity as defined by skaggs 2017 drainage intensity is the rate of water removal when the water table midway between the lateral drain pipes is at the soil surface the drainage intensity can be written as ghane et al 2021 14 di 24 8 k e d e d d 4 k e d d 2 s 2 where di is the drainage intensity cm day s is the drain spacing cm k e is the equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile cm h d d is the drain depth cm and d e is the equivalent depth cm the equivalent depth accounts for radial head loss due to convergence of flowlines toward the drain pipe skaggs 1991 we used the equivalent depth equation developed by van der molen and wesseling 1991 this equation is written as 15 d e π s 8 ln s π r ef f x where r ef is the effective radius of the drain pipe cm when x 0 5 f x can be approximated by 16 f x π 2 4 x ln x 2 π where x 2 π d s and d is the distance from the drain center to the restrictive layer cm for the drainage intensity calculation we assumed similar drain spacing of 1500 cm drain depth of 75 cm and depth to restrictive layer of 200 cm for each of the three pipes for each pipe we calculated drainage intensity for a wide range of soils with saturated hydraulic conductivities from 1 to 6 cm h step 2 we estimated drain inflow per unit length of the lateral drain as huffman et al 2013 17 q d di a d where q d is the estimated drain inflow per unit length of the lateral drain pipe cm2 day and a d is the area drained by one lateral drain pipe with a unit length cm2 cm the a d is calculated as the multiplication of drain spacing s by unit length of the lateral drain 100 cm step 3 we compared the estimated drain inflow per unit length of each drain pipe sock wrapped 4 row sand slot and 8 row sand slot assuming all soil and drainage conditions were identical except for the drain pipe material the only difference between the pipes was the r ef which is unique to the drain pipe material 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification that the drain envelope was necessary we used the envelope need flowchart developed by vlotman et al 2000 to verify that the drain envelope was necessary the first assessment evaluated percent clay content and we determined that our soil had 2 6 clay content soil with less than 30 clay content requires assessment of the plasticity index so we evaluated the plasticity index of our soil when plasticity index is greater than 12 an envelope is not needed however the plasticity index of our soil indicated that it was non plastic which means it had poor stability i e soil particles do not stick together and required an envelope to prevent sediment from entering the drain pipe therefore the sand used in our sand tank experiment required the use of a knitted sock envelope to keep sediment out of the drain pipe the envelope need flowchart developed by vlotman et al 2000 has been incorporated into a user friendly online decision support tool entitled drain sedimentation tool available at https www egr msu edu bae water drainage drainage design tools this tool requires drainage intensity drain spacing cation exchange capacity bulk density and percent sand silt and clay to determine if sedimentation of the drain pipe is a problem 3 2 saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil surrounding the pipe the results of the three constant head permeability experiments showed that the relationship between specific discharge and hydraulic gradient followed the laminar darcian law for the range of hydraulic gradients from 0 04 to 0 38 fig 5 experiment 1 resulted in k s of 41 9 cm h at 18 c experiment 2 resulted in k s of 43 3 cm h at 18 c and experiment 3 resulted in k s of 41 1 cm h at 18 c the average k s of the three experiments was 42 1 cm h at 18 c 3 3 suitability of the knitted sock envelope to prevent drain sedimentation 3 3 1 hydraulic criterion the result of the hydraulic criterion showed that the carriff knitted sock envelope had a ratio of k ks k s 1404 42 1 33 3 thus the hydraulic criterion of the knitted sock envelope was met because the ratio was greater than 10 this means that the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the knitted sock envelope was much greater than that of the sand surrounding the drain and it did not restrict water entry into the pipe 3 3 2 anti clogging criterion the carriff knitted sock envelope had a maximum filtration opening size o 95 of 0 45 mm based on the ratio of o95 o90 1 2 vlotman et al 2000 o 95 0 45 mm translates to o 90 0 38 mm consequently the anti clogging criterion of o 90 0 20 mm was satisfied this means that the knitted sock envelope had large enough openings to allow passage of fine clay particles and avoid clogging the sock openings in our 24 hour sand tank experiment we only observed clay particles wash out in the drain inflow during the first few hours of flow rollin et al 1987 found no evidence of sediment clogging the thin knitted sock openings after 3 years of draining of a silty clay loam soil in canada broughton et al 1987 found no evidence of knitted sock clogging in a wide range of soils from fine sand to silt loam in a sand tank experiment in civil engineering corrugated perforated drain pipes can be wrapped with a knitted sock geotextile to drain water from the downstream toe of dams swihart 2000 studied toe drains and did not find any evidence of a knitted sock envelope clogging with a sand gravelly soil in a laboratory experiment if knitted sock envelopes are properly installed in a soil with a drain sedimentation problem i e non cohesive or weakly cohesive soil their openings are not expected to clog stuyt et al 2005 chemical clogging of geotextile envelopes i e iron ochre calcium carbonate lime and gypsum can be a problem so those should be investigated prior to drain pipe installation guo et al 2021 2020 we recommend long term field investigations of the knitted sock envelope clogging with various soil types to better inform their applications in drainage design 3 3 3 retention criterion the carriff sock thickness less than 1 mm had a maximum o 90 of 0 38 mm for the known o 90 0 38 mm and the d 90 1 43 mm the ratio of o 90 d 90 0 3 which meets the retention criterion 1 o 90 d 90 2 5 the lower limit of the retention criterion is to minimize the risk for mineral clogging stuyt and dierickx 2006 generally knitted sock envelopes are used in non cohesive and weakly cohesive soil sand loamy sand sandy loam silt and silt loam in our sand tank experiment the knitted sock and sand slot pipes were able to retain the sand and prevent it from moving into the drain based on visual observations broughton et al 1987 compared sock wrapped and sand slot pipes in a wide range of soils medium fine sand fine sandy loam very fine sandy loam and silt loam the authors found that even though some sediment entered both sock wrapped and sand slot pipes both pipes provided adequate protection against sediment clogging of the pipe however the authors found that the sock wrapped pipe consistently kept more sediment out of the pipe than the sand slot pipe in each of the tested soils 3 4 verifying the theoretical effective radius we simulated flow for 24 h to reach a steady state condition after which we measured the drain flow rate and hydraulic head of the manometers supplementary section s2 then we calculated the entrance resistance factor and effective radius of the pipe table 4 the theoretical α e of the sock wrapped 3 row regular perforated drain pipe depends on the k s thus we used k s of 42 1 cm h at 18 c to calculate the theoretical α e of the sock wrapped pipe section 3 2 we chose 18 c because the drain inflow temperature for the two sand slot pipes and sock wrapped pipe ranged from 17 5 c to 18 0 c for the experiments of the three pipes comparison of the measured and theoretical effective radius shows that the values are in close agreement and the minor differences can be explained by experimental error therefore our results verify the theoretical method presented by dierickx 1999 for estimating the effective radius of both sand slot and sock wrapped pipes previous studies measured the entrance resistance factor of perforated pipes gaj and madramootoo 2020 and prewrapped loose synthetic envelopes wesseling and homma 1967 sekendar 1984 measured an effective radius of 2 5 cm after wrapping a 5 cm diameter 8 row perforation pvc pipe with synthetic fiber envelope rimidis and dierickx 2004 found that a nonwoven geotextile envelope reduced entrance head loss in a field experiment in lithuania but they did not quantify the effective radius of the nonwoven geotextile wrapped pipe to our knowledge our study is the first to experimentally measure the effective radius of the commonly manufactured sock wrapped pipe 3 5 effective radius of the drain pipes the results showed that the measured entrance head loss of the sock wrapped pipe was only 0 4 cm whereas that of the 8 row sand slot pipe was 6 1 cm and that of the 4 row sand slot pipe was 10 4 cm table 4 the higher entrance head loss of the 4 row and 8 row sand slot pipes resulted in a greater measured entrance resistance factor than that of the sock wrapped pipe consequently the sock wrapped pipe had the largest measured effective radius 5 5 cm followed by the 8 row sand slot pipe 1 6 cm and the 4 row sand slot pipe 0 7 cm therefore the knitted sock envelope had a considerably lower entrance head loss than the sand slot pipe thereby increasing the effective radius of the pipe in drain pipes without a knitted sock envelope entrance head loss occurs due to the convergence of flowlines toward the pipe perforations fig 6 wrapping a knitted sock envelope around a regular perforated drain considerably reduces the convergence of flowlines toward the drain perforations so that entrance resistance factor becomes negligible skaggs 1978 the very small entrance head loss of the sock wrapped pipe 0 4 cm showed that the knitted sock envelope reduced the entrance resistance factor to near zero i e 0 012 as a result the effective radius of the sock wrapped pipe 5 5 cm was close to its maximum value which was the outer radius of the drain pipe 5 9 cm other studies reported a negligible entrance resistance factor for prewrapped loose woven and nonwoven envelopes in an early study bravo and schwab 1977 investigated the effect of perforations on flow into corrugated drains based on an electric analog model the authors postulated that corrugated drain pipes wrapped with a porous covering such as a nylon mesh could represent a completely open drain later sekendar 1984 measured an effective radius of 2 5 cm for an 8 row pvc pipe with 2 5 cm radius wrapped with synthetic fiber in a sand tank experiment which indicated that their synthetic wrapped pipe functioned as a completely open pipe without walls wesseling and homma 1967 also measured negligible entrance resistance factor of 0 020 i e resulting in the maximum effective radius for a prewrapped loose synthetic envelope to our knowledge our study is the first to experimentally show that the effective radius of a sock wrapped pipe is approximately equal to the outer radius of the drain thereby functioning almost as a completely open pipe without walls 3 6 drain inflow performance of the pipes the results showed that the estimated drain inflow of the sock wrapped pipe was higher than that of the 8 row and 4 row sand slot pipes fig 7 the drain inflow per unit length of the sock wrapped pipe increased by 132 cm2 day and 199 cm2 day compared to the 8 row and 4 row sand slot pipes respectively at saturated hydraulic conductivity of 1 0 cm h the differences in the drain inflows per unit length of the drain pipes increased as the saturated hydraulic conductivity increased from 1 0 to 6 0 cm h however the percent increase in drain inflow remained constant across a wide range of the soils overall drain inflow of the sock wrapped pipe was 12 and 20 higher than that of the 8 row and 4 row sand slot pipes respectively although we calculated the drain inflow for an assumed drain spacing and depth the trend of higher drain inflow for the sock wrapped pipe than the sand slot pipe will remain the same for other combinations of drain depth and spacing broughton et al 1987 also measured considerably higher drain inflow in a knitted sock wrapped pipe compared to a sand slot pipe in a laboratory experiment but they did not quantify the effective radius of either pipe the reason that the sock wrapped pipe had the highest drain inflow is because wrapping a knitted sock envelope around a pipe considerably reduces the convergence of flowlines toward the pipe perforations thereby reducing entrance head loss to near zero in other words flowlines will not be concentrated toward the sock wrapped pipe perforations fig 6 instead flowlines will move parallel to each other toward the sock wrapped pipe thereby considerably reducing entrance head loss to near zero once water passes through the knitted sock envelope it moves toward the perforations with negligible head loss the convergence of flowlines toward the pipe perforations affects drain inflow dierickx 1999 a pipe with a greater subdivision of openings has less convergence of flowlines decreasing entrance head loss thereby increasing drain inflow for a given open area of a pipe drain inflow will be higher for the pipe with the greater subdivision of openings dierickx 1999 a greater subdivision of openings can be achieved by increasing the number of rows of perforations the 8 row and 4 row pipes had 496 and 232 number of perforations per meter table 2 respectively which shows that the 8 row pipe has a greater subdivision of openings than the 4 row pipe therefore the reason for the higher drain inflow of 8 row pipes is its greater subdivision of openings than 4 row pipes similar to the entrance head loss that is caused by water entering the pipe perforations exit head loss occurs when water is forced out of the perforated pipe design of conservation drainage practices are affected by entrance and exit head losses saturated buffers woodchip bioreactors and phosphorus removal structures are affected by entrance and exit head losses if the designer desires to treat a higher volume of water they should use a pipe that causes the least exit and entrance head losses in other words a pipe with a larger effective radius should be used to improve the performance of saturated buffers woodchip bioreactors and phosphorus removal structures 3 7 flowline pattern toward the drain pipes immediately after the flow rates and hydraulic heads were measured to calculate the effective radius of the sock wrapped pipe section 3 4 we detached the l shaped pvc pipe from the perforated pipe to allow free drainage we observed that only the bottom half of the sock wrapped pipe interior was wet this shows that water only entered the pipe from the bottom half of the perforations under free drainage we also used a cloth to verify that the top half of the pipe interior was fully dry to determine the pattern of the flowlines for the sock wrapped pipe under free drainage with a ponding condition we repeated the sand tank experiment for the sock wrapped pipe using a water finding paste to assure that water was entering the knitted sock from the top of the pipe we injected a blue dye under the sand surface see supplementary section s3 for water finding paste and dye experiment details after excavating the sand we found traces of the blue dye around the sock wrapped pipe proving that water entered the sock from all directions supplementary fig s6 after uncovering the knitted sock we found traces of water flowlines in the valleys moving from the top to the bottom perforations without entering the perforations on the top half of the pipe fig 8 water droplets passed through the knitted sock from the top of the pipe fell into the valleys and then flowed downward within the valleys toward the bottom half of the pipe perforations where water entered the pipe water droplets did not enter the pipe through the perforations on the top half of the pipe because of the strong adhesion of water to the plastic pipe in other words the force of adhesion between water and plastic was stronger than the force of gravity pulling the water droplets downward through the perforations on the top half of the pipe therefore water only entered the sock wrapped pipe through the perforations in the bottom half of the pipe under free drainage with a ponding condition we found only one study that had reported the flowline pattern toward a pipe wrapped with a geotextile envelope alavi et al 2021 the authors investigated the clogging feature of a 4 9 mm thick prewrapped loose geotextile envelope wrapped around a 10 cm diameter regular perforated pipe in a sand tank under free drainage with a ponding condition the authors presented a diagram showing flowlines entering the perforations on the top half and bottom half of the pipe which contradicts our finding however the authors did not verify that water was entering the pipe from the top half of the pipe perforation personal communication 2021 seyed abdollah alavi in our study we verified that water entered the pipe only through the perforations on the bottom half of the pipe immediately after the drain flow rate and hydraulic head readings were measured to calculate the effective radius of the 3 row sand slot pipe section 3 4 we detached the l shaped pvc pipe from the perforated pipe to allow free drainage we observed that water droplets were dripping from perforations in the top half of the pipe supplementary video the reason for this was likely the presence of soil within the valleys that helped water droplets overcome the force of adhesion between water and plastic thereby the force of gravity pulled the water droplets downward through the perforations on the top half of the pipe supplementary fig s7 therefore under free drainage with a ponding condition water entered the sand slot pipe from all directions the following is the supplementary material related to this article video 1 under typical field conditions with free drainage the water table above the drain quickly drops to the drain level and the water table midway between the lateral drains slowly lowers in other words under free drainage without ponding it is common that there is no water table above the pipe under these conditions the entrance and radial head loss of the top half of the pipe can be neglected because only the perforations in the bottom half of the pipe contribute to flow skaggs 1999 4 conclusions we conducted a sand tank experiment to comparatively evaluate the commonly manufactured knitted sock wrapped and sand slot pipes our study resulted in the following key conclusions the knitted sock envelope met the literature recommended hydraulic anti clogging and retention criteria for the sand used in our experiment the measured effective radius closely agreed with the theoretical effective radius for the sock wrapped and sand slot pipes this validated the theoretical equation developed by dierickx 1999 the sock wrapped pipe had a considerably lower entrance head loss 0 4 cm than the 8 row 6 1 cm and 4 row 10 4 cm sand slot pipes thereby increasing the effective radius of the sock wrapped pipe the entrance resistance factor for the sock wrapped pipe was so small 0 012 that the effective radius was approximately equal to its maximum value 5 5 cm which was the outer radius of the pipe 5 9 cm thus the 10 cm diameter sock wrapped pipe functioned almost as a completely open pipe without walls the drain inflow of the sock wrapped pipe was 12 and 20 higher than that of the 8 row and 4 row sand slot pipes respectively under free drainage with a ponding condition water only entered the sock wrapped pipe through the perforations in the bottom half of the pipe in conclusion a knitted sock envelope increases the effective radius of the pipe thereby increasing drain inflow compared to sand slot pipes the increased drain inflow of the sock wrapped pipe can be beneficial by removing water more quickly than sand slot pipes when installed at the same depth and spacing thereby reducing the risk of crop damage from waterlogging after heavy rainfall the value of this study is that it will

optimized regulated deficit irrigation for limited volumes of water ordil methodology may contribute to reach this objective by optimizing the allocation of irrigation water during the growing cycle when the available volume is lower than the crop irrigation requirements ordil was applied to a barley crop in a 3 year 2015 2017 field test under the semiarid conditions of albacete spain the main

to reach a certain deficit for the whole growing period domínguez et al 2012a or when the amount of available irrigation water is lower than the requirements of the crop ordil leite et al 2015b these methodologies were developed for the mopeco model ortega et al 2004 that was conceived for optimizing the gross margin gm of irrigated farms located in water scarce areas this model has been calibrated for the main extensive annual crops in castilla la mancha and others in different areas of the world carvalho et al 2014 domínguez et al 2012a 2012b 2012c leite et al 2015a léllis et al 2017 lópez urrea et al 2020 martínez romero et al 2019 the analysis of functional traits can be used to address for the integrity goodness and or limitations of irrigation techniques under water limitation allowing the improvement of water use productivity and efficiency of irrigation costa et al 2007 montoro et al 2016 the interplay of different mechanisms of plant functioning functional traits ultimately determines overall performance of plants in terms of growth and crop yield thus understanding the physiological responses to water availability can help to understand plant sensitivity to deficit irrigation álvarez et al 2013 parkash et al 2021 this sensitivity will depend on the duration and intensity of the water deficit siopongco et al 2006 xu et al 2010 xu and zhou 2007 but also on the phenological stage in which the deficit is applied boonjung and fukai 1996 garcía tejero et al 2010 geerts and raes 2009 hence by an ecophysiological approach crop management and irrigation scheduling can be improved de oliveira et al 2021 jones 2004 2018 in this sense ordi methodology has already been evaluated in other herbaceous crops in terms of functional performance being demonstrated that under water limitation it is possible and advisable to save water in some crop stages to use it in specific crop phases which have greater impact on yield performance sánchez virosta et al 2020 this approach reveals the underlying mechanisms of the plant in response to water availability at different crop stages however this ecophysiological assessment in relation to a deficit irrigation strategy has not been yet analyzed in barley spain is the first country in area 24 and third in production 14 of barley in europe anon 2020 clm region is the second largest barley producer in spain with about 40 of the total mapa 2021 in this region where farmers have limited irrigation water varies between 2000 and 4500 m3 ha 1 anon 2019 barley plays an important role in crop rotation due to its low irrigation needs 2500 m3 ha 1 pardo et al 2020 compared to other crops of higher profitability in the area such as onion maize or alfalfa 5800 6500 and 7500 m3 ha 1 respectively since it is a crop with one of the lowest water profitability in this region 0 10 m 3 domínguez et al 2017 farmers are demanding deficit irrigation techniques to save irrigation water in barley to use for other more profitable crops on their farms in this sense by following the ordil methodology pardo et al 2020 have shown that with a volume of irrigation water lower than the crop needs water use efficiency and economic water productivity can be greatly increased 48 on average obtaining high yields with malting quality price of grain increases 15 on average anon 2017 however the underlying functional mechanisms of this performance are unknown thus the main aim was to assess the influence of ordil on the physiological response of barley the specific objectives were 1 identify if stomatal conductance gs net assimilation rate an intrinsic water use efficiency wuei and total dry matter tdm evolution can be used as early and sensitive indicators of barley water status and crop performance 2 provide a mechanistic basis to understand barley physiological response to deficit irrigation at the most sensitive stages and 3 evaluate barley physiological response to ordil and its relation with yield 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the climate of the experimental area is characterized as semi arid the average annual precipitation is approximately 400 mm year 1 occurring mainly in spring and autumn and the reference evapotranspiration values can exceed 1 100 mm year 1 domínguez and de juan 2008 the soil of the experimental plots is classified as calcixerrollic petrocalcic xerochrepts usda ncrs 2006 it has clay loam texture in the upper 50 cm of the soil profile the effective depth of the root 40 cm is limited by the development of petrocalcic horizons which are partially fragmented camargo 2013 the soil of the plots had a very basic ph 8 5 and slightly saline characteristics electrical conductivity of saturated soil extract 0 81 ds m 1 the organic matter content is within the normal range 2 4 but it decreases with depth fertilization was applied following the basic extraction rates of barley bellido 1991 2 2 experimental design three field trials were conducted during the seasons 2015 2016 and 2017 in centro integral de formación profesional de aguas nuevas albacete spain situated in utm x 595368 y4311310 at 695 m a s l shakira barley cultivar was sown with a density of 210 kg ha 1 in 2015 2016 and 2017 seasons january 12th 13th and 13th respectively five irrigation treatments with four randomly distributed repetitions were applied one without deficit nd and the other four with different irrigation water volumes corresponding to 100 t100 90 t90 80 t80 and 70 t70 of net irrigation needs of barley for intermediate weather conditions of a typical meteorological year tmy established in 2500 m3 ha 1 t100 pardo et al 2020 in the case of nd and t100 there were three plots instead of four both treatments were the same treatment up to the amount of water assigned to t100 was depleted table 2 so the differences could presumably occur in the last crop stage ripening in the case of t90 t80 and t70 the allocation of the amount of available irrigation water was optimized by using ordil pardo et al 2020 2022 a drip irrigation system 0 5 m between pipes and emitters with self compensating emitters 3 8 l h 1 was used during the three seasons the quality of irrigation water in the area is suitable for irrigation ph 7 66 electrical conductivity 0 85 ds m 1 total salt content 0 6 mg l 1 organic matter content 0 93 mg l 1 the climatic data table 1 were collected from the weather station albacete placed in the experimental farm which belongs to the national network of the agroclimatic information system for irrigation managed by the mapama https eportal mapa gob es websiar inicio aspx 2 3 optimized regulated deficit irrigation for limited volumes of irrigation water during the field trials daily irrigation scheduling was performed by using the simplified water balance methodology in the root zone allen et al 1998 which is the one used by mopeco domínguez et al 2011 a more detailed description can be found in pardo et al 2020 to determine the irrigation scheduling of each treatment at each crop stage the ordil methodology for limited volumes of available irrigation water was used leite et al 2015b this methodology determines the deficit target in terms of the ratio between actual and maximum evapotranspiration eta etm at each crop yield response ky stage in the case of barley these stages are divided in establishment ky i vegetative development ky i flowering ky ii yield formation ky iii and ripening ky iv based on these crop yield response stages the amount of irrigation water is assigned to be applied at each stage during the real management of the crop the eta etm ratios proposed by the methodology must be updated in order to fit the real climatic conditions with the irrigation water available in the case of nd there is not a deficit target and the ratio eta etm is most of the time maintained in 1 0 a more complete explanation of this methodology and its application in this experiment can be found in pardo et al 2020 2 4 physiological and growth parameters monitoring data of physiological traits were collected from two plots of each treatment in two representative plants of the central part of each plot measurements of net assimilation rates an and stomatal conductance gs were done under clear sky conditions on the third youngest and fully developed leaf without deformities or diseases stomatal conductance gs was measured at natural incident photosynthetic flux density ppfd between 10 00 a m and 2 00 p m with a dynamic diffusion type porometer ap4 leaf porometer delta t devices ltd cambridge uk with a measuring interval between 5 and 1200 mmol m² s 1 depending on the climatic conditions gs was measured with a frequency of 7 14 days throughout the three seasons and covering at least the flowering and yield formation stages net assimilation rate an values were recorded by a portable photosynthesis system for gas exchange measurements li6400 tx model li cor bioscience ne usa the parameters of the leaf chamber for data collection were determined according to the characteristics of the test area 390 μmol mol 1 for co2 atmospheric concentration 25 0 5 c for air temperature 70 5 for air relative humidity a flow rate of 650 μmol s 1 of air and a ppfd of 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 readings of an were made for each treatment at least once in every stage of 2016 and 2017 seasons concurrent with the an measurement gs values were recorded and the intrinsic water use efficiency wuei was calculated for each plant as the ratio of leaf assimilation rate an to leaf stomatal conductance gs in addition to physiological measurements samples of plant material were taken every 15 days to monitor total dry matter tdm evolution in two plots of each treatment biomass samples were collected from a 0 5 0 5 m area located in the central part of the plot biomass sampling was initiated from the beginning of tillering the last sampling was at harvest 2 5 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova with three factors irrigation treatment stage and year was carried out to evaluate the effect of these factors on an gs wuei and tdm while stage and year were the factors analyzed on climatic variables afterwards a post hoc analysis fisher lsd was performed to identify homogeneous groups within each factor or combination of significant factors analyzed pearson s and logarithmic correlations were computed to explore the relationship between physiological variables and final yield the software statistica v 10 statsoft inc tulsa ok usa was used for data analysis and statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 total dry matter responses to irrigation treatments and climatic conditions water deficit can influence on barley phenology mcmaster and wilhelm 2003 and total dry matter content tdm accumulation across the crop cycle goyne et al 1993 in our study phenological differences among treatments were not found fig 1 with all the treatments following a regular growth pattern similar to those found in other studies calera et al 2004 goyne et al 1993 at the end of the crop cycle the greater irrigated treatments accumulated higher biomass these differences on tdm were not statistically shown until the middle of ky ii or as in the case of 2017 season until the last stage this can be because at later growth stages of barley and under mediterranean conditions higher temperatures can exacerbate the water stress impact on tdm accumulation due to higher evaporative demand dreccer et al 2018 mcmaster and wilhelm 2003 which can increase the differences among treatments in this sense ordil distributed the highest amount of irrigation matching with the highest relative growth rate see ky ii and ky iii in figs 1 and 2 this distribution aimed to optimize water use reducing the interaction between water deficit and high temperatures until maturation is reached and biomass gain is completed besides water availability other environmental factors can directly influence on barley dry matter accumulation calera et al 2004 for example a lower tdm on 2016 was found especially compared with 2015 season in all treatments fig 1 since there were not important differences of the irrigation treatments among seasons fig 2 these differences can be explained by the significantly lower mean temperature observed during vegetative development in 2016 see ky i in table 1 high sensitivity to below threshold temperature at this stage has already been observed sadras and dreccer 2015 which can induce low temperature injuries in barley triggering growth declines muñoz amatriaín et al 2020 as that observed in this study in 2016 in summary biomass monitoring was a valuable tool to describe growth patterns under different climatic conditions yet as shown here it was difficult to predict water stress with tdm data until latter stages 3 2 stomatal conductance gs sensitivity to deficit irrigation stomatal closure is a rapid response to water deficit chaves et al 2002 murata and mori 2014 and g s can be considered a valuable reference parameter in plants response to drought medrano et al 2002 nonetheless gs has also been discussed as a useful water status related trait depending on the isohydric or anisohydric behaviour of each species and or variety villalobos gonzález et al 2019 although barley has been claimed as an anisohydric behaviour species tardieu and simonneau 1998 in our study the stomatal response of barley cv shakira was very sensitive to the irrigation amount applied at each treatment and stage fig 2 as found in other studies with several barley genotypes munns et al 2010 in this study the non deficit treatments presented clearly higher values of gs compared to the deficit treatments across the stages these differences were greatest at ky ii which indicates a high sensitivity to water availability at this stage as found by other authors cossani et al 2009 qureshi and neibling 2009 however it should also be noted that those deficit irrigation treatments distributed by ordil i e t90 t80 and t70 presented their relative highest gs values also at ky ii a critical stage for yield especially if water deficit occur under the limiting climatic conditions of mediterranean areas dreccer et al 2018 sánchez díaz et al 2002 this highest amount of irrigation distributed by ordil along with the highest gs values at ky ii indicates i non chronic physiological damages at previous stages lichtenthaler 1996 sánchez virosta et al 2020 and ii an efficient use of the available water at this critical stage araus et al 2008 blum 2009 mateos and araus 2016 3 3 physiological gas exchange responses across ordil treatments net co2 assimilation rate an is highly dependent on the stomatal aperture chaves et al 2016 collatz et al 1991 lawlor and cornic 2002 in fig 3 a robust linear correlation r2 0 84 between gs and an when gs values were in the range between 100 and 400 mmol m 2 s 1 100 gs 400 can be observed this indicates that in this range of gs values the degree of stomatal aperture was the main factor influencing an as previously found in other studies in barley lopes et al 2004 interestingly in this study we found no statistical correlations between gs below 100 gs 100 or above 400 gs 400 mmol m 2 s 1 fig 3 the an response to stomatal aperture is not always linear and depends on the degree of stress chaves et al 2011 flexas and medrano 2002 and other inherent factors influencing photosynthetic efficiency such as leaf chlorophyll content leaf morphology stomatal density growth stage etc lawrence et al 2021 nikolopoulos et al 2002 poorter and evans 1998 the absence of correlation of gs 400 with an means that water supply to overcome this threshold was not directly reflected on higher assimilation rate this matter can provide an insight on ordil irrigation scheduling efficiency in this sense 64 of the gs 400 values corresponded to nd and t100 treatments which were not optimized by ordil the rest 36 of gs 400 values corresponded to t90 t80 and t70 treatments these results imply that these irrigation treatments distributed by ordil were overwatered at some point and should be considered for future improvements besides the absence of statistical correlation of gs 100 with an indicate that non stomatal limitations could have happened due to the deficit irrigation itself or since this low gs values were also found on nd treatment because other environmental factors besides water deficit this matter is further discussed in the following section 3 4 photosynthesis performance in response to stomatal conductance thresholds significant and robust correlations were generally found between gas exchange variables except on gs 100 fig 4 in general gs was negatively related to the wuei fig 4a the increase of wuei under low or moderate water deficit due to stomatal closure it is a well known pattern in plants since the decline on gs is greater than in an larcher 2003 sinclair et al 2009 interestingly in our study the pattern of wuei response was erratic once gs values dropped to gs 100 and the intrinsic water use efficiency did not necessarily increase with stomatal closure below this threshold in fact irregular patterns were also found when gs 100 on the response of stomatal conductance and net assimilation rate respect the intercellular co2 ci fig 4b and c these results along with that showed in fig 3 for gs 100 can be explained since under severe stress non stomatal limitations can affect photosynthesis performance flexas et al 2002 flexas and medrano 2002 marino et al 2018 contrary to the results obtained by robredo et al 2007 in an experiment in barley under elevated co2 environment in this field study stomatal closure did not trigger an increase on ci fig 4b in fact we found an exponential increase of ci with the increase of gs fig 4b and an irregular pattern of an respect ci especially when gs 100 fig 4c based on this we can assume that once gs values dropped to gs 100 net assimilation rate no longer depended only on the stomatal aperture or ci concentration ahumada orellana et al 2019 marino et al 2018 hence it can be expected that metabolic impairments flexas et al 2004 marino et al 2018 medrano et al 2002 and or senescence chaves et al 2012 did not allow a regular photosynthesis performance under very low stomatal conductance values these results along with those shown in the previous section can be very valuable to determine the optimal i e around 400 mmol m 2 s 1 and minimum i e gs 100 stomatal conductance thresholds in barley for a proper deficit irrigation strategy 3 5 gas exchange variability responses across phenological stages variability in the response of gas exchange variables was also found at different yield stages fig 5 in general net assimilation rate was more efficient per unit of gs in ky ii than in ky iii fig 5a in previous studies the influence of growth stage on photosynthetic performance lawrence et al 2021 and how an and gs on barley decreases with leaf age robredo et al 2007 have been shown at ky iii the wuei was generally lower compared to ky ii fig 5b in fact the highest absorbed photosynthetically active radiation happens when the vegetative growth peak is reached gower et al 1999 which permits the greatest conversion of photo assimilates to biomass gain in barley calera et al 2004 gower et al 1999 with these differences between ky ii and ky iii stages it can be inferred that irrigation was properly optimized by ordil since the highest amount of water was distributed at ky ii before seasonal higher temperatures increased evapotranspiration and senescence in fact under limiting climatic conditions such as high temperatures or high vapour pressure deficit available water for the plant became scarcer chaouche et al 2010 gonzález et al 2008 tognetti et al 2006 all these circumstances together can be crucial in terms of irrigation management and efficiency bhattacharya 2019 kirda 2002 in our experiment all the gs 100 values corresponded to two measurements dates in 2016 season specifically to may 3rd in the middle of ky ii and in june 7th at the end of ky iii on may 3rd the minimum temperatures of the three nights before measurement were below the non stressful threshold temperature for barley 2⁰c these prolonged cold temperatures could damage the root zone and leaves resulting in stomatal conductance and photosynthesis constrains allen and ort 2001 melkonian et al 2004 vernieri et al 1991 on the other hand on june 7th five days of above the threshold temperature for development 28⁰c took place prior to the measurement these high temperatures can induce premature senescence and are related with stomatal conductance damages and physiological impairments hlaváčová et al 2018 impacting yield in summary at ky iii seasonal higher temperatures and evapotranspiration along with the starting of leaf senescence led to lower gs and gas exchange performance despite of the irrigation treatment while more efficient use of water at ky ii in terms of physiological performance was found at this stage 3 6 yield response to physiological performance and inter annual climatic variability although barley is one of the best adapted cereals to moderate water deficit robredo et al 2007 sánchez díaz et al 2002 teulat et al 1998 water stress reduces barley yield lopes et al 2004 this is in agreement with our findings in this study barley yield declined in parallel with irrigation amount table 2 besides inter annual yield varied under the same irrigation treatments for example yields were higher in 2015 compared to the other two seasons under the same water supply differences in yield for barley and other cereal crops have been observed due to factors other than water availability such as vpd temperature or radiation dreccer et al 2018 sadras and rodriguez 2007 van ittersum et al 2013 temperature effect is especially accentuated when several days of extreme temperatures occurred dreccer et al 2018 ugarte et al 2007 very high temperatures as those observed in 2016 and 2017 during grain filling table 1 results in resource caption constrains grain abortion and yield declines on cereal crops dreccer et al 2018 ferris et al 1998 wheeler et al 1996 besides very low temperatures at vegetative growth in barley as those observed at ky i in 2016 and 2017 table 1 can notably affect vegetative growth and decrease final yield dreccer et al 2018 muñoz amatriaín et al 2020 the impact of factors other than water supply can be also detected through gas exchange variables as already reported for barley sánchez díaz et al 2002 which are related with yield in fact when all years were pooled at the same treatment to buffer the inter annual variability we found very robust correlations of barley yield with mean gs during the whole cycle fig 6a and with an at ky ii fig 6b the correlation between gas exchange variables with biomass and or yield parameters has been previously reported in barley jiang et al 2006 sánchez díaz et al 2002 and other cereal crops lu et al 1998 the robustness of the correlations in this study supports the significant contribution of gs and an on final barley yield it should be considered that gas exchange variables were mainly monitored during the most yield related phenological stages moreover all the years were pooled for one single treatment diminishing the multi year noise introduced by interannual climatic variability ehrlich and lambin 1996 these results together reinforce the fact that eco physiological variables can be valuable performance indicators of deficit irrigation techniques álvarez et al 2013a costa et al 2007 matese et al 2018 since they responded to water related factors as well as other environmental variability that influence crop production especially at the most sensitive and yield related phenological stages 3 7 future prospects for ordil improvements based on these results ordil correctly optimized irrigation in terms of physiological performance threshold values of gs have been previously proposed for deficit irrigation strategies in other crops ahumada orellana et al 2019 cifre et al 2005 marino et al 2018 yet this is the first reported result for barley however this study also shows that there is still room for improvement it would be ideal to find an optimized distribution that maintains stomatal conductance above 100 mmol m 2 s 1 trying to maintain values close to 400 mmol m 2 s 1 at that level the net assimilation rate in relation to stomatal aperture was optimal however gas exchange monitoring for field phenotyping is laborious and time consuming carvalho et al 2021 costa et al 2013 new remote sensing tools are becoming important to predict yield potential and stress adaptation araus et al 2008 for future improvements thermography appears as a valuable tool for phenotyping araus et al 2008 costa et al 2019 lima et al 2016 and as a predictor of biomass gain sánchez virosta and sánchez gómez 2020 in fact it has been already proposed for barley monitoring munns et al 2010 and can be managed with unmanned aerial vehicles deery et al 2016 sullivan et al 2007 in high throughput manner melandri et al 2020 prashar et al 2013 4 conclusions the findings of this study indicate that ecophysiological based studies can be very valuable for an accurate estimation of barley irrigation requirements in this study optimum gs values ca 400 mmol m 2 s 1 for physiological performance and yield potential and minimum gs values not below 100 mmol m 2 s 1 to avoid chronic physiological damages have been proposed for barley cv shakira which can be used in barley irrigation management and distribution besides the high correlations found between physiological parameters i e gs and an at different phenological stages ky ii and ky iii with yield validate the irrigation distribution made by ordil under limited volumes or irrigation finally advances in ecophysiological monitoring and the understanding of the influence of other climatic factor can be crucial for future optimizations of deficit irrigation techniques as ordil declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9232,agriculture must improve the productivity of irrigation water due to several factors such as global warming the increasing water demand of other sectors or the protection of the environment the optimized regulated deficit irrigation for limited volumes of water ordil methodology may contribute to reach this objective by optimizing the allocation of irrigation water during the growing cycle when the available volume is lower than the crop irrigation requirements ordil was applied to a barley crop in a 3 year 2015 2017 field test under the semiarid conditions of albacete spain the main aim was to assess the influence of ordil on the physiological response of barley the specific objectives were 1 identify if stomatal conductance gs net assimilation rate an intrinsic water use efficiency wuei and total dry matter tdm evolution can be used as early and sensitive indicators of barley water status and crop performance 2 provide a mechanistic basis to understand barley physiological response to deficit irrigation at the most sensitive stages and 3 evaluate barley physiological response to ordil and its relation with yield thus five irrigation treatments were performed one without deficit nd and four with limited volumes of irrigation water 100 90 80 and 70 of typical irrigation needs according to the results gs was a reliable variable to detect early water deficit in barley besides critical thresholds for this variable were found to optimize irrigation and to avoid chronic physiological damages affecting the most sensitive and yield related stages in summary the physiological approach applied in this study validates ordil methodology being useful for future irrigation scheduling and distribution improvements keywords water productivity mopeco simulation model irrigation scheduling plant ecophysiology stomatal conductance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the growing global demand for food makes irrigated agriculture essential singh and panda 2012 however this food supply is threatened by the continuous reduction in the availability of water for agricultural use due to global warming and the competition with other sectors such as manufacturing water use public water supply or energy production flörke et al 2018 ringler et al 2013 rosegrant and ringler 2000 besides in semiarid regions these water limitations can be especially important even more in a climate change context elliott et al 2014 tian et al 2015 for example in important agricultural areas such as castilla la mancha clm in spain reductions of irrigation water extraction are already a fact martínez romero et al 2021 hence irrigation techniques under these circumstances should be reassessed to improve water productivity in these arid and semiarid regions with water limitations moreover the continued increase in energy costs require an improved efficiency in the use of agricultural water to become a sustainable activity fao 2016 minetur 2015 regulated deficit irrigation techniques rdi are based on crops different sensitivities to water deficit in their development stages and may allow water productivity to be increased without causing significant yield losses per unit of area chai et al 2016 marshall 1990 if the availability of irrigable land is not a limitation the lower yield per unit of area may be made up by cropping a larger area irrigated with the same volume of water this way rdi techniques may get a higher yield and profit in regions where water is a limitation but not the irrigable land georgiou and papamichail 2008 lópez mata et al 2019 marshall 1990 the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi methodology maximizes the yield of annual crops when the objective is to reach a certain deficit for the whole growing period domínguez et al 2012a or when the amount of available irrigation water is lower than the requirements of the crop ordil leite et al 2015b these methodologies were developed for the mopeco model ortega et al 2004 that was conceived for optimizing the gross margin gm of irrigated farms located in water scarce areas this model has been calibrated for the main extensive annual crops in castilla la mancha and others in different areas of the world carvalho et al 2014 domínguez et al 2012a 2012b 2012c leite et al 2015a léllis et al 2017 lópez urrea et al 2020 martínez romero et al 2019 the analysis of functional traits can be used to address for the integrity goodness and or limitations of irrigation techniques under water limitation allowing the improvement of water use productivity and efficiency of irrigation costa et al 2007 montoro et al 2016 the interplay of different mechanisms of plant functioning functional traits ultimately determines overall performance of plants in terms of growth and crop yield thus understanding the physiological responses to water availability can help to understand plant sensitivity to deficit irrigation álvarez et al 2013 parkash et al 2021 this sensitivity will depend on the duration and intensity of the water deficit siopongco et al 2006 xu et al 2010 xu and zhou 2007 but also on the phenological stage in which the deficit is applied boonjung and fukai 1996 garcía tejero et al 2010 geerts and raes 2009 hence by an ecophysiological approach crop management and irrigation scheduling can be improved de oliveira et al 2021 jones 2004 2018 in this sense ordi methodology has already been evaluated in other herbaceous crops in terms of functional performance being demonstrated that under water limitation it is possible and advisable to save water in some crop stages to use it in specific crop phases which have greater impact on yield performance sánchez virosta et al 2020 this approach reveals the underlying mechanisms of the plant in response to water availability at different crop stages however this ecophysiological assessment in relation to a deficit irrigation strategy has not been yet analyzed in barley spain is the first country in area 24 and third in production 14 of barley in europe anon 2020 clm region is the second largest barley producer in spain with about 40 of the total mapa 2021 in this region where farmers have limited irrigation water varies between 2000 and 4500 m3 ha 1 anon 2019 barley plays an important role in crop rotation due to its low irrigation needs 2500 m3 ha 1 pardo et al 2020 compared to other crops of higher profitability in the area such as onion maize or alfalfa 5800 6500 and 7500 m3 ha 1 respectively since it is a crop with one of the lowest water profitability in this region 0 10 m 3 domínguez et al 2017 farmers are demanding deficit irrigation techniques to save irrigation water in barley to use for other more profitable crops on their farms in this sense by following the ordil methodology pardo et al 2020 have shown that with a volume of irrigation water lower than the crop needs water use efficiency and economic water productivity can be greatly increased 48 on average obtaining high yields with malting quality price of grain increases 15 on average anon 2017 however the underlying functional mechanisms of this performance are unknown thus the main aim was to assess the influence of ordil on the physiological response of barley the specific objectives were 1 identify if stomatal conductance gs net assimilation rate an intrinsic water use efficiency wuei and total dry matter tdm evolution can be used as early and sensitive indicators of barley water status and crop performance 2 provide a mechanistic basis to understand barley physiological response to deficit irrigation at the most sensitive stages and 3 evaluate barley physiological response to ordil and its relation with yield 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the climate of the experimental area is characterized as semi arid the average annual precipitation is approximately 400 mm year

field trials were conducted during the seasons 2015 2016 and 2017 in centro integral de formación profesional de aguas nuevas albacete spain situated in utm x 595368 y4311310 at 695 m a s l shakira barley cultivar was sown with a density of 210 kg ha 1 in 2015 2016 and 2017 seasons january 12th 13th and 13th respectively five irrigation treatments with four randomly distributed repetitions were applied one without deficit nd and the other four with different irrigation water volumes corresponding to 100 t100 90 t90 80 t80 and 70 t70 of net irrigation needs of barley for intermediate weather conditions of a typical meteorological year tmy established in 2500 m3 ha 1 t100 pardo et al 2020 in the case of nd and t100 there were three plots instead of four both treatments were the same treatment up to the amount of water assigned to t100 was depleted table 2 so the differences could presumably occur in the last crop stage ripening in the case of t90 t80 and t70 the allocation of the amount of available irrigation water was optimized by using ordil pardo et al 2020 2022 a drip irrigation system 0 5 m between pipes and emitters with self compensating emitters 3 8 l h 1 was used

irrigation managed by the mapama https eportal mapa gob es websiar inicio aspx 2 3 optimized regulated deficit irrigation for limited volumes of irrigation water during the field trials daily irrigation scheduling was performed by using the simplified water balance methodology in the root zone allen et al 1998 which is the one used by mopeco domínguez et al 2011 a more detailed description can be found in pardo et al 2020 to determine the irrigation scheduling of each treatment at each crop stage the ordil methodology for limited volumes of available irrigation water was used leite et al 2015b this methodology determines the deficit target in terms of the ratio between actual and maximum evapotranspiration eta etm at each crop yield response ky stage in the case of barley these stages are divided in establishment ky i vegetative development ky i flowering ky ii yield formation ky iii and ripening ky iv based on these crop yield response stages the amount of irrigation water is assigned to be applied at each stage during the real management of the crop the eta etm ratios proposed by the methodology must be updated in order to fit the real climatic conditions with the irrigation water available in the case of nd there is not a deficit target and the ratio eta etm is most of the time maintained in 1 0 a more complete explanation of this methodology and its application in this experiment can be found in pardo et al 2020 2 4 physiological and growth parameters monitoring data of physiological traits were collected from two plots of each treatment in two representative plants of the central part of each plot measurements of net assimilation rates an and stomatal conductance gs were done under clear sky conditions on the third youngest and fully developed leaf without deformities or diseases stomatal conductance gs was measured at natural incident photosynthetic flux density ppfd between 10 00 a m and 2 00 p m with a dynamic diffusion type porometer ap4 leaf porometer delta t devices ltd cambridge uk with a measuring interval between 5 and 1200 mmol m² s 1 depending on the climatic conditions gs was measured with a frequency of 7 14 days throughout the three seasons and covering at least the flowering and yield formation stages net assimilation rate an values were recorded by a portable photosynthesis system for gas exchange measurements li6400 tx model li cor bioscience ne usa the parameters of the leaf chamber for data collection were determined according to the characteristics of the test area 390 μmol mol 1 for co2 atmospheric concentration 25 0 5 c for air temperature 70 5 for air relative humidity a flow rate of 650 μmol s 1 of air and a ppfd of 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 readings of an were made for each treatment at least once in every stage of 2016 and 2017 seasons concurrent with the an measurement gs values were recorded and the intrinsic water use efficiency wuei was calculated for each plant as the ratio of leaf assimilation rate an to leaf stomatal conductance gs in addition to physiological measurements samples of plant material were taken every 15 days to monitor total dry matter tdm evolution in two plots of each treatment biomass samples were collected from a 0 5 0 5 m area located in the central part of the plot biomass sampling was initiated from the beginning of tillering the last sampling was at harvest 2 5 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova with three factors irrigation treatment stage and year was carried out to evaluate the effect of these factors on an gs wuei and tdm while stage and year were the factors analyzed on climatic variables afterwards a post hoc analysis fisher lsd was performed to identify homogeneous groups within each factor or combination of significant factors analyzed pearson s and logarithmic correlations were computed to explore the relationship between physiological variables and final yield the software statistica v 10 statsoft inc tulsa ok usa was used for data analysis and statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 total dry matter responses to irrigation treatments and climatic conditions water deficit can influence on barley phenology mcmaster and wilhelm 2003 and total dry matter content tdm accumulation across the crop cycle goyne et al 1993 in our study phenological differences among treatments were not found fig 1 with all the treatments following a regular growth pattern similar to those found in other studies calera et al 2004 goyne et al 1993 at the end of the crop cycle the greater irrigated treatments accumulated higher biomass these differences on tdm were not statistically shown until the middle of ky ii or as in the case of 2017 season until the last stage this can be because at later growth stages of barley and under mediterranean conditions higher temperatures can exacerbate the water stress impact on tdm accumulation due to higher evaporative demand dreccer et al 2018 mcmaster and wilhelm 2003 which can increase the differences among treatments in this sense ordil distributed the highest amount of irrigation matching with the highest relative growth rate see ky ii and ky iii in figs 1 and 2 this distribution aimed to optimize water use reducing the interaction between water deficit and high temperatures until maturation is reached and biomass gain is completed besides water availability other environmental factors can directly influence on barley dry matter accumulation calera et al 2004 for example a lower tdm on 2016 was found especially compared with 2015 season in all treatments fig 1 since there were not important differences of the irrigation treatments among seasons fig 2 these differences can be explained by the significantly lower mean temperature observed during vegetative development in 2016 see ky i in table 1 high sensitivity to below threshold temperature at this stage has already been observed sadras and dreccer 2015 which can induce low temperature injuries in barley triggering growth declines muñoz amatriaín et al 2020 as that observed in this study in 2016 in summary biomass monitoring was a valuable tool to describe growth patterns under different climatic conditions yet as shown here it was difficult to predict water stress with tdm data until latter stages 3 2 stomatal conductance gs sensitivity to deficit irrigation stomatal closure is a rapid response to water deficit chaves et al 2002 murata and mori 2014 and g s can be considered a valuable reference parameter in plants response to drought medrano et al 2002 nonetheless gs has also been discussed as a useful water status related trait depending on the isohydric or anisohydric behaviour of each species and or variety villalobos gonzález et al 2019 although barley has been claimed as an anisohydric behaviour species tardieu and simonneau 1998 in our study the stomatal response of barley cv shakira was very sensitive to the irrigation amount applied at each treatment and stage fig 2 as found in other studies with several barley genotypes munns et al 2010 in this study the non deficit treatments presented clearly higher values of gs compared to the deficit treatments across the stages these differences were greatest at ky ii which indicates a high sensitivity to water availability at this stage as found by other authors cossani et al 2009 qureshi and neibling 2009 however it should also be noted that those deficit irrigation treatments distributed by ordil i e t90 t80 and t70 presented their relative highest gs values also at ky ii a critical stage for yield especially if water deficit occur under the limiting climatic conditions of mediterranean areas dreccer et al 2018 sánchez díaz et al 2002 this highest amount of irrigation distributed by ordil along with the highest gs values at ky ii indicates i non chronic physiological damages at previous stages lichtenthaler 1996 sánchez virosta et al 2020 and ii an efficient use of the available water at this critical stage araus et al 2008 blum 2009 mateos and araus 2016 3 3 physiological gas exchange responses across ordil treatments net co2 assimilation rate an is highly dependent on the stomatal aperture chaves et al 2016 collatz et al 1991 lawlor and cornic 2002 in fig 3 a robust linear correlation r2 0 84 between gs and an when gs values were in the range between 100 and 400 mmol m 2 s 1 100 gs 400 can be observed this indicates that in this range of gs values the degree of stomatal aperture was the main factor influencing an as previously found in other studies in barley lopes et al 2004 interestingly in this study we found no statistical correlations between gs below 100 gs 100 or above 400 gs 400 mmol m 2 s 1 fig 3 the an response to stomatal aperture is not always linear and depends on the degree of stress chaves et al 2011 flexas and medrano 2002 and other inherent factors influencing photosynthetic efficiency such as leaf chlorophyll content leaf morphology stomatal density growth stage etc lawrence et al 2021 nikolopoulos et al 2002 poorter and evans 1998 the absence of correlation of gs 400 with an means that water supply to overcome this threshold was not directly reflected on higher assimilation rate this matter can provide an insight on ordil irrigation scheduling efficiency in this sense 64 of the gs 400 values corresponded to nd and t100 treatments which were not optimized by ordil the rest 36 of gs 400 values corresponded to t90 t80 and t70 treatments these results imply that these irrigation treatments distributed by ordil were overwatered at some point and should be considered for future improvements besides the absence of statistical correlation of gs 100 with an indicate that non stomatal limitations could have happened due to the deficit irrigation itself or since this low gs values were also found on nd treatment because other environmental factors besides water deficit this matter is further discussed in the following section 3 4 photosynthesis performance in response to stomatal conductance thresholds significant and robust correlations were generally found between gas exchange variables except on gs 100 fig 4 in general gs was negatively related to the wuei fig 4a the increase of wuei under low or moderate water deficit due to stomatal closure it is a well known pattern in plants since the decline on gs is greater than in an larcher 2003 sinclair et al 2009 interestingly in our study the pattern of wuei response was erratic once gs values dropped to gs 100 and the intrinsic water use efficiency did not necessarily increase with stomatal closure below this threshold in fact irregular patterns were also found when gs 100 on the response of stomatal conductance and net assimilation rate respect the intercellular co2 ci fig 4b and c these results along with that showed in fig 3 for gs 100 can be explained since under severe stress non stomatal limitations can affect photosynthesis performance flexas et al 2002 flexas and medrano 2002 marino et al 2018 contrary to the results obtained by robredo et al 2007 in an experiment in barley under elevated co2 environment in this field study stomatal closure did not trigger an increase on ci fig 4b in fact we found an exponential increase of ci with the increase of gs fig 4b and an irregular pattern of an respect ci especially when gs 100 fig 4c based on this we can assume that once gs values dropped to gs 100 net assimilation rate no longer depended only on the stomatal aperture or ci concentration ahumada orellana et al 2019 marino et al 2018 hence it can be expected that metabolic impairments flexas et al 2004 marino et al 2018 medrano et al 2002 and or senescence chaves et al 2012 did not allow a regular photosynthesis performance under very low stomatal conductance values these results along with those shown in the previous section can be very valuable to determine the optimal i e around 400 mmol m 2 s 1 and minimum i e gs 100 stomatal conductance thresholds in barley for a proper deficit irrigation strategy 3 5 gas exchange variability responses across phenological stages variability in the response of gas exchange variables was also found at different yield stages fig 5 in general net assimilation rate was more efficient per unit of gs in ky ii than in ky iii fig 5a in previous studies the influence of growth stage on photosynthetic performance lawrence et al 2021 and how an and gs on barley decreases with leaf age robredo et al 2007 have been shown at ky iii the wuei was generally lower compared to ky ii fig 5b in fact the highest absorbed photosynthetically active radiation happens when the vegetative growth peak is reached gower et al 1999 which permits the greatest conversion of photo assimilates to biomass gain in barley calera et al 2004 gower et al 1999 with these differences between ky ii and ky iii stages it can be inferred that irrigation was properly optimized by ordil since the highest amount of water was distributed at ky ii before seasonal higher temperatures increased evapotranspiration and senescence in fact under limiting climatic conditions such as high temperatures or high vapour pressure deficit available water for the plant became scarcer chaouche et al 2010 gonzález et al 2008 tognetti et al 2006 all these circumstances together can be crucial in terms of irrigation management and efficiency bhattacharya 2019 kirda 2002 in our experiment all the gs 100 values corresponded to two measurements dates in 2016 season specifically to may 3rd in the middle of ky ii and in june 7th at the end of ky iii on may 3rd the minimum temperatures of the three nights before measurement were below the non stressful threshold temperature for barley 2⁰c these prolonged cold temperatures could damage the root zone and leaves resulting in stomatal conductance and photosynthesis constrains allen and ort 2001 melkonian et al 2004 vernieri et al 1991 on the other hand on june 7th five days of above the threshold temperature for development 28⁰c took place prior to the measurement these high temperatures can induce premature senescence and are related with stomatal conductance damages and physiological impairments hlaváčová et al 2018 impacting yield in summary at ky iii seasonal higher temperatures and evapotranspiration along with the starting of leaf senescence led to lower gs and gas exchange performance despite of the irrigation treatment while more efficient use of water at ky ii in terms of physiological performance was found at this stage 3 6 yield response to physiological performance and inter annual climatic variability although barley is one of the best adapted cereals to moderate water deficit robredo et al 2007 sánchez díaz et al 2002 teulat et al 1998 water stress reduces barley yield lopes et al 2004 this is in agreement with our findings in this study barley yield declined in parallel with irrigation amount table 2 besides inter annual yield varied under the same irrigation treatments for example yields were higher in 2015 compared to the other two seasons under the same water supply differences in yield for barley and other cereal crops have been observed due to factors other than water availability such as vpd temperature or radiation dreccer et al 2018 sadras and rodriguez 2007 van ittersum et al 2013 temperature effect is especially accentuated when several days of extreme temperatures occurred dreccer et al 2018 ugarte et al 2007 very high temperatures as those observed in 2016 and 2017 during grain filling table 1 results in resource caption constrains grain abortion and yield declines on cereal crops dreccer et al 2018 ferris et al 1998 wheeler et al 1996 besides very low temperatures at vegetative growth in barley as those observed at ky i in 2016 and 2017 table 1 can notably affect vegetative growth and decrease final yield dreccer et al 2018 muñoz amatriaín et al 2020 the impact of factors other than water supply can be also detected through gas exchange variables as already reported for barley sánchez díaz et al 2002 which are related with yield in fact when all years were pooled at the same treatment to buffer the inter annual variability we found very robust correlations of barley yield with mean gs during the whole cycle fig 6a and with an at ky ii fig 6b the correlation between gas exchange variables with biomass and or yield parameters has been previously reported in barley jiang et al 2006 sánchez díaz et al 2002 and other cereal crops lu et al 1998 the robustness of the correlations in this study supports the significant contribution of gs and an on final barley yield it should be considered that gas exchange variables were mainly monitored during the most yield related phenological stages moreover all the years were pooled for one single treatment diminishing the multi year noise introduced by interannual climatic variability ehrlich and lambin 1996 these results together reinforce the fact that eco physiological variables can be valuable performance indicators of deficit irrigation techniques álvarez et al 2013a costa et al 2007 matese et al 2018 since they responded to water related factors as well as other environmental variability that influence crop production especially at the most sensitive and yield related phenological stages 3 7 future prospects for ordil improvements based on these results ordil correctly optimized irrigation in terms of physiological performance threshold values of gs have been previously proposed for deficit irrigation strategies in other crops ahumada orellana et al 2019 cifre et al 2005 marino et al 2018 yet this is the first reported result for barley however this study also shows that there is still room for improvement it would be ideal to find an optimized distribution that maintains stomatal conductance above 100 mmol m 2 s 1 trying to maintain values close to 400 mmol m 2 s 1 at that level the net assimilation rate in relation to stomatal aperture was optimal however gas exchange monitoring for field phenotyping is laborious and time consuming carvalho et al 2021 costa et al 2013 new remote sensing tools are becoming important to predict yield potential and stress adaptation araus et al 2008 for future improvements thermography appears as a valuable tool for phenotyping araus et al 2008 costa et al 2019 lima et al 2016 and as a predictor of biomass gain sánchez virosta and sánchez gómez 2020 in fact it has been already proposed for barley monitoring munns et al 2010 and can be managed with unmanned aerial vehicles deery et al 2016 sullivan et al 2007 in high throughput manner melandri et al 2020 prashar et al 2013 4 conclusions the findings of this study indicate that ecophysiological based studies can be very valuable for an accurate estimation of barley irrigation requirements in this study optimum gs values ca 400 mmol m 2 s 1 for physiological performance and yield potential and minimum gs values not below 100 mmol m 2 s 1 to avoid chronic physiological damages have been proposed for barley cv shakira which can be used in barley irrigation management and distribution besides the high correlations found between physiological parameters i e gs and an at different phenological stages ky ii and ky iii with yield validate the irrigation distribution made by ordil under limited volumes or irrigation finally advances in ecophysiological monitoring and the understanding of the influence of other climatic factor can be crucial for future optimizations of deficit irrigation techniques as ordil declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9233,soil salinization has severely constrained agricultural sustainability in arid and semi arid regions generally using additional irrigation water to leach excessive salts is a widely used strategy for alleviating soil salt accumulation in the root zone nevertheless this practice simultaneously increases the risk of nitrogen loss to address this contradiction a new index namely the leaching balance index of soil salinity and nitrogen lbi which was defined by multiplying the nitrogen leaching fraction nlf by the absolute value of the discrepancy between the crop tolerance salinity threshold and soil salinity ssc was proposed the lower the index value is the better the soil salt and nitrogen leaching can reach an optimal equilibrium state soil salt leaching and nitrogen loss were simulated by the hydrus 2d model the two year field observation data of soil moisture salinity ammonium and nitrate nitrogen contents were collected for calibration and validation a model case was presented using the lbi to investigate the appropriate mulched drip irrigation and fertigation management practices with different levels of salty waters for cotton in xinjiang in this study in the testing process the normalized root mean square error nrmse provided by this model was 2 13 5 14 20 40 and 14 27 for soil water content swc soil salinity ec1 5 nh4 n and no3 n respectively and the index of agreement d was 0 63 0 94 0 83 0 99 0 69 0 97 and 0 86 0 96 respectively then the simulation scenarios were established to minimize the nlf and the ssc and thus the lbi the results showed that increasing the number of fertigation splits could reduce the lbi specifically five fertigation splits during the growing season could result in a decrease in the lbi of 21 32 furthermore when applying an irrigation amount of 100 etc the alternate use of water salinities of 6 0 ds m 1 and 10 0 ds m 1 at the squaring stage and flower boll stage produced a lower lbi the irrigation scheme of a higher water salinity and irrigation amount during the squaring stage coupled with a lower water salinity and irrigation amount during the flower boll stage was beneficial for decreasing the lbi the lower the value of lbi is the more sustainable the irrigation and soil management will be the new index of the lbi proposed by our study represents one of the first efforts to solve the contradiction between salt accumulation and nitrogen loss which will ultimately aid in the salt control and efficient utilization of water and nitrogen for arid and semi arid regions keywords soil salinization microirrigation cotton fertigation leaching hydrus data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction shortages of freshwater resources have become critical problems in arid regions quantitatively the supply of brackish water worldwide is approximately 1 39 109 km3 which is considered as an alternative source of freshwater rozema and flowers 2008 to solve the contradiction between water supply and demand caused by the rise in crop planting areas brackish water is increasingly used for agricultural irrigation guo and shen 2016 however the improper management of brackish conditions would induce secondary salinization in fields burt et al 2003 hopmans et al 2021 leaching salt downward from the root zone with extra irrigation water is a frequently used approach for controlling soil salinization ben gal et al 2008 minhas et al 2020 nonetheless more irrigation water for salt leaching might result in a rise in the shallow groundwater table which accelerates soil evaporation and in turn causes salt buildup in the root zone singh 2019 additionally salt leaching practices will undoubtedly increase the risk of nitrate leaching into the groundwater which causes soil fertility decreases and groundwater pollution libutti and monteleone 2017 conversely when leaching after irrigation with brackish water is insufficient salts will accumulate in the root zone aragües et al 2015 therefore salt leaching and nitrogen loss in drip irrigation with saline water are a sophisticated contradiction if there is no effective way to deal with the contradiction shallow groundwater table rising soil salinization soil fertility decreases and groundwater nitrate pollution etc will occur in turn this will lead to the inappropriate utilization of saline water and low nitrogen use efficiency in arid regions the majority of traditional salinity management approaches have centered on maintaining adequate soil salt leaching primarily to reduce crop production losses caused by root zone salt buildup ayars et al 2012 chauhdary et al 2020 reported that leaching salts from the root zone may be accomplished by high frequency irrigation under drip irrigation without adding leaching requirements to total irrigation li et al 2019 developed an efficient strategy for soil salt leaching by alternating irrigation with fresh water and saline water furthermore to evaluate the efficiency of salt leaching a quantitative indicator is essential leaching requirement lr as a soil salinity leaching index was originally proposed by u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 and rhoades 1974 further developed lr and obtained a series of equations for calculating lr which is a widely used evaluation indicator corwin et al 2007 shahrokhnia and wu 2021 meanwhile leaching salts means desalinating the soil to quantify the extent of salt leaching an evaluation index of the soil desalinization rate was applied qian et al 2021 liu et al 2021 additionally yang et al 2019 indicated that the salinity surrounding the wetting bulb of drip irrigation decreased as the irrigation volume increased based on assessing the index of salinity leaching efficiency the higher the values of these indexes were the higher the salt leaching was the dynamic threshold soil salinity proposed by our past research can be a more practical indicator for the quantification of salt control che et al 2021b furthermore a moderate amount of leaching i e reducing the difference between soil salinity and the dynamic threshold will be a suitable option considering that nitrate is highly difficult for the soil to fix barnes et al 1992 strebel et al 1989 it is extremely vulnerable to leaching into groundwater under inappropriate irrigation and fertigation management paramasivam et al 2002 previous studies have shown that the nitrogen application rate application time and fertigation frequency were the main factors controlling nitrogen losses nitrate loss increased from 34 to 49 as more nitrogen fertilizer was applied from 140 to 280 kg ha 1 zvomuya et al 2003 on the other hand as one fertigation split during the growth stage cannot be fully absorbed by crops the risk of nitrogen losses increased and it failed to achieve the maximum yield and nitrogen use efficiency ma et al 2021 therefore appropriate split fertigation according to crop growth stage may enhance crop fertilizer uptake while decreasing fertilizer loss errebhi et al 1998 głąb et al 2020 indicated that the optimal nitrogen fertilizer rate and interval for minimizing nutrient losses and high turfgrass quality were 60 kg ha 1 and 4 4 days respectively irrigation schemes with low irrigation amounts were also essential to alleviate nitrate leaching into groundwater jia et al 2020 in addition evaluation indexes might be established to investigate nitrogen losses the nitrogen leaching fraction is a more commonly used index to evaluate nitrogen losses fraters et al 2015 van der salm et al 2007 moreover delgado et al 2006 developed and employed a nitrogen index which was used to analyze nitrogen losses in farmland systems figueroa viramontes et al 2011 nitrogen loss was effectively controlled by these indexes in total several indexes of salt and nitrogen control published in the literatures and their merits and limitations are shown in table 1 in general the practice of reducing nitrogen leaching may aggravate soil salt buildup in the root zone which inhibits crop growth blindly reducing nitrogen leaching in turn raises the risk of salt accumulation especially in arid semi arid regions and salt affected areas there is still little information on the index of nitrogen loss control with consideration of salt stress most of the studies combining nitrogen loss and salt leaching were based on results obtained from field investigations liu et al 2020 compared to the limitations of field investigations mathematical models offer the benefit of saving labor money and time related dynamics models have been confirmed to be valuable tools to predict the leaching of salt and nitrogen simultaneously ramos et al 2011 lekakis and antonopoulos 2015 the hydrus model was utilized to investigate the nitrate leaching potential by gärdenäs et al 2005 and it indicated that fertigation events at the end of the irrigation cycle reduced the potential for nitrate leaching xu et al 2020 explored optimal irrigation and fertigation strategies for reducing water and nitrogen leaching using the rzwqm2 model in addition li and ren 2021 proposed a strategy of adjusting irrigation according to rainfall to control salt leaching based on a distributed agro hydrological model of swap wofost a new mass balance model of ubmod was proposed by mao et al 2020 and was used to simulate the processes of salt leaching and accumulation furthermore when performing a comprehensive evaluation of salt nitrogen leaching soil water fertilizer and salt dynamics must be simulated simultaneously xu et al 2015 simulated the transport of soil water salt and nitrate by using the hydrus 1d model to investigate optimal irrigation strategies phogat et al 2014 simulated the seasonal dynamics of water nitrate and salinity under drip irrigation by applying hydrus 2d ramos et al 2012 modeled the soil water content ammonium nitrogen content nitrate nitrogen content and soil water electrical conductivity by utilizing hydrus 2d therefore numerical simulation can be used as a reliable method to verify the relevant salt and nitrogen leaching indexes the overarching purpose of this research is to solve the contradiction between salt leaching and nitrogen losses the specific goals were 1 to develop the leaching balance index of soil salinity and nitrogen lbi 2 to evaluate the performance of the coupling model of water fertilizer and salt to confirm the rationality of the lbi and 3 to formulate the irrigation and fertigation strategies based on the lbi 2 methodology and model 2 1 leaching balance index of soil salinity and nitrogen the parent material of soil is generally characterized as having medium or high soil salinity in arid and semi arid regions ding et al 2011 which requires irrigation water to remove the salt from the root zone however a higher irrigation amount beyond crop evapotranspiration etc will lead to nitrogen loss which will suppress plant growth and yield formation conversely if irrigation amounts are decreased the salt in the root zone cannot be leached sufficiently so the soil salinity may be above the crop tolerance salinity threshold which also leads to yield reduction therefore we first introduced the threshold soil salinity and treated the discrepancy between soil salinity and the threshold as an indicator for salt control to reflect the appropriate soil salinity environment for crop development then nitrogen loss needs to be considered in the salt control process finally a comprehensive index integrating the nitrogen leaching fraction and the discrepancy between the threshold and soil salinity was proposed the nitrogen leaching fraction nlf was described according to the soil nitrogen balance as follows colpaert et al 2021 1 n l f n a d d e d n i n i n u p t a k e n r e s i d u a l n a d d e d 100 where n added represents the amount of nitrogen applied kg ha 1 n ini represents the soil inorganic nitrogen content in the root zone at the beginning of the given growth stage kg ha 1 n uptake represents the plant nitrogen uptake during the given growth stage kg ha 1 and n residual represents the residual soil inorganic nitrogen content in the root zone at the end of the given growth stage kg ha 1 as an indicator of characterizing the relationship between salt leaching and salt tolerance of crops the discrepancy between the threshold and soil salinity ssc ds m 1 was calculated as follows 2 δ s s c s s c s s c t h where ssc is soil salt content in the root zone which represents the electrical conductivity of soil water extracts of a 1 5 ratio w v ec 1 5 ds m 1 and ssc th represents the threshold soil salinity ds m 1 which is 0 74 and 1 02 ds m 1 at the squaring and flower boll stages for cotton respectively according to che et al 2021b in this study the root zone was located in the 0 40 cm soil layer based on the nitrogen leaching indicator of nlf and the salt leaching indicator of ssc the leaching balance index of soil salinity and nitrogen lbi ds m 1 was developed and given as 3 l b i n l f δ s s c the optimal equilibrium state of salt nitrogen leaching was obtained by minimizing the lbi which can be used to solve the contradiction between salt and nitrogen leaching 2 2 field experimental description a two year consecutive field

2019 fertilizer was applied before seeding and the amount of broadcast applied urea was 75 kg ha 1 n in 2018 and 120 kg ha 1 n in 2019 the dissolved urea was fertigated at three splits through mulched

of 100 cm considering available measurements of soil water content salt nh4 n and no3 n in different soil layers at the late seedling stage we used the observation data of june 5 as the initial conditions the initial soil water content salt nh4 n and no3 n in the 0 100 cm soil layers ranged from 0 200 to 0 326 cm3 cm 3 0 935 1 595 ds m 1 0 359 0 435 mg kg 1 and 1 169 15 018 mg kg 1 respectively in addition the distribution of roots was considered in the simulation domain according to the field measurements the maximal vertical and horizontal rooting depths were set as 60 and 50 cm respectively the horizontal and vertical parameters that characterize the site of maximum water uptake were set to 40 and 10 cm respectively to avoid nonconvergence of calculation at the top boundary with drastic changes in the soil water potential gradient a relatively denser grid 3 cm and a coarser grid 5 cm were designed near the soil surface and the bottom of the domain respectively wang et al 2014 in total fifteen observation points of soil water content salt nh4 n and no3 n were designed in the cross section corresponding to the soil sampling fig 1 the boundary conditions of the simulation domain are shown in fig 1 the sides of the soil profile were set as no flux boundary of water salt nh4 n and no3 n atmospheric boundary conditions were assigned to the bare soil fig 1 the bottom boundary was set as a free drainage boundary water and solutes entered the simulation domain through a saturation zone during an irrigation event li et al 2005 according to field observations during irrigation a constant saturated zone width was set as 40 cm the constant flux q cm d 1 in each irrigation event in the saturation zone was defined as follows chen et al 2020 12 q q l where q represents the actual emitter flux cm2 d 1 and l represents the width of the variable flux boundary condition which is equal to the constant saturation zone width during an irrigation event cm because of the plastic film covering there is no flux in the saturated surface zone during the nonirrigation period as a result the saturation surface zone was given as a variable flux boundary i e a specified flux boundary condition for the irrigation period and a non flux boundary for the nonirrigation period the actual evaporation rate of the atmospheric boundary was mainly determined by e p

from the irrigation amount of 125 etc and nitrogen application rate of 255 kg ha 1 with brackish water treatment i3f2s in 2019 were used to calibrate the model detailed experimental treatments can be found in che et al 2021a based on the measured soil particle size distribution and bulk density che et al 2021a the initial input soil hydraulic parameters were determined by neural network prediction schaap et al 2001 based on the measured soil water salt and nitrate nitrogen contents in different soil layers the parameters of soil hydraulic θ r θ s α n k s salt and nitrogen transport and transformation d t d l d w k d μ w μ s were calibrated by trial and error it should be noted that the connectivity parameter l was not calibrated by trial and error if the result was 0 5 after calibration treatments including different water fertilizer and salt gradients i1f1g i1f1s i3f2g i4f4g and i4f4s in 2018 and 2019 were utilized to validate the model to evaluate the model performance in simulating soil water salt nh4 n and no3 n contents the root mean square error rmse normalized root mean square error nrmse index of agreement d determination coefficient r 2 and slope b based on

measurements o avg represents the average observed value and p avg represents the average simulated value the minimum value of rmse is 0 and the agreement is better when it is close to 0 the model performance is considered excellent with nrmse 10 good if nrmse is in the range of 10 20 fair if the nrmse is in the range of 20 30 and poor if nrmse 30 and the value of d is in the range of 0 1 0 with 1 0 representing a good fit of the data wang et al 2017 the indicator b is used to evaluate whether model predictions are under or overestimating measured data 2 4 simulation scenarios generally fertigation frequency irrigation amount and water quality were the main factors affecting soil nitrogen and salt leaching under drip irrigation additionally the combination of irrigation amount and water quality at different growth stages is an effective way to maintain the soil salt balance in the root zone che et al 2021a therefore after calibration and validation 75 simulation scenarios were set up to investigate the nlf ssc and lbi in this study these scenarios include three different fertigation frequencies with five combinations of irrigation amount and water salinity during the squaring stage from june 15 to july 15 and five combinations during the flower boll stage from july 15 to august 27 fig 2 based on the experimental factors mentioned in section 2 2 for a given nitrogen application rate of 375 kg ha 1 the fertigation splits were set as three fertigation splits t3 five fertigation splits t5 and seven fertigation splits t7 the detailed fertigation dates are shown in table 2 according to two levels of irrigation amount of 100 etc and 150 etc under groundwater 2 54 ds m 1 and brackish water 6 0 ds m 1 in the experiments at the squaring stage when the irrigation amount was 100 etc the two water salinities were 6 0 ds m 1 s1 and 10 0 ds m 1 s2 while the irrigation amount was 150 etc and the three water salinities were 2 54 ds m 1 s3 6 0 ds m 1 s4 and 10 0 ds m 1 s5 at the flower boll stage when the irrigation amount was 100 etc the three water salinities were 2 54 ds m 1 b1 6 0 ds m 1 b2 and 10 0 ds m 1 b3 while the irrigation amount was 150 etc and the two water salinities were 6 0 ds m 1 b4 and 10 0 ds m 1 b5 considering the integrity of the data the soil moisture salinity and nitrogen distributions on june 5 2019 were utilized as the initial conditions all simulation periods were performed from june 5 to september 8 2019 3 results 3 1 model calibration the simulated and observed soil water content swc soil salinity ec1 5 and no3 n at various depths of treatment i3f2s during the 2019 season are shown in figs 3 and 4 it can be found that the simulated values achieved good agreement with the observed values at depths of 0 40 cm the consistency between the simulated swc and observed swc was better than that at depths of 40 100 cm the model performance statistics i e rmse nrmse and d for swc ec1 5 nh4 n and no3 n at depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm for calibration i3f2s are shown in table 3 the rmse values were in the range of 0 010 0 022 cm3 cm 3 0 043 0 244 ds m 1 0 015 0 099 mg kg 1 and 0 767 1 390 mg kg 1 for swc ec1 5 nh4 n and no3 n respectively the rmse values of the water and no3 n contents in the surface layer were generally larger than those in the bottom layer this is most likely due to the fewer changes in water and no3 n content at deeper depths with sparse root distribution during the cotton growth stages the nrmse values were 2 1 11 9 4 5 14 4 20 4 39 8 and 14 4 27 2 for swc ec1 5 nh4 n and no3 n respectively similarly the higher values of d 0 625 0 939 0 793 0 996 0 690 0 993 and 0 860 0 955 for swc ec1 5 nh4 n and no3 n respectively also showed that the model performed well these results indicated that the model was well calibrated and the calibrated parameters of soil hydraulic salt and nitrogen transport and transformation are shown in tables 4 and 5 3 2 model validation the comparison between the observed and simulated swc ec1 5 and no3 n along the 1 1 line is depicted in fig 5 validation data of i1f1g i1f1s i3f2g i4f4g and i4f4s there was fairly perfect consistency between the simulated and observed values the determination coefficients r 2 of swc ec1 5 and no3 n were 0 735 0 898 0 606 0 866 and 0 690 0 893 respectively in addition the rmse values were in the ranges of 0 015 0 022 cm3 cm 3 0 098 0 139 ds m 1 and 1 222 2 314 mg kg 1 respectively table 3 the nrmse values of the swc ec1 5 and no3 n content for the validation treatments were in the ranges of 4 7 13 4 9 3 15 3 and 21 7 31 0 respectively moreover the d values were in the ranges of 0 921 0 967 0 891 0 966 and 0 910 0 960 respectively the b values of swc ec1 5 and no3 n were 0 970 1 046 0 925 1 045 and 0 945 1 084 respectively these results showed that the parameters of soil hydraulic salt and nitrogen transport and transformation were well validated 3 3 the nlf values under different fertigation frequency scenarios the nitrogen leaching fraction nlf can be regarded as an index to control nitrogen loss the influence of fertigation frequency on the nlf of the root zone 0 40 cm is shown in fig 6 the nlfs were in the range of 42 71 and 24 49 at the squaring stage and flower boll stage respectively the nlf of the squaring stage was higher than that of the flower boll stage the possible reason is that the crop water and nitrogen uptake were lower at the squaring stage the setting of fertigation frequency was based on the whole crop growth stage and appropriately increasing fertigation frequency could reduce nitrogen loss with consideration of the accumulative effect at the flower boll stage as shown in fig 6b increasing the number of fertigation splits from three t3 to five t5 led to a decrease in the nitrogen leaching fraction by 24 32 while an increase rate of 27 38 was produced when increasing fertigation splits to seven t7 this result indicated that a five fertigation split is an economical and viable option in addition increasing the fertigation frequency was more effective in reducing the nlf under conditions of an irrigation amount of 100 etc and a water salinity of 2 54 ds m 1 at the flower boll stage b1 the nlf of the five fertigation splits was 30 32 and 25 27 lower than that of the three and seven fertigation splits respectively 3 4 the ssc values under different irrigation amounts and water quality scenarios the discrepancy between the threshold and soil salinity ssc was mainly affected by the irrigation amount and water quality fig 7 the scenarios of the combined irrigation amount and water salinity under five fertigation splits t5 were analyzed in this section the values of ssc at the squaring stage are presented in fig 7a increasing the irrigation amount to 150 etc and water salinity to 10 0 ds m 1 simultaneously at the squaring stage s5 created the lowest absolute value of ssc ssc with a value of 0 014 ds m 1 as shown in fig 7b the ssc values varied under different scenarios at the flower boll stage combining an irrigation amount of 100 etc and a water salinity of 6 0 ds m 1 at the squaring stage s1 applying water salinities of 2 54 6 0 and 10 0 ds m 1 with an irrigation amount of 100 etc at the flower boll stage scenarios of s1b1t5 s1b2t5 and s1b3t5 yielded ssc values of 0 236 0 129 and 0 014 ds m 1 respectively increasing the irrigation amount to 150 etc with water salinities of 6 0 and 10 0 ds m 1 at the flower boll stage scenarios of s1b4t5 and s1b5t5 produced ssc values of 0 112 and 0 037 ds m 1 respectively the scenario of s1b3t5 generated the lower ssc by 62 94 when the water salinity was increased to 10 0 ds m 1 at the squaring stage with an irrigation amount of 100 etc s2 applying a water salinity of 6 0 ds m 1 at the flower boll stage s2b2t5 produced the lowest ssc of 0 010 ds m 1 which was 21 94 lower than that of s2b1t5 s2b3t5 s2b4t5 and s2b5t5 this result indicated that when applying an irrigation amount of 100 etc the alternate use of water salinities of 6 0 ds m 1 and 10 0 ds m 1 at the squaring stage and flower boll stage yielded a lower ssc when the irrigation amount was increased to 150 etc at the squaring stage with a water salinity of 2 54 ds m 1 s3 the lowest ssc was obtained under an irrigation amount of 150 etc with a water salinity of 10 0 ds m 1 at the flower boll stage s3b5t5 with a value of 0 088 ds m 1 similarly when the irrigation amount was increased to 150 etc at the squaring stage with a water salinity of 6 0 ds m 1 s4 the scenario of s4b3t5 provided the lowest value of ssc i e 0 018 ds m 1 when the irrigation amount was increased to 150 etc and the water salinity was increased to 10 0 ds m 1 simultaneously at the squaring stage s5 applying an irrigation amount of 100 etc with a water salinity of 2 54 ds m 1 at the flower boll stage scenario s5b1t5 generated a lower value of ssc 0 019 ds m 1 which was 75 91 lower than that of s5b2t5 s5b3t5 s5b4t5 and s5b5t5 this result indicated that the irrigation scheme of a higher irrigation amount and water salinity at the squaring stage coupled with a lower irrigation amount and water salinity at the flower boll stage was beneficial for decreasing the ssc in addition it can be found that the optimal scenario is s2b2t5 3 5 the comprehensive index of lbi under different simulation scenarios the comprehensive index of lbi was evaluated under different scenarios of fertigation frequency and the combination of irrigation amount and water quality fig 8 the lower the index value is the better the soil salt and nitrogen leaching can reach an optimal equilibrium state the values of lbi at the squaring stage are presented in fig 8a the highest irrigation amount of 150 etc and water salinity of 10 0 ds m 1 at the squaring stage s5 yielded the minimum value of lbi with a value of 0 007 ds m 1 this finding showed that increasing the irrigation amount and water salinity simultaneously was beneficial for decreasing the lbi at the squaring stage as shown in fig 8b the lbi values varied under different scenarios at the flower boll stage when applying an irrigation amount of 100 etc with a water salinity of 6 0 ds m 1 at the squaring stage increasing the number of fertigation splits to five could reduce the lbi by 24 30 and 22 26 compared to three and seven splits respectively when increasing the irrigation amount to 150 etc and increasing the water salinity to 10 0 ds m 1 the lbi of the five fertigation splits was lower than that of the three and seven fertigation splits by 25 30 and 21 25 respectively according to the response of lbi to fertigation frequency five splits was the optimal frequency therefore based on five fertigation splits t5 the combined irrigation amount and water salinity were then optimized under conditions of irrigation amounts of 100 etc coupled with water salinities of 6 0 and 10 0 ds m 1 at the squaring stage s1 and s2 the combinations of irrigation amount and water salinity of 100 etc and 10 0 ds m 1 scenario of s1b3t5 and 100 etc and 6 0 ds m 1 scenario of s2b2t5 at the flower boll stage produced lower lbi values of 0 004 and 0 003 ds m 1 respectively among the scenarios of irrigation amounts with water salinities of 100 etc with 2 54 6 0 and 10 0 ds m 1 and 150 etc with 6 0 and 10 0 ds m 1 at the flower boll stage b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 scenarios of s1b3t5 and s2b2t5 generated lower lbis of 67 93 and 32 95 respectively this result indicated that the alternate use of water salinities of 6 0 ds m 1 and 10 0 ds m 1 at the squaring stage and flower boll stage under an irrigation amount of 100 etc was beneficial for reducing the lbi when the irrigation amount was increased to 150 etc at the squaring stage with water salinities of 2 54 6 0 and 10 0 ds m 1 s3 s4 and s5 the s3b5t5 s4b3t5 and s5b1t5 scenarios produced lower lbis of 0 029 0 005 and 0 005 ds m 1 respectively in detail the lbi was reduced by 75 89 when applying an irrigation amount of 100 etc and a water salinity of 10 0 ds m 1 at the flower boll stage s4b3t5 which was compared with the scenarios of s4b1t5 s4b2t5 s4b4t5 and s4b5t5 similarly the lbi was reduced by 77 93 under an irrigation amount of 100 etc and a water salinity of 2 54 ds m 1 at the flower boll stage s5b1t5 which was compared with the scenarios of s5b2t5 s5b3t5 s5b4t5 and s5b5t5 this result indicated that increasing the irrigation amount and water salinity at the squaring stage as well as decreasing the irrigation amount and water salinity at the flower boll stage was beneficial for decreasing the lbi in addition s2b2t5 is the optimal irrigation and fertigation management with the consideration of the nitrogen and salt leaching balance in this study 4 discussion the assessment of nitrogen loss from agriculture is essential to protect agricultural sustainability a variety of models and indicators have been proposed to quantitatively assess nitrogen loss dai et al 2021 yin et al 2021 the nitrogen leaching fraction nlf is a percent index that integrates nitrogen applied and nitrogen loss and is widely used to evaluate the soil environment and agricultural production muratoglu 2020 indicated that decreasing the nlf would be a solution to promote crop yield and nitrogen use efficiency colpaert et al 2021 evaluated the nitrogen use efficiency and nitrogen loss and indicated that the appropriate fertigation time could reduce the nlf in this study a fertigation frequency of five splits reduced the nlf by 21 32 fig 6 in addition decreasing the irrigation amount and water salinity would also be beneficial for reducing the nlf in fact the time of n application within a growing season is also important for controlling n losses and cotton plants mainly absorb fertilizer during flowering for 18 20 d yang et al 2013 the purpose of splitting nitrogen application in this paper is to reasonably arrange the nitrogen application time on the one hand it can improve the nitrogen absorption of crops on the other hand it can increase the frequency of irrigation and fertigation and then reduce the nitrogen leaching loss by reducing the amount of irrigation however soil salt accumulation was not considered in the application of the nlf index for example scenarios s1b5t5 s2b3t5 and s2b5t5 based on a lower irrigation amount resulted in a lower nlf but caused higher soil salinity figs 6 and 7 therefore the related salt index has been considered together with the nitrogen index to propose a new index of lbi in arid regions several indexes for controlling salinity buildup have been widely used in irrigated croplands zhang et al 2022 szypłowska et al 2019 these indexes mainly include the soil desalinization rate salt discharge amount critical depth of soil desalinization and ratio of salt discharge and leaching qian et al 2021 he et al 2016 which are used to evaluate the effectiveness of salinity management the above indicators ignored the influence of salinity on plant growth leaching requirement lr is a common index integrated with the salt tolerance of crops and irrigation water salinity phogat et al 2020 li and ren 2021 in this study we further developed a new index i e the discrepancy between the threshold and soil salinity ssc during different growth stages the ssc index more directly considers the dynamic relationship between soil salinity ec1 5 and the crop salt tolerance threshold which is a sufficient evaluation index compared to the one valued lr using steady state analyses the ssc characterizing the degree of salt leaching was converted into an index i e the lower the better more precise and detailed irrigation scheduling can be formulated according to minimizing the ssc the alternative use of water quality of 6 0 ds m 1 and 10 0 ds m 1 at the squaring stage and flower boll stage produced a lower ssc and a higher irrigation amount and water salinity at the squaring stage coupled with a lower irrigation amount and water salinity at the flower boll stage was beneficial for decreasing the ssc fig 7 based on the index of nlf and ssc an integrated index of lbi was developed to balance the soil salt leaching and nitrogen loss in our study traditionally a large amount of water is used for salt leaching and thus the soil salt content in the root zone is far below the salt tolerance threshold of crops meanwhile most of the soil nitrogen was also leached out of the root zone which seriously affected the crop nitrogen uptake on the other hand the irrigation amount decreased blindly to reduce nitrogen loss which will result in salt accumulation in the root zone and produce salt stress for crop growth the contradiction of salt and nitrogen leaching can be solved through water fertilizer and salt management based on the proposed lbi the merit of lbi is that an appropriate salt leaching strategy based on lbi can retain more nitrogen in the root zone without salt stress and irrigation can be guided by the principle of minimum lbi that is when a proper leaching strategy is advocated the soil salt content in the root zone is slightly below or beyond the threshold value and a higher nitrogen content remains in the root zone this result indicated that a favorite root zone soil environment for crops can be regulated according to the lbi as shown in fig 8 according to the lbi the optimal irrigation and fertigation strategies were s1b3t5 s2b2t5 s4b3t5 and s5b1t5 in which the nlf and ssc were lower than those under the other scenarios with values of 28 5 29 9 and 0 010 0 019 ds m 1 respectively the proposed lbi not only integrated the feedback between crop and soil salinity but also maintained a balance between soil salt and nitrogen the highest lbi of 0 134 ds m 1 was obtained in the s3b1t3 scenario and the lowest lbi of 0 003 ds m 1 was observed in the s2b2t5 scenario fig 8 this indicated that combining an irrigation amount of 100 etc and the alternate use of water salinities of 6 0 ds m 1 and 10 0 ds m 1 was beneficial to produce a better soil environment in field experiments saline water irrigation is not properly used because of its negative effects on crops therefore according to the lbi optimal irrigation and fertigation strategies can be directly selected to avoid inappropriate application with saline water meanwhile two confusing conditions of lbi will occur from the view of mathematics one when the value of ec 1 5 approaches the threshold infinitely lbi would be zero although the value of nlf is very high however in field conditions the irrigation amount did not increase when ssc ranged from 0 02 to 0 0002 ds m 1 and thus nlf will not be higher on the other hand when ssc is high and simultaneous n leaching below the root zone can be negligible lbi would equal zero in field irrigation and fertigation practices a large irrigation amount could produce high values of ssc and thus nitrogen losses would be great therefore the index is simple and operable and is expected to be a parameter in irrigation and fertigation management practices for salt affected regions meanwhile soil properties irrigation practices and crop state variables starting with the sensitivity of plants to salinity stress may influence soil salt leaching and nitrogen loss when applying the original of the index and the index of lbi has considered the effect of these factors whereas the lbi has some limitations in some extreme cases when the index of lbi was calculated to be the same value their nitrogen and salt leaching behaviors would be different therefore when developing a drip irrigation fertilization strategy with the principle of the minimum lbi index it is necessary to determine whether salt leaching and nitrogen loss is dominant factor which will be the direction of further research additionally the lbi index can be incorporated into sophisticated vadose zone models such as hydrus saltmed and swap which also deserves further study 5 conclusions in this study a new index of lbi was developed to address the contradiction between salt leaching and nitrogen losses the hydrus 2d model was calibrated and validated by the experimental data and then used to evaluate the indexes of nlf ssc and lbi under various irrigation and fertigation scenarios the following primary conclusions were obtained 1 the hydrus 2d model performed well in simulating soil water salinity and nitrogen dynamics under different irrigation amounts nitrogen application rates and water quality conditions during the cotton growing season under mulched drip irrigation the simulations confirmed the representativeness of the leaching balance index lbi proposed in this article to solve the dilemma between maximizing salt leaching and minimizing nitrogen loss 2 increasing the fertigation frequency to five splits could reduce the lbi and increasing the fertigation frequency was more effective in reducing the lbi under conditions of a lower irrigation amount and a lower water salinity 3 the optimal irrigation and fertigation strategy can be obtained by following the principle of producing the lowest lbi the alternate use of water salinities of 6 0 ds m 1 and 10 0 ds m 1 at the squaring stage and flower boll stage under an irrigation amount of 100 etc was suggested when increasing the irrigation amount to 150 etc at the squaring stage coupling a lower irrigation amount and water salinity at the flower boll stage was recommended credit authorship contribution statement zheng che methodology software data analysis data

9233,soil salinization has severely constrained agricultural sustainability in arid and semi arid regions generally using additional irrigation water to leach excessive salts is a widely used strategy for alleviating soil salt accumulation in the root zone nevertheless this practice simultaneously increases the risk of nitrogen loss to address this contradiction a new index namely the leaching balance index of soil salinity and nitrogen lbi which was defined by multiplying the nitrogen leaching fraction nlf by the absolute value of the discrepancy between the crop tolerance salinity threshold and soil salinity ssc was proposed the lower the index value is the better the soil salt and nitrogen leaching can reach an optimal equilibrium state soil salt leaching and nitrogen loss were simulated by the hydrus 2d model the two year field observation data of soil moisture salinity ammonium and nitrate nitrogen contents were collected for calibration and validation a model case was presented using the lbi to investigate the appropriate mulched drip irrigation and fertigation management practices with different levels of salty waters for cotton in xinjiang in this study in the testing process the normalized root mean square error nrmse provided by this model was 2 13 5 14 20 40 and 14 27 for soil water content swc soil salinity ec1 5 nh4 n and no3 n respectively and the index of agreement d was 0 63 0 94 0 83 0 99 0 69 0 97 and 0 86 0 96 respectively then the simulation scenarios were established to minimize the nlf and the ssc and thus the lbi the results showed that increasing the number of fertigation splits could reduce the lbi specifically five fertigation splits during the growing season could result in a decrease in the lbi of 21 32 furthermore when applying an irrigation amount of 100 etc the alternate use of water salinities of 6 0 ds m 1 and 10 0 ds m 1 at the squaring stage and flower boll stage produced a lower lbi the irrigation scheme of a higher water salinity and irrigation amount during the squaring stage coupled with a lower water salinity and irrigation amount during the flower boll stage was beneficial for decreasing the lbi the lower the value of lbi is the more sustainable the irrigation and soil management will be the new index of the lbi proposed by our study represents one of the first efforts to solve the contradiction between salt accumulation and nitrogen loss which will ultimately aid in the salt control and efficient utilization of water and nitrogen for arid and semi arid regions keywords soil salinization microirrigation cotton fertigation leaching hydrus data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction shortages of freshwater resources have become critical problems in arid regions quantitatively the supply of brackish water worldwide is approximately 1 39 109 km3 which is considered as an alternative source of freshwater rozema and flowers 2008 to solve the contradiction between water supply and demand caused by the rise in crop planting areas brackish water is increasingly used for agricultural irrigation guo and shen 2016 however the improper management of brackish conditions would induce secondary salinization in fields burt et al 2003 hopmans et al 2021 leaching salt downward from the root zone with extra irrigation water is a frequently used approach for controlling soil salinization ben gal et al 2008 minhas et al 2020 nonetheless more irrigation water for salt leaching might result in a rise in the shallow groundwater table which accelerates soil evaporation and in turn causes salt buildup in the root zone singh 2019 additionally salt leaching practices will undoubtedly increase the risk of nitrate leaching into the groundwater which causes soil fertility decreases and groundwater pollution libutti and monteleone 2017 conversely when leaching after irrigation with brackish water is insufficient salts will accumulate in the root zone aragües et al 2015 therefore salt leaching and nitrogen loss in drip irrigation with saline water are a sophisticated contradiction if there is no effective way to deal with the contradiction shallow groundwater table rising soil salinization soil fertility decreases and groundwater nitrate pollution etc will occur in turn this will lead to the inappropriate utilization of saline water and low nitrogen use efficiency in arid regions the majority of traditional salinity management approaches have centered on maintaining adequate soil salt leaching primarily to reduce crop production losses caused by root zone salt buildup ayars et al 2012 chauhdary et al 2020 reported that leaching salts from the root zone may be accomplished by high frequency irrigation under drip irrigation without adding leaching requirements to total irrigation li et al 2019 developed an efficient strategy for soil salt leaching by alternating irrigation with fresh water and saline water furthermore to evaluate the efficiency of salt leaching a quantitative indicator is essential leaching requirement lr as a soil salinity leaching index was originally proposed by u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 and rhoades 1974 further developed lr and obtained a series of equations for calculating lr which is a widely used evaluation indicator corwin et al 2007 shahrokhnia and wu 2021 meanwhile leaching salts means desalinating the soil to quantify the extent of salt leaching an evaluation index of the soil desalinization rate was applied qian et al 2021 liu et al 2021 additionally yang et al 2019 indicated that the salinity surrounding the wetting bulb of drip irrigation decreased as the irrigation volume increased based on assessing the index of salinity leaching efficiency the higher the values of these indexes were the higher the salt leaching was the dynamic threshold soil salinity proposed by our past research can be a more practical indicator for the quantification of salt control che et al 2021b furthermore a moderate amount of leaching i e reducing the difference between soil salinity and the dynamic threshold will be a suitable option considering that nitrate is highly difficult for the soil to fix barnes et al 1992 strebel et al 1989 it is extremely vulnerable to leaching into groundwater under inappropriate irrigation and fertigation management paramasivam et al 2002 previous studies have shown that the nitrogen application rate application time and fertigation frequency were the main factors controlling nitrogen losses nitrate loss increased from 34 to 49 as more nitrogen fertilizer was applied from 140 to 280 kg ha 1 zvomuya et al 2003 on the other hand as one fertigation split during the growth stage cannot be fully absorbed by crops the risk of nitrogen losses increased and it failed to achieve the maximum yield and nitrogen use efficiency ma et al 2021 therefore appropriate split fertigation according to crop growth stage may enhance crop fertilizer uptake while decreasing fertilizer loss errebhi et al 1998 głąb et al 2020 indicated that the optimal nitrogen fertilizer rate and interval for minimizing nutrient losses and high turfgrass quality were 60 kg ha 1 and 4 4 days respectively irrigation schemes with low irrigation amounts were also essential to alleviate nitrate leaching into groundwater jia et al 2020 in addition evaluation indexes might be established to investigate nitrogen losses the nitrogen leaching fraction is a more commonly used index to evaluate nitrogen losses fraters et al 2015 van der salm et al 2007 moreover delgado et al 2006 developed and employed a nitrogen index which was used to analyze nitrogen losses in farmland systems figueroa viramontes et al 2011 nitrogen loss was effectively controlled by these indexes in total several indexes of salt and nitrogen control published in the literatures and their merits and limitations are shown in table 1 in general the practice of reducing nitrogen leaching may aggravate soil salt buildup in the root zone which inhibits crop growth blindly reducing nitrogen leaching in turn raises the risk of salt accumulation especially in arid semi arid regions and salt affected areas there is still little information on the index of nitrogen loss control with consideration of salt stress most of the studies combining nitrogen loss and salt leaching were based on results obtained from field investigations liu et al 2020 compared to the limitations of field investigations mathematical models offer the benefit of saving labor money and time related dynamics models have been confirmed to be valuable tools to predict the leaching of salt and nitrogen simultaneously ramos et al 2011 lekakis and antonopoulos 2015 the hydrus model was utilized to investigate the nitrate leaching potential by gärdenäs et al 2005 and it indicated that fertigation events at the end of the irrigation cycle reduced the potential for nitrate leaching xu et al 2020 explored optimal irrigation and fertigation strategies for reducing water and nitrogen leaching using the rzwqm2 model in addition li and ren 2021 proposed a strategy of adjusting irrigation according to rainfall to control salt leaching based on a distributed agro hydrological model of swap wofost a new mass balance model of ubmod was proposed by mao et al 2020 and was used to simulate the processes of salt leaching and accumulation furthermore when performing a comprehensive evaluation of salt nitrogen leaching soil water fertilizer and salt dynamics must be simulated simultaneously xu et al 2015 simulated the transport of soil water salt and nitrate by using the hydrus 1d model to investigate optimal irrigation strategies phogat et al 2014 simulated the seasonal dynamics of water nitrate and salinity under drip irrigation by applying hydrus 2d ramos et al 2012 modeled the soil water content ammonium nitrogen content nitrate nitrogen content and soil water electrical conductivity by utilizing hydrus 2d therefore numerical simulation can be used as a reliable method to verify the relevant salt and nitrogen leaching indexes the overarching purpose of this research is to solve the contradiction between salt leaching and nitrogen losses the specific goals were 1 to develop the leaching balance index of soil salinity and nitrogen lbi 2 to evaluate the performance of the coupling model of water fertilizer and salt to confirm the rationality of the lbi and 3 to formulate the irrigation and fertigation strategies based on the lbi 2 methodology and model 2 1 leaching balance index of soil salinity and nitrogen the parent material of soil is generally characterized as having medium or high soil salinity in arid and semi arid regions ding et al 2011 which requires irrigation water to remove the salt from the root zone however a higher irrigation amount beyond crop evapotranspiration etc will lead to nitrogen loss which will suppress plant growth and yield formation conversely if irrigation amounts are decreased the salt in the root zone cannot be leached sufficiently so the soil salinity may be above the crop tolerance salinity threshold which also leads to yield reduction therefore we first introduced the threshold soil salinity and treated the discrepancy between soil salinity and the threshold as an indicator for salt control to reflect the appropriate soil salinity environment for crop development then nitrogen loss needs to be considered in the salt control process finally a comprehensive index integrating the nitrogen leaching fraction and the discrepancy between the threshold and soil salinity was proposed the nitrogen leaching fraction nlf was described according to the soil nitrogen balance as follows colpaert et al 2021 1 n l f n a d d e d n i n i n u p t a k e n r e s i d u a l n a d d e d 100 where n added represents the amount of nitrogen applied kg ha 1 n ini represents the soil inorganic nitrogen content in the root zone at the beginning of the given growth stage kg ha 1 n uptake represents the plant nitrogen uptake during the given growth stage kg ha 1 and n residual represents the residual soil inorganic nitrogen content in the root zone at the end of the given growth stage kg ha 1 as an indicator of characterizing the relationship between salt leaching and salt tolerance of crops the discrepancy between the threshold and soil salinity ssc ds m 1 was calculated as follows 2 δ s s c s s c s s c t h where ssc is soil salt content in the root zone which represents the electrical conductivity of soil water extracts of a 1 5 ratio w v ec 1 5 ds m 1 and ssc th represents the threshold soil salinity ds m 1 which is 0 74 and 1 02 ds m 1 at the squaring and flower boll stages for cotton respectively according to che et al 2021b in this study the root zone was located in the 0 40 cm soil layer based on the nitrogen leaching indicator of nlf and the salt leaching indicator of ssc the leaching balance index of soil salinity and nitrogen lbi ds m 1 was developed and given as 3 l b i n l f δ s s c the optimal equilibrium state of salt nitrogen leaching was obtained by minimizing the lbi which can be used to solve the contradiction between salt and nitrogen leaching 2 2 field experimental description a two year consecutive field

2019 fertilizer was applied before seeding and the amount of broadcast applied urea was 75 kg ha 1 n in 2018 and 120 kg ha 1 n in 2019 the dissolved urea was fertigated at three splits through mulched drip irrigation systems according to a ratio of 3 4 3 during the squaring early flowering boll and late flowering boll stages the collected soil samples were utilized to measure the soil water salt and nitrogen contents soil water contents were measured by a time domain reflectometer trime fm imko gmbh ettlingen germany in addition soil water content measured by the gravimetric method one day

boundary with drastic changes in the soil water potential gradient a relatively denser grid 3 cm and a coarser grid 5 cm were designed near the soil surface and the bottom of the domain respectively wang et al 2014 in total fifteen observation points of soil water content salt nh4 n and no3 n were designed in the cross section corresponding to the soil sampling fig 1 the boundary conditions of the simulation domain are shown in fig 1 the sides of the soil profile were set as no flux boundary of water salt nh4 n and no3 n atmospheric boundary conditions were assigned to the bare soil fig 1 the bottom boundary was set as a free drainage boundary water and solutes entered the simulation domain through a saturation zone during an irrigation event li et al 2005 according to field observations during irrigation a constant saturated zone width was set as 40 cm the constant flux q cm d 1 in each irrigation event in the saturation zone was defined as follows chen et al 2020 12 q q

from the irrigation amount of 125 etc and nitrogen application rate of 255 kg ha 1 with brackish water treatment i3f2s in 2019 were used to calibrate the model detailed experimental treatments can be found in che et al 2021a based on the measured soil particle size distribution and bulk density che et al 2021a the initial input soil hydraulic parameters were determined by neural network prediction schaap et al 2001 based on the measured soil water salt and nitrate nitrogen contents in different soil layers the parameters of soil hydraulic θ r θ s α n k s salt and nitrogen transport and transformation d t d l d w k d μ w μ s were calibrated by trial and error it should be noted that the connectivity parameter l was not calibrated by trial and error if the result was 0 5 after calibration treatments including different water fertilizer and salt gradients i1f1g i1f1s i3f2g i4f4g and i4f4s in 2018 and 2019 were utilized to validate the model to evaluate the model performance in simulating soil water salt nh4 n and no3 n contents the root mean square error rmse normalized root mean square error nrmse index of agreement d determination coefficient r 2 and slope b based on

measurements o avg represents the average observed value and p avg represents the average simulated value the minimum value of rmse is 0 and the agreement is better when it is close to 0 the model performance is considered excellent with nrmse 10 good if nrmse is in the range of 10 20 fair if the nrmse is in the range of 20 30 and poor if nrmse 30 and the value of d is in the range of 0 1 0 with 1 0 representing a good fit of the data wang et al 2017 the indicator b is used to evaluate whether model predictions are under or overestimating measured data 2 4 simulation scenarios generally fertigation frequency irrigation amount and water quality were the main factors affecting soil nitrogen and salt leaching under drip irrigation additionally the combination of irrigation amount and water quality at different growth stages is an effective way to maintain the soil salt balance in the root zone che et al 2021a therefore after calibration and validation 75 simulation scenarios were set up to investigate the nlf ssc and lbi in this study these scenarios include three different fertigation frequencies with five combinations of irrigation amount and water salinity during the squaring stage from june 15 to july 15 and five combinations during the flower boll stage from july 15 to august 27 fig 2 based on the experimental factors mentioned in section 2 2 for a given nitrogen application rate of 375 kg ha 1 the fertigation splits were set as three fertigation splits t3 five fertigation splits t5 and seven fertigation splits t7 the detailed fertigation dates are shown in table 2 according to two levels of irrigation amount of 100 etc and 150 etc under groundwater 2 54 ds m 1 and brackish water 6 0 ds m 1 in the experiments at the squaring stage when the irrigation amount was 100 etc the two water salinities were 6 0 ds m 1 s1 and 10 0 ds m 1 s2 while the irrigation amount was 150 etc and the three water salinities were 2 54 ds m 1 s3 6 0 ds m 1 s4 and 10 0 ds m 1 s5 at the flower boll stage when the irrigation amount was 100 etc the three water salinities were 2 54 ds m 1 b1 6 0 ds m 1 b2 and 10 0 ds m 1 b3 while the irrigation amount was 150 etc and the two water salinities were 6 0 ds m 1 b4 and 10 0 ds m 1 b5 considering the integrity of the data the soil moisture salinity and nitrogen distributions on june 5 2019 were utilized as the initial conditions all simulation periods were performed from june 5 to september 8 2019 3 results 3 1 model calibration the simulated and observed soil water content swc soil salinity ec1 5 and no3 n at various depths of treatment i3f2s during the 2019 season are shown in figs 3 and 4 it can be found that the simulated values achieved good agreement with the observed values at depths of 0 40 cm the consistency between the simulated swc and observed swc was better than that at depths of 40 100 cm the model performance statistics i e rmse nrmse and d for swc ec1 5 nh4 n and no3 n at depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm for calibration i3f2s are shown in table 3 the rmse values were in the range of 0 010 0 022 cm3 cm 3 0 043 0 244 ds m 1 0 015 0 099 mg kg 1 and 0 767 1 390 mg kg 1 for swc ec1 5 nh4 n and no3 n respectively the rmse values of the water and no3 n contents in the surface layer were generally larger than those in the bottom layer this is most likely due to the fewer changes in water and no3 n content at deeper depths with sparse root distribution during the cotton growth stages the nrmse values were 2 1 11 9 4 5 14 4 20 4 39 8 and 14 4 27 2 for swc ec1 5 nh4 n and no3 n respectively similarly the higher values of d 0 625 0 939 0 793 0 996 0 690 0 993 and 0 860 0 955 for swc ec1 5 nh4 n and no3 n respectively also showed that the model performed well these results indicated that the model was well calibrated and the calibrated parameters of soil hydraulic salt and nitrogen transport and transformation are shown in tables 4 and 5 3 2 model validation the comparison between the observed and simulated swc ec1 5 and no3 n along the 1 1 line is depicted in fig 5 validation data of i1f1g i1f1s i3f2g i4f4g and i4f4s there was fairly perfect consistency between the simulated and observed values the determination coefficients r 2 of swc ec1 5 and no3 n were 0 735 0 898 0 606 0 866 and 0 690 0 893 respectively in addition the rmse values were in the ranges of 0 015 0 022 cm3 cm 3 0 098 0 139 ds m 1 and 1 222 2 314 mg kg 1 respectively table 3 the nrmse values of the swc ec1 5 and no3 n content for the validation treatments were in the ranges of 4 7 13 4 9 3 15 3 and 21 7 31 0 respectively moreover the d values were in the ranges of 0 921 0 967 0 891 0 966 and 0 910 0 960 respectively the b values of swc ec1 5 and no3 n were 0 970 1 046 0 925 1 045 and 0 945 1 084 respectively these results showed that the parameters of soil hydraulic salt and nitrogen transport and transformation were well validated 3 3 the nlf values under different fertigation frequency scenarios the nitrogen leaching fraction nlf can be regarded as an index to control nitrogen loss the influence of fertigation frequency on the nlf of the root zone 0 40 cm is shown in fig 6 the nlfs were in the range of 42 71 and 24 49 at the squaring stage and flower boll stage respectively the nlf of the squaring stage was higher than that of the flower boll stage the possible reason is that the crop water and nitrogen uptake were lower at the squaring stage the setting of fertigation frequency was based on the whole crop growth stage and appropriately increasing fertigation frequency could reduce nitrogen loss with consideration of the accumulative effect at the flower boll stage as shown in fig 6b increasing the number of fertigation splits from three t3 to five t5 led to a decrease in the nitrogen leaching fraction by 24 32 while an increase rate of 27 38 was produced when increasing fertigation splits to seven t7 this result indicated that a five fertigation split is an economical and viable option in addition increasing the fertigation frequency was more effective in reducing the nlf under conditions of an irrigation amount of 100 etc and a water salinity of 2 54 ds m 1 at the flower boll stage b1 the nlf of the five fertigation splits was 30 32 and 25 27 lower than that of the three and seven fertigation splits respectively 3 4 the ssc values under different irrigation amounts and water quality scenarios the discrepancy between the threshold and soil salinity ssc was mainly affected by the irrigation amount and water quality fig 7 the scenarios of the combined irrigation amount and water salinity under five fertigation splits t5 were analyzed in this section the values of ssc at the squaring stage are presented in fig 7a increasing the irrigation amount to 150 etc and water salinity to 10 0 ds m 1 simultaneously at the squaring stage s5 created the lowest absolute value of ssc ssc with a value of 0 014 ds m 1 as shown in fig 7b the ssc values varied under different scenarios at the flower boll stage combining an irrigation amount of 100 etc and a water salinity of 6 0 ds m 1 at the squaring stage s1 applying water salinities of 2 54 6 0 and 10 0 ds m 1 with an irrigation amount of 100 etc at the flower boll stage scenarios of s1b1t5 s1b2t5 and s1b3t5 yielded ssc values of 0 236 0 129 and 0 014 ds m 1 respectively increasing the irrigation amount to 150 etc with water salinities of 6 0 and 10 0 ds m 1 at the flower boll stage scenarios of s1b4t5 and s1b5t5 produced ssc values of 0 112 and 0 037 ds m 1 respectively the scenario of s1b3t5 generated the lower ssc by 62 94 when the water salinity was increased to 10 0 ds m 1 at the squaring stage with an irrigation amount of 100 etc s2 applying a water salinity of 6 0 ds m 1 at the flower boll stage s2b2t5 produced the lowest ssc of 0 010 ds m 1 which was 21 94 lower than that of s2b1t5 s2b3t5 s2b4t5 and s2b5t5 this result indicated that when applying an irrigation amount of 100 etc the alternate use of water salinities of 6 0 ds m 1 and 10 0 ds m 1 at the squaring stage and flower boll stage yielded a lower ssc when the irrigation amount was increased to 150 etc at the squaring stage with a water salinity of 2 54 ds m 1 s3 the lowest ssc was obtained under an irrigation amount of 150 etc with a water salinity of 10 0 ds m 1 at the flower boll stage s3b5t5 with a value of 0 088 ds m 1 similarly when the irrigation amount was increased to 150 etc at the squaring stage with a water salinity of 6 0 ds m 1 s4 the scenario of s4b3t5 provided the lowest value of ssc i e 0 018 ds m 1 when the irrigation amount was increased to 150 etc and the water salinity was increased to 10 0 ds m 1 simultaneously at the squaring stage s5 applying an irrigation amount of 100 etc with a water salinity of 2 54 ds m 1 at the flower boll stage scenario s5b1t5 generated a lower value of ssc 0 019 ds m 1 which was 75 91 lower than that of s5b2t5 s5b3t5 s5b4t5 and s5b5t5 this result indicated that the irrigation scheme of a higher irrigation amount and water salinity at the squaring stage coupled with a lower irrigation amount and water salinity at the flower boll stage was beneficial for decreasing the ssc in addition it can be found that the optimal scenario is s2b2t5 3 5 the comprehensive index of lbi under different simulation scenarios the comprehensive index of lbi was evaluated under different scenarios of fertigation frequency and the combination of irrigation amount and water quality fig 8 the lower the index value is the better the soil salt and nitrogen leaching can reach an optimal equilibrium state the values of lbi at the squaring stage are presented in fig 8a the highest irrigation amount of 150 etc and water salinity of 10 0 ds m 1 at the squaring stage s5 yielded the minimum value of lbi with a value of 0 007 ds m 1 this finding showed that increasing the irrigation amount and water salinity simultaneously was beneficial for decreasing the lbi at the squaring stage as shown in fig 8b the lbi values varied under different scenarios at the flower boll stage when applying an irrigation amount of 100 etc with a water salinity of 6 0 ds m 1 at the squaring stage increasing the number of fertigation splits to five could reduce the lbi by 24 30 and 22 26 compared to three and seven splits respectively when increasing the irrigation amount to 150 etc and increasing the water salinity to 10 0 ds m 1 the lbi of the five fertigation splits was lower than that of the three and seven fertigation splits by 25 30 and 21 25 respectively according to the response of lbi to fertigation frequency five splits was the optimal frequency therefore based on five fertigation splits t5 the combined irrigation amount and water salinity were then optimized under conditions of irrigation amounts of 100 etc coupled with water salinities of 6 0 and 10 0 ds m 1 at the squaring stage s1 and s2 the combinations of irrigation amount and water salinity of 100 etc and 10 0 ds m 1 scenario of s1b3t5 and 100 etc and 6 0 ds m 1 scenario of s2b2t5 at the flower boll stage produced lower lbi values of 0 004 and 0 003 ds m 1 respectively among the scenarios of irrigation amounts with water salinities of 100 etc with 2 54 6 0 and 10 0 ds m 1 and 150 etc with 6 0 and 10 0 ds m 1 at the flower boll stage b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 scenarios of s1b3t5 and s2b2t5 generated lower lbis of 67 93 and 32 95 respectively this result indicated that the alternate use of water salinities of 6 0 ds m 1 and 10 0 ds m 1 at the squaring stage and flower boll stage under an irrigation amount of 100 etc was beneficial for reducing the lbi when the irrigation amount was increased to 150 etc at the squaring stage with water salinities of 2 54 6 0 and 10 0 ds m 1 s3 s4 and s5 the s3b5t5 s4b3t5 and s5b1t5 scenarios produced lower lbis of 0 029 0 005 and 0 005 ds m 1 respectively in detail the lbi was reduced by 75 89 when applying an irrigation amount of 100 etc and a water salinity of 10 0 ds m 1 at the flower boll stage s4b3t5 which was compared with the scenarios of s4b1t5 s4b2t5 s4b4t5 and s4b5t5 similarly the lbi was reduced by 77 93 under an irrigation amount of 100 etc and a water salinity of 2 54 ds m 1 at the flower boll stage s5b1t5 which was compared with the scenarios of s5b2t5 s5b3t5 s5b4t5 and s5b5t5 this result indicated that increasing the irrigation amount and water salinity at the squaring stage as well as decreasing the irrigation amount and water salinity at the flower boll stage was beneficial for decreasing the lbi in addition s2b2t5 is the optimal irrigation and fertigation management with the consideration of the nitrogen and salt leaching balance in this study 4 discussion the assessment of nitrogen loss from agriculture is essential to protect agricultural sustainability a variety of models and indicators have been proposed to quantitatively assess nitrogen loss dai et al 2021 yin et al 2021 the nitrogen leaching fraction nlf is a percent index that integrates nitrogen applied and nitrogen loss and is widely used to evaluate the soil environment and agricultural production muratoglu 2020 indicated that decreasing the nlf would be a solution to promote crop yield and nitrogen use efficiency colpaert et al 2021 evaluated the nitrogen use efficiency and nitrogen loss and indicated that the appropriate fertigation time could reduce the nlf in this study a fertigation frequency of five splits reduced the nlf by 21 32 fig 6 in addition decreasing the irrigation amount and water salinity would also be beneficial for reducing the nlf in fact the time of n application within a growing season is also important for controlling n losses and cotton plants mainly absorb fertilizer during flowering for 18 20 d yang et al 2013 the purpose of splitting nitrogen application in this paper is to reasonably arrange the nitrogen application time on the one hand it can improve the nitrogen absorption of crops on the other hand it can increase the frequency of irrigation and fertigation and then reduce the nitrogen leaching loss by reducing the amount of irrigation however soil salt accumulation was not considered in the application of the nlf index for example scenarios s1b5t5 s2b3t5 and s2b5t5 based on a lower irrigation amount resulted in a lower nlf but caused higher soil salinity figs 6 and 7 therefore the related salt index has been considered together with the nitrogen index to propose a new index of lbi in arid regions several indexes for controlling salinity buildup have been widely used in irrigated croplands zhang et al 2022 szypłowska et al 2019 these indexes mainly include the soil desalinization rate salt discharge amount critical depth of soil desalinization and ratio of salt discharge and leaching qian et al 2021 he et al 2016 which are used to evaluate the effectiveness of salinity management the above indicators ignored the influence of salinity on plant growth leaching requirement lr is a common index integrated with the salt tolerance of crops and irrigation water salinity phogat et al 2020 li and ren 2021 in this study we further developed a new index i e the discrepancy between the threshold and soil salinity ssc during different growth stages the ssc index more directly considers the dynamic relationship between soil salinity ec1 5 and the crop salt tolerance threshold which is a sufficient evaluation index compared to the one valued lr using steady state analyses the ssc characterizing the degree of salt leaching was converted into an index i e the lower the better more precise and detailed irrigation scheduling can be formulated according to minimizing the ssc the alternative use of water quality of 6 0 ds m 1 and 10 0 ds m 1 at the squaring stage and flower boll stage produced a lower ssc and a higher irrigation amount and water salinity at the squaring stage coupled with a lower irrigation amount and water salinity at the flower boll stage was beneficial for decreasing the ssc fig 7 based on the index of nlf and ssc an integrated index of lbi was developed to balance the soil salt leaching and nitrogen loss in our study traditionally a large amount of water is used for salt leaching and thus the soil salt content in the root zone is far below the salt tolerance threshold of crops meanwhile most of the soil nitrogen was also leached out of the root zone which seriously affected the crop nitrogen uptake on the other hand the irrigation amount decreased blindly to reduce nitrogen loss which will result in salt accumulation in the root zone and produce salt stress for crop growth the contradiction of salt and nitrogen leaching can be solved through water fertilizer and salt management based on the proposed lbi the merit of lbi is that an appropriate salt leaching strategy based on lbi can retain more nitrogen in the root zone without salt stress and irrigation can be guided by the principle of minimum lbi that is when a proper leaching strategy is advocated the soil salt content in the root zone is slightly below or beyond the threshold value and a higher nitrogen content remains in the root zone this result indicated that a favorite root zone soil environment for crops can be regulated according to the lbi as shown in fig 8 according to the lbi the optimal irrigation and fertigation strategies were s1b3t5 s2b2t5 s4b3t5 and s5b1t5 in which the nlf and ssc were lower than those under the other scenarios with values of 28 5 29 9 and 0 010 0 019 ds m 1 respectively the proposed lbi not only integrated the feedback between crop and soil salinity but also maintained a balance between soil salt and nitrogen the highest lbi of 0 134 ds m 1 was obtained in the s3b1t3 scenario and the lowest lbi of 0 003 ds m 1 was observed in the s2b2t5 scenario fig 8 this indicated that combining an irrigation amount of 100 etc and the alternate use of water salinities of 6 0 ds m 1 and 10 0 ds m 1 was beneficial to produce a better soil environment in field experiments saline water irrigation is not properly used because of its negative effects on crops therefore according to the lbi optimal irrigation and fertigation strategies can be directly selected to avoid inappropriate application with saline water meanwhile two confusing conditions of lbi will occur from the view of mathematics one when the value of ec 1 5 approaches the threshold infinitely lbi would be zero although the value of nlf is very high however in field conditions the irrigation amount did not increase when ssc ranged from 0 02 to 0 0002 ds m 1 and thus nlf will not be higher on the other hand when ssc is high and simultaneous n leaching below the root zone can be negligible lbi would equal zero in field irrigation and fertigation practices a large irrigation amount could produce high values of ssc and thus nitrogen losses would be great therefore the index is simple and operable and is expected to be a parameter in irrigation and fertigation management practices for salt affected regions meanwhile soil properties irrigation practices and crop state variables starting with the sensitivity of plants to salinity stress may influence soil salt leaching and nitrogen loss when applying the original of the index and the index of lbi has considered the effect of these factors whereas the lbi has some limitations in some extreme cases when the index of lbi was calculated to be the same value their nitrogen and salt leaching behaviors would be different therefore when developing a drip irrigation fertilization strategy with the principle of the minimum lbi index it is necessary to determine whether salt leaching and nitrogen loss is dominant factor which will be the direction of further research additionally the lbi index can be incorporated into sophisticated vadose zone models such as hydrus saltmed and swap which also deserves further study 5 conclusions in this study a new index of lbi was developed to address the contradiction between salt leaching and nitrogen losses the hydrus 2d model was calibrated and validated by the experimental data and then used to evaluate the indexes of nlf ssc and lbi under various irrigation and fertigation scenarios the following primary conclusions were obtained 1 the hydrus 2d model performed well in simulating soil water salinity and nitrogen dynamics under different irrigation amounts nitrogen application rates and water quality conditions during the cotton growing season under mulched drip irrigation the simulations confirmed the representativeness of the leaching balance index lbi proposed in this article to solve the dilemma between maximizing salt leaching and minimizing nitrogen loss 2 increasing the fertigation frequency to five splits could reduce the lbi and increasing the fertigation frequency was more effective in reducing the lbi under conditions of a lower irrigation amount and a lower water salinity 3 the optimal irrigation and fertigation strategy can be obtained by following the principle of producing the lowest lbi the alternate use of water salinities of 6 0 ds m 1 and 10 0 ds m 1 at the squaring stage and flower boll stage under an irrigation amount of 100 etc was suggested when increasing the irrigation amount to 150 etc at the squaring stage coupling a lower irrigation amount and water salinity at the flower boll stage was recommended credit authorship contribution statement zheng che methodology software data analysis data

9234,although saline water can be used as an alternative of freshwater resources for agricultural irrigation especially in arid and semiarid areas however unsuitable saline water quality and unreasonable irrigation technology may result in the detrimental effects on plant growth yield and quality of products thus a three year open field experiment was conducted in ningxia to investigate the influence of three irrigation water salinity levels 1 2 and 3 g l and five molar concentration ratios mcr of na ca 1 3 5 7 and 9 on processing tomato planting in terms of crop water consumption tomato yield traits and fruit quality characteristics the results are as follow i the water consumption decreased significantly with the increasing irrigation water salinity and mcr of na ca ii with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca both the average fruit weight marketable yield and total yield decreased linearly as well the ratio of marketable yield to total yield decreased additionally irrigation water with higher salinity 2 g l and 3 g l and lower mcr of na ca 1 and 3 was more conducive to root water uptake and average fruit weight accumulation than that with lower salinity and higher mcr of na ca iii with irrigation water salinity of 1 g l and 2 g l both the vitamin c lycopene fructose sucrose and starch content of tomato fruit have quadratic function relationship with the irrigation water mcr of na ca moreover the threshold of irrigation water mcr of na ca for soluble solids lycopene and starch accumulation was 7 while the content of total soluble sugar fructose and sucrose achieved the maximum value as the mcr of na ca arrived 5 iv with irrigation water salinity of 3 g l the total soluble sugar and glucose of fruit decreased with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca especially the fruit fructose sucrose and starch concentration decreased linearly furthermore the threshold of irrigation water mcr of na ca for vitamin c and soluble solids accumulation was 5 synthetically saline water with salt content of 2 g l and mcr of na ca at 5 was optimal in the present study for mulched drip irrigation on tomato cultivation in the northern yinchuan plain of ningxia obtaining the relatively high yield 9 72 104 kg hm2 and good quality of tomato keywords irrigation water salinity salt component molar concentration tomato drip irrigation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction irrigation water usually plays an important role for crop growth and yield formation ierna and mauromicale 2018 accordingly to maintain the sustainable high yield for crops it is necessary to apply sufficient irrigation water to meet their water requirement during the growth period uddameri et al 2020 however most regions of the world especially in arid and semiarid areas suffering from freshwater shortage due to the uneven spatial distribution of water resources the expansion of agricultural and industries environmental pollution etc mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 dalin et al 2017 ma et al 2020 thus it is essential to seek available alternatives of freshwater resources for crop irrigation as a common unconventional water resource saline water has been used as an alternative of freshwater in agricultural irrigation for hundreds of years khaleghi et al 2020 j s li et al 2019 sekhon et al 2020 yan et al 2021 it is noted that the utilization of shallow ground saline water for irrigation can not only contribute to narrow the gap between the supply and demand of agricultural fresh water resources but also conducive to the renewal of groundwater in the irrigation areas lei et al 2003 generally the applied saline water can supply most of the necessary moisture and some trace elements for crop growth wang et al 2015 which contribute to the plant growth commercial yield and crop quality el mogy et al 2018 j s li et al 2019 zhai et al 2015 nevertheless improper saline water irrigation may result in large amounts of salt ions brought into the topsoil which may induce detrimental effects on crop growth alharby et al 2018 baath et al 2017 kumar and khare 2016 j s li et al 2019 and adverse influences on marketable

e g na so4 2 and cl in cells tavakkoli et al 2011 machekposhti et al 2017 ibn murad et al 2018 according to the researches the disadvantageous effects induced by inappropriate saline water irrigation on plants usually involve the delay of emergence time tavakkoli et al 2011 the decrease of emergence rate bi 2014 the reduction of net photosynthesis baath et al 2017 alharby et al 2018 de pascale et al 2015 the decline of enzymes activity in the plant tavakkoli et al 2011 munns et al 2006 the decrease of nutrients in root absorption d li et al 2022 while the disadvantages of saline water irrigation on the cultivated soil contain the reduction in the amount of soil active microorganisms in the rootzone rietz et al 2003 the decline of water holding capacity guo et al 2017 xing et al 2016 the decrease of soil effective porosity guo et al 2017 xing et al 2016 as one of the nutritious vegetables tomato lycopersicon esculentum is an economically important crop with high nutritional value and is moderately sensitive to salinity maas and hoffman 1977 hanson et al 2006 malash et al 2008 which can be irrigated with saline water with optimal irrigation strategies j s li et al 2019 d li et al 2022 sekhon et al 2020 yan et al 2021 thus the cultivation of tomato with high yield and good quality under saline water irrigation for great economic benefits is a concern for farmers and researches researches have indicated that the tomato yield may decline with the increase of irrigation water salinity especially when the salt content of applied water exceeded the threshold of salt tolerance kang et al 2010 j s li et al 2019 d li et al 2022 maas and hoffman 1977 maas 1984 has reported that the tomato yield decreased by 10 for every 1 ds m increase of irrigation water ece as the ece of extracting solution in the root zone exceed 2 5 ds m while liu et al 2013 has recognized that the salt tolerance of tomato plant fluctuated significantly during the growing period particularly tomato roots were sensitive to soil water and salt stress during flowering and fruiting period and the corresponding threshold of irrigation water salinity was 3 g l while the critical value in fruit expanding period was 5 0 g l tomato quality traits mainly include flavor quality indexes and nutrition characteristics accordingly the soluble solids ss total soluble sugar ts and titratable acid ta play crucial roles in the tomato flavor quality velterop and vos 2001 w j li et al 2022 while the vitamin c vc and lycopene are important nutrition indicators of tomato which are essential nutrients for humans with excellent antioxidant function j s li et al 2019 although the increase of irrigation water salinity may result in the decrease of tomato yield the tomato flavor quality and nutrient quality are usually improved several studies have confirmed that the increase of irrigation water electric conductivity can promote the increase of organic acid and the accumulation of ss and soluble sugar gawad et al 2005 wang et al 2014 w j li et al 2022 similarity the tomato vc content tend to increase with the increasing irrigation water salinity el mogy et al 2018 j s li et al 2019 w j li et al 2022 tomato yield and fruit quality are not only influenced by salt content of irrigation water but also affected by irrigation water salt components tester and davenport 2003 harun et al 2017 even with the same salt concentration of irrigation water the yield and quality characteristics of tomato may have different response to various salt components of irrigation water as studies have indicated the na usually plays an essential role in the salt tolerance of plants ma et al 2020 niu et al 2017 van zelm et al 2020 the increase of na content in the aboveground parts of plants may result in the occurrence of osmotic stress j s li et al 2019 ma et al 2020 niu et al 2017 van zelm et al 2020 decrease of chlorophyll content reduction of photosynthesis manai et al 2014 liu et al 1998 decline of enzyme activity baath et al 2017 tavakkoli et al 2011 and deficiency of necessary salt ions such as ca2 mg2 k etc cao et al 2019 de pascale et al 2007 hu and schmidhalter 2005 which eventually lead to low yield kumar and khare 2016 generally the ratios of k na and ca2 na in plants are conventional physiological criteria for salt tolerance of plants niu et al 2017 van zelm et al 2020 zhu 2016 since the k deficiency induced by na is closely related to crop growth under salt stress plant tolerance to na stress can be stimulated by increasing the k concentration and the ratio of k na for the aboveground parts hauser and horie 2010 edelstein et al 2011 huang et al 2013 additionally as one of the main nutrient ions for tomato the ca2 usually act as an important role in the growth and development of tomato plants campos et al 2006 especially the tomato fruit disorder blossom end rot ber is generally accompanied with the ca2 deficiency of plant cantore et al 2008 adams and ho 1993 max and horst 2009 to decrease the ratio of na ca2 and reduce the occurrence of ber of tomato the ca2 level of tomato plants can be enhanced by irrigating with high calcium water topdressing with high calcium fertilizer and applying high calcium soil amendments luo et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 to date many experiments have been conducted on saline water irrigation for appropriate irrigation water salinity irrigation strategy etc however litter attention has been paid to the response of crop yield and quality to the irrigation water salt components which is essential for the scientific agriculture irrigation with saline water therefore a three year field experiment was performed under saline water mulched drip irrigation with three irrigation water salinities and five levels of mcr of na ca to study the response of crop water consumption cwc tomato yield traits and fruit quality characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and

planting in this study is shown in fig 3 the healthy tomato growing seedlings hybrid xiuguang no 306 were transplanted to the raised beds three weeks after tomato seeds germination 10 ma 2017 10 ma 2018 and 12 ma 2019 the plant spacing was 60 cm and the row spacing was 40 cm other agronomic practices such as topping and pesticide application were the same as the local traditional tomato cultivation 2 2 2 irrigation as a practical method to guide irrigation soil matric potential regulation has been widely applied for the cultivation of many crops such as maize jiao et al 2007 wan et al 2011 sunflower j g li et al 2019 cotton wang et al 2011 2018 potato wang et al 2007 and tomato zhai et al 2015 wan et al 2008 revealed that the lower limit of soil matric potential with 50 kpa was eligible for tomato growth and fruit yield while kang et al 2005 recognized that with the soil matric potential of 20 kpa under saline water mulched drip irrigation the soil moisture and soil salinity can be well maintained thus three vacuum gauge tensiometers were installed 20 cm underneath the drip tube emitter in each plot and the lower limit of soil matric potential was settled at 20 kpa after tomato seedlings being transplanted fresh water drip irrigation with amount of 30 mm was applied immediately for plants establishment the fifteen tensiometers were observed and recorded three times every day at 8 00 14 00 and 18 00 once the value of tensiometers in each treatment dropped below 20 kpa a single mulched drip irrigation was applied for the treatment with the designed water at 18 30 that afternoon and the amount of irrigation water for each application was 20 mm when the tomato fruits strode into mature stage drip irrigation was terminated to avoid the brown rot 2 2 3 fertilization both diammonium phosphate dap 18 n 46 p 0 k and potassium sulphate 45 k2so4 were uniformly applied as base fertilizer to each plot simultaneously covering the film and the corresponding basal dose was 450 kg hm2 and 90 kg hm2 respectively additionally the urea 46 n of 180 kg hm2 was applied as dressing fertilization with irrigation water at the concentration of 30 mass ratio at fruit set stage 2 3 observation and equipment 2 3 1 fruit yield characteristics generally the harvesting of ripe tomatoes start at 100 days after transplanting and last about 35 days the ripe tomatoes in the present experiment were picked by hand at 7 day intervals from 25 august to 28 september in 2017 26 august to 29 september in 2018 and 24 august to 27 september in 2019 respectively after each packing the tomatoes were classified in marketable or non marketable fruits fruits with mechanical phytosanitary and or physiologic damages for treatments and the fruit number fn per plant for each treatment was recorded moreover the my and non marketable yield of tomatoes were measured and recorded separately after harvest the ty was the cumulative sum of my and non marketable yield besides eleven tomatoes were selected randomly for each treatment after harvest accordingly the tomato average fruit weight aw and average fruit volume av were determined by gravity method and archimedes drainage method respectively 2 3 2 tomato fruit qualities eleven ripe fruits were selected randomly for each treatment to measure the common tomato quality traits including the content of ss lycopene vc ta and ts on 30 september the content of ss and lycopene were determined by refractometric and spectrophotometry method respectively while the concentration of ta and ts was measured by high performance liquid chromatography method and lane eynon method respectively moreover the content of vc was decided by the reductive spectrophotometry method the sugar acid ratio rsa of tomato fruit was evaluated with the follow equation 1 r s a r s t a where rs represents the content of fruit reductive sugar mg g ta is the content of fruit titratable acid mg g additionally eleven clusters of tomato inflorescence were selected randomly and marked in each plot then seven fruit samples were collected from the marked inflorescence for each treatment at 15 25 35 45 and 55 days after the emergence of the marked inflorescence clusters emic the samples for each treatment were weighed and ground with 20 ml of alcohol 80 c2h5oh and some arenaceous quartz in mortars then the tomato pulp

irrigation water salinity on the other hand the cwc decreased significantly with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca especially the cwc declined sharply once the mcr of na ca exceed 5 however with irrigation water mcr of na ca at 1 and 3 there was no significant difference of iq for treatments interestingly the cwc for s2r1 and s2r2 treatment was higher than that for s1r5 treatment similarly the cwc for s3r1 and s3r2 treatment was higher than that for s2r5 treatment moreover the value of cwc for the same treatment in 2018 was higher than that in 2017 3 1 2 effect of irrigation water salinity and mcr of na ca on tomato yield traits the tomato fruit aw av and fn for treatments are shown in fig 4 the my ty and the wue for treatments are shown in fig 5 according to fig 4 the s1r3 treatment got the maximum value of fruit av in 2017 2018 and 2019 while the s1r4 treatment obtained the maximum value of fn the fruit aw for s3r5 treatment and the fn for s3r4 treatment was significantly lower than other treatments meanwhile the fruit av for s3r5 treatment obtained the minimum value additionally with irrigation water salinity of 1 g l and 2 g l the av ranged from 147 33 cm3 to 153 38 cm3 which has no significant difference for treatments moreover with irrigation water salinity of 1 g l no significant difference of fn for treatments was found while with the same irrigation water salinity the aw had no significant difference for the mcr of na ca at 1 and 3 moreover with the same irrigation water mcr of na ca the aw for treatments decreased with the increase of irrigation water salinity meanwhile with the irrigation water salinity of 2 g l and 3 g l the aw decreased with the increasing mcr of na ca especially the fruit aw for treatments decreased significantly when the irrigation water mcr of na ca exceed 3 interestingly the fruit aw for s2r1 treatment was higher than that for s1r5 treatment similarly the fruit aw for s3r1 treatment was higher compared with s2r5 treatment additionally with the irrigation water salinity of 3 g l the fruit av declined with the increasing mcr of na ca particularly the fruit av decreased sharply since the mcr of na ca exceeded 5 as shown in fig 5 the my for s1r1 treatment achieved the maximum value of 11 21 104 kg hm2 in 2017 11 19 104 kg hm2 in 2018 and 11 23 104 kg hm2 in 2019 as well the ty for s1r1 treatment obtained the maximum value of 11 26 104 kg hm2 in 2017 11 23 104 kg hm2 in 2018 and 11 29 104 kg hm2 in 2019 while the my and ty for s3r4 and s3r5 treatment were significantly lower than other treatments moreover the wue for s1r4 and s3r4 treatment obtained the maximum value 21 07 22 84 kg m3 and minimum value 13 02 13 54 kg m3 respectively additionally there was no significant difference of my ty and wue for treatments with irrigation water mcr of na ca lower than 5 with the same irrigation water salinity the my and ty decreased with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca particularly the my and ty declined sharply when the mcr of na ca exceed 5 taking the irrigation water salinity and the mcr of na ca as the independent variable the aw av my and wue as the response variables the corresponding quadratic polynomial regression equations were established table 6 fig 6 based on the analysis with least square method according to the fitting regression

22 92 kg m3 with irrigation water mcr of na ca at 3 36 and 2 57 respectively as a result the aw av my and wue of tomato cannot reach their theoretical maximum values simultaneously with the same irrigation water salinity and mcr of na ca simultaneously 3 1 3 correlations between the irrigation water mcr of na ca and cwc tomato yield traits with the irrigation water salinity of 2 g l and 3 g l both the cwc iq aw my and ty decreased linearly with the increasing irrigation water mcr of na ca table 7 with irrigation water salinity of 2 g l the cwc and iq decreased by 14 mm for each 1 increase

respectively for every 1 increase in the mcr of na ca the results above indicated that to achieve the considerable my the applied irrigation water should have lower irrigation water salinity and lower mcr of na ca 3 1 4 correlations between cwc iq aw av fn my ty and wue there were interrelated correlations among crop water consumption and the traits of tomato yield and the correlation analysis was performed among the cwc iq aw av fn my ty and wue fig 7 obviously the cwc had extremely significant positive correlation with iq 1 00 the aw had extremely significant positive correlation with cwc iq

salinity mcr of na ca and their interaction had significant effect on the ts content p 0 05 and extremely significant influences on rsa ss concentration and vc content of fruit while in 2018 and 2019 both the irrigation water salinity mcr of na ca and their interaction had very significant effects on the tomato fruit rsa ta content and vc concentration p 0 01 according to fig 8 and fig 9 both the

concentration for w2r3 treatment obtained the maximum value the w1r4 w2r4 and w3r1 treatment achieved the maximum value of lycopene content vc concentration and rsa of tomato respectively with the irrigation water salinity of 1 g l the fruit ts and vc content increased first and then decreased with the increasing irrigation water mcr of na ca the fruit ts and vc content arrived the maximum concentration when the irrigation water mcr of na ca reached 5 and 7 respectively however the fruit ss content increased with the increase of irrigation water salinity when the irrigation water salinity was 2 g l the fruit ts ss and vc concentration increased first and then decreased with the increasing mcr of na ca and the content of ts and vc obtained the maximum value as the mcr of na ca arrived 5 whereas the fruit ta content increased non significantly with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca with the irrigation water salt content of 3 g l the fruit ts content decreased non significantly with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca while the fruit ta ss and vc content increased first and then decreased which both achieved the maximum value when the irrigation water mcr of na ca reached 5 additionally there is a trend of raising first and then falling for tomato fruit lycopene content with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca with same water salinity which obtained the maximum value as the mcr of na ca was 7 besides when the irrigation water mcr of na ca was lower than 7 the fruit vc content increased first and then decreased with the increasing irrigation water salinity while the fruit lycopene content increased with the increase of irrigation water salinity as the irrigation water mcr of na ca was lower than 5 taking the irrigation water salinity and mcr of na ca as the independent variable and the lycopene content as the response variable the binary quadratic polynomial regression equation was established with the least square method fig 10 according to the following equation the fruit lycopene content achieved the theoretical maximum value 37 501 10 3 mg g when the irrigation water salinity was 1 909 g l and the mcr of na ca was

and the mcr of na ca on glucose fructose sucrose and starch content of tomato fruit tomato fruit soluble sugar mainly consist of glucose fructose and sucrose as the main reducing monosaccharides of tomato fruit glucose and fructose play important roles in the flavor quality of tomato fruit velterop and vos 2001 while sucrose is the main form of long distance transportation of carbohydrates in tomato plants which is liable to be degraded to fructose and glucose with the stimulation of enzymes moreover fruit starch can be decomposed into glucose and fructose under the stimulation of acid invertase and neutral invertase to investigate the response of soluble sugar and starch to irrigation water salinity and the mcr of na ca the soluble sugar and starch content of tomato fruit on 15 25 35 45 and 55 days after emic were analyzed in this paper and the results are shown in figs 11 12 according to the variation of tomato glucose fructose sucrose and starch content the fruit development period 15 55 days after emic can be divided into two stages 15 25 days after emic and 25 55 days after emic during 15 25 days after emic both the glucose fructose and sucrose content increased slowly with the fruit development while the starch content declined tardily during 25 55 days after emic the glucose and fructose content raised rapidly with the fruit development while the content of sucrose and starch decreased sharply with the irrigation water salinity of 1 g l and 2 g l both the sucrose and starch content increased first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca at same fruit development period and achieved the maximum value as the mcr of na ca reached 5 when the irrigation water salt concentration was 3 g l both the content of tomato glucose fructose sucrose and starch decreased with the increasing irrigation water mcr of na ca at same fruit development period additionally once the irrigation water mcr of na ca exceeded 1 tomato glucose content increased first and then decreased with the increasing irrigation water salinity at same fruit development stage however the sucrose content decreased when the irrigation water mcr of na ca was higher than 3 the starch content decreased with the increase of irrigation water salt concentration as a result the s3r1 and s1r1 treatment achieved the maximum value of glucose 31 05 mg g and fructose 16 85 mg g at 55 days after emic during the fruit development period respectively moreover the sucrose content for s1r2 treatment 2 91 mg g was higher than that for other treatments at 55 days after emic according to the analysis with mathematica 9 0 and the least square method taking the irrigation water salinity and mcr of na ca as the independent variable and the fructose content as the response variable the corresponding binary quadratic polynomial regression equation were established fig 13 as shown in the following equation the fructose content obtained the theoretical maximum

where y11 represents the value of lycopene content for the fitting function 10 3 mg g 3 2 3 correlations between the content of ts ta ss vc lycopene glucose fructose sucrose starch and rsa there were interrelated correlations among the tomato fruit quality traits in the present paper the correlation analysis was carried out among the content of ts ta ss vc lycopene glucose fructose sucrose starch

starch content as well the lycopene content had no significant correlation with the content of glucose fructose sucrose starch moreover the fruit glucose content had extremely significant positive correlation with rsa 0 63 ta content 0 52 and starch concentration 0 59 while the glucose content had distinct positive correlation with the content of ss 0 43 vc 0 4 fructose 0 47 and sucrose 0 43 despite that the sucrose content had no significant correlation with tomato rsa and the content of ta and ss there were highly significant positive correlation among the content of fructose sucrose and starch 4 discussion 4 1 the optimal irrigation water quality for the vigorous growth and high yield of tomato generally crops are stressed in two ways under soil salt conditions tavakkoli et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 dong et al 2018 on the one hand the soil salt may result in the inhibition of soil water infiltration the decline of soil water availability li et al 2003 lakhdar et al 2009 and the decrease of soil water potential in the root zone of plant consequently the soil water uptake by roots will be inhibited due to the osmotic effects moreover the leave stomata of crops are focused to close and the plant transpiration may be weakened boari et al 2016 dong et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 on the other hand some ions such as na cl and so4 2 may induce ion toxicity to crops chinnusamy et al 2005 and the ion toxicity usually result in the decrease of leaf chlorophyll content and the decline of photosynthetic activities the reduction of carbon dioxide co2 availability and the imbalance of necessary ions such as k and ca munns et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 dong et al 2018 aroca et al 2012 munns and tester 2008 additionally the metabolism and photochemical system of plant may be interfered with the elevated concentration of na rodrigues et al 2014 researches have indicated that the improper irrigation water quality may result in the decrease of tomato fruit aw and cause a reduction in tomato yield yang et al 2019 boari et al 2016 cantore et al 2012 the present study indicated that both the yield traits aw av my ty and wue have significant positive correlation with cwc and iq which implied that the increase of tomato cwc contribute to the increase of tomato yield and wue moreover with the increase of irrigation water salinity or irrigation water mcr of na ca the cwc my and ty decreased especially the cwc aw my and ty reduced sharply when the mcr of na ca exceed 5 with irrigation water salinity of 2 g l or 3 g l which result was in accord with the research of harun et al 2017 and j s li et al 2019 harun et al 2017 recognized that the unfavorable effects on crops by salt stress depend on several factors such as salt components and the stress levels j s li et al 2019 indicated that the high na content in the plant tissues of tomato was closely associated with the elevated concentration of na in saline water under drip irrigation which may contribute to the chlorophyll decomposition accordingly the photosynthetic intensity declined the organic matter accumulation decreased as a result the tomato my and ty reduced additionally tomato av decreased with the increasing irrigation water mcr of na ca when the water salinity was 3 g l which was in agreement with the hypothesis of al ismaily et al 2014 and zhang et al 2017 who have revealed that the fruit size of tomato decreased with the increasing salt content and na concentration of irrigation water interestingly the cwc and aw of tomato for s2r1 was higher than that for s1r5 treatment similarly the cwc and aw for s3r1 treatment was higher than that for s2r5 treatment which implied that the irrigation water with higher salinity 2 g l and 3 g l and lower mcr of na ca 1 was more conducive to tomato root water uptake and aw increase than the irrigation water with lower salinity 1 g l and 2 g l and higher mcr of na ca 9 the ratios of my to ty for treatments are shown in table 9 with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca the ratio of my to ty decreased particularly the ratio for treatments with high irrigation water salinity 3 g l and elevated mcr of na ca 7 and 9 declined by 30 approximately which result was in accord with the researches of ho et al 1986 and adams et al 2001 who have recognized that with elevated irrigation water salinity and na concentration the process of ca2 absorption from soil to root and ca2 transportation from root to fruit may be inhibited as a result the incidence of ber increased ho and ehret 1986 adams et al 2001 wan et al 2011 synthetically to achieve the vigorous growth and obtain considerable yield of tomato the irrigation water with salinity not more than 2 g l and mcr of na ca not more than 5 was recommended in the present study 4 2 the optimal irrigation water quality for good quality of tomato the ss reducing sugars and organic acids of tomato play important roles in the fruit flavor quality velterop and vos 2001 moreover the reducing sugars of tomato are also crucial to the osmotic regulation munns and tester 2008 studies have revealed that the reducing sugar organic acid and vc of tomato increased linearly with the increasing salinity of irrigation water d li et al 2022 vande wal et al 2017 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 while the rsa reducing sugar content divided by organic acid content increased quadratic linearly with the increase of irrigation water salt concentration d li et al 2022 the present experiment indicated that with the same irrigation water mcr of na ca lower than 7 the fruit vc content of tomato increased first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation water salinity and obtained the maximum value with irrigation water salt content of 2 g l which was not completely corresponding to the previous studies that may be due to the inconsistent range of irrigation water salt concentration between the present study and previous researches additionally consumers tend to prefer the tomato fruits with high sugar content just as ding et al 2017 have indicated when the tomato rsa is 7 10 the taste flavor of tomato is excellent in particular the rsa in the present experiment for all treatments ranged from 6 1 to 9 95 which implied that the tomato fruits have good taste flavor according to ding et al 2017 though there are many studies about the influence of irrigation water salinity on tomato fruit quality traits few researches have focused on the effects of irrigation water salt composition on fruit flavor and nutritional quality characteristics as shown in fig 15 there were correlative relationship between the irrigation water mcr of na ca and the tomato fruit vc lycopene fructose sucrose and starch content both the vc and lycopene content of fruit show quadratic function relations with the irrigation water mcr of na ca and achieved the theoretical maximum since the mcr of na ca reached 5 or 7 which result implied that the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca within a certain range was conducive to the accumulation of vc and lycopene in tomato fruit additionally with the irrigation water salinity of 1 g l and 2 g l the fruit ts content increased first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca and achieved the maximum value with the mcr of na ca at 5 whereas the ts content decreased with the increasing mcr of na ca when the irrigation water salt concentration was 3 g l meanwhile with the irrigation water salinity of 1 g l the fruit ss increased with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca while with the irrigation water salt concentration of 2 g l and 3 g l the ss increased first and then decreased with the increasing mcr of na ca and obtained the maximum value as the irrigation water mcr of na ca was 7 and 5 respectively the results indicated that with the increase of irrigation water salinity the threshold of irrigation water mcr of na ca for the accumulation of fruit ts and ss decreased the glucose and fructose content of tomato increased in 15 55 days after emic and arrived the maximum value at the end of the fruit development period while the sucrose content increased in 15 25 days after emic and decreased in 25 55 days after emic however the starch content decreased in 15 55 days after emic which may connect with the activities of enzymes related to carbohydrate metabolism in tomato fruits with the maturity of tomato fruit the activity of acid invertase and neutral invertase increased while the sucrose synthase activity decreased which promoted the conversion of fruit sucrose to glucose and fructose studies have recognized that when crops suffer from the salt stress the macromolecular substances in cells such as sucrose tend to be hydrolyzed to soluble sugar to improve the osmotic adjustment capacity and protection ability of protoplasm on one hand the glucose content in the present study increased first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation water salinity which implied that properly increasing the salt concentration of irrigation water was favorable to the formation of fruit glucose on the other hand the fruit glucose content decreased with the increasing irrigation water mcr of na ca with irrigation water salinity of 3 g l which indicated that with high irrigation water salinity 3 g l in this paper there was no positive effect for the improve of soluble sugar levels by only increasing the proportion of sodium ion in irrigation water salinity which results about the tomato fruit glucose content of the present study were in agreement with the research of nebauer et al 2013 who have recognized that the glucose content of tomato increased with the increase of irrigation water salinities according to fig 15 the fruit fructose content after harvest had obvious correlation with the irrigation water mcr of na ca moreover with the irrigation water salinity of 1 g l and 2 g l the fruit fructose content had quadratic function relationship with the irrigation water mcr of na ca and the fructose content achieved the maximum value as the mcr of na ca reached 5 however the fructose content decreased linearly with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca when the irrigation water salinity arrived 3 g l the results demonstrate that when the irrigation water salinity was lower than 2 g l the appropriately increase of the mcr of na ca was conductive to the accumulation of tomato fruit fructose and the corresponding threshold value of the mcr of na ca in the present paper was 5 similar to the fruit fructose content the sucrose and starch concentration of tomato fruit have significant quadratic function relationship with the irrigation water mcr of na ca under salinity of 1 g l and 2 g l while the fruit sucrose and starch content decreased dramatically with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca under salinity of 1 g l the results above may attribute to the influence of irrigation water salinity and the mcr of na ca on the activities of sugar related enzyme in the tomato fruit which requires further research to obtain the higher content of fruit ts ss vc lycopene and glucose content of tomato the irrigation water quality corresponding to s2r3 treatment was recommended 4 3 determination of optimal irrigation water quality based on principal component analysis methods according to the table 6 and fig 6 it was difficult to achieve the theoretical maximum value of tomato my and wue simultaneously as well the fig 10 and fig 13 implied that the lycopene and fructose content of tomato cannot obtain the theoretical maximum value simultaneously thus the principal component analysis was carried out to assess the favorable irrigation water salinity and mcr of na ca for tomato cultivation eight indexes were selected and calculated with spss 20 0 which were aw x1 av x2 my x3 wue x4 rsa x5 ss x6 vc x7 and lycopene x8 with the principal component analysis two indexes f1 and f2 were determined to represent the eight indexes with representativeness of 50 48 and 31 01 respectively fig 16 while the corresponding characterization values for f1 and f2 were 4 039 and 2 481 respectively the two principal components can be expressed as follow 6 f 1 0 238 x 1 0 225 x 2 0 243 x 3 0 225 x 4 0 141 x 5 0 054 x 6 0 013 x 7 0 09 x 8 7 f 2 0 006 x 1 0 064 x 2 0 001 x 3

rate of the two principal components as follow 8 f 50 48 f 1 31 01 f 2 50 48 31 01 where f is the comprehensive score 50 48 and 31 01 are the contribution rates for the first and second principal component respectively the comprehensive evaluation result is shown in table 10 which indicated that the s2r3 treatment obtained the highest comprehensive score and ranked first followed by the s1r4 treatment with the irrigation water salinity of 1 g l the mcr of na ca at 7 obtained the highest comprehensive score while with the irrigation water salinity of 2 g l and 3 g l the mcr of na ca at 5 achieved the highest comprehensive score additionally with the irrigation water mcr of na ca at 1 3 and 5 the irrigation water salinity of 2 g l received the highest score however with the irrigation water mcr of na ca at 7 and 9 the comprehensive score decreased with the increase of irrigation water salinity from 1 g l to 3 g l synthetically irrigation water with salinity of 2 g l and mcr of na ca at 5 was recommended in the present study interestingly the salinity and mcr of na ca for the local shallow groundwater was 1 93 g l and 5 that is accord with the s2r3 treatment which indicated that the shallow groundwater is appropriate for the mulched drip irrigation during tomato planting in the field however the influence of irrigation water salinity and mcr of na ca on the soil salt accumulation the availability of soil nutrients nitrogen phosphorus etc the activity of soil microorganism and plant enzyme etc require further investigation 5 conclusion the cwc of tomato decreased significantly with the increase of irrigation water salinity and mcr of na ca especially with irrigation water salinity of 2 g l and 3 g l the cwc decreased by 14 18 mm and 23 27 mm for every 1 increase in the irrigation water salinity respectively moreover irrigation water with higher salinity 2 g l and 3 g l and lower mcr of na ca 1 and 3 was more conducive to root water uptake than that with lower salinity and higher mcr of na ca not only the aw my and ty decreased with the increase of irrigation water salinity but also the aw my and ty decreased linearly with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca moreover the my ty ratio decreased with the increasing mcr of na ca additionally the irrigation water with high salt content and low mcr of na ca was more conducive to the increase of the tomato aw than irrigation water with low salt concentration and high mcr of na ca both the fruit vc and lycopene content increased first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca with low irrigation water salinity 1 g l and 2 g l the appropriate increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca contributed to the improve of tomato fruit ts ss vc and lycopene content especially the fruit ts content achieved the maximum value when the irrigation water mcr of na ca arrived 5 while the threshold for fruit lycopene and ss accumulation was 7 moreover with the increase of irrigation water salinity the threshold for the tomato fruit ss formation declined when the irrigation water salinity increased to 3 g l the fruit ts content reduced with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca particularly the threshold for the tomato fruit ss accumulation was 5 additionally the s3r1 treatment obtained the maximum value 8 95 9 92 of tomato fruit rsa followed by the s2r1 treatment the fruit glucose and fructose content increased with the development of tomato fruit and arrived the maximum value at 55 days after emic meanwhile the sucrose content of tomato increased in 15 25 days after emic and decreased in 25 55 days after emic however the fruit starch content decreased in 15 55 days after emic with irrigation water salinity of 1 g l and 2 g l both the fructose sucrose and starch content of tomato fruit have significant quadratic function relationship with the irrigation water mcr of na ca the fructose and sucrose content achieved the maximum value as the mcr of na ca reached 5 meanwhile the fruit glucose content obtained the maximum value however with irrigation water salinity of 3 g l the fruit fructose sucrose and starch content decreased linearly as well the fruit glucose content decreased synthetically based on the results of polynomial fitting and principal component analysis to obtain high yield and good quality in tomato planting irrigation water with salinity of 2 g l and mcr of na ca at 5 was recommended for tomato cultivation in the northern yinchuan plain of ningxia which is dramatically consistent with the

9234,although saline water can be used as an alternative of freshwater resources for agricultural irrigation especially in arid and semiarid areas however unsuitable saline water quality and unreasonable irrigation technology may result in the detrimental effects on plant growth yield and quality of products thus a three year open field experiment was conducted in ningxia to investigate the influence of three irrigation water salinity levels 1 2 and 3 g l and five molar concentration ratios mcr of na ca 1 3 5 7 and 9 on processing tomato planting in terms of crop water consumption tomato yield traits and fruit quality characteristics the results are as follow i the water consumption decreased significantly with the increasing irrigation water salinity and mcr of na ca ii with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca both the average fruit weight marketable yield and total yield decreased linearly as well the ratio of marketable yield to total yield decreased additionally irrigation water with higher salinity 2 g l and 3 g l and lower mcr of na ca 1 and 3 was more conducive to root water uptake and average fruit weight accumulation than that with lower salinity and higher mcr of na ca iii with irrigation water salinity of 1 g l and 2 g l both the vitamin c lycopene fructose sucrose and starch content of tomato fruit have quadratic function relationship with the irrigation water mcr of na ca moreover the threshold of irrigation water mcr of na ca for soluble solids lycopene and starch accumulation was 7 while the content of total soluble sugar fructose and sucrose achieved the maximum value as the mcr of na ca arrived 5 iv with irrigation water salinity of 3 g l the total soluble sugar and glucose of fruit decreased with the increase

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction irrigation water usually plays an important role for crop growth and yield formation ierna and mauromicale 2018 accordingly to maintain the sustainable high yield for crops it is necessary to apply sufficient irrigation water to meet their water requirement during the growth period uddameri et al 2020 however most regions of the world especially in arid and semiarid areas suffering from freshwater shortage due to the uneven spatial distribution of water resources the expansion of agricultural and industries environmental pollution etc mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 dalin et al 2017 ma et al 2020 thus it is essential to seek available alternatives of freshwater resources for crop irrigation as a common unconventional water resource saline water has been used as an alternative of freshwater in agricultural irrigation for hundreds of years khaleghi et al 2020 j s li et al 2019 sekhon et al 2020 yan et al 2021 it is noted that the utilization of shallow ground saline water for irrigation can not only contribute to narrow the gap between the supply and demand of agricultural fresh water resources but also conducive to the renewal of groundwater in the irrigation areas lei et al 2003 generally the applied saline water can supply most of the necessary moisture and some trace elements for crop growth wang et al 2015 which contribute to the plant growth commercial yield and crop quality el mogy et al 2018 j s li et al 2019 zhai et al 2015 nevertheless improper saline water irrigation may result in large amounts of salt ions brought into the topsoil which may induce detrimental effects on crop growth alharby et al 2018 baath et al 2017 kumar and khare 2016 j s li et al 2019 and adverse influences on marketable yield my due to the decrease of soil solution osmotic potential in the crop rootzone baath et al 2017 cao et al 2016 majeed and muhammad 2019 imbalance of ions in plant and the specific ions toxicity e g na so4 2 and cl in cells tavakkoli et al 2011 machekposhti et al 2017 ibn murad et al 2018 according to the researches the disadvantageous effects induced by inappropriate saline water irrigation on plants usually involve the delay of emergence time tavakkoli et al 2011 the decrease of emergence rate bi 2014 the reduction of net photosynthesis baath et al 2017 alharby et al 2018 de pascale et al 2015 the decline of enzymes activity in the plant tavakkoli et al 2011 munns et al 2006 the decrease of nutrients in root absorption d li et al 2022 while the disadvantages of saline water irrigation on the cultivated soil contain the reduction in the amount of soil active microorganisms in the rootzone rietz et al 2003 the decline of water holding capacity guo et al 2017 xing et al 2016 the decrease of soil effective porosity guo et al 2017 xing et al 2016 as one of the nutritious vegetables tomato lycopersicon esculentum is an economically important crop with high nutritional value and is moderately sensitive to salinity maas and hoffman 1977 hanson et al 2006 malash et al 2008 which can be irrigated with saline water with optimal irrigation strategies j s li et al 2019 d li et al 2022 sekhon et al 2020 yan et al 2021 thus the cultivation of tomato with high yield and good quality under saline water irrigation for great economic benefits is a concern for farmers and researches researches have indicated that the tomato yield may decline with the increase of irrigation water salinity especially when the salt content of applied water exceeded the threshold of salt tolerance kang et al 2010 j s li et al 2019 d li et al 2022 maas and hoffman 1977 maas 1984 has reported that the tomato yield decreased by 10 for every 1 ds m increase of irrigation water ece as the ece of extracting solution in the root zone exceed 2 5 ds m while liu et al 2013 has recognized that the salt tolerance of tomato plant fluctuated significantly during the growing period particularly tomato roots were sensitive to soil water and salt stress during flowering and fruiting period and the corresponding threshold of irrigation water salinity was 3 g l while the critical value in fruit expanding period was 5 0 g l tomato quality traits mainly include flavor quality indexes and nutrition characteristics accordingly the soluble solids ss total soluble sugar ts and titratable acid ta play crucial roles in the tomato flavor quality velterop and vos 2001 w j li et al 2022 while the vitamin c vc and lycopene are important nutrition indicators of tomato which are essential nutrients for humans with excellent antioxidant function j s li et al 2019 although the increase of irrigation water salinity may result in the decrease of tomato yield the tomato flavor quality and nutrient quality are usually improved several studies have confirmed that the increase of irrigation water electric conductivity can promote the increase of organic acid and the accumulation of ss and soluble sugar gawad et al 2005 wang et al 2014 w j li et al 2022 similarity the tomato vc content tend to increase with the increasing irrigation water salinity el mogy et al 2018 j s li et al 2019 w j li et al 2022 tomato yield and fruit quality are not only influenced by salt content of irrigation water but also affected by irrigation water salt components tester and davenport 2003 harun et al 2017 even with the same salt concentration of irrigation water the yield and quality characteristics of tomato may have different response to various salt components of irrigation water as studies have indicated the na usually plays an essential role in the salt tolerance of plants ma et al 2020 niu et al 2017 van zelm et al 2020 the increase of na content in the aboveground parts of plants may result in the occurrence of osmotic stress j s li et al 2019 ma et al 2020 niu et al 2017 van zelm et al 2020 decrease of chlorophyll content reduction of photosynthesis manai et al 2014 liu et al 1998 decline of enzyme activity baath et al 2017 tavakkoli et al 2011 and deficiency of necessary salt ions such as ca2 mg2 k etc cao et al 2019 de pascale et al 2007 hu and schmidhalter 2005 which eventually lead to low yield kumar and khare 2016 generally the ratios of k na and ca2 na in plants are conventional physiological criteria for salt tolerance of plants niu et al 2017 van zelm et al 2020 zhu 2016 since the k deficiency induced by na is closely related to crop growth under salt stress plant tolerance to na stress can be stimulated by increasing the k concentration and the ratio of k na for the aboveground parts hauser and horie 2010 edelstein et al 2011 huang et al 2013 additionally as one of the main nutrient ions for tomato the ca2 usually act as an important role in the growth and development of tomato plants campos et al 2006 especially the tomato fruit disorder blossom end rot ber is generally accompanied with the ca2 deficiency of plant cantore et al 2008 adams and ho 1993 max and horst 2009 to decrease the ratio of na ca2 and reduce the occurrence of ber of tomato the ca2 level of tomato plants can be enhanced by irrigating with high calcium water topdressing with high calcium fertilizer and applying high calcium soil amendments luo et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 to date many experiments have been conducted on saline water irrigation for appropriate irrigation water salinity irrigation strategy etc however litter attention has been paid to the response of crop yield and quality to the irrigation water salt components which is essential for the scientific agriculture irrigation with saline water therefore a three year field experiment was performed under saline water mulched drip irrigation with three irrigation water

eligible for tomato growth and fruit yield while kang et al 2005 recognized that with the soil matric potential of 20 kpa under saline water mulched drip irrigation the soil moisture and soil salinity can be well maintained thus three vacuum gauge tensiometers were installed 20 cm underneath the drip tube emitter in each plot and the lower limit of soil matric potential was settled at 20 kpa after tomato seedlings being transplanted fresh water drip irrigation with amount of 30 mm was applied immediately for plants establishment the fifteen tensiometers were observed and recorded three times

5761 kg hm2 and 5630 kg hm2 for each 1 increase in the mcr of na ca respectively while with irrigation water salinity of 3 g l the aw my and ty decreased by 15 17 g 6036 7 kg hm2 and 4425 kg hm2 respectively for every 1 increase in the mcr of na ca the results above indicated that to achieve the considerable my the applied irrigation water should have lower irrigation water salinity and lower mcr of na ca 3 1 4 correlations between cwc iq aw av fn my ty and wue there were interrelated correlations among crop water consumption and the traits of tomato yield and the correlation analysis was performed among the cwc iq aw av fn my ty and wue fig 7 obviously the cwc had extremely significant positive correlation with iq 1 00 the aw had extremely significant positive correlation with cwc iq my and ty 0 94 0 94 0 93 0 91 while the av had notable positive correlation with cwc iq aw my and ty 0 89 0 88 0 84 0 87 0 83 though the fn had remarkable positive correlation with my and ty 0 83 0 86 the significant level between fn and cwc iq aw av were only 0 7 0 7 0 57 and 0 66 respectively except for the extremely significant positive correlation between wue and fn my and ty the wue had distinct positive correlation with cwc iq aw and av 0 79 0 79 0 8 0 74 3 2 influences of irrigation water salinity and the mcr of na ca on fruit quality characteristics 3 2 1 influences of irrigation water salinity and the mcr of na ca on ts ta rsa ss vc and lycopene of tomato fruit generally the flavor quality and nutritional quality of tomato fruit tend to be affected by abiotic stresses such as drought and soil salinity yang et al 2019 the significant difference levels of ts ta rsa ss vc and lycopene are listed in table 8 while the ts content ta concentration and rsa of tomato fruit for treatments are shown in fig 8 the ss vc and lycopene content are shown in fig 9 according to table 8 the irrigation water salinity had no significant effects on the lycopene content of tomato but had extremely significant influences on the rsa ts concentration and vc content of fruit p 0 01 moreover the irrigation water mcr of na ca had highly significant effects on the rsa and the content of ss vc and lycopene p 0 01 both the rsa ss content and vc concentration of fruit were dramatically p 0 01 affected by the interaction of irrigation water salinity and the mcr of na ca additionally the irrigation water salinity and the interaction of irrigation water salinity and mcr of na ca had no significant effect p 0 05 on tomato lycopene content in 2017 and 2018 both the irrigation water salinity mcr of na ca and their interaction had significant effect on the ts content p 0 05 and extremely significant influences on rsa ss concentration and vc content of fruit while in 2018 and 2019 both the irrigation water salinity mcr of na ca and their interaction had very significant effects on the tomato fruit rsa ta content and vc concentration p 0 01 according to fig 8 and fig 9 both the content of tomato fruit ts ta and ss for w3r5 treatment got the minimum value while the w1r1 treatment achieved the minimum value of vc and lycopene content meanwhile the tomato ts and vc concentration for w2r3 treatment obtained the maximum value the w1r4 w2r4 and w3r1 treatment achieved the maximum value of lycopene content vc concentration and rsa of tomato respectively with the irrigation water salinity of 1 g l the fruit ts and vc content increased first and then decreased with the increasing irrigation water mcr of na ca the fruit ts and vc content arrived the maximum concentration when the irrigation water mcr of na ca reached 5 and 7 respectively however the fruit ss content increased with the increase of irrigation water salinity when the irrigation water salinity was 2 g l the fruit ts ss and vc concentration increased first and then decreased with the increasing mcr of na ca and the content of ts and vc obtained the maximum value as the mcr of na ca arrived 5 whereas the fruit ta content increased non significantly with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca with the irrigation water salt content of 3 g l the fruit ts content decreased non significantly with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca while the fruit ta ss and vc content increased first and then decreased which both achieved the maximum value when the irrigation water mcr of na ca reached 5 additionally there is a trend of raising first and then falling for tomato fruit lycopene content with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca with same water salinity which obtained the maximum value as the mcr of na ca was 7 besides when the irrigation water mcr of na ca was lower than 7 the fruit vc content increased first and then decreased with the increasing irrigation water salinity while the fruit lycopene content increased with the increase of irrigation water salinity as the irrigation water mcr of na ca was lower than 5 taking the irrigation water salinity and mcr of na ca as the independent variable and the lycopene content as the response variable the binary quadratic polynomial regression equation was established with the least square method fig 10 according to the following equation the fruit lycopene content achieved the theoretical maximum value 37 501 10 3 mg g when the irrigation water salinity was 1 909 g l and the mcr of na ca was

and the mcr of na ca on glucose fructose sucrose and starch content of tomato fruit tomato fruit soluble sugar mainly consist of glucose fructose and sucrose as the main reducing monosaccharides of tomato fruit glucose and fructose play important roles in the flavor quality of tomato fruit velterop and vos 2001 while sucrose is the main form of long distance transportation of carbohydrates in tomato plants which is liable to be degraded to fructose and glucose with the stimulation of enzymes moreover fruit starch can be decomposed into glucose and fructose under the stimulation of acid invertase and neutral invertase to investigate the response of soluble sugar and starch to irrigation water salinity and the mcr of na ca the soluble sugar and starch content of tomato fruit on 15 25 35 45 and 55 days after emic were analyzed in this paper and the results are shown in figs 11 12 according to the variation of tomato glucose fructose sucrose and starch content the fruit development period 15 55 days after emic can be divided into two stages 15 25 days after emic and 25 55 days after emic during 15 25 days after emic both the glucose fructose and sucrose content increased slowly with the fruit development while the starch content declined tardily during 25 55 days after emic the glucose and fructose content raised rapidly with the fruit development while the content of sucrose and starch decreased sharply with the irrigation water salinity of 1 g l and 2 g l both the sucrose and starch content increased first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca at same fruit development period and achieved the maximum value as the mcr of na ca reached 5 when the irrigation water salt concentration was 3 g l both the content of tomato glucose fructose sucrose and starch decreased with the increasing irrigation water mcr of na ca at same fruit development period additionally once the irrigation water mcr of na ca exceeded 1 tomato glucose content increased first and then decreased with the increasing irrigation water salinity at same fruit development stage however the sucrose content decreased when the irrigation water mcr of na ca was higher than 3 the starch content decreased with the increase of irrigation water salt concentration as a result the s3r1 and s1r1 treatment achieved the maximum value of glucose 31 05 mg g and fructose 16 85 mg g at 55 days after emic during the fruit development period respectively moreover the sucrose content for s1r2 treatment 2 91 mg g was higher than that for other treatments at 55 days after emic according to the analysis with mathematica 9 0 and the least square method taking the irrigation water salinity and mcr of na ca as the independent variable and the fructose content as the response variable the corresponding binary quadratic polynomial regression equation were established fig 13 as shown in the following equation the fructose content obtained the theoretical maximum value 15 389 mg g as the irrigation water salinity and mcr of na ca reached 3 471 g l and 1 038 simultaneously 5 y 11 17 39229 1 44731 s 0 98051 r 0 24233 s 2 0 09382 r 2 0 22639 s r r 2 0 92 p 0 01 where y11 represents the value of lycopene content for the fitting function 10 3 mg g 3 2 3 correlations between the content of ts ta ss vc lycopene glucose fructose sucrose starch and rsa there were interrelated correlations among the tomato fruit quality traits in the present paper the correlation analysis was carried out among the content of ts ta ss vc lycopene glucose fructose sucrose starch and rsa as shown in fig 14 the fruit ts content had extremely significant positive correlations with the content of ss 0 52 glucose 0 69 fructose 0 67 sucrose 0 71 and starch 0 72 and the ts content had notable positive correlation with tomato rsa 0 41 while tomato rsa had no significant correlation with the content of ss vc and lycopene there was highly significant positive correlation among ss vc and lycopene content while the ss content had positive distinct correlation with ta 0 42 and starch 0 41 content whereas tomato vc content had no notable correlation with fructose sucrose and starch content as well the lycopene content had no significant correlation with the content of glucose fructose sucrose starch moreover the fruit glucose content had extremely significant positive correlation with rsa 0 63 ta content 0 52 and starch concentration 0 59 while the glucose content had distinct positive correlation with the content of ss 0 43 vc 0 4 fructose 0 47 and sucrose 0 43 despite that the sucrose content had no significant correlation with tomato rsa and the content of ta and ss there were highly significant positive correlation among the content of fructose sucrose and starch 4 discussion 4 1 the optimal irrigation water quality for the vigorous growth and high yield of tomato generally crops are stressed in two ways under soil salt conditions tavakkoli et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 dong et al 2018 on the one hand the soil salt may result in the inhibition of soil water infiltration the decline of soil water availability li et al 2003 lakhdar et al 2009 and the decrease of soil water potential in the root zone of plant consequently the soil water uptake by roots will be inhibited due to the osmotic effects moreover the leave stomata of crops are focused to close and the plant transpiration may be weakened boari et al 2016 dong et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 on the other hand some ions such as na cl and so4 2 may induce ion toxicity to crops chinnusamy et al 2005 and the ion toxicity usually result in the decrease of leaf chlorophyll content and the decline of photosynthetic activities the reduction of carbon dioxide co2 availability and the imbalance of necessary ions such as k and ca munns et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 dong et al 2018 aroca et al 2012 munns and tester 2008 additionally the metabolism and photochemical system of plant may be interfered with the elevated concentration of na rodrigues et al 2014 researches have indicated that the improper irrigation water quality may result in the decrease of tomato fruit aw and cause a reduction in tomato yield yang et al 2019 boari et al 2016 cantore et al 2012 the present study indicated that both the yield traits aw av my ty and wue have significant positive correlation with cwc and iq which implied that the increase of tomato cwc contribute to the increase of tomato yield and wue moreover with the increase of irrigation water salinity or irrigation water mcr of na ca the cwc my and ty decreased especially the cwc aw my and ty reduced sharply when the mcr of na ca exceed 5 with irrigation water salinity of 2 g l or 3 g l which result was in accord with the research of harun et al 2017 and j s li et al 2019 harun et al 2017 recognized that the unfavorable effects on crops by salt stress depend on several factors such as salt components and the stress levels j s li et al 2019 indicated that the high na content in the plant tissues of tomato was closely associated with the elevated concentration of na in saline water under drip irrigation which may contribute to the chlorophyll decomposition accordingly the photosynthetic intensity declined the organic matter accumulation decreased as a result the tomato my and ty reduced additionally tomato av decreased with the increasing irrigation water mcr of na ca when the water salinity was 3 g l which was in agreement with the hypothesis of al ismaily et al 2014 and zhang et al 2017 who have revealed that the fruit size of tomato decreased with the increasing salt content and na concentration of irrigation water interestingly the cwc and aw of tomato for s2r1 was higher than that for s1r5 treatment similarly the cwc and aw for s3r1 treatment was higher than that for s2r5 treatment which implied that the irrigation water with higher salinity 2 g l and 3 g l and lower mcr of na ca 1 was more conducive to tomato root water uptake and aw increase than the irrigation water with lower salinity 1 g l and 2 g l and higher mcr of na ca 9 the ratios of my to ty for treatments are shown in table 9 with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca the ratio of my to ty decreased particularly the ratio for treatments with high irrigation water salinity 3 g l and elevated mcr of na ca 7 and 9 declined by 30 approximately which result was in accord with the researches of ho et al 1986 and adams et al 2001 who have recognized that with elevated irrigation water salinity and na concentration the process of ca2 absorption from soil to root and ca2 transportation from root to fruit may be inhibited as a result the incidence of ber increased ho and ehret 1986 adams et al 2001 wan et al 2011 synthetically to achieve the vigorous growth and obtain considerable yield of tomato the irrigation water with salinity not more than 2 g l and mcr of na ca not more than 5 was recommended in the present study 4 2 the optimal irrigation water quality for good quality of tomato the ss reducing sugars and organic acids of tomato play important roles in the fruit flavor quality velterop and vos 2001 moreover the reducing sugars of tomato are also crucial to the osmotic regulation munns and tester 2008 studies have revealed that the reducing sugar organic acid and vc of tomato increased linearly with the increasing salinity of irrigation water d li et al 2022 vande wal et al 2017 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 while the rsa reducing sugar content divided by organic acid content increased quadratic linearly with the increase of irrigation water salt concentration d li et al 2022 the present experiment indicated that with the same irrigation water mcr of na ca lower than 7 the fruit vc content of tomato increased first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation water salinity and obtained the maximum value with irrigation water salt content of 2 g l which was not completely corresponding to the previous studies that may be due to the inconsistent range of irrigation water salt concentration between the present study and previous researches additionally consumers tend to prefer the tomato fruits with high sugar content just as ding et al 2017 have indicated when the tomato rsa is 7 10 the taste flavor of tomato is excellent in particular the rsa in the present experiment for all treatments ranged from 6 1 to 9 95 which implied that the tomato fruits have good taste flavor according to ding et al 2017 though there are many studies about the influence of irrigation water salinity on tomato fruit quality traits few researches have focused on the effects of irrigation water salt composition on fruit flavor and nutritional quality characteristics as shown in fig 15 there were correlative relationship between the irrigation water mcr of na ca and the tomato fruit vc lycopene fructose sucrose and starch content both the vc and lycopene content of fruit show quadratic function relations with the irrigation water mcr of na ca and achieved the theoretical maximum since the mcr of na ca reached 5 or 7 which result implied that the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca within a certain range was conducive to the accumulation of vc and lycopene in tomato fruit additionally with the irrigation water salinity of 1 g l and 2 g l the fruit ts content increased first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca and achieved the maximum value with the mcr of na ca at 5 whereas the ts content decreased with the increasing mcr of na ca when the irrigation water salt concentration was 3 g l meanwhile with the irrigation water salinity of 1 g l the fruit ss increased with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca while with the irrigation water salt concentration of 2 g l and 3 g l the ss increased first and then decreased with the increasing mcr of na ca and obtained the maximum value as the irrigation water mcr of na ca was 7 and 5 respectively the results indicated that with the increase of irrigation water salinity the threshold of irrigation water mcr of na ca for the accumulation of fruit ts and ss decreased the glucose and fructose content of tomato increased in 15 55 days after emic and arrived the maximum value at the end of the fruit development period while the sucrose content increased in 15 25 days after emic and decreased in 25 55 days after emic however the starch content decreased in 15 55 days after emic which may connect with the activities of enzymes related to carbohydrate metabolism in tomato fruits with the maturity of tomato fruit the activity of acid invertase and neutral invertase increased while the sucrose synthase activity decreased which promoted the conversion of fruit sucrose to glucose and fructose studies have recognized that when crops suffer from the salt stress the macromolecular substances in cells such as sucrose tend to be hydrolyzed to soluble sugar to improve the osmotic adjustment capacity and protection ability of protoplasm on one hand the glucose content in the present study increased first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation water salinity which implied that properly increasing the salt concentration of irrigation water was favorable to the formation of fruit glucose on the other hand the fruit glucose content decreased with the increasing irrigation water mcr of na ca with irrigation water salinity of 3 g l which indicated that with high irrigation water salinity 3 g l in this paper there was no positive effect for the improve of soluble sugar levels by only increasing the proportion of sodium ion in irrigation water salinity which results about the tomato fruit glucose content of the present study were in agreement with the research of nebauer et al 2013 who have recognized that the glucose content of tomato increased with the increase of irrigation water salinities according to fig 15 the fruit fructose content after harvest had obvious correlation with the irrigation water mcr of na ca moreover with the irrigation water salinity of 1 g l and 2 g l the fruit fructose content had quadratic function relationship with the irrigation water mcr of na ca and the fructose content achieved the maximum value as the mcr of na ca reached 5 however the fructose content decreased linearly with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca when the irrigation water salinity arrived 3 g l the results demonstrate that when the irrigation water salinity was lower than 2 g l the appropriately increase of the mcr of na ca was conductive to the accumulation of tomato fruit fructose and the corresponding threshold value of the mcr of na ca in the present paper was 5 similar to the fruit fructose content the sucrose and starch concentration of tomato fruit have significant quadratic function relationship with the irrigation water mcr of na ca under salinity of 1 g l and 2 g l while the fruit sucrose and starch content decreased dramatically with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca under salinity of 1 g l the results above may attribute to the influence of irrigation water salinity and the mcr of na ca on the activities of sugar related enzyme in the tomato fruit which requires further research to obtain the higher content of fruit ts ss vc lycopene and glucose content of tomato the irrigation water quality corresponding to s2r3 treatment was recommended 4 3 determination of optimal irrigation water quality based on principal component analysis methods according to the table 6 and fig 6 it was difficult to achieve the theoretical maximum value of tomato my and wue simultaneously as well the fig 10 and fig 13 implied that the lycopene and fructose content of tomato cannot obtain the theoretical maximum value simultaneously thus the principal component analysis was carried out to assess the favorable irrigation water salinity and mcr of na ca for tomato cultivation eight indexes were selected and calculated with spss 20 0 which were aw x1 av x2 my x3 wue x4 rsa x5 ss x6 vc x7 and lycopene x8 with the principal component analysis two indexes f1 and f2 were determined to represent the eight indexes with representativeness of 50 48 and 31 01 respectively fig 16 while the corresponding characterization values for f1 and f2 were 4 039 and 2 481 respectively the two principal components can be expressed as follow 6 f 1 0 238 x 1 0 225 x 2 0 243 x 3 0 225 x 4 0 141 x 5 0 054 x 6 0 013 x 7 0 09 x 8 7 f 2 0 006 x 1 0 064 x 2 0 001 x 3 0 009 x 4 0 002 x 5 0 378 x 6 0 372 x 7 0 342 x 8 where f1 f2 are the first and second principal component respectively the comprehensive evaluation function can be established by the contribution rate of the two principal components as follow 8 f 50 48 f 1 31 01 f 2 50 48 31 01 where f is the comprehensive score 50 48 and 31 01 are the contribution rates for the first and second principal component respectively the comprehensive evaluation result is shown in table 10 which indicated that the s2r3 treatment obtained the highest comprehensive score and ranked first followed by the s1r4 treatment with the irrigation water salinity of 1 g l the mcr of na ca at 7 obtained the highest comprehensive score while with the irrigation water salinity of 2 g l and 3 g l the mcr of na ca at 5 achieved the highest comprehensive score additionally with the irrigation water mcr of na ca at 1 3 and 5 the irrigation water salinity of 2 g l received the highest score however with the irrigation water mcr of na ca at 7 and 9 the comprehensive score decreased with the increase of irrigation water salinity from 1 g l to 3 g l synthetically irrigation water with salinity of 2 g l and mcr of na ca at 5 was recommended in the present study interestingly the salinity and mcr of na ca for the local shallow groundwater was 1 93 g l and 5 that is accord with the s2r3 treatment which indicated that the shallow groundwater is appropriate for the mulched drip irrigation during tomato planting in the field however the influence of irrigation water salinity and mcr of na ca on the soil salt accumulation the availability of soil nutrients nitrogen phosphorus etc the activity of soil microorganism and plant enzyme etc require further investigation 5 conclusion the cwc of tomato decreased significantly with the increase of irrigation water salinity and mcr of na ca especially with irrigation water salinity of 2 g l and 3 g l the cwc decreased by 14 18 mm and 23 27 mm for every 1 increase in the irrigation water salinity respectively moreover irrigation water with higher salinity 2 g l and 3 g l and lower mcr of na ca 1 and 3 was more conducive to root water uptake than that with lower salinity and higher mcr of na ca not only the aw my and ty decreased with the increase of irrigation water salinity but also the aw my and ty decreased linearly with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca moreover the my ty ratio decreased with the increasing mcr of na ca additionally the irrigation water with high salt content and low mcr of na ca was more conducive to the increase of the tomato aw than irrigation water with low salt concentration and high mcr of na ca both the fruit vc and lycopene content increased first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca with low irrigation water salinity 1 g l and 2 g l the appropriate increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca contributed to the improve of tomato fruit ts ss vc and lycopene content especially the fruit ts content achieved the maximum value when the irrigation water mcr of na ca arrived 5 while the threshold for fruit lycopene and ss accumulation was 7 moreover with the increase of irrigation water salinity the threshold for the tomato fruit ss formation declined when the irrigation water salinity increased to 3 g l the fruit ts content reduced with the increase of irrigation water mcr of na ca particularly the threshold for the tomato fruit ss accumulation was 5 additionally the s3r1 treatment obtained the maximum value 8 95 9 92 of tomato fruit rsa followed by the s2r1 treatment the fruit glucose and fructose content increased with the development of tomato fruit and arrived the maximum value at 55 days after emic meanwhile the sucrose content of tomato increased in 15 25 days after emic and decreased in 25 55 days after emic however the fruit starch content decreased in 15 55 days after emic with irrigation water salinity of 1 g l and 2 g l both the fructose sucrose and starch content of tomato fruit have significant quadratic function relationship with the irrigation water mcr of na ca the fructose and sucrose content achieved the maximum value as the mcr of na ca reached 5 meanwhile the fruit glucose content obtained the maximum value however with irrigation water salinity of 3 g l the fruit fructose sucrose and starch content decreased linearly as well the fruit glucose content decreased synthetically based on the results of polynomial fitting and principal component analysis to obtain high yield and good quality in tomato planting irrigation water with salinity of 2 g l and mcr of na ca at 5 was recommended for tomato cultivation in the northern yinchuan plain of ningxia which is dramatically consistent with the corresponding characteristics of local shallow groundwater credit authorship contribution statement li jingang conceptualization formal analysis investigation methodology software validation
