10770,in iran due to arid and semi arid climate groundwater resources play an essential role in food production as well as domestic and industrial water supply in recent years increasing population scarcity of surface water resources and effects of worldwide and regional climate change have resulted in over exploitation and unsustainability of these resources in the country the present study aims to estimate groundwater sustainable yield examine effects of spatial and temporal scale and propose a plan for groundwater sustainable use in nishapur plain in the north east of iran in investigating the effects of spatial scale the area of the plain is divided into several zones with estimation of groundwater recharge and discharge for each zone and the temporal scale refers to the different time scales used to estimate the average value of groundwater recharge and discharge the results of the transient groundwater model of nishapur plain revealed that average annual groundwater storage depletion is about 311 mcm 1 1 million cubic meters during the 8 year period of 2005 2013 with the minimum average and maximum water table decline of 0 6 m 7 7 m and 11 m respectively the study results suggest that sustainable yield is closely correlated to the spatial and temporal scales and refinement of spatial and temporal scales increases sustainable yield from 39 to 59 of the current pumping volume equal to about 100 mcm of water or 8000 ha of irrigated land furthermore when the groundwater withdrawals are limited to sustainable yield increasing irrigation efficiency from 38 current efficiency to about 60 can potentially result in maintaining irrigated areas and minimize adverse social and economic impacts of limiting groundwater usage this is an achievable rate based on data from the iranian government organizations the results of this study can be extended to other semi arid agricultural areas which primarily depend on groundwater keywords sustainable yield groundwater sustainable use capture concept groundwater modeling nishapur plain 1 introduction groundwater is the main source of water for many people around the world and plays a fundamental role in irrigation of crop fields and the protection of ecosystems in recent decades an increasing demand of water on one hand and over exploitation of groundwater resources on the other hand has led to the unsustainability of these scarce resources worldwide wada et al 2010 in the last century safe yield has being brought to scientists attention lee 1915 theis 1940 todd 1959 sophocleous 1997 lee 1915 pioneered to describe the maximum value for regular and permanent withdrawal without endangering the storage reserve in addition the concept of safe yield has been further developed from different aspects such as economic feasibility groundwater quality protection existing water laws and water rights as well as potential environmental problems todd 1959 defined safe yield as the amount of water which can be withdrawn from a groundwater basin annually without any undesirable results sophocleous 1997 defined safe yield as maintaining a long term balance between the annual groundwater abstraction and recharge however this definition has been mainly criticized due to a common misperception that the development of a groundwater system is safe if the average annual rate of groundwater discharge does not exceed the average rate of natural recharge through precipitation and surface water seepage todd 1959 sophocleous 2000 actually the notion of safe yield ignores the fact that aquifer outflow in the form of evapotranspiration and seepage into streams and springs is balanced by recharge under natural conditions in the long term thus if pumping equals recharge streams and springs may eventually dry up and the aquifer may be depleted of groundwater as the result of continued pumping in excess of recharge sophocleous 2000 this misconception has led to a shift in terminology from safe yield to sustainable yield defined as the development and use of groundwater resource in such a way that can be maintained for an infinite time without any unacceptable environmental economic or social consequences alley et al 1999 sophocleous 2000 custodio 2002 kalf and woodlley 2005 reviewed the gradual change from safe to sustainable yield and discussed the method for estimating sustainable yield based on the water balance equation at the water basin scale in order to apply the concept of sustainability to water resources it is necessary to understand and quantify the effects of human activities on the water resources and environment as far into the future as possible in addition the systems should be robust and flexible so that they can be easily adapted to unexpected future changes therefore defining and measuring sustainability is a major challenge unesco 1999 loucks 2000 norton and toman 1995 emphasized that the term sustainability includes some conceptual ambiguities which are difficult to resolve such as the relation between sustainability and measures of economic well being and the problem of defining the physical scales of sustainability evaluations in case of multiple stakeholder groups practically sustainable yield is often calculated as the percentage of the long term average recharge norton and toman 1995 however bredehoeft 2002 argued that the changes in recharge and discharge caused by abstraction influence the sustainable yield zhou et al 2012 emphasized that sustainable yield cannot be simply calculated as a single value by using the water balance however the dynamic response of the groundwater levels to the groundwater abstraction should be evaluated 2 2 bidwell et al 2007 dogrul et al 2016 gao et al 2016 and sidle 1986 although it has been ignored in most of the studies conducted so far in addition to these complexities sustainable groundwater yield varies with spatial and temporal scales hugman et al 2013 stated that defining sustainable yield based on long term averages or annual values of recharge can lead to over or under exploitation of groundwater in their study different time scales were used to calculate groundwater recharge and extraction these time scales included 1 day 1 month 3 month 6 month and 1 year the study defines sustainable groundwater yield in south portugal as a percentage of groundwater recharge during a defined time period they concluded that reducing the time scale of sustainable yield definition allows for an increase in withdrawal volumes while maintaining the sustainability of the system on the other hand sustainable yield also depends on the definition of spatial scale one can argue that defining the sustainable yield over a relatively large area with a fixed volume of extraction may lead to low rates of withdrawal per unit area although the total groundwater extraction compared to the total recharge and discharge may show a sustainable condition it is misleading in the sense that it ignores the local inverse effects of groundwater pumping i e substantially influence a potential ecosystem therefore sustainable yield should be defined based on a reasonably small spatial scale to properly address significant and important local effects but reasonably large enough to identify the ability of aquifer systems to adjust to pumping stresses maimone 2004 the present study aims to estimate the maximum sustainable yield of an aquifer by using the concept of capture which refers to the sum of the increase in recharge and decrease in discharge brought about by pumping this is performed for the nishapur plain in iran using a modflow model in addition various temporal and spatial scales were examined using the model for the purpose of planning for sustainable groundwater management in the region spatial scale refers to different groundwater zones over which groundwater recharge and discharge are estimated and temporal scale is the time step used to calculate the average groundwater recharge and discharge 2 description of study area 2 1 general information and water resources nishapur plain with an area of about 6000 km2 is located in khorasan razavi province in the north east of iran and bordered by binalood mountain in the north the average annual precipitation in the plain is 234 mm compared to high potential annual evapotranspiration of 2300 mm the only surface water resources in nishapur plain is the main branch of kalshur river due to the limited availability of surface water groundwater is the main source of water supplying more than 90 of water consumption in the plain the available data shows that the long term average annual volume of groundwater pumpage in the plain is about 509 mcm of which more than 96 is used in agriculture in addition the total domestic and industrial demand in nishapur plain is about 40 mcm of which about 10 mcm is supplied from groundwater wells fig 1 shows the location of nishapur plain in iran and kavir markazi basin and land use map of the plain the digital elevation model dem map of nishapur plain is also presented in fig 2 the total irrigated area of nishapur plain is 54 245 ha which is divided into traditional and modern irrigation area traditional irrigation systems with low irrigation efficiency are used in about 63 of total irrigated area equal to about 34 174 ha which is defined as traditional irrigation area while modern irrigation methods such as pressure irrigation systems and pipeline networks are mainly used in about 20 071 ha of the total irrigated area in nishapur plain sazab co 2009 the irrigation efficiency of nishapur plain was estimated in the study conducted by sazab co 2009 this study concluded that irrigation efficiency of traditional and modern irrigation areas are 28 and 54 respectively resulting in the total basin irrigation efficiency of approximately 38 this estimate was primarily based on weighted average efficiency estimated for conveyance system distribution system water application and irrigation technology and management a significant portion of total extracted water in nishapur plain is allocated to wheat 36 5 and sugar beet 31 6 both of which benefit from a set price and pre purchase by the government entities wheat is one of the oldest crops grown in nishapur plain including 41 of the total irrigated area barley sugar beet and cotton are regarded as the other important products in the plain table 1 illustrates the monthly net irrigation demand of major crops in nishapur plain which is close to the worldwide averages 3 3 fao crop water needs and agricultural production information of the current crop pattern is shown in table 2 as illustrated in this table due to the relatively low irrigation efficiency the annual gross irrigation water requirement of the current crop pattern is about 12 600 m3 ha using the weighted value of gross irrigation demand of major crops sazab co 2009 fig 3 shows the distribution of monthly gross irrigation demand according to this figure gross irrigation demand in winter is almost zero and the peak of demand occurs in april may and june gross irrigation demand is less than 1250 m3 ha in march july and august and less than 1000 m3 ha in autumn based on the information derived from previous studies in nishapur plain about 170 mcm of agricultural demand is supplied by surface water aqueducts and springs it is worth noting that as aqueducts are located outside the boundary of nishapur plain aquifer the effect of extracted water from aqueducts is merely considered in the groundwater recharge 2 2 the aquifer of nishapur plain accordicing to the previous studies the aquifer of nishapur plain is unconfined sazab co and izady 2014 fig 4 shows the geologic map of nishapur plain and two cross sections of the aquifer the physical properties of the aquifer including bedrock map and aquifer thickness map and hydraulic properties including hydraulic conductivity k and specific yield sy were derived from the study done by izady 2014 and presented in fig 5 and 6 respectively according to the available data there are 1690 pumping wells in nishapur plain which are mainly located near the eastern boundary of the plain also there are 50 observation wells in the plain which are used in the calibration procedure fig 7 shows the location of pumping and observation wells in the plain fig 8 presents a hydrograph representing the regional groundwater level trends based on the observed groundwater levels this regional hydrograph is developed using observation data from all the observation wells in the region using a thiessen polygon method over the whole area of the plain based on this regional hydrograph the groundwater levels have experienced a declining condition which is reflective of the condition that the long term amount of recharge has beenless than groundwater withdrawals the regional hydrograph indicates that during wet hydrologic conditions there are short term recoveries in the groundwater levels in recent decades groundwater depletion in nishapur plain resulted from uncontrolled withdrawal causes considerable decline in groundwater levels and land subsidence as well as the degradation of groundwater quality the results of the previous studies showed that the average annual land subsidence in nishapur plain is about 10 cm iwrm 4 4 iran water resource management company co 2015 sazab co 2009 some of the consequences of land subsidence in nishapur plain are damage to roads oil and gas transmission lines and potential damage to mashhad nishapur railways 3 materials and method 3 1 concept of capture capture refers to the increase in recharge and decrease in discharge lohman et al 1972 and equilibrium is obtained when pumping equals to capture the relationship between change in storage decreased outflow and increased inflow as a result of groundwater withdrawal is presented in fig 9 seward et al 2006 as shown in this figure change in storage equals zero when pumping equals sum of the increased recharge and decreased discharge capture according to lohman et al 1972 capture is described by a simple water balance equation 1 r δr d δd q s δh δt where q lt 1 is the rate of groundwater pumpage r lt 1 represents natural recharge δr lt 1 indicates the change in the recharge caused by pumping d lt 1 shows natural discharge δd lt 1 is regarded as the change in discharge caused by pumping the value of sδh δt describes the rate of change in storage in which s is specific yield and δh l and δt t are change in groundwater level and time interval respectively the right side of the eq 1 shows the total recharge and the left side indicates the total discharge of the aquifer after pumping based on the capture equation it is evident that r d and s δh δt 0 under the natural condition thus the following equations are obtained when the pumpage is introduced and equilibrium conditions are obtained 2 δr δd q or q δr δd δr and δd are calculated according to the pumping time step seward et al 2006 in the present study capture principle defined by eq 2 was used to estimate the groundwater sustainable yield 3 2 numerical model in the present study a modflow 2005 groundwater flow model was used to simulate groundwater dynamics in nishapur plain aquifer the groundwater basin was discretized into grid of cells with a size of 500 m the model includes one unconfined layer and uses a monthly stress period and time step for simulation the eastern and a small portion of the southern boundary of the groundwater basin were defined as constant inflow boundary and a small portion of the western boundary was defined as constant outflow boundary other boundaries were determined as no flow boundary fig 10 illustartes a schematic map in which the network of cells boundary conditions of the groundwater model of nishapur plain and the location of pumping wells are presented in order to use capture concept groundwater recharge and discharge in natural and post development condition i e after abstracting groundwater were determined using this groundwater model the model was calibrated by the automated pest calibration method aquifer properties including hydraulic conductivity and specific yield rainfall infiltration factor recharge from surface water and recharge from return flow of irrigation water were modified during the calibration process the calibration target was set so that root mean square error rmse of simulated and observed hydraulic head would be less than 1 5 m in order to calibrate hydraulic conductivity and specific yield some control points were defined over the whole area of the plain fig 11 presents the location of these control points in the plain according to the results of the previous studies and based on the topography of the plain soil type and expert experiences the rainfall infiltration factor was assumed to be 0 5 of the long term average rainfall in addition recharge from surface water main branches of kalshur river was considered to be 10 15 of the long term average river discharge and recharge from return flow of irrigation water was considered to be 15 25 of the annual groundwater withdrawal sazab co 2009 izady 2014 the values of these factors were determined in the model calibration in this study the development and calibration of groundwater model was done in two steps in the first step the steady state model was developed and calibrated using the 8 year 2005 2013 average values of the groundwater recharge and discharge after the calibration of this model the value of rainfall infiltration factor the share of river discharge and return flow of irrigation water that infilltrates the aquifer and the value of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield in the defined control points were determined the calibrated steady state model was used to construct pre development or natural groundwater model in which groundwater withdrawal equals zero next natural groundwater recharge and discharge were estimated using this model natural groundwater recharge was calculated by summing the recharge from rainfall infiltration and kalshur river seepage and groundwater inflow from adjacent aquifers in the east and south of the aquifer in addition natural discharge equals the sum of groundwater outflow to natural drainage and adjacent aquifer in the west of the aquifer in the second step under post development condition the transient groundwater model of nishapur plain with 84 monthly stress periods and one time step in each stress period was developed and calibrated during the 7 year period of 2005 2012 in this step the initial value of the calibration parameters were derived from the results of first step and adjusted at the end of this step then the developed model was validated in the period of 2012 2013 next in the transient groundwater model monthly areal recharge rate was estimated as the sum of the rainfall infiltration return flow of irrigation water and kalshur river seepage and groundwater inflow from adjacent aquifers in the east and south of the aquifer in this condition groundwater discharge was equal to outflow to adjacent aquifers in the west of the aquifer it is worth noting that the results of the groundwater model shows that the groundwater outflow to natural drainage equals zero in the developed condition this occurs due to the low groundwater table after groundwater abstraction then increase in recharge δr and decrease in discharge δd as a results of abstracting groundwater were estimated by subtracting groundwater recharge and discharge in the natural condition from value of these parameters in the developed condition afterward based on the capture concept groundwater sustainable yield of nishapur plain was estimated using the values of δr and δd and eq 2 it should be noted that according to this equation by limiting the groundwater withdrawal to the estimated sustainable yield change in the groundwater storage and as a result change in the groundwater level will be almost zero and the groundwater will reach a new equilibrium 3 3 simulation scenarios in order to examine the effect of spatial and temporal scale on the groundwater sustainability the sustainable yield of nishapur plain was estimated based on the results of the calibrated transient groundwater model and capture concept this part of the study was divided into two steps the first step involved different scenarios in which the effect of spatial scale on the sustainable yield was evaluated in the second step four scenarios were defined to examine the effect of temporal scale by using the spatial scale which maximizes sustainable yield derived from the results of the first step in the first scenario of the first step the sustainable yield was defined over the whole area of the plain as a large scale in the second scenario the area of the plain was divided into different groundwater zones based on the location of the pumping wells and sustainable yield was estimated in each zone the sustainable yield of the plain equals the sum of the estimated sustainable yield of these zones using the results of the second scenario other scenarios were defined in a trial and error procedure according to the sustainability status of the groundwater zones in the previous scenario sustainable groundwater zones were combined with each other and unsustainable zones divided into smaller zones in each scenario the procedure was continued until the change in the sustainable yield in two consecutive scenarios was negligible and the maximum sustainable yield was reached it is possible to use different time scale to calculate groundwater recharge and discharge therefore duirng the second step four different scenarios were defined to examine the effect of temporal scale on the groundwater sustainable yield of nishapur plain in the first two scenarios sustainable yield was calculated by using 1 year and 6 month average values of the groundwater recharge and discharge then two other scenarios were defined to assess the effect of seasonal and monthly time scale on the groundwater sustainable yield fig 12 shows the flowchart of the simulation scenarios in this part of the study the results of the previous studies indicated that reaching a new equilibrium takes a long period of time after limiting the groundwater withdrawal with a specific value such as sustainable yield kalf and woolley 2005 hu et al 2010 gleeson et al 2012 however determining the sustainable yield results in reaching a new equilibrium during a short period of time is important from the perspective of planning for sustainable management of groundwater resources therefore in each of the scenarios in the present study the groundwater sustainable yield was determined in a long planning horizon more than 75 years and a short planning horizon which was assumed to be equal to the simulation period 8 years in this study in this study the short planning horizon was selected based on the maximum continuous period of the available data 4 results and discussion 4 1 natural pre development condition natural pre development condition was simulated to estimate the natural groundwater recharge and discharge in nishapur plain using the calibrated steady state model according to the results of steady state model calibration the mr 5 5 mean residual mar 6 6 mean absolute residual and rmse of simulated hydraulic head in the steady state condition was about 0 21 0 94 and 1 32 m respectively and the calibrated value of rainfall infiltrtion factor recharge from kalsur river discharge and recharge from return flow of irrigation water was determined to be 5 15 and 20 respectively the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield maps were also modified therefore in the steady state groundwater model areal recharge rate equals sum of the 5 of the 42 year period of 1971 2013 average rainfall 15 of the 41 year period of 1971 2012 average kalshur river discharge and 20 of average annual groundwater withdrawal then in the calibrated steady state model the groundwater withdrawal was set to zero to develop natural groundwater model in the pre development or natural condition the aquifer is in equilibrium the change in the storage equals zero and the natural recharge equals natural discharge table 3 shows the water balance components of nishapur plain in the natural condition as shown in this table both natural recharge and discharge of nishapur plain equals 69 mcm 4 2 developed condition the transient groundwater model of nishapur plain was developed and calibrated in the 7 year period 2005 2012 after the calibration process the value of calibration parameters 7 7 rainfall infiltration factor the share of kalshur river discharge and return flow of irrigated area that infiltrates the groundwater hydralic conductivity and specific yield which were derived from calibration of the steady states model has been adjused the results of the calibration of model indicated that mr mar and rmse of simulated hydraulic head was 0 17 0 87 and 1 15 m respectively then validation of the groundwater model was done in 2012 2013 and the results illustrates that mr mar and rmse of the simulated hydraulic head in the validation prosecc was 0 18 0 9 and 1 23 m which show the accuracy of the groundwater model based on the results of the transient groundwater model the average annual groundwater storage depletion in the 8 year period of 2005 2013 is about 311 mcm table 4 it should be noted that the values of recharge from rainfall surface water and return flow of irrigation water in this table water were the input of the model the distribution map of the groundwater level in the end of the simulation period is presented in fig 13 the results indicated that the maximum groundwater table decline occurred in the north east of the plain is about 11 m in addition maximum groundwater table rise observed in the north west of the plain is 0 5 m in general a significant groundwater table decline occured in the north and south of the plain due to the excessive withdrawal in spite of the considerable recharge in these regions as a result of the high hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic slope fig 14 illustrates the variation of the simulated and observed groundwater level and 95 confidence interval upper and lower limit in the developed condition and fig 15 shows the variation of simualted groudwater levels versus observed values for four different observation wells as an example the r squared values of the simulated hydraulic head in these observation wells were also presented in fig 15 the transient groundwater model of nishapur plain is used to calculate the groundwater recharge and discharge and change in the storage after abstracting groundwater then these values were used to estimate sustainable yield using eq 2 and the results of the steady state model 4 3 effect of spatial scale in order to examine the effect of spatial scale on the sustainable yield the groundwater sustainable yield of nishapur plain was determined by using capture concept in five different scenarios table 5 indcates the number of groundwater zones in these scenarios in each scenario the first and second numbers represent the number of the scenario and step respecively in scenario 1 1 using the concept of capture and results from modflow model the sustainable yield was calculated based on the annual average recharge and discharge derived from the whole area of the plain as shown in table 4 the groundwater recharge and discharge in the developed condition are 207 mcm and 9 mcm respectively thus using the capture concept eq 2 groundwater sustainable yield is about 198 mcm by subtracting decrease in groundwater discharge δr 59 8 from increase in groundwater recharge δd 137 9 which is equal to almost 40 of the current groundwater abstraction the components of the capture concept in scenario 1 1 is presented in table 6 based on the simulation results it takes about 100 years to reach a new equilibrium by equating the groundwater withdrawal to the sustainable yield fig 16 illustrates the variation of the simulated groundwater level for piezo 1 as an example of limitting groundwater abstraction with the sustainable yield determined in scenario 1 1 as shown after about 96 years the groundwater level changes have been stopped and the aquifer has reached a new equilibrium according to the results in order to reach a new equilibrium in a short period of time 8 years in this study the sustainable yield should be reduced to about 100 mcm 20 of the current pumpage in scenario 2 1 the area of the plain was divided into 32 zones based on the location of the pumping wells using the results of scenario 2 1 scenarios 3 1 4 1 and 5 1 were defined in a trial and error procedure the number of zones in scenario 3 1 4 1 and 5 1 was 23 29 and 31 respectively fig 17 illustrates the groundwater zones in nishapour plain in scenario 2 1 as an example based on the results maximum sustainble yield was achieved in the scenario 5 1 therefore defining another scenario is not necessary in this regard table 7 indicates the results of the groundwater sustainable yield in nishapur plain in the long and short planning horizon as illustrated in this table different spatial scale results in achieving different groundwater sustainable yields in this study minimum suatainable yeild was achieved in scenario 1 1 in which the spatial scale equals to the whole area of the plain in oreder to evaluate the effect of large spatial scale on the sustainable yield thus large spatial scales could result in underestimating the groundwater sustainble yield of the palin according to the results presented in table 7 the maximum sustainable yield was achieved in scenario 5 1 which is equal to about 295 and 189 mcm in a long and short planning horizon respectively in this scenario the sustainable yield is about 58 of the current pumpage in a long planning horizon while the current groundwater pumpage should be reduced about 63 to be sustainable in the short planning horizon thus sustainable yield in scenario 5 1 is almost 97 and 89 mcm more than scenario 1 1 in the long and short planning horizon respectively this amount of water is about 20 of the current groundwater consumption in nishapr plain in other words in scenario 5 1 it is possible to irrigate nearly 8000 ha of land more than that of scenario 1 1 therefore spatial scale can significantly affect on determination of sustainable yield and planning for sustainable groundwater management the results show that decreasing trend in the groundwater level was stopped in all of the studied scenarios as a result of limitting groundwater abstraction with sustainable yield determined in each scenario and the maximum groundwater level was achieved in scenario 5 1 hence defining appropriate spatial scale can influecne groundwater sustainbale yield resulting in producing higher sustainable groundwater table 4 4 effect of temporal scale during the second step the groundwater sustainable yield of nishapur plain was determined in four different scenarios in order to examine the effect of temporal scale on the groundwater sustainable yield using the spatial scale defined in the scenario 5 1 each scenario was simulated in two different planning horizons the results of the simulated scenarios in this step were compared with those in the scenario 5 1 tables 8 indicates the results of the groundwater sustainable yield of nishapur plain in the scenarios under study during the long and short planning horizon based on the results in table 8 no significant difference was observed in the sustainable yields obtained in the scenario 5 1 and 1 2 because the annual changes in the groundwater recharge and discharge in nishapur plain are negligible calculating the groundwater recharge and discharge based on the 6 month average values in the scenario 2 2 results in determining the sustainable yield in the autumn and spring less than what is actually sustainable since the agricultural water demand in the summer is less than that of spring and equals to zero in the winter in almost all the cultivated area in nishapur plain therefore using a 6 month time scale results in underestimating the groundwater sustainable yield based on the results maximum sustainable yield was achieved in the scenario 4 2 which is almost 5 and 10 mcm more than the amount in the scenario 5 1 in the long and short planning horizon respectively due to the absence of seasonal variation in the groundwater recharge and discharge the amount of groundwater sustainable yield in the scenario 3 2 is very close to that of the scenario 4 2 the results illustrate that he maximum simulated groundwater level was achieved in scenario 4 2 thus temporal scale can influence sustainable yield and defining a proper temporal scale based on the nature of the temporal variation in each groundwater system could result in achieving maximum sustainable yield and groundwater table as a general conclusion for the step 1 and 2 the simultaneous effect of spacial and temporal scale on the groundwater sustainable yield in nishapur plain leads to about 100 mcm increase in the sustainable yield compared to the scenario 1 1 which is of great economic and social significance further it is concluded that the maximum groundwater sustainable yield in nishapur plain is about 300 and 200 mcm in the long and short planning horizon respectively 4 5 planning for groundwater sustainable use the reduction of irrigated area and an increase in irrigation efficiency are considered as two strategies for groundwater sustainable use in nishapur plain it is worth noting that about 170 mcm of water derived from other resources is used in supplying irrigation demand in nishapur plain in addition to the groundwater resources therefore the total irrigable area is calculated by using groundwater sustainable yield in different scenarios and 170 mcm of water derived from other resources in each related strategy 4 5 1 irrigation area curtalge strategy in the area curtalge sterategy it is assumed that the total irrigation efficiency equals to 38 the irrigation efficiency in the current condition therefore the irrigated area should be decreased in order to meet irrigation demand with acceptable criteria in the condition of limiting the groundwater withdarawal by sustainable yield which is estimated in the long and short planning horizon in the simulated scenarios in section 4 3 and 4 4 the results indicates that by applying this strategy the total current area of wheat and sugar beet can be irrigated in all of the scenarios except in the scenario 1 1 during the long planning horizon the area of barley equals to zero in the scenario 1 1 with minimum sustainable yield and should be decreased to about 21 of the current irrigated area in the scenario 4 2 in which maximum sustainable yield was reached in addition it is not possible to cultivate cotton during the long planning horizon in this condition regarding the short planning horizon the total current area of wheat could be irrigated except in the scenario 1 1 and a maximum of 55 of the current area of sugar beet can be irrigated in the scenario 4 2 thus irrigating barley and cotton is impossible it is worth noting that curtailing the irrigation area has many social and economic consequences therefore this strategy could endanger the social and economic balance of the region and requires more extensive social and economic studies 4 5 2 efficiency increase strategy the irrigation system in about 63 of the irrigated area of nishapur plain is mainly flood irrigation methods basin border and furrow therefore the irrigation efficieny is very low in nishapur plain and according to previous studies it is about 38 regarding the crop pattern and agricultural conditions a variety of irrigation method such as surface and sprinkler irrigation can be used in nishapur plain in order to increase the irrigation efficiency based on this strategy it is assumed that the irrigation efficiency could be increased to about 60 due to improving the irrigation system this is an achievable rate based on data from the iranian government organizations according to the results in this strategy the total current irrigated area in nishapur plain could be irrigted except in the the long term scnarios 1 1 and 1 2 thus increasing efficiency makes the groundwater resources of nishapur plain sustainable in the long planning horizon and makes it possible to irrigate the total irrigated area of the plain also the results show that the total current area of wheat and sugar beet can be irrigated in the short planning horizon in this condition a maximum of 80 of the current area of barley can be irrigated in the scenario 4 2 and the total irrigable area of cotton and other crops becomes zero 5 summary and conclusions in arid and semi arid areas groundwater resources play an important role in supplying demands due to limitations in runoff and availability of surface water resources excessive goundwater withdrawal have resulted in groundwater depletion which underlines the necessity and importance of sustainable groundwater management groundwater is the main source of water supply in nishapur plain located in khorasan razavi province in the northeast of iran in nishapur plain the long term annual average groundwater abstraction is about 509 mcm of which more than 96 is used in agriculture in the present study modflow 2005 was employed to develop and calibrate a single layer groundwater model in nishapur plain based on the results of the transient groundwater model average annual groundwater storage depletion is about 311 mcm during the 8 year period of 2005 2013 therefore planning for sustainable groundwater management in nishapur plain plays an important role in satisfying ever increasing water demand in this study the effect of spatial and temporal scale on the groundwater sustainable yield caculalation in nishapur plain was examined using capture concept in two steps the first step involved five scenarios in which the effect of spatial scale on the sustainable yield was evaluated during the second step four scenarios yearly 6 month seasonal and monthly were defined to examine the effect of temporal scale using the spatial scale which maximizes sustainable yield in each of these scenarios groundwater sustainable yield was determined in two different planning horizon a long planning horizon 75 years and a short planning horizon equal to simulation period of 8 years long based on the results of the step 1 and 2 defining an appropriate spatial and temporal scale could result in achieving maximum sustainable yield with highest groundwater level the results indicated that the maximum groundwater sustainable yield to reach a new equilibrium was about 300 and 200 mcm in the short and long planning horizon respectively accordingly the sustainable yield was about 59 and 39 of the current groundwater withdrawals in the short and long planning horizon respectively next two different strategies of cultivated area curtilage and irrigation efficiency increase were proposed in order to suggest a sustainable groundwater use in the plain for this purpose the total irrigable area of four majour crops in nishapur plain including wheat sugar beet barley and cotton was determined for all the simulated scenarios in the section 4 3 and 4 4 in each strategy in the cultivated area curtilage strategy it is assumed that irrigatin efficiency equals to 38 current efficiency based on this strategy the total current hectarage of wheat and sugar beet can be irrigated in all of the scenarios except in the scenario 1 1 during the long planning horizon in this condition the minimum and maximum irrigable area of barley equals to 0 and 21 of the current irrigated area respectively and cultivating cotton is impossible the total current area of wheat could be irrigated except in the scenario 1 1 during the short planning horizon further the minimum and maximum irrigable area of sugar beet was about 0 and 55 of the irrigated area of sugar beet in the current condition the irrigated area of barley and cotton was zero in this condition regarding the efficiency increase strategy it was assumed that the curretnt irrigation efficiency could increase to at least 60 by using a variety of surface irrigation and sprinkler irrigation methods based on this strategy it is possible to irrigate the total irrigated area of the plain using the groundwater sustainable yield in all of the scenarios in the long planning horizon however the total current area of wheat and sugar beet could be irrigated during the short planning horizon and the maximum irrigable area of barley was about 80 in the scenario 4 2 where the groundwater sustainable yield was maximum based on this condition the total irrigable area of cotton and other crops was zero the results of this study indicates that defining the appropriate spatial and temporal scale regarding the aquifer physical and hydrologic conditions makes it possible to maximize the estiamted groundwater sustainable yield further sustainable groundwater management reduces negative economic and social impacts of groundwater resources limitation and provides the possibility of using these scarce resources for a longer time especially in arid and semi arid regions like iran in addition estimating sustainable yield provides water managers with valuable information which helps them develop an appropriate plan to reduce the effects of water crisis it is worth noting that performing economic and social assessments play an important role in comparing different scenarios and providing practical strategies for water resources management also using optimization methods can improve the results therefore it is suggested that in the future studies the optimal scenario for sustainable groundwater management will be selected through economic and social assessments and using the conventional optimization methods in addition proposing cropping pattern through agricultural studies and according to the groundwater sustainable yield will increase the success of the proposed sustainable management strategies declaration of competing

10770,in iran due to arid and semi arid climate groundwater resources play an essential role in food production as well as domestic and industrial water supply in recent years increasing population scarcity of surface water resources and effects of worldwide and regional climate change have resulted in over exploitation and unsustainability of these resources in the country the present study aims to estimate groundwater sustainable yield examine effects of spatial and temporal scale and propose a plan for groundwater sustainable use in nishapur plain in the north east of iran in investigating the effects of spatial scale the area of the plain is divided into several zones with estimation of groundwater recharge and discharge for each zone and the temporal scale refers to the different time scales used to estimate the average value of groundwater recharge and discharge the results of the transient groundwater model of nishapur plain revealed that average annual groundwater storage depletion is about 311 mcm 1 1 million cubic meters during the 8 year period of 2005 2013 with the minimum average and maximum water table decline of 0 6 m 7 7 m and 11 m respectively the study results suggest that sustainable yield is closely correlated to the spatial and temporal scales and refinement of spatial and temporal scales increases sustainable yield from 39 to 59 of the current pumping volume equal to about 100 mcm of water or 8000 ha of irrigated land furthermore when the groundwater withdrawals are limited to sustainable yield increasing irrigation efficiency from 38 current efficiency to about 60 can potentially result in maintaining irrigated areas and minimize adverse social and economic impacts of limiting groundwater usage this is an achievable rate based on data from the iranian government organizations the results of this study can be extended to other semi arid agricultural areas which primarily depend on groundwater keywords sustainable yield groundwater sustainable use capture concept groundwater modeling nishapur plain 1 introduction groundwater is the main source of water for many people around the world and plays a fundamental role in irrigation of crop fields and the protection of ecosystems in recent decades an increasing demand of water on one hand and over exploitation of groundwater resources on the other hand has led to the unsustainability of these scarce resources worldwide wada et al 2010 in the last century safe yield has being brought to scientists attention lee 1915 theis 1940 todd 1959 sophocleous 1997 lee 1915 pioneered to describe the maximum value for regular and permanent withdrawal without endangering the storage reserve in addition the concept of safe yield has been further developed from different aspects such as economic feasibility groundwater quality protection existing water laws and water rights as well as potential environmental problems todd 1959 defined safe yield as the amount of water which can be withdrawn from a groundwater basin annually without any undesirable results sophocleous 1997 defined safe yield as maintaining a long term balance between the annual groundwater abstraction and recharge however this definition has been mainly criticized due to a common misperception that the development of a groundwater system is safe if the average annual rate of groundwater discharge does not exceed the average rate of natural recharge through precipitation and surface water seepage todd 1959 sophocleous 2000 actually the notion of safe yield ignores the fact that aquifer outflow in the form of evapotranspiration and seepage into streams and springs is balanced by recharge under natural conditions in the long term thus if pumping equals recharge streams and springs may eventually dry up and the aquifer may be depleted of groundwater as the result of continued pumping in excess of recharge sophocleous 2000 this misconception has led to a shift in terminology from safe yield to sustainable yield defined as the development and use of groundwater resource in such a way that can be maintained for an infinite time without any unacceptable environmental economic or social consequences alley et al 1999 sophocleous 2000 custodio 2002 kalf and woodlley 2005 reviewed the gradual change from safe to sustainable yield and discussed the method for estimating sustainable yield based on the water balance equation at the water basin scale in order to apply the concept of sustainability to water resources it is necessary to understand and quantify the effects of human activities on the water resources and environment as far into the future as possible in addition the systems should be robust and flexible so that they can be easily adapted to unexpected future changes therefore defining and measuring sustainability is a major challenge unesco 1999 loucks 2000 norton and toman 1995 emphasized that the term sustainability includes some conceptual ambiguities which are difficult to resolve such as the relation between sustainability and measures of economic well being and the problem of defining the physical scales of sustainability evaluations in case of multiple stakeholder groups practically sustainable yield is often calculated as the percentage of the long term average recharge norton and toman 1995 however bredehoeft 2002 argued that the changes in recharge and discharge caused by abstraction influence the sustainable yield zhou et al 2012 emphasized that sustainable yield cannot be simply calculated as a single value by using the water balance however the dynamic response of the groundwater levels to the groundwater abstraction should be evaluated 2 2 bidwell et al 2007 dogrul et al 2016 gao et al 2016 and sidle 1986 although it has been ignored in most of the studies conducted so far in addition to these complexities sustainable groundwater yield varies with spatial and temporal scales hugman et al 2013 stated that defining sustainable yield based on long term averages or annual values of recharge can lead to over or under exploitation of groundwater in their study different time scales were used to calculate groundwater recharge and extraction these time scales included 1 day 1 month 3 month 6 month and 1 year the study defines sustainable groundwater yield in south portugal as a percentage of groundwater recharge during a defined time period they concluded that reducing the time scale of sustainable yield definition allows for an increase in withdrawal volumes while maintaining the sustainability of the system on the other hand sustainable yield also depends on the definition of spatial scale one can argue that defining the sustainable yield over a relatively large area with a fixed volume of extraction may lead to low rates of withdrawal per unit area although the total groundwater extraction compared to the total recharge and discharge may show a sustainable condition it is misleading in the sense that it ignores the local inverse effects of groundwater pumping i e substantially influence a potential ecosystem therefore sustainable yield should be defined based on a reasonably small spatial scale to properly address significant and important local effects but reasonably large enough to identify the ability of aquifer systems to adjust to pumping stresses maimone 2004 the present study aims to estimate the maximum sustainable yield of an aquifer by using the concept of capture which refers to the sum of the increase in recharge and decrease in discharge brought about by pumping this is performed for the nishapur plain in iran using a modflow model in addition various temporal and spatial scales were examined using the model for the purpose of planning for sustainable groundwater management in the region spatial scale refers to different groundwater zones over which groundwater recharge and discharge are estimated and temporal scale is the time step used to calculate the average groundwater recharge and discharge 2 description of study area 2 1 general information and water resources nishapur plain with an area of about 6000 km2 is located in khorasan razavi province in the north east of iran and bordered by binalood mountain in the north the average annual precipitation in the plain is 234 mm compared to high potential annual evapotranspiration of 2300 mm the only surface water resources in nishapur plain is the main branch of kalshur river due to the limited availability of surface water groundwater is the main source of water supplying more than 90 of water consumption in the plain the available data shows that the long term average annual volume of groundwater pumpage in the plain is about 509 mcm of which more than 96 is used in agriculture in addition the total domestic and industrial demand in nishapur plain is about 40 mcm of which about 10 mcm is supplied from groundwater wells fig 1 shows the location of nishapur plain in iran and kavir markazi basin and land use map of the plain the digital elevation model dem map of nishapur plain is also presented in fig 2 the total irrigated area of nishapur plain is 54 245 ha which is divided into traditional and modern irrigation area traditional irrigation systems with low irrigation efficiency are used in about 63 of total irrigated area equal to about 34 174 ha which is defined as traditional irrigation area while modern irrigation methods such as pressure irrigation systems and pipeline networks are mainly used in about 20 071 ha of the total irrigated area in nishapur plain sazab co 2009 the irrigation efficiency of nishapur plain was estimated in the study conducted by sazab co 2009 this study concluded that irrigation efficiency of traditional and modern irrigation areas are 28 and 54 respectively resulting in the total basin irrigation efficiency of approximately 38 this estimate was primarily based on weighted average efficiency estimated for conveyance system distribution system water application and irrigation technology and management a significant portion of total extracted water in nishapur plain is allocated to wheat 36 5 and sugar beet 31 6 both of which benefit from a set price and pre purchase by the government entities wheat is one of the oldest crops grown in nishapur plain including 41 of the total irrigated area barley sugar beet and cotton are regarded as the other important products in the plain table 1 illustrates the monthly net irrigation demand of major crops in nishapur plain which is close to the worldwide averages 3 3 fao crop water needs and agricultural production information of the current crop pattern is shown in table 2 as illustrated in this table due to the relatively low irrigation efficiency the annual gross irrigation water requirement of the current crop pattern is about 12 600 m3 ha using the weighted value of gross irrigation demand of major crops sazab co 2009 fig 3 shows the distribution of monthly gross irrigation demand according to this figure gross irrigation demand in winter is almost zero and the peak of demand occurs in april may and june gross irrigation demand is less than 1250 m3 ha in march july and august and less than 1000 m3 ha in autumn based on the information derived from previous studies in nishapur plain about 170 mcm of agricultural demand is supplied by surface water aqueducts and springs it is worth noting that as aqueducts are located outside the boundary of nishapur plain aquifer the effect of extracted water from aqueducts is merely considered in the groundwater recharge 2 2 the aquifer of nishapur plain accordicing to the previous studies the aquifer of nishapur plain is unconfined sazab co and izady 2014 fig 4 shows the geologic map of nishapur plain and two cross sections of the aquifer the physical properties of the aquifer including bedrock map and aquifer thickness map and hydraulic properties including hydraulic conductivity k and specific yield sy were derived from the study done by izady 2014 and presented in fig 5 and 6 respectively according to the available data there are 1690 pumping wells in nishapur plain which are mainly located near the eastern boundary of the plain also there are 50 observation wells in the plain which are used in the calibration procedure fig 7 shows the location of pumping and observation wells in the plain fig 8 presents a hydrograph representing the regional groundwater level trends based on the observed groundwater levels this regional hydrograph is developed using observation data from all the observation wells in the region using a thiessen polygon method over the whole area of the plain based on this regional hydrograph the groundwater levels have experienced a declining condition which is reflective of the condition that the long term amount of recharge has beenless than groundwater withdrawals the regional hydrograph indicates that during wet hydrologic conditions there are short term recoveries in the groundwater levels in recent decades groundwater depletion in nishapur plain resulted from uncontrolled withdrawal causes considerable decline in groundwater levels and land subsidence as well as the degradation of groundwater quality the results of the previous studies showed that the average annual land subsidence in nishapur plain is about 10 cm iwrm 4 4 iran water resource management company co 2015 sazab co 2009 some of the consequences of land subsidence in nishapur plain are damage to roads oil and gas transmission lines and potential damage to mashhad nishapur railways 3 materials and method 3 1 concept of capture capture refers to the increase in recharge and decrease in discharge lohman et al 1972 and equilibrium is obtained when pumping equals to capture the relationship between change in storage decreased outflow and increased inflow as a result of groundwater withdrawal is presented in fig 9 seward et al 2006 as shown in this figure change in storage equals zero when pumping equals sum of the increased recharge and decreased discharge capture according to lohman et al 1972 capture is described by a simple water balance equation 1 r δr d δd q s δh δt where q lt 1 is the rate of groundwater pumpage r lt 1 represents natural recharge δr lt 1 indicates the change in the recharge caused by pumping d lt 1 shows natural discharge δd lt 1 is regarded as the change in discharge caused by pumping the value of sδh δt describes the rate of change in storage in which s is specific yield and δh l and δt t are change in groundwater level and time interval respectively the right side of the eq 1 shows the total recharge and the left side indicates the total discharge of the aquifer after pumping based on the capture equation it is evident that r d and s δh δt 0 under the natural condition thus the following equations are obtained when the pumpage is introduced and equilibrium conditions are obtained 2 δr δd q or q δr δd δr and δd are calculated according to the pumping time step seward et al 2006 in the present study capture principle defined by eq 2 was used to estimate the groundwater sustainable yield 3 2 numerical model in the present study a modflow 2005 groundwater flow model was used to simulate groundwater dynamics in nishapur plain aquifer the groundwater basin was discretized into grid of cells with a size of 500 m the model includes one unconfined layer and uses a monthly stress period and time step for simulation the eastern and a small portion of the southern boundary of the groundwater basin were defined as constant inflow boundary and a small portion of the western boundary was defined as constant outflow boundary other boundaries were determined as no flow boundary fig 10 illustartes a schematic map in which the network of cells boundary conditions of the groundwater model of nishapur plain and the location of pumping wells are presented in order to use capture concept groundwater recharge and discharge in natural and post development condition i e after abstracting groundwater were determined using this groundwater model the model was calibrated by the automated pest calibration method aquifer properties including hydraulic conductivity and specific yield rainfall infiltration factor recharge from surface water and recharge from return flow of irrigation water were modified during the calibration process the calibration target was set so that root mean square error rmse of simulated and observed hydraulic head would be less than 1 5 m in order to calibrate hydraulic conductivity and specific yield some control points were defined over the whole area of the plain fig 11 presents the location of these control points in the plain according to the results of the previous studies and based on the topography of the plain soil type and expert experiences the rainfall infiltration factor was assumed to be 0 5 of the long term average rainfall in addition recharge from surface water main branches of kalshur river was considered to be 10 15 of the long term average river discharge and recharge from return flow of irrigation water was considered to be 15 25 of the annual groundwater withdrawal sazab co 2009 izady 2014 the values of these factors were determined in the model calibration in this study the development and calibration of groundwater model was done in two steps in the first step the steady state model was developed and calibrated using the 8 year 2005 2013 average values of the groundwater recharge and discharge after the calibration of this model the value of rainfall infiltration factor the share of river discharge and return flow of irrigation water that infilltrates the aquifer and the value of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield in the defined control points were determined the calibrated steady state model was used to construct pre development or natural groundwater model in which groundwater withdrawal equals zero next natural groundwater recharge and discharge were estimated using this model natural groundwater recharge was calculated by summing the recharge from rainfall infiltration and kalshur river seepage and groundwater inflow from adjacent aquifers in the east and south of the aquifer in addition natural discharge equals the sum of groundwater outflow to natural drainage and adjacent aquifer in the west of the aquifer in the second step under post development condition the transient groundwater model of nishapur plain with 84 monthly stress periods and one time step in each stress period was developed and calibrated during the 7 year period of 2005 2012 in this step the initial value of the calibration parameters were derived from the results of first step and adjusted at the end of this step then the developed model was validated in the period of 2012 2013 next in the transient groundwater model monthly areal recharge rate was estimated as the sum of the rainfall infiltration return flow of irrigation water and kalshur river seepage and groundwater inflow from adjacent aquifers in the east and south of the aquifer in this condition groundwater discharge was equal to outflow to adjacent aquifers in the west of the aquifer it is worth noting that the results of the groundwater model shows that the groundwater outflow to natural drainage equals zero in the developed condition this occurs due to the low groundwater table after groundwater abstraction then increase in recharge δr and decrease in discharge δd as a results of abstracting groundwater were estimated by subtracting groundwater recharge and discharge in the natural condition from value of these parameters in the developed condition afterward based on the capture concept groundwater sustainable yield of nishapur plain was estimated using the values of δr and δd and eq 2 it should be noted that according to this equation by limiting the groundwater withdrawal to the estimated sustainable yield change in the groundwater storage and as a result change in the groundwater level will be almost zero and the groundwater will reach a new equilibrium 3 3 simulation scenarios in order to examine the effect of spatial and temporal scale on the groundwater sustainability the sustainable yield of nishapur plain was estimated based on the results of the calibrated transient groundwater model and capture concept this part of the study was divided into two steps the first step involved different scenarios in which the effect of spatial scale on the sustainable yield was evaluated in the second step four scenarios were defined to examine the effect of temporal scale by using the spatial scale which maximizes sustainable yield derived from the results of the first step in the first scenario of the first step the sustainable yield was defined over the whole area of the plain as a large scale in the second scenario the area of the plain was divided into different groundwater zones based on the location of the pumping wells and sustainable yield was estimated in each zone the sustainable yield of the plain equals the sum of the estimated sustainable yield of these zones using the results of the second scenario other scenarios were defined in a trial and error procedure according to the sustainability status of the groundwater zones in the previous scenario sustainable groundwater zones were combined with each other and unsustainable zones divided into smaller zones in each scenario the procedure was continued until the change in the sustainable yield in two consecutive scenarios was negligible and the maximum sustainable yield was reached it is possible to use different time scale to calculate groundwater recharge and discharge therefore duirng the second step four different scenarios were defined to examine the effect of temporal scale on the groundwater sustainable yield of nishapur plain in the first two scenarios sustainable yield was calculated by using 1 year and 6 month average values of the groundwater recharge and discharge then two other scenarios were defined to assess the effect of seasonal and monthly time scale on the groundwater sustainable yield fig 12 shows the flowchart of the simulation scenarios in this part of the study the results of the previous studies indicated that reaching a new equilibrium takes a long period of time after limiting the groundwater withdrawal with a specific value such as sustainable yield kalf and woolley 2005 hu et al 2010 gleeson et al 2012 however determining the sustainable yield results in reaching a new equilibrium during a short period of time is important from the perspective of planning for sustainable management of groundwater resources therefore in each of the scenarios in the present study the groundwater sustainable yield was determined in a long planning horizon more than 75 years and a short planning horizon which was assumed to be equal to the simulation period 8 years in this study in this study the short planning horizon was selected based on the maximum continuous period of the available data 4 results and discussion 4 1 natural pre development condition natural pre development condition was simulated to estimate the natural groundwater recharge and discharge in nishapur plain using the calibrated steady state model according to the results of steady state model calibration the mr 5 5 mean residual mar 6 6 mean absolute residual and rmse of simulated hydraulic head in the steady state condition was about 0 21 0 94 and 1 32 m respectively and the calibrated value of rainfall infiltrtion factor recharge from kalsur river discharge and recharge from return flow of irrigation water was determined to be 5 15 and 20 respectively the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield maps were also modified therefore in the steady state groundwater model areal recharge rate equals sum of the 5 of the 42 year period of 1971 2013 average rainfall 15 of the 41 year period of 1971 2012 average kalshur river discharge and 20 of average annual groundwater withdrawal then in the calibrated steady state model the groundwater withdrawal was set to zero to develop natural groundwater model in the pre development or natural condition the aquifer is in equilibrium the change in the storage equals zero and the natural recharge equals natural discharge table 3 shows the water balance components of nishapur plain in the natural condition as shown in this table both natural recharge and discharge of nishapur plain equals 69 mcm 4 2 developed condition the transient groundwater model of nishapur plain was developed and calibrated in the 7 year period 2005 2012 after the calibration process the value of calibration parameters 7 7 rainfall infiltration factor the share of kalshur river discharge and return flow of irrigated area that infiltrates the groundwater hydralic conductivity and specific yield which were derived from calibration of the steady states model has been adjused the results of the calibration of model indicated that mr mar and rmse of simulated hydraulic head was 0 17 0 87 and 1 15 m respectively then validation of the groundwater model was done in 2012 2013 and the results illustrates that mr mar and rmse of the simulated hydraulic head in the validation prosecc was 0 18 0 9 and 1 23 m which show the accuracy of the groundwater model based on the results of the transient groundwater model the average annual groundwater storage depletion in the 8 year period of 2005 2013 is about 311 mcm table 4 it should be noted that the values of recharge from rainfall surface water and return flow of irrigation water in this table water were the input of the model the distribution map of the groundwater level in the end of the simulation period is presented in fig 13 the results indicated that the maximum groundwater table decline occurred in the north east of the plain is about 11 m in addition maximum groundwater table rise observed in the north west of the plain is 0 5 m in general a significant groundwater table decline occured in the north and south of the plain due to the excessive withdrawal in spite of the considerable recharge in these regions as a result of the high hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic slope fig 14 illustrates the variation of the simulated and observed groundwater level and 95 confidence interval upper and lower limit in the developed condition and fig 15 shows the variation of simualted groudwater levels versus observed values for four different observation wells as an example the r squared values of the simulated hydraulic head in these observation wells were also presented in fig 15 the transient groundwater model of nishapur plain is used to calculate the groundwater recharge and discharge and change in the storage after abstracting groundwater then these values were used to estimate sustainable yield using eq 2 and the results of the steady state model 4 3 effect of spatial scale in order to examine the effect of spatial scale on the sustainable yield the groundwater sustainable yield of nishapur plain was determined by using capture concept in five different scenarios table 5 indcates the number of groundwater zones in these scenarios in each scenario the first and second numbers represent the number of the scenario and step respecively in scenario 1 1 using the concept of capture and results from modflow model the sustainable yield was calculated based on the annual average recharge and discharge derived from the whole area of the plain as shown in table 4 the groundwater recharge and discharge in the developed condition are 207 mcm and 9 mcm respectively thus using the capture concept eq 2 groundwater sustainable yield is about 198 mcm by subtracting decrease in groundwater discharge δr 59 8 from increase in groundwater recharge δd 137 9 which is equal to almost 40 of the current groundwater abstraction the components of the capture concept in scenario 1 1 is presented in table 6 based on the simulation results it takes about 100 years to reach a new equilibrium by equating the groundwater withdrawal to the sustainable yield fig 16 illustrates the variation of the simulated groundwater level for piezo 1 as an example of limitting groundwater abstraction with the sustainable yield determined in scenario 1 1 as shown after about 96 years the groundwater level changes have been stopped and the aquifer has reached a new equilibrium according to the results in order to reach a new equilibrium in a short period of time 8 years in this study the sustainable yield should be reduced to about 100 mcm 20 of the current pumpage in scenario 2 1 the area of the plain was divided into 32 zones based on the location of the pumping wells using the results of scenario 2 1 scenarios 3 1 4 1 and 5 1 were defined in a trial and error procedure the number of zones in scenario 3 1 4 1 and 5 1 was 23 29 and 31 respectively fig 17 illustrates the groundwater zones in nishapour plain in scenario 2 1 as an example based on the results maximum sustainble yield was achieved in the scenario 5 1 therefore defining another scenario is not necessary in this regard table 7 indicates the results of the groundwater sustainable yield in nishapur plain in the long and short planning horizon as illustrated in this table different spatial scale results in achieving different groundwater sustainable yields in this study minimum suatainable yeild was achieved in scenario 1 1 in which the spatial scale equals to the whole area of the plain in oreder to evaluate the effect of large spatial scale on the sustainable yield thus large spatial scales could result in underestimating the groundwater sustainble yield of the palin according to the results presented in table 7 the maximum sustainable yield was achieved in scenario 5 1 which is equal to about 295 and 189 mcm in a long and short planning horizon respectively in this scenario the sustainable yield is about 58 of the current pumpage in a long planning horizon while the current groundwater pumpage should be reduced about 63 to be sustainable in the short planning horizon thus sustainable yield in scenario 5 1 is almost 97 and 89 mcm more than scenario 1 1 in the long and short planning horizon respectively this amount of water is about 20 of the current groundwater consumption in nishapr plain in other words in scenario 5 1 it is possible to irrigate nearly 8000 ha of land more than that of scenario 1 1 therefore spatial scale can significantly affect on determination of sustainable yield and planning for sustainable groundwater management the results show that decreasing trend in the groundwater level was stopped in all of the studied scenarios as a result of limitting groundwater abstraction with sustainable yield determined in each scenario and the maximum groundwater level was achieved in scenario 5 1 hence defining appropriate spatial scale can influecne groundwater sustainbale yield resulting in producing higher sustainable groundwater table 4 4 effect of temporal scale during the second step the groundwater sustainable yield of nishapur plain was determined in four different scenarios in order to examine the effect of temporal scale on the groundwater sustainable yield using the spatial scale defined in the scenario 5 1 each scenario was simulated in two different planning horizons the results of the simulated scenarios in this step were compared with those in the scenario 5 1 tables 8 indicates the results of the groundwater sustainable yield of nishapur plain in the scenarios under study during the long and short planning horizon based on the results in table 8 no significant difference was observed in the sustainable yields obtained in the scenario 5 1 and 1 2 because the annual changes in the groundwater recharge and discharge in nishapur plain are negligible calculating the groundwater recharge and discharge based on the 6 month average values in the scenario 2 2 results in determining the sustainable yield in the autumn and spring less than what is actually sustainable since the agricultural water demand in the summer is less than that of spring and equals to zero in the winter in almost all the cultivated area in nishapur plain therefore using a 6 month time scale results in underestimating the groundwater sustainable yield based on the results maximum sustainable yield was achieved in the scenario 4 2 which is almost 5 and 10 mcm more than the amount in the scenario 5 1 in the long and short planning horizon respectively due to the absence of seasonal variation in the groundwater recharge and discharge the amount of groundwater sustainable yield in the scenario 3 2 is very close to that of the scenario 4 2 the results illustrate that he maximum simulated groundwater level was achieved in scenario 4 2 thus temporal scale can influence sustainable yield and defining a proper temporal scale based on the nature of the temporal variation in each groundwater system could result in achieving maximum sustainable yield and groundwater table as a general conclusion for the step 1 and 2 the simultaneous effect of spacial and temporal scale on the groundwater sustainable yield in nishapur plain leads to about 100 mcm increase in the sustainable yield compared to the scenario 1 1 which is of great economic and social significance further it is concluded that the maximum groundwater sustainable yield in nishapur plain is about 300 and 200 mcm in the long and short planning horizon respectively 4 5 planning for groundwater sustainable use the reduction of irrigated area and an increase in irrigation efficiency are considered as two strategies for groundwater sustainable use in nishapur plain it is worth noting that about 170 mcm of water derived from other resources is used in supplying irrigation demand in nishapur plain in addition to the groundwater resources therefore the total irrigable area is calculated by using groundwater sustainable yield in different scenarios and 170 mcm of water derived from other resources in each related strategy 4 5 1 irrigation area curtalge strategy in the area curtalge sterategy it is assumed that the total irrigation efficiency equals to 38 the irrigation efficiency in the current condition therefore the irrigated area should be decreased in order to meet irrigation demand with acceptable criteria in the condition of limiting the groundwater withdarawal by sustainable yield which is estimated in the long and short planning horizon in the simulated scenarios in section 4 3 and 4 4 the results indicates that by applying this strategy the total current area of wheat and sugar beet can be irrigated in all of the scenarios except in the scenario 1 1 during the long planning horizon the area of barley equals to zero in the scenario 1 1 with minimum sustainable yield and should be decreased to about 21 of the current irrigated area in the scenario 4 2 in which maximum sustainable yield was reached in addition it is not possible to cultivate cotton during the long planning horizon in this condition regarding the short planning horizon the total current area of wheat could be irrigated except in the scenario 1 1 and a maximum of 55 of the current area of sugar beet can be irrigated in the scenario 4 2 thus irrigating barley and cotton is impossible it is worth noting that curtailing the irrigation area has many social and economic consequences therefore this strategy could endanger the social and economic balance of the region and requires more extensive social and economic studies 4 5 2 efficiency increase strategy the irrigation system in about 63 of the irrigated area of nishapur plain is mainly flood irrigation methods basin border and furrow therefore the irrigation efficieny is very low in nishapur plain and according to previous studies it is about 38 regarding the crop pattern and agricultural conditions a variety of irrigation method such as surface and sprinkler irrigation can be used in nishapur plain in order to increase the irrigation efficiency based on this strategy it is assumed that the irrigation efficiency could be increased to about 60 due to improving the irrigation system this is an achievable rate based on data from the iranian government organizations according to the results in this strategy the total current irrigated area in nishapur plain could be irrigted except in the the long term scnarios 1 1 and 1 2 thus increasing efficiency makes the groundwater resources of nishapur plain sustainable in the long planning horizon and makes it possible to irrigate the total irrigated area of the plain also the results show that the total current area of wheat and sugar beet can be irrigated in the short planning horizon in this condition a maximum of 80 of the current area of barley can be irrigated in the scenario 4 2 and the total irrigable area of cotton and other crops becomes zero 5 summary and conclusions in arid and semi arid areas groundwater resources play an important role in supplying demands due to limitations in runoff and availability of surface water resources excessive goundwater withdrawal have resulted in groundwater depletion which underlines the necessity and importance of sustainable groundwater management groundwater is the main source of water supply in nishapur plain located in khorasan razavi province in the northeast of iran in nishapur plain the long term annual average groundwater abstraction is about 509 mcm of which more than 96 is used in agriculture in the present study modflow 2005 was employed to develop and calibrate a single layer groundwater model in nishapur plain based on the results of the transient groundwater model average annual groundwater storage depletion is about 311 mcm during the 8 year period of 2005 2013 therefore planning for sustainable groundwater management in nishapur plain plays an important role in satisfying ever increasing water demand in this study the effect of spatial and temporal scale on the groundwater sustainable yield caculalation in nishapur plain was examined using capture concept in two steps the first step involved five scenarios in which the effect of spatial scale on the sustainable yield was evaluated during the second step four scenarios yearly 6 month seasonal and monthly were defined to examine the effect of temporal scale using the spatial scale which maximizes sustainable yield in each of these scenarios groundwater sustainable yield was determined in two different planning horizon a long planning horizon 75 years and a short planning horizon equal to simulation period of 8 years long based on the results of the step 1 and 2 defining an appropriate spatial and temporal scale could result in achieving maximum sustainable yield with highest groundwater level the results indicated that the maximum groundwater sustainable yield to reach a new equilibrium was about 300 and 200 mcm in the short and long planning horizon respectively accordingly the sustainable yield was about 59 and 39 of the current groundwater withdrawals in the short and long planning horizon respectively next two different strategies of cultivated area curtilage and irrigation efficiency increase were proposed in order to suggest a sustainable groundwater use in the plain for this purpose the total irrigable area of four majour crops in nishapur plain including wheat sugar beet barley and cotton was determined for all the simulated scenarios in the section 4 3 and 4 4 in each strategy in the cultivated area curtilage strategy it is assumed that irrigatin efficiency equals to 38 current efficiency based on this strategy the total current hectarage of wheat and sugar beet can be irrigated in all of the scenarios except in the scenario 1 1 during the long planning horizon in this condition the minimum and maximum irrigable area of barley equals to 0 and 21 of the current irrigated area respectively and cultivating cotton is impossible the total current area of wheat could be irrigated except in the scenario 1 1 during the short planning horizon further the minimum and maximum irrigable area of sugar beet was about 0 and 55 of the irrigated area of sugar beet in the current condition the irrigated area of barley and cotton was zero in this condition regarding the efficiency increase strategy it was assumed that the curretnt irrigation efficiency could increase to at least 60 by using a variety of surface irrigation and sprinkler irrigation methods based on this strategy it is possible to irrigate the total irrigated area of the plain using the groundwater sustainable yield in all of the scenarios in the long planning horizon however the total current area of wheat and sugar beet could be irrigated during the short planning horizon and the maximum irrigable area of barley was about 80 in the scenario 4 2 where the groundwater sustainable yield was maximum based on this condition the total irrigable area of cotton and other crops was zero the results of this study indicates that defining the appropriate spatial and temporal scale regarding the aquifer physical and hydrologic conditions makes it possible to maximize the estiamted groundwater sustainable yield further sustainable groundwater management reduces negative economic and social impacts of groundwater resources limitation and provides the possibility of using these scarce resources for a longer time especially in arid and semi arid regions like iran in addition estimating sustainable yield provides water managers with valuable information which helps them develop an appropriate plan to reduce the effects of water crisis it is worth noting that performing economic and social assessments play an important role in comparing different scenarios and providing practical strategies for water resources management also using optimization methods can improve the results therefore it is suggested that in the future studies the optimal scenario for sustainable groundwater management will be selected through economic and social assessments and using the conventional optimization methods in addition proposing cropping pattern through agricultural studies and according to the groundwater sustainable yield will increase the success of the proposed sustainable management strategies declaration of competing

10771,iran has the second rank in production and cultivation area and the fifth in exporting date palm in the world even though the date palm has a high economic value due to the water crisis in iran the effect of date palm production on the water resources along with its economic value should be considered this research assesses the index of water footprint and economic value of water footprint for three cultivars of date palms including the soft semi dry and dry during the period 2008 2016 through this study these indices have been computed for date palms and compared with the other agricultural products in iran finally the results are used for prioritization of the cultivated area the outputs show that the average footprint and economic value of water footprint for date palm is 3 02 m3 kg and 0 59 usd m3 respectively which in this regards the share of green blue and grey water footprint are 9 1 76 9 and 14 the maximum value of water footprint 8 6 m3 kg and economic value of water footprint 1 49 usd m3 belongs to the dry date palm while the minimum value of those indices is 0 97 m3 kg and 0 19 usd m3 which belongs to the semi dry date palm in comparison the date palm with 43 agricultural products in iran the dry date palm is ranked 33 in water footprint and 18 in the economic value of water footprint while the semi dry and the soft date palms are ranked 33 and 34 in water footprint and 29 and 30 in the economic value of water footprint the volume of water footprint for date palm is about 2437 million cubic meters mcm per year in iran which the share of soft semi dry and dry date palms are 79 6 18 and 2 45 respectively the volume of the exported virtual water is 1243 mcm with 733 million usd economic value of water footprint whereas the net benefit of exported date palm is one quarter of its economic value of water footprint the results of this study show that the indices discussed through this study capable to provide valuable information for prioritization of date palm cultivation and management of water resources in iran keywords water footprint economic value date palm cultivars water management 1 introduction date palm is one of the ancient fruit crops belong to the arecaceae family barrow 1998 date palms grow even under severe conditions in arid and semiarid areas and have great socioeconomic importance especially in the middle east and north africa hasnaoui et al 2011 date palms are known for their nutritional value micronutrient fiber and protein barh and mazudmar 2008 date palm cultivars are classified into three accepted categories according to water content and texture of the ripe fruit at harvest glasner et al 2002 soft dates usually possess more than 30 water content but no sucrose since the invertase enzyme converts all sucrose into glucose and fructose reducing sugars semi dry dates contains 20 30 water with some sucrose content whereas dry dates contain less than 20 water and almost often contain similar quantities of sucrose and reducing sugars at harvest stage hussein et al 1979 elleuch et al 2008 and guido et al 2011 date palm is an important agricultural production in iran due to its exported economic value this production has returned 153000 usd net benefits to iran s economy ministry of agriculture jihad maj 2017 according to fao 2017 egypt with a 19 production share is ranked as the first date producer and iran algeria saudi arabia and iraq with 14 12 9 and 7 respectively which are ranked as the second to the fifth producers in the world in this regard iran is the second country in production and cultivation area fifth in exporting of date palm and 17th of crop yield in the world in addition to the high economic value and nutrition it is important to consider the impact of date production on water resources since more than 50 of iran is covered by arid regions and the date palm grows in warm and dry lands of iran managing water resources is essential madani 2014 nowadays researchers are emphasis on revising the policies of water resources management such that the former approaches are replaced with the virtual water vw and the water footprint wf approaches the vw is defined as the total water used for the production of a product allan 1997 2003 salah 2014 and the wf is the index of estimation of the real water consumption hoekstra et al 2011a 2011b the wf of a product can be divided into three components which are the green wf effective rainfall the blue wf net irrigation requirement and the grey wf the volume of fresh water needed in dilution chemical fertilizer for agricultural production aims ababaei and ramezani etedali 2017 due to population increases food security and sustainable management of water resources are essential hence wf and economic wf are dynamic concepts for management of water resources in any sectors especially in agriculture these concepts are considered by many researchers in various fields for instance the study of water footprints on mango wf in australia ridoutt et al 2009 2010 banana in peru and ecowader zarate and kuiper 2013 citrus fruits in south africa munro et al 2016 cocoa in colombia ortiz rodriguez et al 2015 tropical fruits shtull trauring et al 2016 date palm mekonen and hoekstra 2011 oil palm mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 seewiseng et al 2012 gheewala et al 2014 suttayakul et al 2016 almond in california fulton et al 2019 saffron and citrus fruit bazrafshan et al 2019a b shtull trauring et al 2016 in studying of wf for tropical fruits such as banana avocado and date palm in the north part of the jordan valley in israel showed that the highest wf belongs to the date palm with the 0 75 m3 kg green blue wf they also found that when the energy of dates is replaced by the weight dates have lowest wf due to relatively high energy and low yield in comparison to other crops in this regard mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 estimated 2 227 m3 kg and 5 m3 kg on the global scale for total wf of date palm and oil palm respectively this also estimated 2 919 m3 kg for date palm in iran joseph 2017 estimated the total wf of date palm in oman with the value of 2 1 m3 kg chouchane et al 2015 calculated the total wf and economic wf value in tunisia respectively 4 39 m3 kg and 0 29 usd m3 the literature reviews show that there exist several estimations of date palm wf in the global mekonen and hoekstra 2011 and regional scales shtull trauring et al 2016 however there is no research which considers the wf components and economic value of date palm in details in cultivar levels the objective of this research is 1 estimating the wf components for date palm cultivars at the national and provincial scales 2 calculating the economic value of date palm wf and comparing with other agricultural products 3 estimating the volume of vw which annually exported and 4 regional prioritization of date palm producers 2 materials and methods the productive trees of the date palm in iran are covered by 199 114 ha which they yearly produce about 1 014 006 tons of date palm the main provinces of date palm producer are kerman khoozestan sistan baloochestan hormozgan fars south of keram and bushehr these provinces contain 90 of cultivated areas which produces 93 of date palm productions according to maj 2017 92 of date palm orchards are irrigated lands in iran there are several types of cultivar date palm in iran including soft semi dry and dry the soft date palm includes mazafati bazmani parkoo abdollahi shahani kabkab rabbi khass breim gantar shekari kalooteh halavi mordasang khanizi khassoei aal mehtari mosalla mosalla haloo bardian and zardak the semi dry date palm contains zahedi estamaran khazravi nikdini and halileh further the dry date palm contains piarom daski barhi and deiri through this study the information of the cultivated area crop yield per hectare chemical fertilizer consumption irrigation efficiency planting time and soil type are extracted from the bulletin of the ministry of agriculture jihad ministry of agriculture jihad maj 2017 during the 2008 2016 also the climatological data are provided from the iranian

which was obtained from the maj 2017 generally the prices were considered in this study are 1 25 usd kg for soft date palm 1 22 usd kg for semi dry date palm and 3 48 usd kg for dry date palm ministry of agriculture jihad maj 2017 the provinces are segmented through the k means clustering approach as one of the most popular and the simplest partitional algorithm jain 2010 to obtain the homogeneous areas in terms of wf and wfev indices 3 results 3 1 crop yield and area cultivated area variation crop yield and chemical fertilizer consumption at the regional and national scale are represented in table 1 the most cultivated areas 78 2 and date palm production 68 3 in iran belong to the soft type in this regards sistan baloochestan province has the highest date palm production and the south of kerman contains the highest cultivated area the average production of soft date palm in iran is about 5 tons ha which on average consumes 176 kg h chemical fertilizer annually the second rank of production and cultivation areas belongs to the semi dry date palm with 27 9 and 19 4 respectively five of those provinces produce the semi dry date palm with 6 2 tons ha crop yield the lowest cultivated area 2 4 and production 3 8 belongs to dry date palm which is cultivated only in four provinces the average crop yield of dry one is 5 5 tons ha and khoozestan has the highest cultivated area and production in semi dry and dry date palm the total cultivated areas of productive trees are 179 779 ha with the average crop yield of 5 54 tons ha and total production of 802 588 tons per year the crop yield variation and cultivated area for 2008 2016 are displayed in fig 2 it can be found from fig 2 that the cultivated area was increased during the 2009 2011 while the crop yield decreased but during the 2012 2016 the crop yield increased whereas the cultivated area was decreased the crop yield and cultivated area have increased by 4 3 and 12 4 respectively in the given period which results in 21 increasing in crop production 3 2 wf and wfev the wf and wfev s shares of various date palms are given in table 2 the average wf of the soft date palm is 2 68 m3 kg with the shares of 9 9 green 76 6 blue and 13 5 grey the highest and the lowest of wf belongs to the booshehr 3 42 m3 kg and khoozestan 2 06 m3 kg the average wfev of the soft date palm is 0 49 usd m3 this means that the value of one m3 of consuming water to produce one kg of the soft date palm is about 0 49 usd also khoozestan 0 76 usd m3 and booshehr 0 31 usd m3 have the highest and the lowest wfev of the soft date palm in iran the estimated wf of the semi dry date palm is 2 56 m3 kg from this the shares of green blue and grey wf are 10 1 75 9 and 14 respectively further the highest and the lowest wf belongs to kerman 4 04 m3 kg and fars 0 97 m3 kg the average wfev of the semi dry date palm is equal to that in soft date palm with 0 49 usd m3 the dry date palm has the average wf of 3 83 m3 kg from which kerman and khoozestan contain the highest and the lowest wf with the values 8 06 m3 kg and 1 08 m3 kg respectively moreover the average of wfev is 0 91 usd m3 that the lowest and the highest wfev belongs to khoozestan 1 46 usd m3 and sistan baloochestan 0 26 usd m3 overall the average wf of date palms in iran is 3 02 m3 kg with wfev of 0 59 usd m3 in this regard the share of green blue and grey wf are 9 1 76 9 and 12 respectively furthermore the highest and the lowest wf belong to the dry and semi dry palms temporal variation of wf and wfev has been displayed in fig 3 according to the results even though the crop yield and wef were increased the wf was decreased from 3 22 m3 kg to 2 93 m3 kg also the cost of one cubic meter of water that was consumed to produce one kg of date palm has been increased from 0 45 usd to 0 7 usd it should be considered that the world price of data palm was 0 81 usd kg in 2008 and 1 4 usd kg in 2017 according to faostat 2017 3 3 comparison of date palm with other products the wf and wfev of three types of date palm and 40 other products have been estimated in iran the estimated values of all 43 products are plotted through fig 4 in fig 4 the x axis wf is adjusted in ascending while the y axis wfev is adjusted in descending order as it is shown in fig 4 the dry date palm has a greater wfev comparing with other products such as almond apple orange watermelon onion potato wheat barley and saffron this type of date palm has the rank of 40 in wf and 18 in wfev among those 43 products the semi dry and soft date palms have a little difference in wf and wfev but they have a greater benefit compared to the saffron as a valuable product these two types of date palms have the ranks of 33 and 34 in wf and 29 and 30 in wfev respectively 3 4 regional prioritization of date palms in iran the regional prioritization has been performed using the clustering approach based on wf and wfev indices fig 5 a represents the priority of soft date palms among seven provinces it can be seen that the first cluster contains the south of kerman and khoozestan with the highest wfev and lowest wf hence these two regions are the priority in soft date palm cultivation within this cluster the range of wf is 2 to 2 3 m3 kg and wfev is 0 7 to 0 58 usd m3 the second priority is assigned to the cluster which contains sistan baloochestan kerman and fars with the range of wf from 2 4 to 3 m3 kg and wfev from 0 4 to 0 56 usd m3 finally the last cluster includes hormozgan and booshehr with the range of wf greater than 3 m3 kg and wfev less than 0 3 usd m3 the results of the regional prioritization of semi dry date palm show that fars khoozestan and sistan baloochestan with wfev value greater than 0 3 usd m3 and wf value less than 2 5 m3 kg constructs the first cluster while kerman and booshehr with wfev less than 0 3 usd m3 and wf value greater than 2 5 m3 kg are located in second regional priority fig 5b finally hormozgan and khoozestan with wfev greater than 1 4 usd m3 and wf value less than 3 m3 kg have the priority in dry date palm cultivation while kerman and sistan baloochestan with wfev less than 0 5 usd m3 and wf greater than 3 m3 kg are in the second priority fig 5c 3 5 comparing the total net benefit of exported date palms with wfev the total wf of date palm cultivation is 2347 mcm table 3 regarding the high production of the soft date palm and its cultivated area the share of total wf is 79 6 from national share 1868 mcm the south of kerman dedicated the greatest share 17 2 among all provinces the shares of the semi dry and dry date palm are 18 and 2 45 of the national share where khoozestan province has the greatest share in iran fig 6 displays the production variation and the net benefit of exported date palm for the duration of 2008 2016 according to iri customs irica 2016 reports the rate of exported date palm has been increased by 87 from 111846 tons to 171048 tons on average around 53 of produced date palm was exported which its total net benefit was 157 3 million usd considering this exported value the exported wf was 1243 mcm per year with the coast of 733 million usd fig 7 represents the exported wf components exported wfev and the total net benefit earned through the exported date palm during 2008 2016 during the study period while the exported wf components decreased the exported wfev and the total net benefits have been increased 4 discussion this study investigates the wf components and wf economic value of various date palms at the regional and national scale in iran during the 2008 2016 the virtual water exported through date palm was estimated and the wf and economic value of wf of 40 products were calculated and compared with the date palm product finally the cultivated regions of date palm were prioritized according to the given indices the estimated wf average of date palm productions are 3 02 m3 kg in iran 2 227 m3 kg in a global scale chapagain and hoeksra 2004 0 75 m3 kg in jordan shtull trauring et al 2016 and 2 1 m3 kg in oman joseph 2017 the important reasons of high wf in iran are the poor technology of irrigation high crop water requirement and low crop yield fao 2008 the estimated wf of the date palm is 2 27 m3 kg and 5 m3 kg in oil palm at the global scale however due to the water requirement crop yield climatic condition and agriculture water management these values are different for various palms mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 according to the fao 2017 during the 1961 2017 the date palm crop yields were decreased from 7 8 tons ha to 6 7 tons ha in the world while it was increased from 3 8 tons ha to 7 8 tons ha in iran this increasing is likely due to the improving of knowledge and technology of date palm cultivation however iran attained the 17th rank of date palm cultivation in the world fao 2017 the most reasons of low crop yield in iran is poor extension services and increasing diseases fao 2008 it is important to consider that while the date palm crop yield in egypt 35 tons ha is six times more than iran but it has one quarter cultivation area compared to iran and also ranked as the first country in date palm production no doubt this is because of employing high knowledge and technology fao 2008 bekheet and el sharabasy 2015 in addition to egypt saudi arabia 6 628 tons ha uae 7 188 oman 14 445 sudan 11 81 and algeria 6 133 have also better crop yields than iran thus the most important issues in palm cultivation which should be considered are attention to developing technology and employing modern methods in date palm cultivation in iran beside training and promoting farmers ministry of agriculture jihad maj 2017 further it can be found that during the study period the cultivated area crop yield and production were increased in iran but the crop yield was decreased during the 2009 2011 which is due to the increasing cultivated area by planting new palm trees ministry of agriculture jihad maj 2017 the share of green wf is only 9 1 0 27 m3 kg of the total wf which is concluded that the share of effective rainfall is very low this is due to the spatial distribution of date palm which generally they grow in arid and warm regions with rainfall less than 300 mm per year fars and booshehr counties have a high source of green water and use the water harvesting methods bazrafshan et al 2019b in planting which decreases the wf the share of blue wf is 76 9 2 7 m3 kg in iran the date palms cultivated areas are totally located in the arid and low rainfall regions of iran these regions face with low effective rainfall high evapotranspiration and crop water requirement on the other hand low irrigation efficiency 55 on average in those regions has caused to increase the proportion of blue wf ali houri and tishehzan 2008 hence it is essential to decrease irrigation water loss and increasing irrigation efficiency by using new technologies the biggest cultivated areas of the soft date palms is the south of kerman and booshehr the total wf consumed in these regions is 769 5 mcm with a low exporting and economic value due to the limitation of water resources the majority of blue water is provided through the groundwater thus developing valuable and marketable cultivars increases the economic value of wf further the share of grey wf is 14 0 44 m3 kg in iran the palm trees of these regions often located in light textured soils with poor organic matter high ph low capacity of water storage aryakia et al 2017 so that the optimal management of chemical fertilizer and applying organic and biofertilizers will decrease the soil and water pollution and increase the quality and quantity of date palms in total around 313 mcm is used for dilution of chemical fertilizer which is a notable volume of water since there exist a water stress in those regions in addition the fertilizing approaches of date palms in iran are broadcast and drill hole fertilization these methods increase the consumption of water and fertilizer environmental pollution and finally the grey wf will be increased this condition can be improved by using fertigation and foliar feeding dialami et al 2018 rousta 2002 malakouti and basirat 2002 despite the high wf of dry date cultivars the outputs of this research show that the wf economic value of dry date palm is high this is because of high pricing and marketability simple transportation and storage capability marouf et al 2012 the biggest cultivated area and production with high wf and low crop yield is of the soft date palm whereas the 18 types of soft date palms except kebkab shahani mazafti have the low ability of fresh keeping and low marketability and hence low exporting value rastegar et al 2012 according to maj 2017 43 3 of exported date palms in iran is the soft date palm which they are cultivated in all seven counties of this 20 45 of shared wf belongs to the dry and semi dry date palms while 46 7 of exported wf belongs to these types of date palms the most valuable commercial types of date palms are piarom estamaran zahedi deiri and rabbi so the development of crop production in those provinces with focusing on commercial advantages local and national marketing and foundation of a non governmental organization can increase the economic value of wf in those types of date palm the total wf of date palms in iran is 2437 mcm with virtual water trading of 1243 mcm the economic value of exported wf is 733 million usd but the net benefit of exported date palms is 157 3 million usd per year this means that the cost of exported date palms is one quarter of the cost of exported wf due to the water shortage it is essential to apply the new irrigation techniques optimizing the management practices and management of pests and diseases in these areas since the semi arid and arid regions are faced with the water stress thus the agricultural policies should be based on exporting low virtual water and high wfev agricultural crops and importing crops with large virtual water and low wfev shtull trauring and bernstein 2018 5 conclusion date palm growth regions are located in the arid and warm area with the rainfall less than 300 mm per year these areas faced with severe water stress over the past three decades due to the irregular politics of agricultural jihad especially in agricultural water management since the share of blue and grey wf are high in these regions it is essential to apply optimal management in water resources and fertilizers considering the limitation of water resources in the south of iran the wf and the economic value of wf provide useful information for prioritization of cultivated regions of date palms the management of water resources in those regions can be improved by combining local and regional information finally even though the concepts applied through this research can be used to evaluate the effect of the crop pattern on water resources but it cannot be used as a policy solution despite this it should be noted that these indices can be used as useful tools in water resource management however using these concepts without considering other management aspects of water resources have caused an excessive dependence on importing the agricultural products and foods these issues have increased commercial and security risks thus in addition to the virtual water trade wf and economic value of wf the political tools such as national security economic growth employment and poverty reduction

converts all sucrose into glucose and fructose reducing sugars semi dry dates contains 20 30 water with some sucrose content whereas dry dates contain less than 20 water and almost often contain similar quantities of sucrose and reducing sugars at harvest stage hussein et al 1979 elleuch et al 2008 and guido et al 2011 date palm is an important agricultural production in iran due to its exported economic value this production has returned 153000 usd net benefits to iran s economy ministry of agriculture jihad maj 2017 according to fao 2017 egypt with a 19 production share is ranked as the first date producer and iran algeria saudi arabia and iraq with 14 12 9 and 7 respectively which are ranked as the second to the fifth producers in the world in this regard iran is the second country in production and cultivation area fifth in exporting of date palm and 17th of crop yield in the world in addition to the high economic value and nutrition it is important to consider the impact of date production on water resources since more than 50 of iran is covered by arid regions and the date palm grows in warm and dry lands of iran managing water resources is essential madani 2014 nowadays researchers are emphasis on revising the policies of water resources management such that the former approaches are replaced with the virtual water vw and the water footprint wf approaches the vw is defined as the total water used for the production of a product allan 1997 2003 salah 2014 and the wf is the index of estimation of the real water consumption hoekstra et al 2011a 2011b the wf of a product can be divided into three components which are the green wf effective rainfall the blue wf net irrigation requirement and the grey wf the volume of fresh water needed in dilution chemical fertilizer for agricultural production aims ababaei and ramezani etedali 2017 due to population increases food security and sustainable management of water resources are essential hence wf and economic wf are dynamic concepts for management of water resources in any sectors especially in agriculture these concepts are considered by many researchers in various fields for instance the study of water footprints on mango wf in australia ridoutt et al 2009 2010 banana in peru and ecowader zarate and kuiper 2013 citrus fruits in south africa munro et al 2016 cocoa in colombia ortiz rodriguez et al 2015 tropical fruits shtull trauring et al 2016 date palm mekonen and hoekstra 2011 oil palm mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 seewiseng et al 2012 gheewala et al 2014 suttayakul et al 2016 almond in california fulton et al 2019 saffron and citrus fruit bazrafshan et al 2019a b shtull trauring et al 2016 in studying of wf for tropical fruits such as banana avocado and date palm in the north part of the jordan valley in israel showed that the highest wf belongs to the date palm with the 0 75 m3 kg green blue wf they also found that when the energy of dates is replaced by the weight dates have lowest wf due to relatively high energy and low yield in comparison to other crops in this regard mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 estimated 2 227 m3 kg and 5 m3 kg on the global scale for total wf of date palm and oil palm respectively this also estimated 2 919 m3 kg for date palm in iran joseph 2017 estimated the total wf of date palm in oman with the value of 2 1 m3 kg chouchane et al 2015 calculated the total wf and economic wf value in tunisia respectively 4 39 m3 kg and 0 29 usd m3 the literature reviews show that there exist several estimations of date palm wf in the global mekonen and hoekstra 2011 and regional scales shtull trauring et al 2016 however there is no research which considers the wf components and economic value of date palm in details in cultivar levels the objective of this research is 1 estimating the wf components for date palm cultivars at the national and provincial scales 2 calculating the economic value of date palm wf and comparing with other agricultural products 3 estimating the volume of vw which annually exported and 4 regional prioritization of date palm producers 2 materials and methods the productive trees of the date palm in iran are covered by 199 114 ha which they yearly produce about 1 014 006 tons of date palm the main provinces of date palm producer are kerman khoozestan sistan baloochestan hormozgan fars south of keram and bushehr these provinces contain 90 of cultivated areas which produces 93 of date palm productions according to maj 2017 92 of date palm orchards are irrigated lands in iran there are several types of cultivar date palm in iran including soft semi dry and dry the soft date palm includes mazafati bazmani parkoo abdollahi shahani kabkab rabbi khass breim gantar shekari kalooteh halavi mordasang khanizi khassoei aal mehtari mosalla mosalla haloo bardian and zardak the semi dry date palm contains zahedi estamaran khazravi nikdini and halileh further the dry date palm contains piarom daski barhi and deiri through this study the information of the cultivated area crop yield per hectare chemical fertilizer consumption irrigation efficiency planting time and soil type are extracted from the bulletin of the ministry of agriculture jihad ministry of agriculture jihad maj 2017 during the 2008 2016 also the climatological data are provided from the iranian meteorological organization irimo 2017 for the same duration the data contain the rainfall relative humidity sunshine hours max and min of temperature and wind velocity fig 1 2 1 estimation of wf components through this study the wf components of the date palm are calculated using the water footprint assessment manual hoekstra and chapagian 2008 hoekstra et al 2011a egan 2011 aldaya et al 2012 in the cropwat package the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 was considered as the standard method for computing the crop water requirement which is defined as the sum of crop evapotranspiration subtract by effective rainfall in this regards the most important factors of crop water requirements are climate planting date and irrigation method the green wf can be calculated eq 1 in eq 1 the p e represents the effective rainfall computed by the usda s c method in the duration of growth season on millimeter and the y shows the crop yield tons per hectare chapagain et al 2006 the effective rainfall was computed in the local scale every plain and the pe was calculated using the weighted average of plains in the provincial scale 1 w f g r e e n p e 10 y also the blue wf is computed through the eq 2 where the etc is the crop evapotranspiration in mm the y is defined as the weighted average of the plains at the provincial scale crop yield given from ministry of

in fact this is the value of consuming virtual water water value the net benefit is found by subtracting the benefit of selling each product by the cost of its cultivation practicing and harvesting which was obtained from the maj 2017 generally the prices were considered in this study are 1 25 usd kg for soft date palm 1 22 usd kg for semi dry date palm and 3 48 usd kg for dry date palm ministry of agriculture jihad maj 2017 the provinces are segmented through the k means clustering approach as one of the most popular and the simplest partitional algorithm jain 2010 to obtain the homogeneous areas in terms of wf and wfev indices 3 results 3 1 crop yield and area cultivated area variation crop yield and chemical fertilizer consumption at the regional and national scale are represented in table 1 the most cultivated areas 78 2 and date palm production 68 3 in iran belong to the soft type in this regards sistan baloochestan province has the highest date palm production and the south of kerman contains the highest cultivated area the average production of soft date palm in iran is about 5 tons ha which on average consumes 176 kg h chemical fertilizer annually the second rank of production and cultivation areas belongs to the semi dry date palm with 27 9 and 19 4 respectively five of those provinces produce the semi dry date palm with 6 2 tons ha crop yield the lowest cultivated area 2 4 and production 3 8 belongs to dry date palm which is cultivated only in four provinces the average crop yield of dry one is 5 5 tons ha and khoozestan has the highest cultivated area and production in semi dry and dry date palm the total cultivated areas of productive trees are 179 779 ha with the average crop yield of 5 54 tons ha and total production of 802 588 tons per year the crop yield variation and cultivated area for 2008 2016 are displayed in fig 2 it can be found from fig 2 that the cultivated area was increased during the 2009 2011 while the crop yield decreased but during the 2012 2016 the crop yield increased whereas the cultivated area was decreased the crop yield and cultivated area have increased by 4 3 and 12 4 respectively in the given period which results in 21 increasing in crop production 3 2 wf and wfev the wf and wfev s shares of various date palms are given in table 2 the average wf of the soft date palm is 2 68 m3 kg with the shares of 9 9 green 76 6 blue and 13 5 grey the highest and the lowest of wf belongs to the booshehr 3 42 m3 kg and khoozestan 2 06 m3 kg the average wfev of the soft date palm is 0 49 usd m3 this means that the value of one m3 of consuming water to produce one kg of the soft date palm is about 0 49 usd also khoozestan 0 76 usd m3 and booshehr 0 31 usd m3 have the highest and the lowest wfev of the soft date palm in iran the estimated wf of the semi dry date palm is 2 56 m3 kg from this the shares of green blue and grey wf are 10 1 75 9 and 14 respectively further the highest and the lowest wf belongs to kerman 4 04 m3 kg and fars 0 97 m3 kg the average wfev of the semi dry date palm is equal to that in soft date palm with 0 49 usd m3 the dry date palm has the average wf of 3 83 m3 kg from which kerman and khoozestan contain the highest and the lowest wf with the values 8 06 m3 kg and 1 08 m3 kg respectively moreover the average of wfev is 0 91 usd m3 that the lowest and the highest wfev belongs to khoozestan 1 46 usd m3 and sistan baloochestan 0 26 usd m3 overall the average wf of date palms in iran is 3 02 m3 kg with wfev of 0 59 usd m3 in this regard the share of green blue and grey wf are 9 1 76 9 and 12 respectively furthermore the highest and the lowest wf belong to the dry and semi dry palms temporal variation of wf and wfev has been displayed in fig 3 according to the results even though the crop yield and wef were increased the wf was decreased from 3 22 m3 kg to 2 93 m3 kg also the cost of one cubic meter of water that was consumed to produce one kg of date palm has been increased from 0 45 usd to 0 7 usd it should be considered that the world price of data palm was 0 81 usd kg in 2008 and 1 4 usd kg in 2017 according to faostat 2017 3 3 comparison of date palm with other products the wf and wfev of three types of date palm and 40 other products have been estimated in iran the estimated values of all 43 products are plotted through fig 4 in fig 4 the x axis wf is adjusted in ascending while the y axis wfev is adjusted in descending order as it is shown in fig 4 the dry date palm has a greater wfev comparing with other products such as almond apple orange watermelon onion potato wheat barley and saffron this type of date palm has the rank of 40 in wf and 18 in wfev among those 43 products the semi dry and soft date palms have a little difference in wf and wfev but they have a greater benefit compared to the saffron as a valuable product these two types of date palms have the ranks of 33 and 34 in wf and 29 and 30 in wfev respectively 3 4 regional prioritization of date palms in iran the regional prioritization has been performed using the clustering approach based on wf and wfev indices fig 5 a represents the priority of soft date palms among seven provinces it can be seen that the first cluster contains the south of kerman and khoozestan with the highest wfev and lowest wf hence these two regions are the priority in soft date palm cultivation within this cluster the range of wf is 2 to 2 3 m3 kg and wfev is 0 7 to 0 58 usd m3 the second priority is assigned to the cluster which contains sistan baloochestan kerman and fars with the range of wf from 2 4 to 3 m3 kg and wfev from 0 4 to 0 56 usd m3 finally the last cluster includes hormozgan and booshehr with the range of wf greater than 3 m3 kg and wfev less than 0 3 usd m3 the results of the regional prioritization of semi dry date palm show that fars khoozestan and sistan baloochestan with wfev value greater than 0 3 usd m3 and wf value less than 2 5 m3 kg constructs the first cluster while kerman and booshehr with wfev less than 0 3 usd m3 and wf value greater than 2 5 m3 kg are located in second regional priority fig 5b finally hormozgan and khoozestan with wfev greater than 1 4 usd m3 and wf value less than 3 m3 kg have the priority in dry date palm cultivation while kerman and sistan baloochestan with wfev less than 0 5 usd m3 and wf greater than 3 m3 kg are in the second priority fig 5c 3 5 comparing the total net benefit of exported date palms with wfev the total wf of date palm cultivation is 2347 mcm table 3 regarding the high production of the soft date palm and its cultivated area the share of total wf is 79 6 from national share 1868 mcm the south of kerman dedicated the greatest share 17 2 among all provinces the shares of the semi dry and dry date palm are 18 and 2 45 of the national share where khoozestan province has the greatest share in iran fig 6 displays the production variation and the net benefit of exported date palm for the duration of 2008 2016 according to iri customs irica 2016 reports the rate of exported date palm has been increased by 87 from 111846 tons to 171048 tons on average around 53 of produced date palm was exported which its total net benefit was 157 3 million usd considering this exported value the exported wf was 1243 mcm per year with the coast of 733 million usd fig 7 represents the exported wf components exported wfev and the total net benefit earned through the exported date palm during 2008 2016 during the study period while the exported wf components decreased the exported wfev and the total net benefits have been increased 4 discussion this study investigates the wf components and wf economic value of various date palms at the regional and national scale in iran during the 2008 2016 the virtual water exported through date palm was estimated and the wf and economic value of wf of 40 products were calculated and compared with the date palm product finally the cultivated regions of date palm were prioritized according to the given indices the estimated wf average of date palm productions are 3 02 m3 kg in iran 2 227 m3 kg in a global scale chapagain and hoeksra 2004 0 75 m3 kg in jordan shtull trauring et al 2016 and 2 1 m3 kg in oman joseph 2017 the important reasons of high wf in iran are the poor technology of irrigation high crop water requirement and low crop yield fao 2008 the estimated wf of the date palm is 2 27 m3 kg and 5 m3 kg in oil palm at the global scale however due to the water requirement crop yield climatic condition and agriculture water management these values are different for various palms mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 according to the fao 2017 during the 1961 2017 the date palm crop yields were decreased from 7 8 tons ha to 6 7 tons ha in the world while it was increased from 3 8 tons ha to 7 8 tons ha in iran this increasing is likely due to the improving of knowledge and technology of date palm cultivation however iran attained the 17th rank of date palm cultivation in the world fao 2017 the most reasons of low crop yield in iran is poor extension services and increasing diseases fao 2008 it is important to consider that while the date palm crop yield in egypt 35 tons ha is six times more than iran but it has one quarter cultivation area compared to iran and also ranked as the first country in date palm production no doubt this is because of employing high knowledge and technology fao 2008 bekheet and el sharabasy 2015 in addition to egypt saudi arabia 6 628 tons ha uae 7 188 oman 14 445 sudan 11 81 and algeria 6 133 have also better crop yields than iran thus the most important issues in palm cultivation which should be considered are attention to developing technology and employing modern methods in date palm cultivation in iran beside training and promoting farmers ministry of agriculture jihad maj 2017 further it can be found that during the study period the cultivated area crop yield and production were increased in iran but the crop yield was decreased during the 2009 2011 which is due to the increasing cultivated area by planting new palm trees ministry of agriculture jihad maj 2017 the share of green wf is only 9 1 0 27 m3 kg of the total wf which is concluded that the share of effective rainfall is very low this is due to the spatial distribution of date palm which generally they grow in arid and warm regions with rainfall less than 300 mm per year fars and booshehr counties have a high source of green water and use the water harvesting methods bazrafshan et al 2019b in planting which decreases the wf the share of blue wf is 76 9 2 7 m3 kg in iran the date palms cultivated areas are totally located in the arid and low rainfall regions of iran these regions face with low effective rainfall high evapotranspiration and crop water requirement on the other hand low irrigation efficiency 55 on average in those regions has caused to increase the proportion of blue wf ali houri and tishehzan 2008 hence it is essential to decrease irrigation water loss and increasing irrigation efficiency by using new technologies the biggest cultivated areas of the soft date palms is the south of kerman and booshehr the total wf consumed in these regions is 769 5 mcm with a low exporting and economic value due to the limitation of water resources the majority of blue water is provided through the groundwater thus developing valuable and marketable cultivars increases the economic value of wf further the share of grey wf is 14 0 44 m3 kg in iran the palm trees of these regions often located in light textured soils with poor organic matter high ph low capacity of water storage aryakia et al 2017 so that the optimal management of chemical fertilizer and applying organic and biofertilizers will decrease the soil and water pollution and increase the quality and quantity of date palms in total around 313 mcm is used for dilution of chemical fertilizer which is a notable volume of water since there exist a water stress in those regions in addition the fertilizing approaches of date palms in iran are broadcast and drill hole fertilization these methods increase the consumption of water and fertilizer environmental pollution and finally the grey wf will be increased this condition can be improved by using fertigation and foliar feeding dialami et al 2018 rousta 2002 malakouti and basirat 2002 despite the high wf of dry date cultivars the outputs of this research show that the wf economic value of dry date palm is high this is because of high pricing and marketability simple transportation and storage capability marouf et al 2012 the biggest cultivated area and production with high wf and low crop yield is of the soft date palm whereas the 18 types of soft date palms except kebkab shahani mazafti have the low ability of fresh keeping and low marketability and hence low exporting value rastegar et al 2012 according to maj 2017 43 3 of exported date palms in iran is the soft date palm which they are cultivated in all seven counties of this 20 45 of shared wf belongs to the dry and semi dry date palms while 46 7 of exported wf belongs to these types of date palms the most valuable commercial types of date palms are piarom estamaran zahedi deiri and rabbi so the development of crop production in those provinces with focusing on commercial advantages local and national marketing and foundation of a non governmental organization can increase the economic value of wf in those types of date palm the total wf of date palms in iran is 2437 mcm with virtual water trading of 1243 mcm the economic value of exported wf is 733 million usd but the net benefit of exported date palms is 157 3 million usd per year this means that the cost of exported date palms is one quarter of the cost of exported wf due to the water shortage it is essential to apply the new irrigation techniques optimizing the management practices and management of pests and diseases in these areas since the semi arid and arid regions are faced with the water stress thus the agricultural policies should be based on exporting low virtual water and high wfev agricultural crops and importing crops with large virtual water and low wfev shtull trauring and bernstein 2018 5 conclusion date palm growth regions are located in the arid and warm area with the rainfall less than 300 mm per year these areas faced with severe water stress over the past three decades due to the irregular politics of agricultural jihad especially in agricultural water management since the share of blue and grey wf are high in these regions it is essential to apply optimal management in water resources and fertilizers considering the limitation of water resources in the south of iran the wf and the economic value of wf provide useful information for prioritization of cultivated regions of date palms the management of water resources in those regions can be improved by combining local and regional information finally even though the concepts applied through this research can be used to evaluate the effect of the crop pattern on water resources but it cannot be used as a policy solution despite this it should be noted that these indices can be used as useful tools in water resource management however using these concepts without considering other management aspects of water resources have caused an excessive dependence on importing the agricultural products and foods these issues have increased commercial and security risks thus in addition to the virtual water trade wf and economic value of wf the political tools such as national security economic growth employment and poverty reduction

10772,the performance of three 1 0 m3 volume each pilot scale bioreactors with one filled with woodchips only and the other two amended 10 v v with activated c and flaxseed cake respectively was tested under field conditions for nitrate removal from tile drainage water in lithuania the bioreactors were monitored for a period of 1 5 y during which the flow rate hydraulic retention time water t ph dissolved o nitrate nitrite ammonium sulfate and chemical o demand concentrations were measured the results showed that the average nitrate removal efficiency in the bioreactor with no additives was 40 3 and it was 44 1 in the bioreactor with activated c additives in the bioreactor with flaxseed cake additives 41 2 of the n was removed during the cold seasonal period when the inflow t varied between 1 8 c and 10 0 c activated c amended woodchips showed higher efficiency and supported higher nitrate removal rates compared to those of other fillers the highest nitrate removal efficiency was achieved at a ph of 7 0 7 5 the experiment demonstrated the potential for the enhancement of nitrate removal through the incorporation of activated c in denitrifying bioreactors the addition of activated c substantially reduced the organic c losses while maintaining denitrification woodchips amended with flaxseed cake showed no significant difference in nitrates removal compared to the woodchips only treatment a much higher release of organic c with no added effect on nitrate removal indicated that flaxseed cake as an external c source was more biodegradable than woodchips but the benefit of its addition to woodchips was not proved keywords nitrate removal denitrifying bioreactor agricultural drainage activated carbon flaxseed cake 1 introduction in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere artificial drainage systems have been introduced to remove excess water and improve soil productivity therefore artificial drainage has become a common agricultural practice in lithuania throughout the history of land drainage the overall drained area ditches plus tile drains has totaled 84 of the agricultural land area povilaitis et al 2015 with a tile drained area of 87 from the overall drained lithuania remains one of the most extensively drained countries in the world povilaitis 2015 however impacts on water quality caused by the introduction of drainage systems are a large concern blann et al 2009 christianson et al 2012 addy et al 2016 it is well known that tile drainage serves as a direct accelerated transport pathway for contaminants from agricultural land to streams kladivko et al 2004 deelstra et al 2014 when entering drains water leaches nutrients mostly inorganic forms of n and p therefore the increased nutrient inflow into surface waters leads to their eutrophication iital et al 2008 conley et al 2009 kiedrzyńska et al 2014 excess n entering aquatic environments is recognized as a global problem in lithuania 80 of the total n in streams enters from agricultural areas povilaitis et al 2018 consequently by the year 2021 the country is obliged to reduce the amount of n entering the baltic sea by 11 800 tons 26 this is a considerable challenge that requires new solutions denitrifying woodchip bioreactors have been proposed as a novel practice for nitrate n no3 n removal from tile drainage flow cooke et al 2001 schipper et al 2010 christianson et al 2013a bednarek et al 2014 husk et al 2017 this technology is based on routing tile drainage water through a buried trench filled with woodchips where nitrate under anaerobic conditions is used by heterotrophic bacteria to oxidize c while reducing no3 n to n gas the first experiments using enhanced denitrification to directly treat tile drainage water were conducted by blowes et al 1994 this study and subsequent studies have revealed that no3 n removal in drainage water through denitrification bioreactors varies from 18 to 100 with more typical annual reductions in the range of 32 55 van driel et al 2006 jaynes et al 2008 woli et al 2010 warneke et al 2011 christianson et al 2012 2017 lepine et al 2016 according to hoover et al 2016 woodchip bioreactors are identified as the most cost effective edge of field practice for n reduction however there is still much to be learned about the overall annual performance of this biotechnology denitrification in bioreactors is influenced by temperature which promotes the activity of anaerobic bacteria bock et al 2015 however most studies on woodchip bioreactors have been performed at relatively high temperatures that are not relevant in climates where temperatures may be low below 10 c for extended periods this indicates that the efficiency of bioreactors in colder climates is not completely understood research conducted by hassanpour et al 2017 showed no3 n concentration reductions of 100 when temperatures are above 16 c and reductions of less than 30 when temperatures are below 5 c feyereisen et al 2016 also found that no3 n removal rates rrs are generally 4 5 fold lower under cool 1 5 c conditions compared with those under warm 15 5 c conditions decreases in denitrification rates with subsequent lower bioreactor efficiency at low temperatures have been regularly reported jin et al 2008 vacková et al 2011 sayi ucar et al 2015 addy et al 2016 hoover et al 2016 feyereisen et al 2017 nordström and herbert 2017 zhang et al 2017 in other studies cameron and schipper 2010 and wang and chu 2016 found that in the long term no3 n rrs could be lower at higher temperatures the lower rrs may occur because labile c is depleted more rapidly at higher temperatures these findings indicate that denitrification at various temperatures is limited by bioavailable c because no3 n removal generally decreases with decreasing temperature more information about different c substrates for the design of bioreactors is needed the selection of an appropriate c medium can help to achieve the balance between availability cost and denitrification rate lower denitrification rates at low temperatures can be compensated by the addition of natural plant like materials and or synthetic biodegradable polymers wang and chu 2016 various previous studies have demonstrated that external c sources can increase the denitrification process ovez et al 2006 yong zhen et al 2006 mankiewicz boczek et al 2017 the capacity of wheat straw to support denitrification has been shown by soares and abeliovich 1998 other studies found that newspaper volokita et al 1996 rice husk shao et al 2009 biochar bock et al 2015 activated sludge sun et al 2017 dried cornstalks cardboard fibers greenan et al 2006 shredded corn stover corn cobs feyereisen et al 2016 recycled steel byproducts hua et al 2016 paper fibers robertson 2010 and tree bark shavings povilaitis et al 2018 can contribute to higher no3 n removal moreover electrical stimulations acetate and ethanol could be potential enhancers of low temperature denitrification martin et al 2009 law et al 2018 biodegradable polymer pellets can also act as a solid substrate and biofilm carrier for denitrification boley et al 2000 in this study woodchips amended with two additional c sources namely activated c and flaxseed cake were investigated to enhance denitrification in bioreactors it is well known that activated c is a universal adsorbent for the removal of diverse types of aquatic pollutants bhatnagar and sillanpää 2011 hale et al 2012 bhatnagar et al 2013 nam et al 2014 however only a few studies have reported the sorption of no3 n by activated c afkhami et al 2007 karanasios et al 2010 ota et al 2013 mazarji et al 2017 moreover the potential of flaxseed cake as a c source to enhance denitrification has been never reported therefore the objective of this research was to determine if the addition of activated c and flaxseed cake could enhance no3 n removal in denitrifying woodchip bioreactors under varying temperature conditions the relationship between no3 n removal and sulfate reduction and the effect of activated c and flaxseed cake amendments on organic c export were also analysed 2 materials and methods three pilot scale denitrification bioreactors namely one filled with woodchips only w and the other two amended 10 v v with a mixture of woodchips and activated c w ac and flaxseed cake w fsc respectively were constructed at the field laboratory of vytautas magnus university in lithuania to test the efficiency of no3 n removal the bioreactors were made from cube shaped plastic containers 1 0 m3 volume each placed below ground by the excavation of a 1 2 m trench connected to two plastic water tanks 1 0 m3 volume each the locally sourced woodchips used for all the bioreactors were predominantly from alder and pine trees bulk density of 260 kg m3 the prevailing particle diameter of the woodchips 65 of the cumulative distribution varied from 1 1 cm to 3 0 cm the granular activated c of organosorb 10 aa type bulk density of 450 kg m3 total brunauer emmett teller surface area of 950 m2 g ph of 8 5 hardness of 90 iodine number of 1010 mg g was obtained from desotec with a granule size of 1 3 mm produced by high temperature steam activation of coal flaxseed cake bulk density of 570 kg m3 is a byproduct of local flaxseed oil production the cake is rich in proteins 32 fats 13 plant fibrils 25 and carbohydrates 18 and is available in large quantities in lithuania it is added to woodchips as a supplementary c source to enhance the performance of bioreactors the average length of the flaxseed flakes was about 3 0 cm each bioreactor was filled with woodchips or the woodchips amended with additives respectively to a depth of 1 0 m and a saturation level of 0 9 m was maintained by standpipes installed outside the outlets perforated bottom drainage pipes diverting the outflow from the bioreactors were swirled with synthetic net mesh size of 0 1 mm to avoid the washout of the fillers a polyethylene liner was folded and a plastic closure was capped over the top of each bioreactor to seal it from the soil and a mount with 20 cm thickness was formed and sown with grass the porosity of each filler based on the saturated volume of the bioreactor was determined using the porosity determination procedure described by christianson et al 2010 the analysis revealed that the woodchip porosity was 50 and the porosity of the woodchips amended with activated c and flaxseed cake was 48 and 47 respectively a schematic representation of the three pilot scale woodchip bioreactors is shown in fig 1 the no3 n removal efficiency tests of the three bioreactors began on june 16 2017 during the first month after the startup all the bioreactors demonstrated strong sporadic behavior without any consistent pattern therefore the results presented in this article covered the period from july 20 2017 until december 27 2018 the measurements were performed at various irregular time intervals by applying the same sampling procedures the bioreactors were fed nitrate via the addition of nano3 to the water tanks during the study period at concentrations ranging from 6 3 mg n l to 30 0 mg n l these concentrations were typical 83 of the cumulative frequency of the range in no3 n values observed in drainage water under field conditions povilaitis et al 2018 the water from the tanks was supplied to each bioreactor by gravity the flow velocity was determined by the difference in hydraulic head 3 6 m maximum between the water levels in the tanks and in the bioreactors water inflow to each bioreactor was recorded with the help of flow meters the inflow rates were adjusted manually with valves the valves were also used to achieve different water retention times and steady state flow conditions at various time intervals the bioreactors were monitored for no3 n nitrite n no2 n ammonium n nh4 n sulfate s so4 s chemical oxygen demand cod water temperature t c ph total dissolved solids tds dissolved oxygen do and free dissolved carbon dioxide co2 in water the no3 n number of measurements n 135 no2 n n 40 nh4 n n 40 and so4 s n 42 concentrations at the inlet outlet and inside the sampling wells were determined using a maxidirect photometer md600 with powder reagents the do n 135 contents and ts were measured using a portable hi 9142 hanna instruments ltd multimeter and the tds n 135 and ph n 135 values were determined using a hi 98136 meter the indirect amount of total organic c toc compounds in water measured as cod n 40 was determined using a hi 83099 02 cod meter by applying the dichromate method the dissolved co2 concentrations were measured n 12 using a portable oxyguard analyzer gaseous emissions i e n2o no2 and ch4 from the bioreactors were not monitored the no3 n removal efficiency expressed in percentage was determined as the difference between the inlet and outlet concentrations divided by the inlet concentration the no3 n removal rate in the bioreactors was calculated using the following equation 1 r r c i n n o 3 n c o u t n o 3 n h r t where rr is the removal rate g n m3 h cin no3 n and c out no3 n are the inflow and outflow concentrations g m3 respectively during an event defined as the period between two water sample collections when the water flow rate through the bioreactor is larger than zero and hrt is the hydraulic retention time h which was determined as follows 2 h r t ρ v q where ρ is the porosity of the filler v is the bioreactor volume m3 and q is the flow rate m3 h to determine the reliability of the differences between the experiments the shapiro wilk test was first conducted to assess the normality of the no3 n removal efficiency data from different bioreactors because the assumption of normality was not met a non parametric kruskal wallis test with post hoc was performed to determine whether the three groups of measurement data with different fillers were significantly different the significance of the difference in any pairwise comparison was determined by non parametric mann whitney test the data that fall 2 2 iqr i e interquartile range above the q3 75 and below the q1 25 quartiles were removed from the analysis hoaglin and iglewitcz 1987 aggarwal 2017 the strength of linear relationship between two variables was determined by regression analysis all statistical analyses were performed by applying the past version 2 0 software package 3 results 3 1 nitrate removal considering the entire study period the calculated hrt ranged from 1 15 h to 11 1 h the do concentrations at the inlets and outlets ranged from 3 1 mg l to 4 9 mg l and from 0 0 mg l to 1 3 mg l respectively this implied that the do in the bioreactors was consumed by heterotrophic bacteria and that c was made available to the bacterial community biological activity facilitated the reduction of o and further no3 n transformations with inflow concentrations ranging from 6 3 mg l to 30 0 mg l and outflow concentrations ranging from 3 4 mg l to 22 1 mg l the resulting no3 n removal efficiency during an event ranged from 17 5 to 75 0 in the w bioreactor from 21 3 to 82 7 in the w ac bioreactor and from 16 3 to 81 8 in the w fsc bioreactor the no3 n rrs during events ranged from 0 16 g n m3 h to 5 99 g n m3 h in the w bioreactor from 0 13 g n m3 h to 6 24 g n m3 h in the w ac bioreactor and from 0 28 g n m3 h to 6 72 g n m3 h in the w fsc bioreactor the average no3 n removal efficiency was 40 3 44 1 and 41 2 respectively the average rr of 1 76 g n m3 h was higher in the w ac bioreactor compared to the rate of 1 58 g n m3 h determined in the w and w fsc bioreactors the changes in the inflow t do ph no3 n no2 n nh4 n so4 s cod and tds concentrations and hrt among the three bioreactors did not show any statistically significant differences based on the kruskal wallis test the absence of differences in the changes in these parameters allowed us to assume that the inflow conditions equally affected no3 n removal in all bioreactors moreover the differences in the outflow concentrations of do no2 n nh4 n and t were also statistically insignificant however there were significant differences found in the outflow concentrations of so4 s p 0 010 tds p 0 001 cod p 0 010 and ph values p 0 050 inside the sampling wells among the bioreactors this indicated that no3 n removal to some extent was related to or controlled by the changes in these parameters 3 2 effect of inflow water temperature the experiment showed that no3 n removal was foremost affected by inflow t the t measured at the inlet ranged from 1 8 c to 21 7 c and that at the outlets ranged from 4 0 c to 21 2 c this range in temperatures was compatible with the tile drainage temperatures that can occur under conditions in lithuania povilaitis et al 2018 the effect of t was examined through the analysis of no3 n removal efficiencies and rates observed at various temperature intervals after comparing the removal efficiencies at t intervals of 0 0 5 0 c 5 1 10 0 c 10 1 15 0 c and higher than 15 c statistically significant differences p 0 050 were determined between the w ac and w bioreactors and between the w ac and w fsc bioreactors there were no significant differences in no3 n removal efficiencies between the w and w fsc bioreactors despite the absence of large differences in the removal magnitudes the no3 n removal efficiency at all temperature intervals was statistically higher in the w ac bioreactor average efficiency and removal rate values in all bioreactors are shown in table 1 in contrast to the no3 n removal efficiencies the no3 n rrs were statistically higher in the w ac bioreactor compared to those in the other two bioreactors only within the 0 0 5 0 c and 5 1 10 0 c temperature intervals higher inflow ts 10 1 15 0 c and 15 c did not reveal any significant differences in the rrs among the bioreactors the differences in the no3 n rrs between the w and w fsc bioreactors at all temperature intervals were also insignificant p 0 050 statistically higher removal efficiencies and rates under low 0 0 10 0 c temperature conditions in the w ac bioreactor could have been attributed to the effect of activated c the comparison of removal efficiencies and rates along with the scatter of measured values when the inflow ts were below and above 10 c are presented in fig 2 the increase in the denitrification rate with increased t was also estimated using the q5 and q10 temperature coefficients i e the factors by which the rr increased for each 5 c and 10 c increase respectively these indexes have often been applied in similar studies as an indication of biological reactions schipper et al 2010 christianson et al 2012 addy et al 2016 hoover et al 2016 in this experiment an exponential best fit model for the entire temperature range yielded q5 values of 1 38 1 42 and 1 31 and q10 values of 1 91 2 02 and 1 73 in the w w ac and w fsc bioreactors respectively however the values of q5 1 12 and q10 1 25 calculated at the low temperature range 0 10 c in the w ac bioreactor were slightly higher compared to q5 1 06 and 1 07 and q10 1 13 and 1 14 in the w and w fsc bioreactors respectively these results strengthened the assumption that woodchips amended with activated c can generate higher denitrification rates at low temperatures however the same assumption with the amendment of flaxseed cake was not confirmed the no3 n rrs in bioreactors at the 0 0 5 0 c interval ranged from 0 19 g n m3 h to 2 37 g n m3 h the rrs at the 5 1 10 0 c interval changed from 0 13 g n m3 h to 2 77 g n m3 h when the inflow t was within 10 1 15 0 c the rates changed from 0 39 g n m3 h to 6 72 g n m3 h the highest rrs ranging from 0 52 g n m3 h to 6 24 g n m3 h were observed at temperatures higher than 15 c 3 3 organic carbon release according to schipper et al 2010 c availability to denitrifiers is a key determinant for no3 n removal bioavailable c sources in water mostly appear in simple organic compounds and support removal efficiency however there are concerns about excessive release of organic c from bioreactors in this study toc was measured as cod and used as an indicator of bioavailable c and for all bioreactors the cod concentration at the outlet was significantly greater than that at the inlet the cod concentration in the inflow ranged from 0 0 mg l to 17 0 mg l average of 3 03 mg l while the outflow concentrations ranged from 1 0 mg l to 305 0 mg l average of 125 3 mg l in the w bioreactor from 1 0 mg l to 69 0 mg l average of 19 6 mg l in the w ac bioreactor and from 1 0 mg l to 475 0 mg l average of 217 5 mg l in the w fsc bioreactor the outflows were ranked in order of magnitude as w fsc w w ac and showed an average of a 6 11 fold higher organic c release from the w and w fsc bioreactors compared to that from the w ac bioreactor the observed concentrations showed that flaxseed cake rich in proteins fats and carbohydrates made it more subject to decay and faster organic c release than other c sources woodchips containing large amounts of cellulose and hemicellulose were more resistant to biodegradation woodchips are the most common and preferred c medium therefore the toc release from the w bioreactor exhibited degradability and c loss similar to that of a conventional bioreactor under the given temperature and hrt conditions unlike the other treatments the w ac treatment demonstrated that owing to specific properties the addition of activated c was able to retain much more organic c the adsorption properties determined by the high porosity and large specific surface area of activated c resulted in much lower c fluxes from the w ac bioreactor this indicated that activated c with a higher potential to accumulate labile organic compounds could support more stable microbial activity and sustain higher denitrification because of the adsorption of organic compounds with subsequent enhancement of microbial activity no3 n removal may be less susceptible to low temperatures if activated c is present this presumption was confirmed by comparing the no3 n removal efficiencies against the cod concentrations fig 3 the process of toc release i e decomposition of organic matter in all the bioreactors except for the w ac bioreactor was positively temperature dependent thus no3 n removal linearly increased with toc increase in the case of the w ac bioreactor fig 3b toc was the least temperature dependent e g from 0 0 c to 10 0 c the dependency was absent however the removal process tended to steadily increase with little change in toc this demonstrated that woodchips amended with activated c as a bioreactor filling material may substantially reduce c losses while maintaining denitrification although the bioavailable c concentration was much higher in the w fsc bioreactor the lack of a significant difference in no3 n removal efficiency between the w and w fsc bioreactors indicated that the removal in the latter treatment was most likely oversaturated with c 3 4 effect of ph the ph values in the inflow ranged from 7 3 to 9 0 average of 8 3 while those inside the sampling wells ranged from 6 1 to 8 3 average of 7 3 in the w bioreactor from 6 2 to 7 6 average of 7 1 in the w ac bioreactor and from 6 1 to 7 4 average of 6 8 in the w fsc bioreactor bioreactor w was able to accommodate a wider range in ph while the bioreactor with flaxseed cake more frequently exhibited lower ph 7 0 values fig 4 the results showed that the pattern of change in ph statistically differed among the bioreactors this suggested that ph could differently affect microbial activity and the performance of denitrification shao et al 2009 wang and chu 2016 feyereisen et al 2017 and blum et al 2018 reported that ph in the range of 6 5 8 5 is suitable for denitrification in this experiment the highest no3 n removal efficiencies in the w and w ac bioreactors were achieved when the ph ranged from 7 0 to 7 5 this was the most dominant ph interval covering 64 and 72 of the values respectively at this interval 27 and 30 of the observed removal efficiencies were higher than 50 and the ph weighted average was 45 5 and 47 8 respectively at a ph greater than 7 5 the medium became more alkaline and the removal efficiency tended to decrease bell shaped distribution in fig 4a for the w bioreactor the w fsc bioreactor behaved slightly differently most of the removal efficiency values 61 ranging from 16 3 to 81 8 with a weighted average of 38 6 occurred at a ph of less than 7 0 and only 21 of the observed efficiencies within a ph of 7 0 7 5 were higher than 50 the average removal at a ph of 7 0 7 5 was 43 7 these results demonstrated that the no3 n removal efficiency in the w and w ac bioreactors tended to increase toward a ph of 7 0 7 5 however a decrease in removal efficiency was likely to occur beyond this interval the results also revealed that in the w fsc bioreactor the shift to a more acidic medium ph of 6 5 7 0 supported microbial activity that was suitable for high denitrification in principle despite the fact that the change in ph statistically differed among the bioreactors its range from 6 5 to 7 5 positively affected no3 n removal 3 5 total dissolved solids changes in the chemical balance affected the tds pattern with the inflow concentrations ranging from 412 mg l to 529 mg l average of 468 mg l the highest tds outflows ranging from 421 mg l to 688 mg l average of 474 mg l were observed in the w fsc bioreactor in the w and w ac bioreactors the amount of tds ranged from 386 mg l to 488 mg l average of 451 mg l and from 390 mg l to 510 mg l average of 455 mg l respectively which were statistically lower p 0 001 than that in the w fsc bioreactor and lower p 0 001 than that in the inflow there were no significant differences found between tds in the w and w ac bioreactors higher tds in the w fsc bioreactor could have been attributed to the larger amount of negatively charged colloids products of fsc decomposition and likely higher release of bicarbonates discontinuous measurements showed that the hco3 concentration in the outflow was 17 47 higher than that in the inflow since the proportions of hco3 to co2 at a certain ph are relative to each other significantly higher quantities of co2 could have led to increased hco3 in the w fsc bioreactor the decrease in tds in the outflows compared to that in the inflows in the w and w ac bioreactors could have been explained through the comparison of the difference in the inflow and outflow ph according to cole and prairie 2009 at an inflow ph of 7 3 9 0 the amount of hco3 could be hundreds of times greater than that of co2 and co3 however owing to organic matter decomposition the ph inside the bioreactors decreased average 7 1 7 3 and the proportions of relative magnitudes were changed 3 6 sulfate reduction the inflow concentrations of so4 s ranged from 7 7 mg l to 29 7 mg l average of 18 2 mg l which were more than 2 fold higher than those in the outflows the highest so4 s reduction 62 7 on average was observed in the w ac bioreactor where the outflow concentration ranged from 1 7 mg l to 12 4 mg l average of 6 5 mg l and was statistically lower p 0 040 than that in the other two bioreactors the difference between the outflow concentrations in the w and w fsc bioreactors was statistically insignificant the so4 s concentration ranged from 3 7 mg l to 19 1 mg l average of 8 04 mg l in the w bioreactor and from 1 7 mg l to 13 7 mg l average of 8 09 mg l in the w fsc bioreactor generally sulfate reduction occurs when the no3 n concentration in the bioreactor is depleted however in this experiment the no3 n concentration was never depleted below the threshold value of 0 5 mg l shipper et al 2010 this indicated that sulfate reduction occurred under non n limiting conditions moreover the absence of interdependency between no3 n removal efficiency and so4 s reduction in the w bioreactor horizontal line in fig 5 a and the negative relationship between no3 n removal and so4 s reduction in the w ac and w fsc bioreactors fig 5b and 5c revealed that both electron acceptors no3 and so4 were utilized simultaneously and that no3 n and so4 s reduction occurred concomitantly the obtained results suggest that different groups of bacteria may compete for the same c substrate and electron acceptor the negative relationship between no3 n removal and so4 s reduction implied that either the denitrifiers biomass or activity was temporarily lower compared to those of the sulfate reducers srb assimilatory sulfate reduction could have occurred alternatively srb to some extent produced hydrogen sulfide h2s which inhibited no3 n reduction i e dissimilatory sulfate reduction higher so4 s reduction resulted in higher h2s production with subsequent lower no3 n reduction this process was slightly more pronounced in the w ac and w fsc bioreactors fig 5 the so4 s reduction was dependent on hrt the relationship between hrt and so4 s reduction in the w ac and w fsc bioreactors was opposite to that of no3 n versus so4 s data not shown a longer hrt 9 10 h resulted in a 60 80 sulfate reduction compared to a 42 50 reduction at a shorter 1 h hrt the change was less evident in the w bioreactor correspondingly the no3 n removal efficiency was negatively related to increased hrt this indicated that a longer hrt under non n limiting conditions may have resulted in greater srb development thereby inhibiting denitrification and no3 n reduction statistically higher so4 s reduction in the w ac bioreactor was likely related to the enhanced srb activity due to the greater accumulation of organic matter on the activated c surface by adsorption 3 7 effect of hydraulic retention time on removal rate the pattern of change in hrt was similar in all bioreactors with minimum values ranging from 1 15 h to 1 71 h and maximum values ranging from 9 2 h to 11 1 h the no3 n rr was nonlinearly dependent on hrt fig 6 the relationship between the hrts and rrs determined using power function approximation showed that lower hrts led to higher rrs this indicated that the lower hrt was a result of the higher flow rate passing through the bioreactors when the flow rate increased the no3 n input load also increased under a higher input load faster n mass removal occurred therefore a higher rr for lower hrt was most likely governed by reaction kinetics i e a transition to first order kinetics 3 8 ammonium and nitrite release the no2 n concentrations at the inlet ranged from 0 009 mg l to 0 104 mg l average of 0 060 mg l and were slightly reduced with a range from 0 009 mg l to 0 100 mg l average of 0 054 mg l at the outlets data not shown no2 n is an intermediate during no3 n reduction therefore the absence of the substantial reduction of no2 n in the outflows indicated that denitrification was most frequently incomplete the other reason for such steady formation of no2 n in the bioreactors could have been attributed to the similar inflow and inside no2 n decomposition rates there were no statistically significant differences found between the no2 n and nh4 n outflow concentrations among the bioreactors in contrast to no2 n the nh4 n concentrations ranging from 0 016 mg l to 0 140 mg l were always higher in the outflow compared to those ranging from 0 015 mg l to 0 031 mg l average of 0 018 mg l in the inflow the nh4 n release was higher by 16 and 30 on average in the w ac bioreactor compared to that in the w fsc and w bioreactors respectively the release was most likely the result of drna i e dissimilatory reduction of no3 n to nh4 n because the w ac bioreactor had greater potential to adsorb organic c to favor the dnra bacteria over denitrifiers healy et al 2012 fenton et al 2014 this implied that activated c may have created the medium for higher diversity and supported higher activity of microorganisms to a lesser extent drna also occurred in the w and w fsc bioreactors because the ratio of organic c to no3 n was relatively high there consequently less than 1 of the no3 n removal in the treatments was attributed to drna greenan et al 2006 reported that drna accounts for less than 4 of no3 n removal gibert et al 2008 declared that 10 of no3 n removal is a result of drna generally anaerobic environments with high c tend to favor drna over denitrification 4 discussion many factors affect no3 n removal in bioreactors among these inflow t is the most important factor controlling denitrification by affecting microbial activity in the performed treatments both the no3 n removal efficiencies and rrs were 39 43 lower at low temperatures 1 8 10 0 c than at higher temperatures 10 1 21 7 c similar results were obtained in other studies for example wang and chu 2016 found that nitrate removal efficiency decreases from 92 5 at 25 c to 68 7 at 15 c and that the rr decreases by 50 when temperature decreases by 5 c addy et al 2016 showed that denitrification beds with temperatures below 6 c have a 2 fold lower rr than those at temperatures from 6 c to 16 9 c hoover et al 2016 reported that with a mean influent no3 n concentration of 30 7 mg l the mean effluent concentrations range from 24 9 mg l at 10 c to 13 5 mg l at 20 c feyereisen et al 2016 observed no3 n reductions in bioreactors ranging from 5 to 73 and from 4 to 16 at 15 5 c and 1 5 c respectively the q10 temperature coefficients of 1 91 2 02 and 1 73 in the w w ac and w fsc bioreactors respectively were also comparable to those reported in the literature cameron and schipper 2010 warneke et al 2011 and addy et al 2016 found q10 values of around 2 0 for no3 n rrs thereby demonstrating an increasing no3 n removal pattern at higher temperatures and the demand to enhance the removal at lower temperatures the addition of activated c 10 v v in the w ac bioreactor showed statistically higher no3 n removal efficiencies and rrs compared to those of the w and w fsc bioreactors at low temperatures 0 10 c the greater efficiency of the removal in the w ac bioreactor could have been attributed to the higher microbial activity stimulated by specific properties of activated c according to knezev 2015 the enhancement in microbial activity on the activated c surface is related to the accumulation of organic matter by adsorption bacteria and other microorganisms interact with the surface of activated c in contact with water these interactions lead to attachment retention and consequently to growth and maintenance of bacteria in granular activated c therefore owing to its high porosity and large specific surface area activated c was able to adsorb and retain much more labile organic c by providing a larger area available for bacterial attachment and higher denitrification in the w ac bioreactor meynet et al 2012 also found that biochemical processes taking place on activated c surfaces can enlarge microbial diversity and cell counts and promote higher respiration a greater variety of species in the bacterial community make it better adapted to temperature change porter et al 2015 vacková et al 2011 reported that mixed cultures showed the highest denitrification rate at temperatures below 10 c it is likely that with the addition of activated c a bacterial community less susceptible to low temperature emerges the process of syntrophy shah et al 2014 in which the cooperation of various groups of microorganisms occurs could also contribute to no3 n removal however the addition of flaxseed cake 10 v v in the woodchip bioreactor did not reveal any significant difference compared to the no3 n removal in the w treatment throughout the range of temperatures no effect of the addition of an external c source in the w fsc bioreactor could be related to the relatively high labile organic c release it is likely that organic c oversaturation occurred in the bioreactor thereby impeding the possibility for higher denitrification in contrast to the commonly accepted opinion that organic c availability may boost denitrification schipper et al 2010 lepine et al 2016 hassanpour et al 2017 the obtained results suggested that the abundance of organic c from the decay of the additional c source under non n limiting conditions may have inhibited the growth of denitrifiers if organic c release exceeds a particular concentration e g cod 300 mg l in this study then no3 n removal may be limited hoover et al 2016 reported greater no3 n removal with weathered 52 woodchips compared to that with fresh 39 woodchips because of the difference in toc this confirms the key role of organic c in controlling denitrification however it also implies that an optimal ratio between the inflow no3 n concentration and bioavailable organic c in the bioreactors may exist for enhanced denitrification this relationship should be investigated in further studies furthermore the competitiveness of denitrifiers may be lower when flaxseed cake is added for example warneke et al 2011 reported that the bacterial community in a woodchip bioreactor contained a higher percentage of denitrifiers than the community in a maize cob bioreactor andrus et al 2014 also suggested to inoculate optimal microbial species to shift the community to high performing no3 n removers the ph values observed in the bioreactors were consistent with those mentioned in other studies the highest no3 n removal efficiencies were achieved at a ph of 7 0 7 5 the ph range from 6 5 to 7 5 also revealed increasing no3 n removal however the shift to more alkaline conditions with a ph of 7 5 8 3 showed a decrease in no3 n removal saleh lakha et al 2009 found that ph has a significant effect on denitrifying enzyme activity with cumulative denitrification levels of 28 μmol 63 μmol and 22 μmol at a ph of 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 respectively moreover the cell densities of denitrifiers pseudomonas mandelii are in the order of ph 7 ph 8 ph 6 ph 5 according to van den heuvel et al 2011 no3 n reduction tends to increase toward a ph of 7 0 a comprehensive study by blum et al 2018 reported that enzymes involved in n cycling have different optima therefore no3 n reduction increases with increasing ph with an optimum range from 7 0 to 8 0 they stated that the highest expected no3 n reduction is in the ph range of 7 0 7 5 and low at a ph of less than 6 5 and greater than 8 0 the results indicated that no3 n removal in activated c amended bioreactor more frequently occur within a ph of 7 0 7 5 lower ph values in the w fsc bioreactor were likely conditioned by higher free dissolved co2 it is well known that dissolved co2 which originates from the respiration of heterotrophic bacteria is a master variable in anaerobic environments since dissolved co2 consists of two pools free co2 and its hydrated form of h2co3 after reaction with water it affects the chemical balance and regulates ph cole and prairie 2009 therefore the free dissolved co2 concentration in the inflow ranged from 1 mg l to 4 mg l while that inside the sampling wells ranged from 10 mg l to 38 mg l average of 23 1 mg l in the w bioreactor from 2 mg l to 10 mg l average of 2 3 mg l in the w ac bioreactor and from 14 mg l to 71 mg l average of 46 2 mg l in the w fsc bioreactor this showed that the decomposition of organic matter with less adsorption was most intense in the w fsc bioreactor and that the change in chemical equilibrium led to increased co2 and lower ph in contrast to other fillers the shift in equilibrium to a more alkaline condition ph of 7 5 8 3 in the w bioreactor fig 4a indicated the influence of its greater buffering and the likely greater formation of co3 carbonates sulfate reducing bacteria srb also could have produced alkalinity and this may have accounted for some of the differences in ph between the treatments all three bioreactors acted as a sink of no2 n and source of nh4 n with a low level of ammonium production 0 140 mg n l so4 s reduction has been observed christianson et al 2012 shipper et al 2010 shih et al 2011 hoover et al 2016 in many denitrification systems when no3 n has been nearly depleted this process is a great concern because it produces noxious h2s in contrast to published data the no3 n concentrations ranged from 3 4 mg l to 22 1 mg l in this study were never depleted however sulfate reduction to some extent was always occurring because denitrifying organisms compete with sulfate reducers this implied that both electron acceptors were utilized jointly a more detailed study about concomitant no3 n and so4 s reductions was conducted by dalsgaard and bak 1994 they found that at higher so4 s concentrations no3 n reductions may be temporarily halted and only so4 s reductions may occur although inflow so4 s concentrations up to 29 7 mg l in this experiment were consistent with those observed in tile drainage water bastienė et al 2012 it is likely that they were in a range to cause the reductions denitrification and sulfate reduction activities in batch experiments were also investigated by yamashita and yamamoto ikemoto 2014 they revealed that population of sulfate reducing bacteria may significantly increase inside the wood under denitrification conditions nevertheless an explicit explanation to sulfate reduction phenomenon in the current treatments was not found it is likely that the competitive population of assimilatory sulfate reducers might have exceeded or suppressed the population of denitrifiers a longer hrt in the treatments showed higher sulfate reduction with subsequent lower no3 n removal under these circumstances a longer hrt under non n limiting conditions might have resulted in the greater development of sulfate reducers inhibiting denitrification lepine et al 2016 also found significant sulfate reduction and sulfide production in bioreactors operating with longer hrts these results signify that bioreactors with long hrts may induce srb growth have a higher risk of generating h2s and support the formation of methyl mercury the formation of nh4 n may also lead to adverse effects on the aquatic environment in downstream bioreactors the obtained results demonstrated that lower hrts stimulated higher rrs higher no3 n rrs for lower hrts were governed by no3 n removal transition to first order reaction kinetics these findings were consistent with the results obtained by christianson et al 2013b cameron and schipper 2010 hoover et al 2016 and povilaitis et al 2018 similarly but with a less apparent relationship the no3 n removal efficiency was dependent on hrt however this was contradictory to the results reported in other studies the majority of research conducted under n limiting conditions has shown that higher retention times provide higher no3 n removal efficiencies christianson et al 2013c lepine et al 2016 in our study with continuous non n limiting conditions the reported pattern was not confirmed this demonstrated that the optimal hrt for the no3 n rr may not be the same as that for no3 n removal efficiency longer hrt designs may result in higher sulfate reduction and increased cost at shorter hrts the do may not be removed and microorganisms may be washed out balancing these two removal metrics is a complicated and complex task more research is required to evaluate the flow rate seasonality microbial community and other limiting factors to attain reliable parameters for bioreactor design in lithuania in terms of application the c losses from the w ac bioreactor were much lower and the no3 n removal was higher than those from the w and w fsc bioreactors this suggested that a more efficient bioreactor with prolonged longevity could be designed by mixing woodchips with activated c feyereisen et al 2016 also found that a plastic biofilm carrier and corn cobs added to woodchips improve nitrate removal yong zhen et al 2007 reported that denitrification potential is substantially increased with the addition of three external c sources i e methanol ethanol and acetate mankiewicz boczek et al 2017 showed that brown coal pine sawdust flax harl barley straw and coal straw mix are good solutions to increase denitrification the addition of biochar and steel byproducts also positively affects nitrate removal in woodchip bioreactors bock et al 2015 hua et al 2016 despite the relatively small difference in the no3 n removal magnitude 10 on average between the w and w ac bioreactors throughout the study period the addition of 10 v v activated c to woodchips generated higher no3 n removal efficiencies and rrs at low temperatures 0 10 c it is likely that determining the optimum amount of activated c higher than 10 v v by taking into account cost versus removal efficiency for enhanced bioreactor performance would not only reduce c loss but also increase the magnitude of no3 n removal the increased release of c with no added effect on no3 n removal from the w fsc bioreactor indicated that flaxseed cake was more biodegradable than woodchips schipper et al 2010 reported that only slow rates of c decomposition are needed to support no3 n removal the high release of soluble c can reduce do in receiving waters and adversely affect biota although flaxseed cake is a less expensive material than activated c the benefit of its addition to woodchips was not confirmed 5 conclusions three pilot scale denitrification bioreactors namely one filled with woodchips only and the other two amended 10 v v with a mixture of woodchips and activated c and flaxseed cake were constructed to test the efficiency of no3 n removal the experiment demonstrated the potential to enhance nitrate removal through the incorporation of activated c the addition of activated c substantially reduced organic c losses from the bioreactors while maintaining denitrification compared to other fillers woodchips only and woodchips amended with flaxseed cake activated c amended woodchips showed higher efficiency and supported higher no3 n removal rates at low temperatures 10 c the highest no3 n removal efficiency was achieved at a ph of 7 0 7 5 all bioreactors acted as a sink of no2 n and source of nh4 n with sulfate reduction under non n limiting conditions lower hydraulic retention times hrts stimulated higher removal rates while longer hrts likely resulted in higher srb development thereby inhibiting denitrification and no3 n reduction woodchips amended with flaxseed cake showed no significant difference in removing no3 n compared to the use of woodchips only a much greater release of organic c with no added effect on no3 n removal indicated that flaxseed cake as an external c source was more biodegradable than woodchips but the benefit of its addition to woodchips was not confirmed declaration of competing interest the authors

10772,the performance of three 1 0 m3 volume each pilot scale bioreactors with one filled with woodchips only and the other two amended 10 v v with activated c and flaxseed cake respectively was tested under field conditions for nitrate removal from tile drainage water in lithuania the bioreactors were monitored for a period of 1 5 y during which the flow rate hydraulic retention time water t ph dissolved o nitrate nitrite ammonium sulfate and chemical o demand concentrations were measured the results showed that the average nitrate removal efficiency in the bioreactor with no additives was 40 3 and it was 44 1 in the bioreactor with activated c additives in the bioreactor with flaxseed cake additives 41 2 of the n was removed during the cold seasonal period when the inflow t varied between 1 8 c and 10 0 c activated c amended woodchips showed higher efficiency and supported higher nitrate removal rates compared to those of other fillers the highest nitrate removal efficiency was achieved at a ph of 7 0 7 5 the experiment demonstrated the potential for the enhancement of nitrate removal through the incorporation of activated c in denitrifying bioreactors the addition of activated c substantially reduced the organic c losses while maintaining denitrification woodchips amended with flaxseed cake showed no significant difference in nitrates removal compared to the woodchips only treatment a much higher release of organic c with no added effect on nitrate removal indicated that flaxseed cake as an external c source was more biodegradable than woodchips but the benefit of its addition to woodchips was not proved keywords nitrate removal denitrifying bioreactor agricultural drainage activated carbon flaxseed cake 1 introduction in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere artificial drainage systems have been introduced to remove excess water and improve soil productivity therefore artificial drainage has become a common agricultural practice in lithuania throughout the history of land drainage the overall drained area ditches plus tile drains has totaled 84 of the agricultural land area povilaitis et al 2015 with a tile drained area of 87 from the overall drained lithuania remains one of the most extensively drained countries in the world povilaitis 2015 however impacts on water quality caused by the introduction of drainage systems are a large concern blann et al 2009 christianson et al 2012 addy et al 2016 it is well known that tile drainage serves as a direct accelerated transport pathway for contaminants from agricultural land to streams kladivko et al 2004 deelstra et al 2014 when entering drains water leaches nutrients mostly inorganic forms of n and p therefore the increased nutrient inflow into surface waters leads to their eutrophication iital et al 2008 conley et al 2009 kiedrzyńska et al 2014 excess n entering aquatic environments is recognized as a global problem in lithuania 80 of the total n in streams enters from agricultural areas povilaitis et al 2018 consequently by the year 2021 the country is obliged to reduce the amount of n entering the baltic sea by 11 800 tons 26 this is a considerable challenge that requires new solutions denitrifying woodchip bioreactors have been proposed as a novel practice for nitrate n no3 n removal from tile drainage flow cooke et al 2001 schipper et al 2010 christianson et al 2013a bednarek et al 2014 husk et al 2017 this technology is based on routing tile drainage water through a buried trench filled with woodchips where nitrate under anaerobic conditions is used by heterotrophic bacteria to oxidize c while reducing no3 n to n gas the first experiments using enhanced denitrification to directly treat tile drainage water were conducted by blowes et al 1994 this study and subsequent studies have revealed that no3 n removal in drainage water through denitrification bioreactors varies from 18 to 100 with more typical annual reductions in the range of 32 55 van driel et al 2006 jaynes et al 2008 woli et al 2010 warneke et al 2011 christianson et al 2012 2017 lepine et al 2016 according to hoover et al 2016 woodchip bioreactors are identified as the most cost effective edge of field practice for n reduction however there is still much to be learned about the overall annual performance of this biotechnology denitrification in bioreactors is influenced by temperature which promotes the activity of anaerobic bacteria bock et al 2015 however most studies on woodchip bioreactors have been performed at relatively high temperatures that are not relevant in climates where temperatures may be low below 10 c for extended periods this indicates that the efficiency of bioreactors in colder climates is not completely understood research conducted by hassanpour et al 2017 showed no3 n concentration reductions of 100 when temperatures are above 16 c and reductions of less than 30 when temperatures are below 5 c feyereisen et al 2016 also found that no3 n removal rates rrs are generally 4 5 fold lower under cool 1 5 c conditions compared with those under warm 15 5 c conditions decreases in denitrification rates with subsequent lower bioreactor efficiency at low temperatures have been regularly reported jin et al 2008 vacková et al 2011 sayi ucar et al 2015 addy et al 2016 hoover et al 2016 feyereisen et al 2017 nordström and herbert 2017 zhang et al 2017 in other studies cameron and schipper 2010 and wang and chu 2016 found that in the long term no3 n rrs could be lower at higher temperatures the lower rrs may occur because labile c is depleted more rapidly at higher temperatures these findings indicate that denitrification at various temperatures is limited by bioavailable c because no3 n removal generally decreases with decreasing temperature more information about different c substrates for the design of bioreactors is needed the selection of an appropriate c medium can help to achieve the balance between availability cost and denitrification rate lower denitrification rates at low temperatures can be compensated by the addition of natural plant like materials and or synthetic biodegradable polymers wang and chu 2016 various previous studies have demonstrated that external c sources can increase the denitrification process ovez et al 2006 yong zhen et al 2006 mankiewicz boczek et al 2017 the capacity of wheat straw to support denitrification has been shown by soares and abeliovich 1998 other studies found that newspaper volokita et al 1996 rice husk shao et al 2009 biochar bock et al 2015 activated sludge sun et al 2017 dried cornstalks cardboard fibers greenan et al 2006 shredded corn stover corn cobs feyereisen et al 2016 recycled steel byproducts hua et al 2016 paper fibers robertson 2010 and tree bark shavings povilaitis et al 2018 can contribute to higher no3 n removal moreover electrical stimulations acetate and ethanol could be potential enhancers of low temperature denitrification martin et al 2009 law et al 2018 biodegradable polymer pellets can also act as a solid substrate and biofilm carrier for denitrification boley et al 2000 in this study woodchips amended with two additional c sources namely activated c and flaxseed cake were investigated to enhance denitrification in bioreactors it is well known that activated c is a universal adsorbent for the removal of diverse types of aquatic pollutants bhatnagar and sillanpää 2011 hale et al 2012 bhatnagar et al 2013 nam et al 2014 however only a few studies have reported the sorption of no3 n by activated c afkhami et al 2007 karanasios et al 2010 ota et al 2013 mazarji et al 2017 moreover the potential of flaxseed cake as a c source to enhance denitrification has been never reported therefore the objective of this research was to determine if the addition of activated c and flaxseed cake could enhance no3 n removal in denitrifying woodchip bioreactors under varying temperature conditions the relationship between no3 n removal and sulfate reduction and the effect of activated c and flaxseed cake amendments on organic c export were also analysed 2 materials and methods three pilot scale denitrification bioreactors namely one filled with woodchips only w and the other two amended 10 v v with a mixture of woodchips and activated c w ac and flaxseed cake w fsc respectively were constructed at the field laboratory of vytautas magnus university in lithuania to test the efficiency of no3 n removal the bioreactors were made from cube shaped plastic containers 1 0 m3 volume each placed below ground by the excavation of a 1 2 m trench connected to two plastic water tanks 1 0 m3 volume each the locally sourced woodchips used for all the bioreactors were predominantly from alder and pine trees bulk density of 260 kg m3 the prevailing particle diameter of the woodchips 65 of the cumulative distribution varied from 1 1 cm to 3 0 cm the granular activated c of organosorb 10 aa type bulk density of 450 kg m3 total brunauer emmett teller surface area of 950 m2 g ph of 8 5 hardness of 90 iodine number of 1010 mg g was obtained from desotec with a granule size of 1 3 mm produced by high temperature steam activation of coal flaxseed cake bulk density of 570 kg m3 is a byproduct of local flaxseed oil production the cake is rich in proteins 32 fats 13 plant fibrils 25 and carbohydrates 18 and is available in large quantities in lithuania it is added to woodchips as a supplementary c source to enhance the performance of bioreactors the average length of the flaxseed flakes was about 3 0 cm each bioreactor was filled with woodchips or the woodchips amended with additives respectively to a depth of 1 0 m and a saturation level of 0 9 m was maintained by standpipes installed outside the outlets perforated bottom drainage pipes diverting the outflow from the bioreactors were swirled with synthetic net mesh size of 0 1 mm to avoid the washout of the fillers a polyethylene liner was folded and a plastic closure was capped over the top of each bioreactor to seal it from the soil and a mount with 20 cm thickness was formed and sown with grass the porosity of each filler based on the saturated volume of the bioreactor was determined using the porosity determination procedure described by christianson et al 2010 the analysis revealed that the woodchip porosity was 50 and the porosity of the woodchips amended with activated c and flaxseed cake was 48 and 47 respectively a schematic representation of the three pilot scale woodchip bioreactors is shown in fig 1 the no3 n removal efficiency tests of the three bioreactors began on june 16 2017 during the first month after the startup all the bioreactors demonstrated strong sporadic behavior without any consistent pattern therefore the results presented in this article covered the period from july 20 2017 until december 27 2018 the measurements were performed at various irregular time intervals by applying the same sampling procedures the bioreactors were fed nitrate via the addition of nano3 to the water tanks during the study period at concentrations ranging from 6 3 mg n l to 30 0 mg n l these concentrations were typical 83 of the cumulative frequency of the range in no3 n values observed in drainage water under field conditions povilaitis et al 2018 the water from the tanks was supplied to each bioreactor by gravity the flow velocity was determined by the difference in hydraulic head 3 6 m maximum between the water levels in the tanks and in the bioreactors water inflow to each bioreactor was recorded with the help of flow meters the inflow rates were adjusted manually with valves the valves were also used to achieve different water retention times and steady state flow conditions at various time intervals the bioreactors were monitored for no3 n nitrite n no2 n ammonium n nh4 n sulfate s so4 s chemical oxygen demand cod water temperature t c ph total dissolved solids tds dissolved oxygen do and free dissolved carbon dioxide co2 in water the no3 n number of measurements n 135 no2 n n 40 nh4 n n 40 and so4 s n 42 concentrations at the inlet outlet and inside the sampling wells were determined using a maxidirect photometer md600 with powder reagents the do n 135 contents and ts were measured using a portable hi 9142 hanna instruments ltd multimeter and the tds n 135 and ph n 135 values were determined using a hi 98136 meter the indirect amount of total organic c toc compounds in water measured as cod n 40 was determined using a hi 83099 02 cod meter by applying the dichromate method the dissolved co2 concentrations were measured n 12 using a portable oxyguard analyzer gaseous emissions i e n2o no2 and ch4 from the bioreactors were not monitored the no3 n removal efficiency expressed in percentage was determined as the difference between the inlet and outlet concentrations divided by the inlet concentration the no3 n removal rate in the bioreactors was calculated using the following equation 1 r r c i n n o 3 n c o u t n o 3 n h r t where rr is the removal rate g n m3 h cin no3 n and c out no3 n are the inflow and outflow concentrations g m3 respectively during an event defined as the period between two water sample collections when the water flow rate through the bioreactor is larger than zero and hrt is the hydraulic retention time h which was determined as follows 2 h r t ρ v q where ρ is the porosity of the filler v is the bioreactor volume m3 and q is the flow rate m3 h to determine the reliability of the differences between the experiments the shapiro wilk test was first conducted to assess the normality of the no3 n removal efficiency data from different bioreactors because the assumption of normality was not met a non parametric kruskal wallis test with post hoc was performed to determine whether the three groups of measurement data with different fillers were significantly different the significance of the difference in any pairwise comparison was determined by non parametric mann whitney test the data that fall 2 2 iqr i e interquartile range above the q3 75 and below the q1 25 quartiles were removed from the analysis hoaglin and iglewitcz 1987 aggarwal 2017 the strength of linear relationship between two variables was determined by regression analysis all statistical analyses were performed by applying the past version 2 0 software package 3 results 3 1 nitrate removal considering the entire study period the calculated hrt ranged from 1 15 h to 11 1 h the do concentrations at the inlets and outlets ranged from 3 1 mg l to 4 9 mg l and from 0 0 mg l to 1 3 mg l respectively this implied that the do in the bioreactors was consumed by heterotrophic bacteria and that c was made available to the bacterial community biological activity facilitated the reduction of o and further no3 n transformations with inflow concentrations ranging from 6 3 mg l to 30 0 mg l and outflow concentrations ranging from 3 4 mg l to 22 1 mg l the resulting no3 n removal efficiency during an event ranged from 17 5 to 75 0 in the w bioreactor from 21 3 to 82 7 in the w ac bioreactor and from 16 3 to 81 8 in the w fsc bioreactor the no3 n rrs during events ranged from 0 16 g n m3 h to 5 99 g n m3 h in the w bioreactor from 0 13 g n m3 h to 6 24 g n m3 h in the w ac bioreactor and from 0 28 g n m3 h to 6 72 g n m3 h in the w fsc bioreactor the average no3 n removal efficiency was 40 3 44 1 and 41 2 respectively the average rr of 1 76 g n m3 h was higher in the w ac bioreactor compared to the rate of 1 58 g n m3 h determined in the w and w fsc bioreactors the changes in the inflow t do ph no3 n no2 n nh4 n so4 s cod and tds concentrations and hrt among the three bioreactors did not show any statistically significant differences based on the kruskal wallis test the absence of differences in the changes in these parameters allowed us to assume that the inflow conditions equally affected no3 n removal in all bioreactors moreover the differences in the outflow concentrations of do no2 n nh4 n and t were also statistically insignificant however there were significant differences found in the outflow concentrations of so4 s p 0 010 tds p 0 001 cod p 0 010 and ph values p 0 050 inside the sampling wells among the bioreactors this indicated that no3 n removal to some extent was related to or controlled by the changes in these parameters 3 2 effect of inflow water temperature the experiment showed that no3 n removal was foremost affected by inflow t the t measured at the inlet ranged from 1 8 c to 21 7 c and that at the outlets ranged from 4 0 c to 21 2 c this range in temperatures was compatible with the tile drainage temperatures that can occur under conditions in lithuania povilaitis et al 2018 the effect of t was examined through the analysis of no3 n removal efficiencies and rates observed at various temperature intervals after comparing the removal efficiencies at t intervals of 0 0 5 0 c 5 1 10 0 c 10 1 15 0 c and higher than 15 c statistically significant differences p 0 050 were determined between the w ac and w bioreactors and between the w ac and w fsc bioreactors there were no significant differences in no3 n removal efficiencies between the w and w fsc bioreactors despite the absence of large differences in the removal magnitudes the no3 n removal efficiency at all temperature intervals was statistically higher in the w ac bioreactor average efficiency and removal rate values in all bioreactors are shown in table 1 in contrast to the no3 n removal efficiencies the no3 n rrs were statistically higher in the w ac bioreactor compared to those in the other two bioreactors only within the 0 0 5 0 c and 5 1 10 0 c temperature intervals higher inflow ts 10 1 15 0 c and 15 c did not reveal any significant differences in the rrs among the bioreactors the differences in the no3 n rrs between the w and w fsc bioreactors at all temperature intervals were also insignificant p 0 050 statistically higher removal efficiencies and rates under low 0 0 10 0 c temperature conditions in the w ac bioreactor could have been attributed to the effect of activated c the comparison of removal efficiencies and rates along with the scatter of measured values when the inflow ts were below and above 10 c are presented in fig 2 the increase in the denitrification rate with increased t was also estimated using the q5 and q10 temperature coefficients i e the factors by which the rr increased for each 5 c and 10 c increase respectively these indexes have often been applied in similar studies as an indication of biological reactions schipper et al 2010 christianson et al 2012 addy et al 2016 hoover et al 2016 in this experiment an exponential best fit model for the entire temperature range yielded q5 values of 1 38 1 42 and 1 31 and q10 values of 1 91 2 02 and 1 73 in the w w ac and w fsc bioreactors respectively however the values of q5 1 12 and q10 1 25 calculated at the low temperature range 0 10 c in the w ac bioreactor were slightly higher compared to q5 1 06 and 1 07 and q10 1 13 and 1 14 in the w and w fsc bioreactors respectively these results strengthened the assumption that woodchips amended with activated c can generate higher denitrification rates at low temperatures however the same assumption with the amendment of flaxseed cake was not confirmed the no3 n rrs in bioreactors at the 0 0 5 0 c interval ranged from 0 19 g n m3 h to 2 37 g n m3 h the rrs at the 5 1 10 0 c interval changed from 0 13 g n m3 h to 2 77 g n m3 h when the inflow t was within 10 1 15 0 c the rates changed from 0 39 g n m3 h to 6 72 g n m3 h the highest rrs ranging from 0 52 g n m3 h to 6 24 g n m3 h were observed at temperatures higher than 15 c 3 3 organic carbon release according to schipper et al 2010 c availability to denitrifiers is a key determinant for no3 n removal bioavailable c sources in water mostly appear in simple organic compounds and support removal efficiency however there are concerns about excessive release of organic c from bioreactors in this study toc was measured as cod and used as an indicator of bioavailable c and for all bioreactors the cod concentration at the outlet was significantly greater than that at the inlet the cod concentration in the inflow ranged from 0 0 mg l to 17 0 mg l average of 3 03 mg l while the outflow concentrations ranged from 1 0 mg l to 305 0 mg l average of 125 3 mg l in the w bioreactor from 1 0 mg l to 69 0 mg l average of 19 6 mg l in the w ac bioreactor and from 1 0 mg l to 475 0 mg l average of 217 5 mg l in the w fsc bioreactor the outflows were ranked in order of magnitude as w fsc w w ac and showed an average of a 6 11 fold higher organic c release from the w and w fsc bioreactors compared to that from the w ac bioreactor the observed concentrations showed that flaxseed cake rich in proteins fats and carbohydrates made it more subject to decay and faster organic c release than other c sources woodchips containing large amounts of cellulose and hemicellulose were more resistant to biodegradation woodchips are the most common and preferred c medium therefore the toc release from the w bioreactor exhibited degradability and c loss similar to that of a conventional bioreactor under the given temperature and hrt conditions unlike the other treatments the w ac treatment demonstrated that owing to specific properties the addition of activated c was able to retain much more organic c the adsorption properties determined by the high porosity and large specific surface area of activated c resulted in much lower c fluxes from the w ac bioreactor this indicated that activated c with a higher potential to accumulate labile organic compounds could support more stable microbial activity and sustain higher denitrification because of the adsorption of organic compounds with subsequent enhancement of microbial activity no3 n removal may be less susceptible to low temperatures if activated c is present this presumption was confirmed by comparing the no3 n removal efficiencies against the cod concentrations fig 3 the process of toc release i e decomposition of organic matter in all the bioreactors except for the w ac bioreactor was positively temperature dependent thus no3 n removal linearly increased with toc increase in the case of the w ac bioreactor fig 3b toc was the least temperature dependent e g from 0 0 c to 10 0 c the dependency was absent however the removal process tended to steadily increase with little change in toc this demonstrated that woodchips amended with activated c as a bioreactor filling material may substantially reduce c losses while maintaining denitrification although the bioavailable c concentration was much higher in the w fsc bioreactor the lack of a significant difference in no3 n removal efficiency between the w and w fsc bioreactors indicated that the removal in the latter treatment was most likely oversaturated with c 3 4 effect of ph the ph values in the inflow ranged from 7 3 to 9 0 average of 8 3 while those inside the sampling wells ranged from 6 1 to 8 3 average of 7 3 in the w bioreactor from 6 2 to 7 6 average of 7 1 in the w ac bioreactor and from 6 1 to 7 4 average of 6 8 in the w fsc bioreactor bioreactor w was able to accommodate a wider range in ph while the bioreactor with flaxseed cake more frequently exhibited lower ph 7 0 values fig 4 the results showed that the pattern of change in ph statistically differed among the bioreactors this suggested that ph could differently affect microbial activity and the performance of denitrification shao et al 2009 wang and chu 2016 feyereisen et al 2017 and blum et al 2018 reported that ph in the range of 6 5 8 5 is suitable for denitrification in this experiment the highest no3 n removal efficiencies in the w and w ac bioreactors were achieved when the ph ranged from 7 0 to 7 5 this was the most dominant ph interval covering 64 and 72 of the values respectively at this interval 27 and 30 of the observed removal efficiencies were higher than 50 and the ph weighted average was 45 5 and 47 8 respectively at a ph greater than 7 5 the medium became more alkaline and the removal efficiency tended to decrease bell shaped distribution in fig 4a for the w bioreactor the w fsc bioreactor behaved slightly differently most of the removal efficiency values 61 ranging from 16 3 to 81 8 with a weighted average of 38 6 occurred at a ph of less than 7 0 and only 21 of the observed efficiencies within a ph of 7 0 7 5 were higher than 50 the average removal at a ph of 7 0 7 5 was 43 7 these results demonstrated that the no3 n removal efficiency in the w and w ac bioreactors tended to increase toward a ph of 7 0 7 5 however a decrease in removal efficiency was likely to occur beyond this interval the results also revealed that in the w fsc bioreactor the shift to a more acidic medium ph of 6 5 7 0 supported microbial activity that was suitable for high denitrification in principle despite the fact that the change in ph statistically differed among the bioreactors its range from 6 5 to 7 5 positively affected no3 n removal 3 5 total dissolved solids changes in the chemical balance affected the tds pattern with the inflow concentrations ranging from 412 mg l to 529 mg l average of 468 mg l the highest tds outflows ranging from 421 mg l to 688 mg l average of 474 mg l were observed in the w fsc bioreactor in the w and w ac bioreactors the amount of tds ranged from 386 mg l to 488 mg l average of 451 mg l and from 390 mg l to 510 mg l average of 455 mg l respectively which were statistically lower p 0 001 than that in the w fsc bioreactor and lower p 0 001 than that in the inflow there were no significant differences found between tds in the w and w ac bioreactors higher tds in the w fsc bioreactor could have been attributed to the larger amount of negatively charged colloids products of fsc decomposition and likely higher release of bicarbonates discontinuous measurements showed that the hco3 concentration in the outflow was 17 47 higher than that in the inflow since the proportions of hco3 to co2 at a certain ph are relative to each other significantly higher quantities of co2 could have led to increased hco3 in the w fsc bioreactor the decrease in tds in the outflows compared to that in the inflows in the w and w ac bioreactors could have been explained through the comparison of the difference in the inflow and outflow ph according to cole and prairie 2009 at an inflow ph of 7 3 9 0 the amount of hco3 could be hundreds of times greater than that of co2 and co3 however owing to organic matter decomposition the ph inside the bioreactors decreased average 7 1 7 3 and the proportions of relative magnitudes were changed 3 6 sulfate reduction the inflow concentrations of so4 s ranged from 7 7 mg l to 29 7 mg l average of 18 2 mg l which were more than 2 fold higher than those in the outflows the highest so4 s reduction 62 7 on average was observed in the w ac bioreactor where the outflow concentration ranged from 1 7 mg l to 12 4 mg l average of 6 5 mg l and was statistically lower p 0 040 than that in the other two bioreactors the difference between the outflow concentrations in the w and w fsc bioreactors was statistically insignificant the so4 s concentration ranged from 3 7 mg l to 19 1 mg l average of 8 04 mg l in the w bioreactor and from 1 7 mg l to 13 7 mg l average of 8 09 mg l in the w fsc bioreactor generally sulfate reduction occurs when the no3 n concentration in the bioreactor is depleted however in this experiment the no3 n concentration was never depleted below the threshold value of 0 5 mg l shipper et al 2010 this indicated that sulfate reduction occurred under non n limiting conditions moreover the absence of interdependency between no3 n removal efficiency and so4 s reduction in the w bioreactor horizontal line in fig 5 a and the negative relationship between no3 n removal and so4 s reduction in the w ac and w fsc bioreactors fig 5b and 5c revealed that both electron acceptors no3 and so4 were utilized simultaneously and that no3 n and so4 s reduction occurred concomitantly the obtained results suggest that different groups of bacteria may compete for the same c substrate and electron acceptor the negative relationship between no3 n removal and so4 s reduction implied that either the denitrifiers biomass or activity was temporarily lower compared to those of the sulfate reducers srb assimilatory sulfate reduction could have occurred alternatively srb to some extent produced hydrogen sulfide h2s which inhibited no3 n reduction i e dissimilatory sulfate reduction higher so4 s reduction resulted in higher h2s production with subsequent lower no3 n reduction this process was slightly more pronounced in the w ac and w fsc bioreactors fig 5 the so4 s reduction was dependent on hrt the relationship between hrt and so4 s reduction in the w ac and w fsc bioreactors was opposite to that of no3 n versus so4 s data not shown a longer hrt 9 10 h resulted in a 60 80 sulfate reduction compared to a 42 50 reduction at a shorter 1 h hrt the change was less evident in the w bioreactor correspondingly the no3 n removal efficiency was negatively related to increased hrt this indicated that a longer hrt under non n limiting conditions may have resulted in greater srb development thereby inhibiting denitrification and no3 n reduction statistically higher so4 s reduction in the w ac bioreactor was likely related to the enhanced srb activity due to the greater accumulation of organic matter on the activated c surface by adsorption 3 7 effect of hydraulic retention time on removal rate the pattern of change in hrt was similar in all bioreactors with minimum values ranging from 1 15 h to 1 71 h and maximum values ranging from 9 2 h to 11 1 h the no3 n rr was nonlinearly dependent on hrt fig 6 the relationship between the hrts and rrs determined using power function approximation showed that lower hrts led to higher rrs this indicated that the lower hrt was a result of the higher flow rate passing through the bioreactors when the flow rate increased the no3 n input load also increased under a higher input load faster n mass removal occurred therefore a higher rr for lower hrt was most likely governed by reaction kinetics i e a transition to first order kinetics 3 8 ammonium and nitrite release the no2 n concentrations at the inlet ranged from 0 009 mg l to 0 104 mg l average of 0 060 mg l and were slightly reduced with a range from 0 009 mg l to 0 100 mg l average of 0 054 mg l at the outlets data not shown no2 n is an intermediate during no3 n reduction therefore the absence of the substantial reduction of no2 n in the outflows indicated that denitrification was most frequently incomplete the other reason for such steady formation of no2 n in the bioreactors could have been attributed to the similar inflow and inside no2 n decomposition rates there were no statistically significant differences found between the no2 n and nh4 n outflow concentrations among the bioreactors in contrast to no2 n the nh4 n concentrations ranging from 0 016 mg l to 0 140 mg l were always higher in the outflow compared to those ranging from 0 015 mg l to 0 031 mg l average of 0 018 mg l in the inflow the nh4 n release was higher by 16 and 30 on average in the w ac bioreactor compared to that in the w fsc and w bioreactors respectively the release was most likely the result of drna i e dissimilatory reduction of no3 n to nh4 n because the w ac bioreactor had greater potential to adsorb organic c to favor the dnra bacteria over denitrifiers healy et al 2012 fenton et al 2014 this implied that activated c may have created the medium for higher diversity and supported higher activity of microorganisms to a lesser extent drna also occurred in the w and w fsc bioreactors because the ratio of organic c to no3 n was relatively high there consequently less than 1 of the no3 n removal in the treatments was attributed to drna greenan et al 2006 reported that drna accounts for less than 4 of no3 n removal gibert et al 2008 declared that 10 of no3 n removal is a result of drna generally anaerobic environments with high c tend to favor drna over denitrification 4 discussion many factors affect no3 n removal in bioreactors among these inflow t is the most important factor controlling denitrification by affecting microbial activity in the performed treatments both the no3 n removal efficiencies and rrs were 39 43 lower at low temperatures 1 8 10 0 c than at higher temperatures 10 1 21 7 c similar results were obtained in other studies for example wang and chu 2016 found that nitrate removal efficiency decreases from 92 5 at 25 c to 68 7 at 15 c and that the rr decreases by 50 when temperature decreases by 5 c addy et al 2016 showed that denitrification beds with temperatures below 6 c have a 2 fold lower rr than those at temperatures from 6 c to 16 9 c hoover et al 2016 reported that with a mean influent no3 n concentration of 30 7 mg l the mean effluent concentrations range from 24 9 mg l at 10 c to 13 5 mg l at 20 c feyereisen et al 2016 observed no3 n reductions in bioreactors ranging from 5 to 73 and from 4 to 16 at 15 5 c and 1 5 c respectively the q10 temperature coefficients of 1 91 2 02 and 1 73 in the w w ac and w fsc bioreactors respectively were also comparable to those reported in the literature cameron and schipper 2010 warneke et al 2011 and addy et al 2016 found q10 values of around 2 0 for no3 n rrs thereby demonstrating an increasing no3 n removal pattern at higher temperatures and the demand to enhance the removal at lower temperatures the addition of activated c 10 v v in the w ac bioreactor showed statistically higher no3 n removal efficiencies and rrs compared to those of the w and w fsc bioreactors at low temperatures 0 10 c the greater efficiency of the removal in the w ac bioreactor could have been attributed to the higher microbial activity stimulated by specific properties of activated c according to knezev 2015 the enhancement in microbial activity on the activated c surface is related to the accumulation of organic matter by adsorption bacteria and other microorganisms interact with the surface of activated c in contact with water these interactions lead to attachment retention and consequently to growth and maintenance of bacteria in granular activated c therefore owing to its high porosity and large specific surface area activated c was able to adsorb and retain much more labile organic c by providing a larger area available for bacterial attachment and higher denitrification in the w ac bioreactor meynet et al 2012 also found that biochemical processes taking place on activated c surfaces can enlarge microbial diversity and cell counts and promote higher respiration a greater variety of species in the bacterial community make it better adapted to temperature change porter et al 2015 vacková et al 2011 reported that mixed cultures showed the highest denitrification rate at temperatures below 10 c it is likely that with the addition of activated c a bacterial community less susceptible to low temperature emerges the process of syntrophy shah et al 2014 in which the cooperation of various groups of microorganisms occurs could also contribute to no3 n removal however the addition of flaxseed cake 10 v v in the woodchip bioreactor did not reveal any significant difference compared to the no3 n removal in the w treatment throughout the range of temperatures no effect of the addition of an external c source in the w fsc bioreactor could be related to the relatively high labile organic c release it is likely that organic c oversaturation occurred in the bioreactor thereby impeding the possibility for higher denitrification in contrast to the commonly accepted opinion that organic c availability may boost denitrification schipper et al 2010 lepine et al 2016 hassanpour et al 2017 the obtained results suggested that the abundance of organic c from the decay of the additional c source under non n limiting conditions may have inhibited the growth of denitrifiers if organic c release exceeds a particular concentration e g cod 300 mg l in this study then no3 n removal may be limited hoover et al 2016 reported greater no3 n removal with weathered 52 woodchips compared to that with fresh 39 woodchips because of the difference in toc this confirms the key role of organic c in controlling denitrification however it also implies that an optimal ratio between the inflow no3 n concentration and bioavailable organic c in the bioreactors may exist for enhanced denitrification this relationship should be investigated in further studies furthermore the competitiveness of denitrifiers may be lower when flaxseed cake is added for example warneke et al 2011 reported that the bacterial community in a woodchip bioreactor contained a higher percentage of denitrifiers than the community in a maize cob bioreactor andrus et al 2014 also suggested to inoculate optimal microbial species to shift the community to high performing no3 n removers the ph values observed in the bioreactors were consistent with those mentioned in other studies the highest no3 n removal efficiencies were achieved at a ph of 7 0 7 5 the ph range from 6 5 to 7 5 also revealed increasing no3 n removal however the shift to more alkaline conditions with a ph of 7 5 8 3 showed a decrease in no3 n removal saleh lakha et al 2009 found that ph has a significant effect on denitrifying enzyme activity with cumulative denitrification levels of 28 μmol 63 μmol and 22 μmol at a ph of 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 respectively moreover the cell densities of denitrifiers pseudomonas mandelii are in the order of ph 7 ph 8 ph 6 ph 5 according to van den heuvel et al 2011 no3 n reduction tends to increase toward a ph of 7 0 a comprehensive study by blum et al 2018 reported that enzymes involved in n cycling have different optima therefore no3 n reduction increases with increasing ph with an optimum range from 7 0 to 8 0 they stated that the highest expected no3 n reduction is in the ph range of 7 0 7 5 and low at a ph of less than 6 5 and greater than 8 0 the results indicated that no3 n removal in activated c amended bioreactor more frequently occur within a ph of 7 0 7 5 lower ph values in the w fsc bioreactor were likely conditioned by higher free dissolved co2 it is well known that dissolved co2 which originates from the respiration of heterotrophic bacteria is a master variable in anaerobic environments since dissolved co2 consists of two pools free co2 and its hydrated form of h2co3 after reaction with water it affects the chemical balance and regulates ph cole and prairie 2009 therefore the free dissolved co2 concentration in the inflow ranged from 1 mg l to 4 mg l while that inside the sampling wells ranged from 10 mg l to 38 mg l average of 23 1 mg l in the w bioreactor from 2 mg l to 10 mg l average of 2 3 mg l in the w ac bioreactor and from 14 mg l to 71 mg l average of 46 2 mg l in the w fsc bioreactor this showed that the decomposition of organic matter with less adsorption was most intense in the w fsc bioreactor and that the change in chemical equilibrium led to increased co2 and lower ph in contrast to other fillers the shift in equilibrium to a more alkaline condition ph of 7 5 8 3 in the w bioreactor fig 4a indicated the influence of its greater buffering and the likely greater formation of co3 carbonates sulfate reducing bacteria srb also could have produced alkalinity and this may have accounted for some of the differences in ph between the treatments all three bioreactors acted as a sink of no2 n and source of nh4 n with a low level of ammonium production 0 140 mg n l so4 s reduction has been observed christianson et al 2012 shipper et al 2010 shih et al 2011 hoover et al 2016 in many denitrification systems when no3 n has been nearly depleted this process is a great concern because it produces noxious h2s in contrast to published data the no3 n concentrations ranged from 3 4 mg l to 22 1 mg l in this study were never depleted however sulfate reduction to some extent was always occurring because denitrifying organisms compete with sulfate reducers this implied that both electron acceptors were utilized jointly a more detailed study about concomitant no3 n and so4 s reductions was conducted by dalsgaard and bak 1994 they found that at higher so4 s concentrations no3 n reductions may be temporarily halted and only so4 s reductions may occur although inflow so4 s concentrations up to 29 7 mg l in this experiment were consistent with those observed in tile drainage water bastienė et al 2012 it is likely that they were in a range to cause the reductions denitrification and sulfate reduction activities in batch experiments were also investigated by yamashita and yamamoto ikemoto 2014 they revealed that population of sulfate reducing bacteria may significantly increase inside the wood under denitrification conditions nevertheless an explicit explanation to sulfate reduction phenomenon in the current treatments was not found it is likely that the competitive population of assimilatory sulfate reducers might have exceeded or suppressed the population of denitrifiers a longer hrt in the treatments showed higher sulfate reduction with subsequent lower no3 n removal under these circumstances a longer hrt under non n limiting conditions might have resulted in the greater development of sulfate reducers inhibiting denitrification lepine et al 2016 also found significant sulfate reduction and sulfide production in bioreactors operating with longer hrts these results signify that bioreactors with long hrts may induce srb growth have a higher risk of generating h2s and support the formation of methyl mercury the formation of nh4 n may also lead to adverse effects on the aquatic environment in downstream bioreactors the obtained results demonstrated that lower hrts stimulated higher rrs higher no3 n rrs for lower hrts were governed by no3 n removal transition to first order reaction kinetics these findings were consistent with the results obtained by christianson et al 2013b cameron and schipper 2010 hoover et al 2016 and povilaitis et al 2018 similarly but with a less apparent relationship the no3 n removal efficiency was dependent on hrt however this was contradictory to the results reported in other studies the majority of research conducted under n limiting conditions has shown that higher retention times provide higher no3 n removal efficiencies christianson et al 2013c lepine et al 2016 in our study with continuous non n limiting conditions the reported pattern was not confirmed this demonstrated that the optimal hrt for the no3 n rr may not be the same as that for no3 n removal efficiency longer hrt designs may result in higher sulfate reduction and increased cost at shorter hrts the do may not be removed and microorganisms may be washed out balancing these two removal metrics is a complicated and complex task more research is required to evaluate the flow rate seasonality microbial community and other limiting factors to attain reliable parameters for bioreactor design in lithuania in terms of application the c losses from the w ac bioreactor were much lower and the no3 n removal was higher than those from the w and w fsc bioreactors this suggested that a more efficient bioreactor with prolonged longevity could be designed by mixing woodchips with activated c feyereisen et al 2016 also found that a plastic biofilm carrier and corn cobs added to woodchips improve nitrate removal yong zhen et al 2007 reported that denitrification potential is substantially increased with the addition of three external c sources i e methanol ethanol and acetate mankiewicz boczek et al 2017 showed that brown coal pine sawdust flax harl barley straw and coal straw mix are good solutions to increase denitrification the addition of biochar and steel byproducts also positively affects nitrate removal in woodchip bioreactors bock et al 2015 hua et al 2016 despite the relatively small difference in the no3 n removal magnitude 10 on average between the w and w ac bioreactors throughout the study period the addition of 10 v v activated c to woodchips generated higher no3 n removal efficiencies and rrs at low temperatures 0 10 c it is likely that determining the optimum amount of activated c higher than 10 v v by taking into account cost versus removal efficiency for enhanced bioreactor performance would not only reduce c loss but also increase the magnitude of no3 n removal the increased release of c with no added effect on no3 n removal from the w fsc bioreactor indicated that flaxseed cake was more biodegradable than woodchips schipper et al 2010 reported that only slow rates of c decomposition are needed to support no3 n removal the high release of soluble c can reduce do in receiving waters and adversely affect biota although flaxseed cake is a less expensive material than activated c the benefit of its addition to woodchips was not confirmed 5 conclusions three pilot scale denitrification bioreactors namely one filled with woodchips only and the other two amended 10 v v with a mixture of woodchips and activated c and flaxseed cake were constructed to test the efficiency of no3 n removal the experiment demonstrated the potential to enhance nitrate removal through the incorporation of activated c the addition of activated c substantially reduced organic c losses from the bioreactors while maintaining denitrification compared to other fillers woodchips only and woodchips amended with flaxseed cake activated c amended woodchips showed higher efficiency and supported higher no3 n removal rates at low temperatures 10 c the highest no3 n removal efficiency was achieved at a ph of 7 0 7 5 all bioreactors acted as a sink of no2 n and source of nh4 n with sulfate reduction under non n limiting conditions lower hydraulic retention times hrts stimulated higher removal rates while longer hrts likely resulted in higher srb development thereby inhibiting denitrification and no3 n reduction woodchips amended with flaxseed cake showed no significant difference in removing no3 n compared to the use of woodchips only a much greater release of organic c with no added effect on no3 n removal indicated that flaxseed cake as an external c source was more biodegradable than woodchips but the benefit of its addition to woodchips was not confirmed declaration of competing interest the authors

the search were organic fertilizer and grain yield or wue and wheat the year of publication was not restricted but publications after july 2018 were not included to avoid distortions caused by publication selection the data chosen for use had to satisfy the following criteria 1 the field studies must include a treatment with organic fertilizer application and a without organic fertilizer control and 2 the means standard deviations or standard errors and sample sizes of the variables concerned must be directly available or amenable to being calculated from the data data were recorded by experimental year for publications reporting results from multi year experiments after scrutinizing the search results 776 observations from 177 studies conducted at 80 sites were selected for use

traditional rate 250 300 high and 300 kg ha 1 ultra high 2 2 statistical analysis data were analyzed using the methods of meta analysis described by curtis and wang 1998 hedges et al 1999 and wang et al 2017a the natural log lnr of the response ratio r was calculated as the effect size in this meta analysis representing the effect of organic fertilizer application using the following equations 1 r x t x c 2 l n r ln x t x c l n x t l n x c where xt is the mean of winter wheat yield et or wue in the organic fertilizer treatment and xc is the mean of winter wheat yield wue or et in the without organic fertilizer control if xt and xc are normally distributed and xc is unlikely to be negative then lnr is approximately normally distributed with a mean of approximately the true response log ratio the variance v of lnr was calculated using the following equation 3 v s t 2 n t x t 2 s c 2 n c x c 2 where st and sc are the standard deviations for all comparisons in the treatment and control groups respectively and nt and nc are the sample sizes for the treatment and control groups respectively several studies did not report values of standard deviations or standard error in these cases we calculated the average coefficient of variation within each data set and then back calculated the standard error from the average coefficient of variation weighted means were used since individual experiments often differ in their statistical precision curtis and wang 1998 the weighted mean log ratio ln r was used which produces the greatest precision minimum variance and was calculated using the following equations 4 l n r i 1 k w i l n r i i 1 k w i 5 w i 1 v i where the weighting factor wi is the reciprocal of the total variance of lnri curtis and wang 1998 a mixed or random effects model was employed to determine whether organic fertilizer application significantly affected each dependent variable using the statistical software metawin 2 1 systat software inc san jose ca with a resampling of 9999 iterations li et al 2018 rosenberg et al 2000 shcherbak et al 2014 wang et al 2017a inverse variance statistical methods were adopted for the meta analysis a random effect model was adopted in cases of high heterogeneity a chi square p value 0 05 we performed a kolmogorov smirnov test and determined that the distribution of yield wue and et is not normal p 0 001 fig 3 means and 95 confidence intervals ci on the estimated effect size were generated using the bootstrapping test i e sampling with replacement of the size equal to the initial size of the subset repeated n 9999 times for yield wue and et in the study as well as subgroups of yield wue and et shcherbak et al 2014 wang et al 2017a groups with fewer than two valid comparisons were excluded from the meta analysis to facilitate interpretation the percentage of change in winter wheat yield wue and et were calculated as ln r 1 100 if the 95 ci for a dependent variable did not overlap zero the effect of organic fertilizer application was considered significant means of the different categorical variables were considered significantly different from one another if their 95 bootstrapping cis did not overlap curtis and wang 1998 wang et al 2017a a positive percentage change indicated an increase in the respective variable with organic fertilizer relative to without organic fertilizer while a negative value indicated a decrease meta analysis assumes that studies are independent and free from publication bias and we considered this to be the case in the meta analysis reported here curtis and wang 1998 wang et al 2017a with meta analysis one can test whether categorical groups are homogeneous with respect to effect size i e that observed differences in lnr among studies are due to sampling error and whether there are significant differences in mean response between these groups we used the homogeneity statistic q an estimate of the among study variance to test whether variances were significantly different if p 0 05 tested against a chi square distribution then the data were considered to be heterogeneous and further analyzed by single factor categorical analysis curtis and wang 1998 wang et al 2017a when conducting categorical analyses total heterogeneity of effect size among studies qt was generated and partitioned into heterogeneity within categorical variables qw and heterogeneity between categorical variables qb such that qt qw qb comparison between categorical variables was examined by qb the frequency distribution of effect size was plotted and the frequency of effect size was fit to a gaussian distribution function to assess homogeneity of observations using sigmaplot v 12 5 software jandel scientific corte maders ca 3 results 3 1 overall response of winter wheat yield and wue to organic fertilization the frequency distribution of effect size was fit to a gaussian distribution function for yield et and wue of winter wheat li et al 2018 shan and yan 2013 the kolmogorov smirnov test indicated that the distribution of yield et and wue is not normal fig 3 the organic fertilizer application rate was about 30 75 mg ha 1 for nof and nlof and 10 22 5 mg ha 1 for nrof data not shown on average yield with organic fertilizer and without organic fertilizer was 5 4 and 4 6 mg ha 1 respectively et was 394 and 392 mm respectively and wue was 9 5 and 11 4 kg mm 1 ha 1 respectively data not shown yield and wue were increased by 20 and 18 with organic fertilizer compared to without organic fertilizer respectively fig 4 applying organic fertilizer did not significantly affect et 3 2 response of winter wheat yield and wue to organic fertilization as affected by growing region and et winter wheat yield and wue response to organic fertilizer application in china varied with growing region and et during the growing season figs 5 and 6 on average yield and wue were significantly increased with organic fertilizer compared to without organic fertilizer in different regions of northern china fig 5 the increase in yield with organic fertilizer was largest in the north china plain 33 followed by the northwest region 20 and the central plain irrigation region rice and winter wheat growing region and cold region 16 17 organic fertilizer significantly increased et of winter wheat in the central plain irrigation region decreased et in north china plain and northwest region and did not significantly affect et in the rice and winter wheat growing region fig 5b organic fertilizer significantly increased wue by 31 in the north china plain and by 16 18 in the northwest region central plain irrigation region and rice and winter wheat growing region fig 5c the effect of et on the response of winter wheat yield and wue to organic fertilizer was evaluated in this study since most observations of wue came from experiments in semi arid regions of china in these regions grain yield and wue of winter wheat are primarily limited by soil water deficit during spring growth and through grain filling because of high evaporation and erratic distribution of precipitation wang et al 2018a the positive effect organic fertilizer on yield decreased as et increased fig 6a the increase in yield with organic fertilizer was largest when et was 300 mm 26 followed by when et was 300 500 mm 17 and was least when et was 500 mm 8 the positive effect of organic fertilizer on wue was also influenced by et the largest increase in wue occurred when et was 300 mm 21 followed by when et was 300 500 mm 18 19 and was least when et was 500 mm 15 fig 6b 3 3 response of winter wheat yield and wue to organic fertilization as affected by soil organic matter soil organic matter content significantly affected the response of winter wheat yield and wue to organic fertilization in china fig 7 the positive effect of organic fertilizer on yield decreased with increased som fig 7a the increase in yield with organic fertilizer was greatest when som was 1 4 24 27 and least when som was 1 4 9 11 soil organic matter content did not significantly affect the response of winter wheat et to organic fertilizer fig 7b the response of winter wheat wue to organic fertilization varied among categories of som fig 7c the mean increase in wue with organic fertilizer ranged from 17 to 19 when som was 1 0 to 1 4 or 2 0 and was 11 for sites with 1 4 2 0 som 3 4 response of winter wheat yield and wue to organic fertilization as affected by n fertilizer rate yield et and wue of winter wheat in response to organic fertilization in northern china varied with n fertilizer rate fig 8 the positive effect of organic fertilization on winter wheat yield was influenced by n fertilizer rate fig 8a organic fertilizer increased wheat yield by 71 in the absence of synthetic n fertilizer application by 15 18 when synthetic n fertilizer was applied up to 300 kg n ha 1 and by 10 with synthetic n fertilization 300 kg n ha 1 organic fertilizer did not significantly affect et regardless of synthetic n fertilizer rate applied fig 8b the positive effect of organic fertilizer on wue of winter wheat was affected by synthetic n fertilizer rate fig 8c organic fertilizer increased wue by 41 in the absence of synthetic n fertilizer by 18 19 when synthetic n fertilizer was applied up to 150 kg n ha 1 or at 250 300 kg n ha 1 and by 11 13 when synthetic n fertilizer was applied at 150 250 kg ha 1 the effect of synthetic n fertilizer rate on the response of winter wheat yield and wue to organic fertilizer was assessed by yield level since the rate of synthetic n fertilization is commonly adjusted according to the expected yield of a growing environment wang et al 2018a b on average the positive effect organic fertilizer on yield and wue decreased as yield level increased fig 9 at low yield levels 4 0 mg ha 1 organic fertilizer increased yield by 88 in the absence of synthetic n fertilizer by 20 27 when synthetic n fertilizer was applied up to 300 kg ha 1 and by 7 when the synthetic n fertilizer rate exceeded 300 kg n ha 1 fig 9a at medium yield levels 4 0 5 5 mg ha 1 organic fertilizer increased yield by 44 in the absence of synthetic n fertilizer and by 15 18 with synthetic n fertilization fig 9d at high yield levels 5 5 mg ha 1 however the positive effect organic fertilizer on yield averaged 4 11 among levels of synthetic n fertilization fig 9g evapotranspiration of winter wheat in response to organic fertilizer varied with yield level at low yield levels 4 0 mg ha 1 organic fertilizer significantly reduced et in the absence of synthetic n fertilizer however organic fertilizer did not significantly affect et when synthetic n fertilizer was applied fig 9b at medium yield levels 4 0 5 5 mg ha 1 organic fertilizer reduced et by 4 13 when synthetic n fertilizer was applied at 0 100 or 150 200 kg n ha 1 increased et by 8 when synthetic n fertilizer was applied at 100 150 kg n ha 1 and did not significantly affect et in the absence of synthetic n fertilizer or when synthetic n fertilizer was applied at 200 250 kg n ha 1 fig 9e at high yield levels 5 5 mg ha 1 organic fertilizer did not significantly affect et when synthetic n fertilizer was applied at 100 250 kg n ha 1 fig 9h water use efficiency of winter wheat in response to organic fertilizer also varied with yield level at low yield levels 4 0 mg ha 1 organic fertilizer increased wue by an average of 16 21 among levels of synthetic n fertilization fig 9c at medium yield levels 4 0 5 5 mg ha 1 organic fertilizer increased wue by 10 14 in the absence of synthetic n fertilization or when synthetic n fertilizer was applied up to 200 kg n ha 1 but did not affect wue when synthetic n fertilizer was applied at 200 250 kg n ha 1 fig 9f at high yield levels 5 5 mg ha 1 organic fertilizer did not significantly affect wue of winter wheat when synthetic n fertilizer was applied at 100 150 or 200 250 kg n ha 1 and increased wue by an average of 9 when synthetic n fertilizer was applied at 150 200 kg n ha 1 fig 9i 3 5 response of winter wheat yield and yield variation to organic fertilization yield of winter wheat was significantly affected by method of organic fertilization fig 10 on average yield was 5 9 5 5 and 4 1 mg ha 1 for nof nlof and nrof respectively data not shown when organic fertilizer was applied yield was increased by 28 and 25 with the nlof and nof treatments respectively and was reduced by 11 with the nrof treatment fig 10 organic fertilization significantly influenced spatial and temporal variation in yield fig 11 on average the coefficient of variation across locations was 28 7 and 32 9 with organic fertilizer and without organic fertilizer respectively and the coefficient of variation across years was 11 8 and 14 3 with organic fertilizer and without organic fertilizer respectively data not shown based on these values organic fertilizer significantly reduced spatial and temporal variation in yield by an average of 11 and 23 respectively fig 11 4 discussion this study provides a systematic and quantitative analysis on the impacts of organic fertilization on the yields and wue of winter wheat in china based on literature search organic fertilization was the focus of this study because of its potential to improve soil quality reduce chemical fertilizer application and enhance resource utilization efficiency xiong and wu 2017 4 1 overall response of winter wheat yield and wue to organic fertilization this meta analysis confirmed that organic fertilization increased grain yield of winter wheat in northern china supporting our first hypothesis overall the use of organic fertilizer increased grain yield by 20 without affecting et thereby increasing wue as shown in previous studies fan et al 2005 liu et al 2013 wang et al 2011 2017b this could be due to organic fertilization increasing precipitation storage efficiency wang et al 2011 and alleviating soil water depletion liu et al 2013 chemical fertilization without organic fertilizer control can cause severe depletion of soil water in semi arid areas liu et al 2013 thus winter wheat with chemical fertilization might be insufficient to maintain high yield and wue wang et al 2011 2013 2018a this can be attributed to reduced soil evaporation with organic fertilization through increased crop canopy coverage chen et al 2015 satyanarayana et al 2002 wang et al 2018a li et al 1993 and transpiration wang et al 2018a zhang et al 1998 thereby enhancing biomass accumulation and ultimately increasing yield and wue however seufert et al 2012 found that organic fertilizer decreased wheat grain yield by 30 this discrepancy may be associated with differences in method of organic fertilization since some studies have evaluated organic fertilization as part of a low input cropping system i e a portion of n fertilizer replaced with organic fertilizer at the same level of n this slow n release pattern of organic n sources is attributed to the dependence of organic fertilizer on microbial decomposition and subsequent mineralization of n a process largely affected by climate kramer et al 2002 under these conditions the n source is usually a limiting factor for adequate crop uptake of n and grain yield rieux et al 2013 4 2 response of winter wheat yield to method of organic fertilization in this study the increase in yield compared to without organic fertilizer was greater with nlof than nof presumably due to excessive n input with nof hawkesford 2014 wang et al 2018a winter wheat yield was reduced with nrof likely because low available n with nrof was a limiting factor for crop uptake of n and grain yield wang et al 2018a similar responses have been reported in wheat annett et al 2007 mason et al 2007 rieux et al 2013 and legumes seufert et al 2012 these results suggest that combining reduced synthetic n fertilizer input with organic fertilization as a viable option for sustainable intensification of cereal production in northern china 4 3 response of winter wheat yield and wue to organic fertilization as affected by growing region and et the effect of organic fertilization on yield and wue of winter wheat were affected by growing region and et the positive effect of organic fertilization on yield and wue of winter wheat was greatest in the north china plain this could be because excessive use shallow saline groundwater for irrigation in the north china plain causes soil salinization ju et al 2007 ma et al 2008 thereby restricting crop yield increased soil organic matter content is beneficial to soil desalination li et al 2012 mavi et al 2012 we also found that the positive effect of organic fertilization on yield and wue of winter wheat decreased as et increased the results of this study suggest that organic fertilizer enabled winter wheat to use water more efficiently in relatively droughty environments organic fertilization has been shown to increase wheat drought tolerance leading greater wue under drought stress chen et al 2015 wang et al 2017b similar responses have been reported for maize xie et al 2019 the results of this study indicate that growing environments in northern china with et 500 mm are expected to experience the greatest improvement in wue with organic fertilizer application 4 4 response of winter wheat yield and wue to organic fertilization as affected by soil organic matter soil organic matter plays an important role as a pool of terrestrial carbon pan et al 2009 in ecosystem productivity in the functioning of agroecosystems loveland and webb 2003 and in cropland fertility tiessen et al 1994 previous studies consistently show that increases in soc from applying organic fertilizers to agricultural soils improves soil quality increases crop productivity and alleviates global warming lal 2004 shi et al 2016 knowledge of site specific factors affecting crop response to organic amendments could direct their application and result in the greatest advances in crop production fan et al 2005 liu et al 2013 this meta analysis shows that the positive effect of organic fertilizer on grain yield and wue of winter wheat was greatest at sites with som 1 4 indicating that application of organic fertilizer to infertile soils produced greater yield increases this may be due to greater improvements in soil water storage efficiency fan et al 2005 wang et al 2011 and soil fertility with organic fertilization in these conditions loveland and webb 2003 pan et al 2009 resulting in a greater increase in biomass accumulation and grain yield chen et al 2015 li et al 2012 mavi et al 2012 wang et al 2017b 4 5 response of winter wheat yield and wue as affected by n fertilizer rate nitrogen fertilizers are a fundamental component of cereal production hawkesford 2014 the combination of organic and inorganic fertilizer is common when organic fertilizers are used in china fan et al 2005 liu et al 2013 wang et al 2011 thus knowledge on optimization of synthetic n fertilizer use when organic fertilizer is applied and how this should vary based on site and growing environment is paramount for improving resource utilization efficiency and advancing sustainable intensification of cereal production this meta analysis shows that increases in grain yield and wue of winter wheat in response to organic fertilizer have not been proportional to n fertilizer input which is in agreement with previous studies shi et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 the positive effect of organic fertilizer on yield and wue of winter wheat was greatest in the absence of synthetic n fertilizer likely because organic fertilizer can supply n for wheat growth and development liu et al 2009 2013 previous studies on winter wheat production in china without organic fertilizer show that maximum grain yield occurred with n fertilizer applied at 250 kg n ha 1 wang et al 2018b yu and shi 2015 this meta analysis shows that grain yield peaked at 100 150 kg n ha 1 the results from this study indicate that integrated use of organic fertilizer and synthetic n fertilizer has the potential to reduce synthetic n input for winter wheat production by about 150 kg n ha 1 60 without affecting yield and wue organic fertilizer was relatively more effective at enhancing grain yield and wue in lower yielding environments consistent with the findings that these responses were greater at sites with 1 4 som this could be partially due to greater efficiency of organic fertilizer at improving soil fertility and crop yield on low and medium yielding soils liu et al 2013 maeder et al 2002 pan et al 2009 tiessen et al 1994 wang et al 2017b watson et al 2002 as a result of improvements in soil quality liu et al 2013 water storage fan et al 2005 wang et al 2011 and soil desalination li et al 2012 mavi et al 2012 4 6 response of winter wheat yield and yield stability to organic fertilization cereal production by most resource poor and subsistence farmers often depends on inherent soil fertility and is thus subject to great variability raseduzzaman and jensen 2017 an analysis of the major european crops produced from 1920 to 2000 showed that crops with a higher yield level had greater yield stability than lower yielding crops chloupek et al 2004 numerous studies have reported greater cereal productivity with organic fertilizer compared to without fan et al 2005 liu et al 2013 raseduzzaman and jensen 2017 rieux et al 2013 thomsen et al 2008 wang et al 2011 this productivity increase with organic fertilization could help to reduce yield variability and increase yield stability particularly for smallholder farmers this study shows that use of organic fertilizer contributed to greater winter wheat grain yield with less spatial and temporal variation in agreement with previous studies chloupek et al 2004 döring et al 2015 fan et al 2005 raseduzzaman and jensen 2017 high grain yield with organic fertilization could be partially attributed to slower release of nutrients from organic compared to control treatment thereby enhancing the synchrony between nutrient availability and crop nutrient uptake kramer et al 2002 5 conclusions this meta analysis based on reported field experiments conducted across a range of soils and growing environments in northern china shows that use of organic fertilizer increased winter wheat grain yield and wue and reduced spatial and temporal variability in yield without affecting et the yield response to organic fertilizer was dependent on method of application as nof and nlof substantially increased yield while nrof reduced yield the positive effect of organic fertilizer on grain yield and wue of winter wheat was greatest when yield levels was 4 0 mg ha 1 moreover organic fertilization was more effective at improving yield and wue in north china plain when synthetic n application was 150 kg n ha 1 and in growing environments with som 1 4 and et 500 mm these results highlight the potential of organic fertilizer to facilitate reduced n fertilizer input for winter wheat production while producing greater yield mitigating spatial and temporal yield variation and enhancing the efficiency of water resources with rational implementation this could serve as a cornerstone for sustainable intensification of cereal production and give rise to a second green revolution in agriculture declaration of competing interest the authors have declared that no competing interests exist

nitrogen n fertilizer is a key approach to increase crop yield especially for cereals teng et al 2015 wang et al 2018a although n fertilizer use for crop production has increased markedly improvements

with the neglect of organic fertilizers as a source of nutrients contribute to low n fertilizer use efficiency bao et al 2006 hawkesford 2014 excessive n application reduces risk of yield loss due to n deficiency and is a common practice in china wang et al 2018a this creates opportunity for farmers to reduce synthetic n fertilizer use without reducing grain yield hartmann et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 thus there is great interest in reducing synthetic n input for crop production rieux et al 2013 china has a long tradition of recycling organic nutrients in agriculture but this tradition is rapidly disappearing following intensification and specialization of agricultural production with increased use of synthetic fertilizers cui et al 2018 rieux et al 2013 wang et al 2007b china s excessive and inefficient use of synthetic fertilizers have contributed to its current harmful state of environmental pollution chen et al 2014 cui and shoemaker 2018 zhang et al 2008 with increasing concern about environmental protection the chinese government issued a policy of zero growth in synthetic n fertilizer use in 2015 xiong and wu 2017 thus improving crop yields while reducing synthetic fertilization are major goals in china recent studies have evaluated alternative fertilization strategies which utilize organic amendments such as livestock manure fan et al 2005 liu et al 2009 2013 wang et al 2017b green manure garcia franco et al 2015 and crop residues fan et al 2005 wang et al 2007b some research has shown that application of organic fertilizer i e livestock manure can be a sustainable practice for crop production due to its ability to recycle nutrients and enhance soil quality fan et al 2005 he et al 2010 kato and yamagishi 2011 liu et al 2009 2013 manna et al 2007 tiessen et al 1994 wang et al 2007a 2011 2017b xu et al 2009 while reducing environmental pollution fan et al 2005 sainju et al 2003 zhai et al 2011 other studies indicate that organic fertilizer reduces crop yield annett et al 2007 mäder et al 2002 mason et al 2007 seufert et al 2012 understanding the theoretical basis by which factors contribute to the discrepancy in crop yield response to organic fertilizer is key to advise the development and adoption of sustainable cropping systems winter wheat triticum aestivum l is an important crop in china where its planting area and grain production are second only to that of rice oryza sativa l wang et al 2018a winter wheat hectarage is concentrated in northern china often in semi arid environments and n is typically the most yield limiting nutrient for its production deng et al 2006 wang et al 2018b therefore knowledge of winter wheat grain yield and water use in response to organic fertilizer in china and how this is affected by site growing environment and agronomic management such as n fertilizer rate and method of organic fertilization is paramount for sustainable intensification of wheat production such knowledge could serve as a basis for sustainable production of other crops and a second green agriculture revolution li et al 2018 wang et al 2018b however a literature synthesis to understand the response of winter wheat yield evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue to organic fertilizer has not been conducted meta analysis provides a formal statistical method to compare and integrate the results of multiple studies to reveal underlying factors contributing to responses and make inferences on regional and global scales gurevitch and hedges 1999 the present study is a meta analysis of field experiments on winter wheat production in northern china that seeks answers to determine 1 how grain yield et and wue of winter wheat respond to organic fertilizer and whether this is influenced by growing region et som n fertilizer rate or yield level 2 how the method of organic fertilization affects winter wheat grain yield and 3 whether organic fertilizer application can reduce spatial and temporal variation in winter wheat yield we hypothesize that 1 organic fertilizer application will result in greater yield and wue without affecting et compared to without organic fertilizer 2 organic fertilization will be most effective at improving grain yield and wue in drier environments with lower levels of som n fertilizer input and yield level and 3 organic fertilization will reduce spatial and temporal variation in yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 data search and collection a search of peer reviewed publications was performed to collect data on the effects of organic fertilization i e livestock manure on yield and wue of sole cropped winter wheat grown in northern china data published in english were collected from the isi web of science http apps webofknowledge com and google scholar https xs glgoo net and data published in chinese were collected from the china national knowledge infrastructure http www cnki net and baidu scholar http xueshu baidu com the keywords used for the search were organic fertilizer and grain yield or wue and wheat the year of publication was not restricted but publications after july 2018 were not included to avoid distortions caused by publication selection the data chosen for use had to satisfy the following criteria 1 the field studies must include a treatment with organic fertilizer application and a without organic fertilizer control and 2 the means standard deviations or standard errors and sample sizes of the variables concerned must be directly available or amenable to being calculated from the data data were recorded by experimental year for publications reporting results from multi year experiments after scrutinizing the search results 776 observations from 177 studies conducted at 80 sites were selected for use

mongolia hubei xinjiang heilongjiang shandong and shanxi fig 2 geographic climate water regime and cropping system information for regions with experimental sites of winter wheat that were included in this meta analysis are in table 1 based on the method of organic fertilization the organic fertilizer treatment was classified into one of three categories 1 synthetic nitrogen fertilizer plus organic

replaced with organic nitrogen fertilizer at the same level of nitrogen nrof to explain variation in the response of winter wheat yield and wue to environmental and site conditions the following were obtained for each site year growing region et som content and n fertilizer rate some data i e som content unavailable in the peer reviewed publications were obtained from the china soil science

traditional rate 250 300 high and 300 kg ha 1 ultra high 2 2 statistical analysis data were analyzed using the methods of meta analysis described by curtis and wang 1998 hedges et al 1999 and wang et al 2017a the natural log lnr of the response ratio r was calculated as the effect size in this meta analysis representing the effect of organic fertilizer application using the following equations 1 r x t x c 2 l n r ln x t x c l n x t l n x c where xt is the mean of winter wheat yield et or wue in the organic fertilizer treatment and xc is the mean of winter wheat yield wue or et in the without organic fertilizer control if xt and xc are normally distributed and xc is unlikely to be negative then lnr is approximately normally distributed with a mean of approximately the true response log ratio the variance v of lnr was calculated using the following equation 3 v s t 2 n t x t 2 s c 2 n c x c 2 where st and sc are the standard deviations for all comparisons in the treatment and control groups respectively and nt and nc are the sample sizes for the treatment and control groups respectively several studies did not report values of standard deviations or standard error in these cases we calculated the average coefficient of variation within each data set and then back calculated the standard error from the average coefficient of variation weighted means were used since individual experiments often differ in their statistical precision curtis and wang 1998 the weighted mean log ratio ln r was used which produces the greatest precision minimum variance and was calculated using the following equations 4 l n r i 1 k w i l n r i i 1 k w i 5 w i 1 v i where the weighting factor wi is the reciprocal of the total variance of lnri curtis and wang 1998 a mixed or random effects model was employed to determine whether organic fertilizer application significantly affected each dependent variable using the statistical software metawin 2 1 systat software inc san jose ca with a resampling of 9999 iterations li et al 2018 rosenberg et al 2000 shcherbak et al 2014 wang et al 2017a inverse variance statistical methods were adopted for the meta analysis a random effect model was adopted in cases of high heterogeneity a chi square p value 0 05 we performed a kolmogorov smirnov test and determined that the distribution of yield wue and et is not normal p 0 001 fig 3 means and 95 confidence intervals ci on the estimated effect size were generated using the bootstrapping test i e sampling with replacement of the size equal to the initial size of the subset repeated n 9999 times for yield wue and et in the study as well as subgroups of yield wue and et shcherbak et al 2014 wang et al 2017a groups with fewer than two valid comparisons were excluded from the meta analysis to facilitate interpretation the percentage of change in winter wheat yield wue and et were calculated as ln r 1 100 if the 95 ci for a dependent variable did not overlap zero the effect of organic fertilizer application was considered significant means of the different categorical variables were considered significantly different from one another if their 95 bootstrapping cis did not overlap curtis and wang 1998 wang et al 2017a a positive percentage change indicated an increase in the respective variable with organic fertilizer relative to without organic fertilizer while a negative value indicated a decrease meta analysis assumes that studies are independent and free from publication bias and we considered this to be the case in the meta analysis reported here curtis and wang 1998 wang et al 2017a with meta analysis one can test whether categorical groups are homogeneous with respect to effect size i e that observed differences in lnr among studies are due to sampling error and whether there are significant differences in mean response between these groups we used the homogeneity statistic q an estimate of the among study variance to test whether variances were significantly different if p 0 05 tested against a chi square distribution then the data were considered to be heterogeneous and further analyzed by single factor categorical analysis curtis and wang 1998 wang et al 2017a when conducting categorical analyses total heterogeneity of effect size among studies qt was generated and partitioned into heterogeneity within categorical variables qw and heterogeneity between categorical variables qb such that qt qw qb comparison between categorical variables was examined by qb the frequency distribution of effect size was plotted and the frequency of effect size was fit to a gaussian distribution function to assess homogeneity of observations using sigmaplot v 12 5 software jandel scientific corte maders ca 3 results 3 1 overall response of winter wheat yield and wue to organic fertilization the frequency distribution of effect size was fit to a gaussian distribution function for yield et and wue of winter wheat li et al 2018 shan and yan 2013 the kolmogorov smirnov test indicated that the distribution of yield et and wue is not normal fig 3 the organic fertilizer application rate was about 30 75 mg ha 1 for nof and nlof and 10 22 5 mg ha 1 for nrof data not shown on average yield with organic fertilizer and without organic fertilizer was 5 4 and 4 6 mg ha 1 respectively et was 394 and 392 mm respectively and wue was 9 5 and 11 4 kg mm 1

significantly affect et 3 2 response of winter wheat yield and wue to organic fertilization as affected by growing region and et winter wheat yield and wue response to organic fertilizer application in china varied with growing region and et during the growing season figs 5 and 6 on average yield and wue were significantly increased with organic fertilizer compared to without organic fertilizer in different regions of northern china fig 5 the increase in yield with organic fertilizer was largest in the north china plain 33 followed by the northwest region 20 and the central plain irrigation region rice and winter wheat growing region and cold region 16 17 organic fertilizer significantly increased et of winter wheat in the central plain irrigation region decreased et in north china plain and northwest region and did not significantly affect et in the rice and winter wheat growing region fig 5b organic fertilizer significantly increased wue by 31 in the north china plain and by 16 18 in the northwest region central plain irrigation region and rice and winter wheat growing region fig 5c the effect of et on the response of winter wheat yield and wue to organic fertilizer was evaluated in this study since most observations of wue came from experiments in semi arid regions of china in these regions grain yield and wue of winter wheat are primarily limited by soil water deficit during spring growth and through grain filling because of high evaporation and erratic distribution of precipitation wang et al 2018a the positive effect organic fertilizer on yield decreased as et increased fig 6a the increase in yield with organic fertilizer was largest when et was 300 mm 26 followed by when et was 300 500 mm 17 and was least when et was 500 mm 8 the positive effect of organic fertilizer on wue was also influenced by et the largest increase in wue occurred when et was 300 mm 21 followed by when et was 300 500 mm 18 19 and was least when et was 500 mm 15 fig 6b 3 3 response of winter wheat yield and wue to organic fertilization as affected by soil organic matter soil organic matter content significantly affected the response of winter wheat yield and wue to organic fertilization in china fig 7 the positive effect of organic fertilizer on yield decreased with increased som fig 7a the increase in yield with organic fertilizer was greatest when som was 1 4 24 27 and least when som was 1 4 9 11 soil organic matter content did not significantly affect the response of winter wheat et to organic fertilizer fig 7b the response of winter wheat wue to organic fertilization varied among categories of som fig 7c the mean increase in wue with organic fertilizer ranged from 17 to 19 when som was 1 0 to 1 4 or 2 0 and was 11 for sites with 1 4 2 0 som 3 4 response of winter wheat yield and wue to organic fertilization as affected by n fertilizer rate yield et and wue of winter wheat in response to organic fertilization in northern china varied with n fertilizer rate fig 8 the positive effect of organic fertilization on winter wheat yield was influenced by n fertilizer rate fig 8a organic fertilizer increased wheat yield by 71 in the absence of synthetic n fertilizer application by 15 18 when synthetic n fertilizer was applied up to 300 kg n ha 1 and by 10 with synthetic n fertilization 300 kg n ha 1 organic fertilizer did not significantly affect et regardless of synthetic n fertilizer rate applied fig 8b the positive effect of organic fertilizer on wue of winter wheat was affected by synthetic n fertilizer rate fig 8c organic fertilizer increased wue by 41 in the absence of synthetic n fertilizer by 18 19 when synthetic n fertilizer was applied up to 150 kg n ha 1 or at 250 300 kg n ha 1 and by 11 13 when synthetic n fertilizer was applied at 150 250 kg ha 1 the effect of synthetic n fertilizer rate on the response of winter wheat yield and wue to organic fertilizer was assessed by yield level since the rate of synthetic n fertilization is commonly adjusted according to the expected yield of a growing environment wang et al 2018a b on average the positive effect organic fertilizer on yield and wue decreased as yield level increased fig 9 at low yield levels 4 0 mg ha 1 organic fertilizer increased yield by 88 in the absence of synthetic n fertilizer by 20 27 when synthetic n fertilizer was applied up to 300 kg ha 1 and by 7 when the synthetic n fertilizer rate exceeded 300 kg n ha 1 fig 9a at medium yield levels 4 0 5 5 mg ha 1 organic fertilizer increased yield by 44 in the absence of synthetic n fertilizer and by 15 18 with synthetic n fertilization fig 9d at high yield levels 5 5 mg ha 1 however the positive effect organic fertilizer on yield averaged 4 11 among levels of synthetic n fertilization fig 9g evapotranspiration of winter wheat in response to organic fertilizer varied with yield level at low yield levels 4 0 mg ha 1 organic fertilizer significantly reduced et in the absence of synthetic n fertilizer however organic fertilizer did not significantly affect et when synthetic n fertilizer was applied fig 9b at medium yield levels 4 0 5 5 mg ha 1 organic fertilizer reduced et by 4 13 when synthetic n fertilizer was applied at 0 100 or 150 200 kg n ha 1 increased et by 8 when synthetic n fertilizer was applied at 100 150 kg n ha 1 and did not significantly affect et in the absence of synthetic n fertilizer or when synthetic n fertilizer was applied at 200 250 kg n ha 1 fig 9e at high yield levels 5 5 mg ha 1 organic fertilizer did not significantly affect et when synthetic n fertilizer was applied at 100 250 kg n ha 1 fig 9h water use efficiency of winter wheat in response to organic fertilizer also varied with yield level at low yield levels 4 0 mg ha 1 organic fertilizer increased wue by an average of 16 21 among levels of synthetic n fertilization fig 9c at medium yield levels 4 0 5 5 mg ha 1 organic fertilizer increased wue by 10 14 in the absence of synthetic n fertilization or when synthetic n fertilizer was applied up to 200 kg n ha 1 but did not affect wue when synthetic n fertilizer was applied at 200 250 kg n ha 1 fig 9f at high yield levels 5 5 mg ha 1 organic fertilizer did not significantly affect wue of winter wheat when synthetic n fertilizer was applied at 100 150 or 200 250 kg n ha 1 and increased wue by an average of 9 when synthetic n fertilizer was applied at 150 200 kg n ha 1 fig 9i 3 5 response of winter wheat yield and yield variation to organic fertilization yield of winter wheat was significantly affected by method of organic fertilization fig 10 on average yield was 5 9 5 5 and 4 1 mg ha 1 for nof nlof and nrof respectively data not shown when organic fertilizer was applied yield was increased by 28 and 25 with the nlof and nof treatments respectively and was reduced by 11 with the nrof treatment fig 10 organic fertilization significantly influenced spatial and temporal variation in yield fig 11 on average the coefficient of variation across locations was 28 7 and 32 9 with organic fertilizer and without organic fertilizer respectively and the coefficient of variation across years was 11 8 and 14 3 with organic fertilizer and without organic fertilizer respectively data not shown based on these values organic fertilizer significantly reduced spatial and temporal variation in yield by an average of 11 and 23 respectively fig 11 4 discussion this study provides a systematic and quantitative analysis on the impacts of organic fertilization on the yields and wue of winter wheat in china based on literature search organic fertilization was the focus of this study because of its potential to improve soil quality reduce chemical fertilizer application and enhance resource utilization efficiency xiong and wu 2017 4 1 overall response of winter wheat yield and wue to organic fertilization this meta analysis confirmed that organic fertilization increased grain yield of winter wheat in northern china supporting our first hypothesis overall the use of organic fertilizer increased grain yield by 20 without affecting et thereby increasing wue as shown in previous studies fan et al 2005 liu et al 2013 wang et al 2011 2017b this could be due to organic fertilization increasing precipitation storage efficiency wang et al 2011 and alleviating soil water depletion liu et al 2013 chemical fertilization without organic fertilizer control can cause severe depletion of soil water in semi arid areas liu et al 2013 thus winter wheat with chemical fertilization might be insufficient to maintain high yield and wue wang et al 2011 2013 2018a this can be attributed to reduced soil evaporation with organic fertilization through increased crop canopy coverage chen et al 2015 satyanarayana et al 2002 wang et al 2018a li et al 1993 and transpiration wang et al 2018a zhang et al 1998 thereby enhancing biomass accumulation and ultimately increasing yield and wue however seufert et al 2012 found that organic fertilizer decreased wheat grain yield by 30 this discrepancy may be associated with differences in method of organic fertilization since some studies have evaluated organic fertilization as part of a low input cropping system i e a portion of n fertilizer replaced with organic fertilizer at the same level of n this slow n release pattern of organic n sources is attributed to the dependence of organic fertilizer on microbial decomposition and subsequent mineralization of n a process largely affected by climate kramer et al 2002 under these conditions the n source is usually a limiting factor for adequate crop uptake of n and grain yield rieux et al 2013 4 2 response of winter wheat yield to method of organic fertilization in this study the increase in yield compared to without organic fertilizer was greater with nlof than nof presumably due to excessive n input with nof hawkesford 2014 wang et al 2018a winter wheat yield was reduced with nrof likely because low available n with nrof was a limiting factor for crop uptake of n and grain yield wang et al 2018a similar responses have been reported in wheat annett et al 2007 mason et al 2007 rieux et al 2013 and legumes seufert et al 2012 these results suggest that combining reduced synthetic n fertilizer input with organic fertilization as a viable option for sustainable intensification of cereal production in northern china 4 3 response of winter wheat yield and wue to organic fertilization as affected by growing region and et the effect of organic fertilization on yield and wue of winter wheat were affected by growing region and et the positive effect of organic fertilization on yield and wue of winter wheat was greatest in the north china plain this could be because excessive use shallow saline groundwater for irrigation in the north china plain causes soil salinization ju et al 2007 ma et al 2008 thereby restricting crop yield increased soil organic matter content is beneficial to soil desalination li et al 2012 mavi et al 2012 we also found that the positive effect of organic fertilization on yield and wue of winter wheat decreased as et increased the results of this study suggest that organic fertilizer enabled winter wheat to use water more efficiently in relatively droughty environments organic fertilization has been shown to increase wheat drought tolerance leading greater wue under drought stress chen et al 2015 wang et al 2017b similar responses have been reported for maize xie et al 2019 the results of this study indicate that growing environments in northern china with et 500 mm are expected to experience the greatest improvement in wue with organic fertilizer application 4 4 response of winter wheat yield and wue to organic fertilization as affected by soil organic matter soil organic matter plays an important role as a pool of terrestrial carbon pan et al 2009 in ecosystem productivity in the functioning of agroecosystems loveland and webb 2003 and in cropland fertility tiessen et al 1994 previous studies consistently show that increases in soc from applying organic fertilizers to agricultural soils improves soil quality increases crop productivity and alleviates global warming lal 2004 shi et al 2016 knowledge of site specific factors affecting crop response to organic amendments could direct their application and result in the greatest advances in crop production fan et al 2005 liu et al 2013 this meta analysis shows that the positive effect of organic fertilizer on grain yield and wue of winter wheat was greatest at sites with som 1 4 indicating that application of organic fertilizer to infertile soils produced greater yield increases this may be due to greater improvements in soil water storage efficiency fan et al 2005 wang et al 2011 and soil fertility with organic fertilization in these conditions loveland and webb 2003 pan et al 2009 resulting in a greater increase in biomass accumulation and grain yield chen et al 2015 li et al 2012 mavi et al 2012 wang et al 2017b 4 5 response of winter wheat yield and wue as affected by n fertilizer rate nitrogen fertilizers are a fundamental component of cereal production hawkesford 2014 the combination of organic and inorganic fertilizer is common when organic fertilizers are used in china fan et al 2005 liu et al 2013 wang et al 2011 thus knowledge on optimization of synthetic n fertilizer use when organic fertilizer is applied and how this should vary based on site and growing environment is paramount for improving resource utilization efficiency and advancing sustainable intensification of cereal production this meta analysis shows that increases in grain yield and wue of winter wheat in response to organic fertilizer have not been proportional to n fertilizer input which is in agreement with previous studies shi et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 the positive effect of organic fertilizer on yield and wue of winter wheat was greatest in the absence of synthetic n fertilizer likely because organic fertilizer can supply n for wheat growth and development liu et al 2009 2013 previous studies on winter wheat production in china without organic fertilizer show that maximum grain yield occurred with n fertilizer applied at 250 kg n ha 1 wang et al 2018b yu and shi 2015 this meta analysis shows that grain yield peaked at 100 150 kg n ha 1 the results from this study indicate that integrated use of organic fertilizer and synthetic n fertilizer has the potential to reduce synthetic n input for winter wheat production by about 150 kg n ha 1 60 without affecting yield and wue organic fertilizer was relatively more effective at enhancing grain yield and wue in lower yielding environments consistent with the findings that these responses were greater at sites with 1 4 som this could be partially due to greater efficiency of organic fertilizer at improving soil fertility and crop yield on low and medium yielding soils liu et al 2013 maeder et al 2002 pan et al 2009 tiessen et al 1994 wang et al 2017b watson et al 2002 as a result of improvements in soil quality liu et al 2013 water storage fan et al 2005 wang et al 2011 and soil desalination li et al 2012 mavi et al 2012 4 6 response of winter wheat yield and yield stability to organic fertilization cereal production by most resource poor and subsistence farmers often depends on inherent soil fertility and is thus subject to great variability raseduzzaman and jensen 2017 an analysis of the major european crops produced from 1920 to 2000 showed that crops with a higher yield level had greater yield stability than lower yielding crops chloupek et al 2004 numerous studies have reported greater cereal productivity with organic fertilizer compared to without fan et al 2005 liu et al 2013 raseduzzaman and jensen 2017 rieux et al 2013 thomsen et al 2008 wang et al 2011 this productivity increase with organic fertilization could help to reduce yield variability and increase yield stability particularly for smallholder farmers this study shows that use of organic fertilizer contributed to greater winter wheat grain yield with less spatial and temporal variation in agreement with previous studies chloupek et al 2004 döring et al 2015 fan et al 2005 raseduzzaman and jensen 2017 high grain yield with organic fertilization could be partially attributed to slower release of nutrients from organic compared to control treatment thereby enhancing the synchrony between nutrient availability and crop nutrient uptake kramer et al 2002 5 conclusions this meta analysis based on reported field experiments conducted across a range of soils and growing environments in northern china shows that use of organic fertilizer increased winter wheat grain yield and wue and reduced spatial and temporal variability in yield without affecting et the yield response to organic fertilizer was dependent on method of application as nof and nlof substantially increased yield while nrof reduced yield the positive effect of organic fertilizer on grain yield and wue of winter wheat was greatest when yield levels was 4 0 mg ha 1 moreover organic fertilization was more effective at improving yield and wue in north china plain when synthetic n application was 150 kg n ha 1 and in growing environments with som 1 4 and et 500 mm these results highlight the potential of organic fertilizer to facilitate reduced n fertilizer input for winter wheat production while producing greater yield mitigating spatial and temporal yield variation and enhancing the efficiency of water resources with rational implementation this could serve as a cornerstone for sustainable intensification of cereal production and give rise to a second green revolution in agriculture declaration of competing interest the authors have declared that no competing interests exist

10774,soil parameters related to soil water holding capacity could play an important role in simulating winter wheat growth under severe soil water stress which could heavily influence the simulated soil water contents and then biomass and final yield in this study a field experiment of winter wheat triticum aestivum l was conducted in two consecutive growing seasons 2012 2014 under rainfall shelter in arid areas of china with the purpose to identify to what extent the soil parameters could influence the simulated output variables in the dssat ceres wheat model under water stress conditions the permanent wilting point pwp which were initially indirectly measured based on soil sampling were manually tuned through a trial and error method based on field observations of soil water content and aboveground biomass the results showed that the maximum advancing of maturity date was about five days under water stress conditions the stages of returning green and grain filling were critical periods for agricultural water management of winter wheat in arid areas the relative mean absolute error rmae of simulated and observed variables were almost all less than 20 when water stress occurred at the heading and grain filling stages however there were relatively large simulation errors when water stress occurred at the wintering and returning green stages in addition the ceres wheat model did not correctly simulate the discrepancies in phenology dates of winter wheat the overall averaged root mean square error of all treatments for total water storage in 0 100 cm soil layer and winter wheat biomass decreased to 0 3 mm and 750 kg ha 1 after manually tuning the initially indirectly measured value of pwp in general the ceres wheat model showed some limitations to simulate winter growth under complicated arid conditions meanwhile the measurement uncertainty in soil parameter pwp could introduce large simulation errors in simulating crop growth response to severe water stress conditions we suggest the soil parameter pwp should be more carefully calibrated based on relevant field observations since it is related to crop type and difficult to be directly and precisely measured in general it is necessary to further research into the responding mechanism and simulation of winter wheat growth to water stress in liable drought areas keywords winter wheat water stress permanent wilting point ceres wheat dssat 1 introduction winter wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the main staple crops in arid and semi arid regions of the northwest china however winter wheat production is constrained by increasingly tight water supplies shan et al 2002 therefore it is of great significance to define the growth response of winter wheat under different water stress periods and develop water saving measures for the sustainable production of winter wheat in this region water stress at different growth stages could have different kinds of influences on crop phenology and yields angus and moncur 1977 kang et al 2002 mcmaster and wilhelm 2003 the reduction of final yield is related not only to the intensity of water stress but also to crop growth stage cakir 2004 wang et al 2004 the stages of returning green and grain filling were critical periods for agricultural water management of winter wheat in arid areas therefore it is necessary to clarify the critical periods of water demand for agricultural water management of winter wheat in arid areas typically this kind of research usually depends on traditional field plot experiments whereas the results are usually site specific and may not be sufficiently extrapolated crop growth simulation models or crop models can predict crop yield based on environmental conditions and agricultural managements they are widely used to analyze the influential factors on the agricultural system help find the optimal management practices and provide technical guidance for decision support for farmers and decision makers antle et al 2016 jones et al 2016 crop growth simulation models are typically defined as mathematical representations of the reactions that occur within the plant and the interactions between the plant and its environment hammer et al 2006 the interactions within plant could include growth development photosynthesis assimilate partioning and yield formation the interactions might include unpredictable inputs future daily weather predictable inputs soil parameters and interventions e g planting date irrigation and application of fertilizer it is a multidisciplinary platform for agronomic research which involves plant physiology ecology agronomy agricultural meteorology and plant nutrition fertilizer science hammer et al 2006 jones et al 2003 so far main wheat growth simulation models include stics brisson et al 1998 afrcwheat2 porter et al 1993 ceres wheat ritchie and otter 1985 sirius jamieson et al 1998 sucros2 van laar et al 1992v and swheat van keulen and seligman 1987v etc the ceres wheat model a widely used wheat growth simulation model in the world has been applied in many types of application such as irrigation scheduling fertilizer management and influences of climate change on wheat production attia et al 2016 dettori et al 2011 thorp et al 2010 for example he et al 2013 applied the ceres wheat model to simulate the growth and development of spring wheat under different irrigation conditions in minqin county gansu province of china an optimal irrigation schedule was brought forward based on the results of model simulations in previous studies the ceres wheat model has also been used to simulate soil water dynamics eitzinger et al 2004 and wheat yields biernath et al 2011 under water stress conditions however there were some limitations for the ceres series model to simulate crop growth under water stress conditions for example nouna et al 2003 found that the values of leaf area index lai biomass and grain yield of maize were all underestimated under serious water stress this limitation was caused by the inaccurate estimation of evapotranspiration et under water stress which was also confirmed in the simulations with ceres maize model dejonge et al 2011 thus further research is needed to improve the ceres series model to simulate wheat growth under water stress at different growth stages it is very important to determine properly the soil parameters related to total available water which represented soil water holding capacity to correctly simulate et during the growing season campos et al 2016 total available water depended on effective root depth and the difference between soil water contents at field capacity and wilting point campos et al 2016 however it is usually difficult and expensive to directly measure the soil water content at permanent wilting point ghorbani et al 2017 rab et al 2011 which might heavily affect the simulation accuracy of ceres wheat model however most of the studies focused on the estimation of genetic coefficients or crop related parameters while soil parameters were generally directly measured in the experiment unfortunately direct measurements of soil parameters were usually difficult and expensive mohanty et al 2015 therefore soil parameters were often estimated through indirect methods such as class pedotransfer functions wösten et al 1995 multiple linear regression minasny et al 1999 extended nonlinear regression scheinost et al 1997 and artificial neural network pachepsky et al 1996 these indirect methods would introduce uncertainties in soil parameters and then in the simulated output variables unfortunately it is still not clear how large the simulation errors introduced by soil parameters could be in the simulation of winter wheat growth with the ceres wheat model in this study we used the experimental data of winter wheat growth under water stresses at different growth stages in two consecutive years 2012 2014 to analyze the influences of intensity and occurring stage of water stress on the growth and yield of winter wheat in arid areas of northwest china the objectives were 1 to study the response of winter wheat growth to water stress at two adjacent stages and explore the optimal irrigation dates and quotas 2 to evaluate the reliability of the ceres wheat model to simulate winter wheat growth and yield under different scenarios of water stress and 3 to identify to what extent the soil parameters could influence the simulated output variables in the ceres wheat model when under severe water stress conditions this study will provide a basis for scheduling deficit irrigation for winter wheat based on the ceres wheat model and also promote the application of ceres wheat model in other relevant studies of agro ecological system in arid and semi arid regions of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the field experiments were conducted in the irrigation station of the northwest a f university 34 17 n 108 04 e 506 m from 2012 to 2014 at yangling shaanxi province china this area belongs to semi arid regions in china with a typical temperate and monsoonal climate temporal distribution of local precipitations was uneven which makes it prone to develop seasonal droughts the long term average annual frost free days temperature sunshine and precipitation were 221 d 12 9 c 2196 h and 660 mm respectively the soil type of the experimental site was lou soil silt loam with a ph of 8 14 total organic carbon content of 8 20 g kg 1 and total nitrogen of 0 62 g kg 1 in the 0 20 cm soil layer 2 2 field experiments the winter wheat cultivar involved was xiaoyan 22 a popular wheat cultivar planted in the guanzhong plain where the experimental site is located the planting dates were oct 15th both in 2012 and 2013 dry wheat seeds were sown in drill with a planting depth of 5 6 cm row spacing of 25 cm and planting density of 4 106 plant ha 1 the harvest dates were jun 2nd in 2013 and jun 7th in 2014 the level of fertilization application was the same for all treatments with a base fertilizer of 140 kg n ha 1 and 50 kg p2o5 ha 1 but without top dressing a representative quadrat of 1 m2 was randomly selected and marked in each plot to determine the final yield which must not be disturbed during the whole growing season regular soil and plant sampling with three replicates should be conducted outside the square the experimental factors were irrigation level and water stress period the water requirements of winter wheat in the whole growth period were about 400 500 mm in this region this experiment was designed to have full irrigation treatment with a total amount of 400 mm irrigation as commonly practiced in the region there were two levels of reduced irrigation treatments i e 120 mm and 240 mm of total irrigation as we investigated the scenarios of two consecutive stages without irrigations within the five stages of wheat cropping season there were four possible irrigation schedules for each level of water stresses see table 1 therefore three irrigations of 40 mm and 80 mm each time were available for the reduced irrigation treatments of 120 mm and 240 mm respectively the whole growing season of winter wheat was divided into five different stages i e wintering returning green jointing heading and grain filling phenology was documented using the zadoks scale zadoks et al 1974 for example when the occurrence rate of jointed winter wheat was up to 50 this day was known as jointing stage water stress occurred at an individual stage might have relatively limited influences but water stress occurred at two adjacent stages might have more serious damage on wheat growth thus each water stress period included two adjacent growth stages i e wintering returning green d1 returning green jointing d2 jointing heading d3 and heading grain filling d4 consequently there were a total of eight treatments with three replicates for each of them table 1 a total of 24 plots following a split plot experimental design were arranged under a giant movable rainout shelter to exclude the influences of rainfall on experiments the area of each plot was 8 m2 adjacent plots were separated by polyethylene plastic films buried 1 5 m below soil surface to prevent subsurface water flow additionally a check treatment ck was arranged nearby which also had three replicates the irrigation method was border irrigation experimental design was the same for both two growing seasons 2 3 ceres wheat model description the ceres wheat model in the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat software is specific for the simulation of wheat growth jones et al 2003 it was embedded in the dssat csm cropping system model platform and was able to call the common modules of soil water nitrogen and carbon balances and the meteorological and soil databases the ceres wheat model simulates the development growth yield and carbon and water balances at a daily step jones et al 2016 2003 the processes simulated include solar radiation interception and photosynthesis of canopy nutrient uptake and activity of roots assimilate partitioning water uptake and transpiration growth and respiration leaf area expansion organ genesis and senescence field management etc the data required for running ceres wheat model usually include four types weather data soil data crop genetic coefficients and management information in the dssat model daily soil water balance was simulated with the one dimensional tipping bucket method ritchie 1985 1998 vertical soil water movement and root water uptake could be simulated for each soil layer potential water uptake was a function of root length density depth distribution and actual soil water content potential evapotranspiration et could be calculated either with the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 or with the fao56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 potential crop et was a function of crop leaf area index lai and et0 dssat implemented water stress factors of turfac eq 1 and swfac eq 2 to simulate the crop growth and development as followed anapalli et al 2008 1 turfac trwup rwue p 1 e p 0 2 swfac trwup e p 0 where turfac is the first water stress or turgor factor trwup is potential root water uptake e p 0 is the potential transpiration and rwue p 1 is a species specific parameter that is currently set to 1 5 for all dssat crops under well watered conditions potential root water uptake is higher than potential transpiration as the soil dries out because of root water uptake and surface evaporation potential root water uptake decreases at a certain stage a threshold is reached where the first water stress or turgor factor turfac eq 1 is activated fig 1 this level of water stress is mainly implemented to modulate expansive growth which in many cases is more sensitive to drought stress than the other growth and development processes when potential transpiration demand equals or exceeds the potential root water uptake a second stress factor swfac eq 2 is activated fig 1 ritchie et al 1998 the water stress factor swfac mainly affects growth and biomass related processes for winter wheat a drought stress might accelerate the development rate and shorten the days to flowering seed set or physiological maturity but it might decelerate the development rate for some other crops under non stress conditions both factors are set to 1 0 once the stress factors have been activated they decrease to a value less than 1 proportionally to the severity of difference between potential transpiration demand and potential extractable soil moisture 2 4 data for model application 2 4 1 weather data daily weather data of 2012 2014 were obtained from the national general weather station at yangling which was about 100 m away from the experimental site the daily data included sunshine hour h maximum temperature oc minimum temperature oc and precipitation mm fig 2 the values of precipitation were set to 0 0 mm since the experiment was conducted under the rainout shelter daily solar radiation was estimated based on sunshine hours and the angstrom equation eq 3 angstrom 1924 3 r s r max a s b s n n where r s is the daily total solar radiation mj m 2 r max is the daily extraterrestrial solar radiation on a horizontal surface mj m 2 n is the daily sunshine hours h n is the day length h a s and b s are two empirical coefficients which are related to atmospheric conditions and set as 0 25 and 0 50 as recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao 2 4 2 soil data soil physical properties of each layer were measured directly before the experiment soil texture was analyzed with the laser particle size analyzer topsizer zhuhai omec instruments co ltd china the parameters of permanent wilting point and field capacity were measured through an indirect method based on high speed centrifugation first the cutting ring method was used to collect soil sample for each 20 cm layer to a depth of 100 cm next each soil sample was soaked more than 48 h until completely saturated third the high speed centrifugation was used to obtain soil water content and soil water potential fourth the retention curve software in hydrus 2 was used to fit the van genuchten retention function van genuchten 1980v finally the values were derived indirectly for soil parameters of permanent wilting point soil water contents at 1500 kpa field capacity soil water contents at 10 kpa and saturation soil water contents at 0 kpa based on the retention function above however the parameter of permanent wilting point was influenced by crop species soil type and crop stage of growth norton and silvertooth 1998 this indirect measurement method would introduce uncertainties in its value and then in the simulated model output variables therefore permanent wilting point was then manually tuned again through a trial and error method based on field measured soil water content to measure soil water moisture soil samples were collected randomly at representative crop covering points in the plots with an auger at every 20 cm throughout a depth of 1 0 m the soils collected were mixed and then dried in an oven at a constant temperature of 105 for 24 h the volumetric soil water moisture was obtained by the multiplication of mass soil water moisture and soil bulk density the sampling frequency was once in two weeks before the jointing stage and then once a week thereafter 2 4 3 crop growth data as mentioned above a quadrat of 1 m2 was randomly selected and marked after emergence to represent the average growth status and determine the final yield of winter wheat in each plot for plant sampling a total of five representative plant samples of winter wheat were randomly collected outside the quadrat the plants were dried in an oven at a temperature of 75 for 48 h to a constant weight then the dry matter weights were measured to determine the aboveground biomass the plant sampling frequency was as the same as soil sampling after physiological maturity all of the wheat plants in each quadrat were harvested the dry matter biomass was measured as above the number of productive ears was counted the average grain number per ear was measured based on ten representative ears finally all of the sampled ears were threshed the grains were also dried in an oven at a constant temperature of 75 for 48 h dry matter grain yield and 1000 kernel weight or unit grain weight were then measured with an electronic scale 2 5 model calibration and verification the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue is a bayesian method for parameter estimation beven and binley 1992 he 2009 he et al 2010 the glue method assumed that in the case of large models with many parameters there was no exact inverse solution hence the estimation of a unique set of parameters which optimized a goodness of fit criterion given the observations was not possible the main principle of this method was to discretize the parameter space by generating many parameter values from the prior distribution likelihood values were then calculated for each parameter set using field observations probabilities an empirical posterior distribution of the parameters were calculated using bayes equation romanowicz and beven 2006 the glue approach is implemented as a package for automatic parameter estimation in dssat the fact that it was used to estimate the genetic coefficients related to the chinese winter wheat cultivar xiaoyan 22 must come later table 2 there were two rounds of model runs in current dssat glue package genetic coefficients related to crop phenology were estimated in the first round while coefficients related to crop growth in the second main procedures in each round of glue included 1 set up of prior distributions for genetic coefficients 2 generation of random parameter sets from the prior distributions 3 model runs with the random parameter sets 4 calculation of likelihood values and 5 construction of posterior distributions at least 3000 model runs were recommended in each round of glue to ensure that the genetic coefficients were each estimated accurately and the posterior distributions were reliable he 2008 however the current dssat glue program did not consider other parameters except for genetic coefficients related to crop cultivars the soil parameters especially those related to soil water holding capacity e g saturation field capacity and pwp were usually set as the measured values and seldom be estimated again whereas we found the pwp which is heavily dependent on crop types played an important role in simulating soil water contents and final yield under soil water stress thus this parameter had to be carefully estimated unfortunately there is no such an automatic tool available to estimate the soil parameters therefore pwp was manually tuned again through a trial and error method based on the comparisons between the simulated and measured soil water contents in different soil layers the ceres wheat model was then evaluated twice based on the indirectly measure and manually tuned soil parameters respectively in this study we used four kinds of model output and observation variables for parameter estimation and model verification including phenology anthesis and maturity dates unit grain weight final biomass and grain yield the data from the non stressed ck treatment in the two growing seasons were used for model calibration a final set of genetic coefficients was obtained after 20 000 models runs in each round of glue table 2 then the data from other rest treatments were used for model verification in which the measurements and simulations of concerned output variables were compared 2 6 statistical analysis two statistics of relative mean absolute error rmae and relative root mean square error rrmse between simulated and observed output variables were used to evaluate the results of model calibration and verification both statistics were able to measure the discrepancy between model simulations and field observation additionally they were dimensionless and could be used for the comparison between different output variables usually lower values of rmae and rrmse indicate higher accuracy of model simulation 4 r m a e 1 n i 1 n s i o i o i 100 5 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 6 r r m s e r m s e o 100 where s i is the i th simulated variable o i is the i

on plant heights different irrigation scenarios had no remarkable influences on plant heights of winter wheat under the irrigation level of i1 fig 3 a but there was some difference under i2 fig 3c generally the treatments of d3 water stress at jointing and heading stages 2012 2013 season and d4 water stress at heading and grain filling stages 2013 2014 season had the highest height while d1 water stress at wintering and returning green stages had the shortest height it can be concluded that irrigations at early vegetative growth stages could to some extent increase plant height of winter wheat larger irrigation amounts might lead to more increment this kind of trend was more obvious in the field experiment of 2013 2014 fig 3b and 3d either under irrigation i1 fig 3b or i2 fig 3d treatments of d4 water stress at heading and grain filling stages and d3 water stress at jointing and heading stages had relatively similarly higher plant heights while treatments of d2 water stress at returning green and jointing stages and d1 water stress at wintering and returning green stages shared relatively similarly shorter plant heights the comparisons above proved that irrigation at the returning green stage could remarkably increase the plant height of winter wheat in other words improve the vegetative growth of winter wheat compared with the ck treatments in the two seasons all treatments had shortened plant heights fig 3 plant heights increased slowly after returning green and then increased rapidly until the heading stage for instance it took about 130 days for winter wheat to grow from emergence to a height of 15 cm the average growth rate was only about 0 12 cm d 1 however it took only about 50 days from 15 cm to 75 cm with an average growth rate of 1 2 cm d 1 or about ten times of the former rate plant heights of xiaoyan 22 the winter wheat cultivar investigated in this study kept 70 80 cm after heading stage or 180 days after planting 3 1 2 influences on winter wheat biomass the above ground biomass values of all treatments were lower than those of ck treatments in the 2012 2013 growing season fig 4 a and 4c there were no obvious differences among the treatments for their biomass under irrigation level of i1 but treatment related to d1 water stress at wintering and returning green stages had slightly lower biomass than the other treatments when under i2 however the situation was more complicated in the 2013 2014 growing season compared with the ck treatment all treatments had lower biomass in the 2013 2014 growing season fig 4c and 4d when under irrigation level of i1 except ck treatments related to d1 water stress at wintering and returning green stages had the lowest biomass and followed by d2 water stress at returning green and jointing stages while treatments related to d3 water stress at jointing and heading stages and d4 water stress at heading and grain filling stages shared the similarly highest biomass when under i2 except ck the biomass of treatments related to d1 water stress at wintering and returning green stages were remarkably lower than the other treatments while there were no great differences among the treatments related to d2 water stress at returning green and jointing stages d3 water stress at jointing and heading stages and d4 water stress at heading and grain filling stages like plant height above ground biomass of all treatments showed similar growth pattern in both two seasons the biomass grew very slowly before jointing stage about 150 days after planting then increased rapidly until arriving at its maximum at the maturity stage 3 1 3 influences on winter wheat phenology different irrigation scenarios investigated in this study all had some influence on winter wheat phenology dates to varying degrees in both 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 seasons in the 2012 2013 season main phenology dates were almost the same for all treatments before the jointing stage without significant difference fig 5 a p 0 05 however later phenology dates e g heading anthesis grain filling and maturity changed significantly p 0 05 due to different irrigation scenarios for treatment i1d1 the later phenology dates were all earlier than the other treatments since the total irrigation was only 120 mm in the whole season and water stress occurred continuously in the wintering and returning green stages the maximum advancing of maturity date was about five days under the same irrigation level i1 or i2 the heading and anthesis dates of d1 d2 d3 and d4 were delayed one to three days respectively generally the heading and anthesis dates advanced more if water stress occurred earlier irrigation levels also had some influences on phenology dates the treatments related to irrigation level i1 were generally one to three days earlier than those related to i2 for their heading and anthesis dates it confirmed the phenomenon that serious water stress could bring forward the phenology dates before anthesis to various degrees for the ck treatment the heading anthesis grain filling and maturity dates were all later than those of the other treatments in the 2012 2013 season the maximum difference between heading dates could be as large as nine days fig 5a the same phenomena were also observed in the 2013 2014 season 3 1 4 influences on winter wheat yields different irrigation scenarios obviously influenced the yield components and grain yields of winter wheat both in the 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 seasons table 3 when under irrigation level of i1 in the 2012 2013 season the numbers of productive ears and grains per ear of treatments related to d3 water stress at jointing and heading stages and d4 water stress at heading and grain filling stages were all higher than those related to d1 water stress at wintering and returning green stages and d2 water stress at returning green and jointing stages however the values of 1000 kernel weight were lower than those related to d1 and d2 generally treatments related to d1 and d2 showed no great difference for their yields and yield components as well as d3 and d4 hence it could be concluded that returning green was the critical irrigation stage for productive ears grains per ear and final yield while heading was the critical irrigation stage for 1000 kernel weight of winter wheat treatments of i1d3 and i1d1 obtained the maximum and minimum grain yields respectively the same phenomena were also observed under the irrigation level of i2 compared with the 2012 2013 season the experimental results of 2013 2014 were different to some extent since the values of productive ears grains per ear and final yields of almost all treatments were lower than the last season this was because the soil water contents were relatively low before sowing in the 2013 2014 season which led to insufficient water available for the vegetative growth before jointing stage both under i1 and i2 the values of productive ears grains per ear and 1000 kernel weight of treatments related to d3 water stress at jointing and heading stages and d4 water stress at heading and grain filling stages were close to each other but all higher than those related to d1 water stress at wintering and returning green stages and d2 water stress at returning green and jointing stages this trend agreed with the experimental results of 2012 2013 seasons either under i1 or i2 the treatments related to d1 water stress at wintering and returning green stages all gave the lowest yields or only 66 and 67 of the highest yields obtained by i1d3 and i2d2 3 2 simulation of winter wheat growth and yield under different irrigation scenarios 3 2 1 model calibration and verification with the glue estimated genetic coefficients table 2 and indirectly measured soil parameters table 4 the simulated and observed anthesis and maturity dates were almost the same with relative mean absolute error rmae of only 0 52 and 0 21 for the model calibration process table 5 the simulation accuracy of biomass and grain yield was also high with rmae values of 6 48 and 4 22 whereas the accuracy of unit weight simulation was relatively low with an rmae of greater than 10 for the model verification process the simulation accuracy of anthesis and maturity dates was 2 09 and 2 20 however the simulated anthesis and maturity dates were exactly the same for different treatments in each year while observed dates were different because of various water stress scenarios the simulation accuracy of unit grain weight biomass and grain yield was relatively poor especially for the treatments with water stress at heading and grain filling stages the rmae values of output variables concerned were all greater than 20 in contrast to grain yield biomass was poorly simulated when water stress occurred at returning green stage for example the rmae values of treatment related to d1 water stress at wintering and returning green stages and d2 water stress at returning green and jointing stages were all greater than 30 and 20 respectively this indicated that water stress before jointing could have great influences on model simulation of biomass and grain yield generally the values of overall average rmae and rrmse were all about 5 for the calibration processes and above 15 for the calibration processes 3 2 2 comparisons of time series output variables under indirectly measured soil parameters the ceres wheat model was run with the indirectly measured soil parameters i e permanent wilting point and field capacity glue estimated genetic coefficients and the relevant input data of 2012 2013 growing season the simulated dynamics of winter wheat biomass and soil water contents were compared among different treatments figs 6 8 roots of winter wheat mainly concentrated in the 0 80 cm soil profile and the 0 40 cm soil layer usually contained the majority of the root lengths and had a large root length density wang et al 2006 in addition soil water contents of 0 20 cm layer changed greatly and had a great potential influence on crop growth thus only the soil water dynamics of 0 20 cm layer was presented for the sake of brevity when sufficient irrigation was applied the dynamics of winter wheat biomass and soil moisture of ck treatment could all be accurately simulated fig 6 during the 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 growing seasons the determination coefficient r 2 and root mean square rmse between simulation and observation of biomass were 0 98 0 97 and 1 144 1 490 kg ha 1 respectively and they were 0 45 0 81 r 2 and 0 05 0 03 cm3 cm 3 rmse for soil moisture in the 0 20 cm layer generally the simulation accuracy of biomass was higher than soil moisture fig 6a but the main trend of soil water dynamics was correct since most simulations matched the corresponding observations fig 6b thus it could be concluded that the ceres wheat model was able to correctly simulate the dynamics of winter wheat biomass and soil moisture when there was sufficient irrigation water however when under different scenarios of soil water stress the simulated dynamics of biomass and soil moisture varied greatly figs 7 and 8 either under i1 or i2 if there were continuous water stress at early vegetative stages e g d1 and d2 there would be great errors in simulated biomass after jointing stage since simulations were lower than observations fig 7a b e and f this indicated that the ceres wheat model overestimated the inhibition of winter wheat growth by soil water stress at returning green stage with the delay of water stress the simulation of winter wheat biomass gradually improved if water stress occurred at the heading and grain filling stages d4 model simulated and observed results were close to each other fig 7d and h in this case the ceres wheat was able to correctly simulate winter wheat growth with water stress at later growth stages for soil moisture at the 0 20 cm layer the simulation errors would become larger with the increase of soil water stress the simulation accuracies under irrigation level of i1 fig 8a d were generally lower that those under i2 fig 8e h when under the same irrigation level of i1 if water stress occurred at early stage of winter wheat growth simulated soil moisture was usually lower than the observations in other words the model underestimated soil moistures at this stage or overestimated the level of soil water stress which probably mainly contributed to the great errors in biomass simulation fig 8a b e and f however with the delay of water stress the simulation accuracy of soil moisture gradually improved when water stress occurred at the heading and grain filling stages d4 the simulations and observations matched very well fig 8d and h which confirmed once again that the ceres wheat model was able to correctly simulate soil water content when water stress occurred at later growth stages 3 2 3 comparisons of time series output variables under manually tuned soil parameters with the manually tuned soil parameters and glue estimated genetic coefficients the simulated dynamics soil water contents simulated 2 were compared among different treatments at the 0 20 cm layer fig 9 through slightly adjusting the values of permanent wilting point and increasing field capacity table 4 the simulation accuracy was greatly improved for each treatment most simulated values matched the corresponding observations fig 9 thus it was concluded that the ceres wheat model was able to correctly simulate soil moisture under different irrigation scenarios if the soil parameters related to water holing capacity could be correctly estimated to further verify the influences of soil parameters of permanent wilting point the simulated dynamics of total water storage in the 0 100 cm soil profile fig 10 and winter wheat biomass fig 11 were compared among different treatments based on initial indirectly measured simulated 1 and new manually tuned soil parameters simulated 2 the simulation accuracies of total water storage were improved under both two irrigation levels after manually tuning the soil parameters fig 10 the improved simulation accuracies were generally higher under i2 than those under i1 for each treatment the simulation accuracy was improved obviously after 160 d day after sowing the general rmse values decreased by 3 3 0 1 0 6 1 0 0 5 0 4 1 1 0 7 mm for treatments i1d1 i1d2 i1d3 i1d4 i2d1 i2d2 i2d3 and i2d4 when compared to results simulated with initial indirect soil parameters and glue based genetic coefficients or simulated 1 respectively the overall mean rmse of all treatments decreased to 0 3 mm for different treatments the simulation accuracies decreased or increased to different extents after changing the soil parameters in addition simulated total water storage was usually lower than the observations under the same irrigation level of i1 in other words the model overestimated the level of soil water stress which might contributed to the errors in biomass simulation both under i1 and i2 the simulation accuracies of aboveground biomass were improved for almost all of the treatments after manually tuning the soil parameters fig 11 the improved simulation accuracies under i2 were higher than those under i1 for each treatment the simulation accuracies were improved obviously after 160 d day after sowing especially under irrigation level of i2 the general rmse values decreased by 1475 678 363 352 1605 1411 645 530 kg ha 1 for treatments i1d1 i1d2 i1d3 i1d4 i2d1 i2d2 i2d3 and i2d4 when compared to the results of simulated 1 respectively the simulation accuracy of i2d4 became slightly lower after manually tuning the soil parameters the overall mean rmse value decreased 750 kg ha 1 thus the simulation accuracy was improved greatly under different water stress conditions after manually tuning the soil parameters of permanent wilting point and field capacity 4 discussions 4 1 influences of different irrigation scenarios on winter wheat growth different irrigation scenarios investigated in this study showed remarkable influences on plant height and aboveground biomass of winter wheat field observations showed that soil water stress during wintering or returning green stage led to a decrease both in plant height and biomass this indicated that serious and continuous water stress at early vegetative stages could heavily reduce aboveground biomass of winter wheat which could not even be offset by later irrigations thus an irrigation at the wintering or returning green stage could alleviate the inhibition of water stress on plant growth and increase plant height and aboveground biomass of winter wheat in the guanzhong plain of china different irrigation scenarios showed remarkable influences on the phenology of winter wheat especially after the jointing stage low irrigation level could advance the maturity date up to three days earlier and more serious soil water stress would advance winter wheat phenology even more which was consistent with the finding by mavromatis 2014 winter wheat grain yields depends on the grain number and on the remobilization of the pre flowering reserve as well as on the photosynthesis occurring during the grain filling period artru et al 2018 bijanzadeh and emam 2010 meanwhile the dependent factors could be influenced by irrigation depth water stress period and their interaction both under irrigation levels of i1 and i2 soil water stress could heavily influence productive ears grains per ear unit grain weight and final grain yield continuous water stress at both wintering and returning green stages i1d1 led to a very low grain yield when continuous water stress occurred at jointing and heading stages i1d3 the highest grain yield was obtained since irrigations before jointing could guarantee the normal growth of winter wheat however unit grain weight was relatively low since water stress negatively influenced the early process of grain filling the treatment i2d2 water stress at returning green and jointing stages obtained the highest yield because of sufficient irrigation at wintering stage to meet the crop water requirements of vegetative growth two more irrigations at heading and grain filling stages increased the number of productive ears grains per ear and unit grain weight this was different with the research which found that moderate water deficit during grain filling resulting in greater grain yield zhang et al 2008 generally an irrigation at jointing could obviously increase productive ears while irrigations at heading and grain filling could markedly increase grains per ear and unit gain weight which was consistent with the study done by bakhsh et al 2013 in this study we found returning green was the critical stage for winter wheat irrigation however some other studies showed that the critical period of water requirement of winter wheat was from jointing to heading ji et al 2014 thorp 2007 the difference was mainly because previous studies were performed in open fields where rainfall could confound the results due to additional unintended water input however this current study was conducted strictly under rainfall shelter almost without any precipitation input thus soil moisture before sowing became very low and the influence of irrigation at early vegetative stage increased obviously winter wheat plants suffered longtime soil water stress in the treatments without irrigation at seedling from emergence to jointing the crop could not recover its normal growth even with sufficient irrigation at later stages and finally had very poor yields this confirmed once again that irrigation at returning green stage was crucial for a stable grain yield of winter wheat 4 2 influences of soil parameters related to water holding capacity on simulation accuracy although we found that there were only some small differences between initial indirectly measured and new manually tuned values of soil parameters of permanent wilting point table 4 the simulation accuracies of soil water contents were improved greatly in this study after using the manually tuned soil parameters instead fig 9 this also resulted in higher simulation accuracies for total water storage and biomass figs 10 and 11 therefore it could be concluded that soil parameters related to soil water holding capacity i e permanent wilting point played a very important role in simulating winter wheat growth under soil water stress conditions however permanent wilting point is very difficult to be measured directly in practice it is more functionally defined as the point at which plants wilt and do not recover overnight taiz and zeiger 1991 crop species soil type and crop stage of growth all can affect the measured values of permanent wilting point norton and silvertooth 1998 although permanent wilting point can be measured by some indirect methods this would bring large uncertainty in parameter value and finally introduce large simulation errors due to the uncertainties in indirectly measured values of permanent wilting point simulated plant available soil water which was defined as the difference between field capacity and permanent wilting point was also uncertain thus there could be some big errors in simulated biomass and yields caused only by some small differences in the values of relevant soil parameters generally we suggested that the soil parameters related to water holding capacity played a very important role in simulating winter wheat growth when under severe soil water stress hence these soil parameters should be measured more directly and accurately and need to be further tuned based on field observations when simulating crop growth under serious water stress conditions 4 3 evaluation of the ceres wheat model in arid conditions generally the ceres wheat model was able to correctly simulate the growth and yield of winter wheat with sufficient water supply and the simulation accuracy was relatively high which was in agreement with some previous studies dettori et al 2011 langensiepen et al 2008 pecetti and hollington 1997 thorp et al 2010 however when there were different scenarios of soil water stress the simulation accuracy would change a lot for phenology unit grain weight aboveground biomass and grain yield when water stress occurred at the early vegetative stage the simulation accuracy of the ceres wheat model became low it usually simulated phenology dates earlier and overestimated unit grain weight but underestimated final biomass and grain yield at the same time it also underestimated the soil moisture at the early growth stages which was probably one of the main reasons for the low simulated biomass and grain yield when water stress occurred at later growth stages the simulation accuracy of the ceres wheat model improved a lot but still had some kinds of errors for example for treatments related to d4 water stress at heading and grain filling stages in the 2013 2014 season the model seriously underestimated the unit grain weight of winter wheat rmae 40 either under irrigation level i1 or i2 in general the ceres wheat model could simulate winter wheat growth with water stress at later growth stages more accurately than the growth with water stress at early stages different reasons might contribute to such kind of simulation errors nouna et al 2003 explored the reasons for the low accuracy of ceres wheat model under water stress first they found the model did not sufficiently simulate leaf area index lai in the whole season next the water stress index calculated in the model did not consider the actual situation in field experiments dejonge et al 2012 suggested that the simulation accuracy of evapotranspiration et should be increased first if the ceres series models should be improved to simulate crop growth under water stress since the water stress indices in the model were directly related to et values while previous methods for evaluating et using a static crop coefficient have worked well for studies under non stressed water conditions few studies have emphasized et accumulation under water stress therefore they provided a new equation that calculates a dynamic crop coefficient as a function of lai in addition some studies found that moderate water stress could stimulate the growth of roots of wheat seedling and increase the root shoot ratio whereas serious water stress could inhibit root growth and decrease root activity sun et al 2003 in some treatments of this study water stress continuously occurred at wintering and returning green stages longtime water stress seriously retarded the growth of wheat roots thus we suggest that an additional water stress index should be added in the ceres wheat model to take account of the complicated relationship between water stress and root growth and to improve the simulation accuracy of wheat growth under water stress at seedling stage the ceres wheat model gave the same simulations of anthesis and maturity dates for different irrigation scenarios which contradicted the observations in other words the current ceres wheat model was unable to simulate the phenology discrepancy caused by soil water stress this was because the phenology simulation in the current model was mainly based on meteorological factors such as temperature and photoperiod without consideration of the secondary influence of water and nutrient stress mcmaster et al 2008 additionally travasso and delecolle 1995 pointed out that current ceres wheat model used air temperature in phenology prediction rather than actual temperature in crop canopy in general the current ceres wheat model had some drawbacks in phenology prediction for winter wheat growth under serious water stress 5 conclusions the experimental results showed that irrigation before jointing was necessary to reduce the inhibition of water stress on plant growth to guarantee higher plant height and aboveground biomass serious and early water stress could advance the phenology dates of winter wheat the returning green and grain filling stages were proved to be critical periods for field water management generally the ceres wheat model could simulate winter wheat growth under water stress at later reproductive stages better than the growth under water stress before jointing stages the current ceres wheat model was not able to simulate the phenology discrepancies caused by different water stress scenarios the simulation accuracies of dynamics of water contents in 0 20 cm soil layer and winter wheat biomass all improved greatly after manually tuning the initially indirectly measured soil value of permanent wilting point generally soil parameters related to soil water holding capacity played an important role in simulating winter wheat growth under severe soil water stress in general the ceres wheat model proved to have some drawbacks to simulate winter wheat growth under complicated scenarios of soil water stress to be effectively applied in winter wheat management in arid and semi arid regions of china we suggest the current ceres wheat model should be further validated modified and improved the influences on winter wheat growth by water stress at seedling stages must be well understood and quantified especially the influences on root system additionally the secondary influence of water stress on wheat phenology should also be considered in the new phenology algorithm

10774,soil parameters related to soil water holding capacity could play an important role in simulating winter wheat growth under severe soil water stress which could heavily influence the simulated soil water contents and then biomass and final yield in this study a field experiment of winter wheat triticum aestivum l was conducted in two consecutive growing seasons 2012 2014 under rainfall shelter in arid areas of china with the purpose to identify to what extent the soil parameters could influence the simulated output variables in the dssat ceres wheat model under water stress conditions the permanent wilting point pwp which were initially indirectly measured based on soil sampling were manually tuned through a trial and error method based on field observations of soil water content and aboveground biomass the results showed that the maximum advancing of maturity date was about five days under water stress conditions the stages of returning green and grain filling were critical periods for agricultural water management of winter wheat in arid areas the relative mean absolute error rmae of simulated and observed variables were almost all less than 20 when water stress occurred at the heading and grain filling stages however there were relatively large simulation errors when water stress occurred at the wintering and returning green stages in addition the ceres wheat model did not correctly simulate the discrepancies in phenology dates of winter wheat the overall averaged root mean square error of all treatments for total water storage in 0 100 cm soil layer and winter wheat biomass decreased to 0 3 mm and 750 kg ha 1 after manually tuning the initially indirectly measured value of pwp in general the ceres wheat model showed some limitations to simulate winter growth under complicated arid conditions meanwhile the measurement uncertainty in soil parameter pwp could introduce large simulation errors in simulating crop growth response to severe water stress conditions we suggest the soil parameter pwp should be more carefully calibrated based on relevant field observations since it is related to crop type and difficult to be directly and precisely measured in general it is necessary to further research into the responding mechanism and simulation of winter wheat growth to water stress in liable drought areas keywords winter wheat water stress permanent wilting point ceres wheat dssat 1 introduction winter wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the main staple crops in arid and semi arid regions of the northwest china however winter wheat production is constrained by increasingly tight water supplies shan et al 2002 therefore it is of great significance to define the growth response of winter wheat under different water stress periods and develop water saving measures for the sustainable production of winter wheat in this region water stress at different growth stages could have different kinds of influences on crop phenology and yields angus and moncur 1977 kang et al 2002 mcmaster and wilhelm 2003 the reduction of final yield is related not only to the intensity of water stress but also to crop growth stage cakir 2004 wang et al 2004 the stages of returning green and grain filling were critical periods for agricultural water management of winter wheat in arid areas therefore it is necessary to clarify the critical periods of water demand for agricultural water management of winter wheat in arid areas typically this kind of research usually depends on traditional field plot experiments whereas the results are usually site specific and may not be sufficiently extrapolated crop growth simulation models or crop models can predict crop yield based on environmental conditions and agricultural managements they are widely used to analyze the influential factors on the agricultural system help find the optimal management practices and provide technical guidance for decision support for

swheat van keulen and seligman 1987v etc the ceres wheat model a widely used wheat growth simulation model in the world has been applied in many types of application such as irrigation scheduling fertilizer management and influences of climate change on wheat production attia et al 2016 dettori et al 2011 thorp et al 2010 for example he et al 2013 applied the ceres wheat model to simulate the growth and development of spring wheat under different irrigation conditions in minqin county gansu province of china an optimal irrigation schedule was brought forward based on the results of model simulations in previous studies the ceres wheat model has also been used to simulate soil water dynamics eitzinger et al 2004 and wheat yields biernath et al 2011 under water stress conditions however there were some limitations for the ceres series model to simulate crop growth under water stress conditions for example nouna et al 2003 found that the values of leaf area index lai biomass and grain yield of maize were all underestimated under serious water stress this limitation was caused by the inaccurate estimation of evapotranspiration et under water stress which was also confirmed in the simulations with ceres maize model dejonge et al 2011 thus further research is needed to improve the ceres series model to simulate wheat growth under water stress at different growth stages it is very important to determine properly the soil parameters related to total available water which represented soil water holding capacity to correctly simulate et during the growing season campos et al 2016 total available water depended on effective root depth and the difference between soil water contents at field capacity and wilting point campos et al 2016 however it is usually difficult and expensive to directly measure the soil water content at permanent wilting point ghorbani et al 2017 rab et al 2011 which might heavily affect the simulation accuracy of ceres wheat model however most of the studies focused on the estimation of genetic coefficients or crop related parameters while soil parameters were generally directly measured in the experiment unfortunately direct measurements of soil parameters were usually difficult and expensive mohanty et al 2015 therefore soil parameters were often estimated through indirect methods such as class pedotransfer functions wösten et al 1995 multiple linear regression minasny et al 1999 extended nonlinear regression scheinost et al 1997 and artificial neural network pachepsky et al 1996 these indirect methods would introduce uncertainties in soil parameters and then in the simulated output variables unfortunately it is still not clear how large the simulation errors introduced by soil parameters could be in the simulation of winter wheat growth with the ceres wheat model in this study we used the experimental data of winter wheat growth under water stresses at different growth stages in two consecutive years 2012 2014 to analyze the influences of intensity and occurring stage of water stress on the growth and yield of winter wheat in arid areas of northwest china the objectives were 1 to study the response of winter wheat growth to water stress at two adjacent stages and explore the optimal irrigation dates and quotas 2 to evaluate the reliability of the ceres wheat model to simulate winter wheat growth and yield under different scenarios of water stress and 3 to identify to what extent the soil parameters could influence the simulated output variables in the ceres wheat model when under severe water stress conditions this study will provide a basis for scheduling deficit irrigation for winter wheat based on the ceres wheat model and also promote the application of ceres wheat model in other relevant studies of agro ecological system in arid and semi arid regions of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the field experiments were conducted in the irrigation station of the northwest a f university 34 17 n 108 04 e 506 m from 2012 to 2014 at yangling shaanxi province china this area belongs to semi arid regions in china with a typical temperate and monsoonal climate temporal distribution of local precipitations was uneven which makes it prone to develop seasonal droughts the long term average annual frost free days temperature sunshine and precipitation were 221 d 12 9 c 2196 h and 660 mm respectively the soil type of the experimental site was lou soil silt loam with a ph of 8 14 total organic carbon content of 8 20 g kg 1 and total nitrogen of 0 62 g kg 1 in the 0 20 cm soil layer 2 2 field experiments the winter wheat cultivar involved was xiaoyan 22 a popular wheat cultivar planted in the guanzhong plain where the experimental site is located the planting dates were oct 15th both in 2012 and 2013 dry wheat seeds were sown in drill with a planting depth of 5 6 cm row spacing of 25 cm and planting density of 4 106 plant ha 1 the harvest dates were jun 2nd in 2013 and jun 7th in 2014 the level of fertilization application was the same for all treatments with a base fertilizer of 140 kg n ha 1 and 50 kg p2o5 ha 1 but without top dressing a representative quadrat of 1 m2 was randomly selected and marked in each plot to determine the final yield which must not be disturbed during the whole growing season regular soil and plant sampling with three replicates should be conducted outside the square the experimental factors were irrigation level and water stress period the water requirements of winter wheat in the whole growth period were about 400 500 mm in this region this experiment was designed to have full irrigation treatment with a total amount of 400 mm irrigation as commonly practiced in the region there were two levels of reduced irrigation treatments i e 120 mm and 240 mm of total irrigation as we investigated the scenarios of two consecutive stages without irrigations within the five stages of wheat cropping season there were four possible irrigation schedules for each level of water stresses see table 1 therefore three irrigations of 40 mm and 80 mm each time were available for the reduced irrigation treatments of 120 mm and 240 mm respectively the whole growing season of winter wheat was divided into five different stages i e wintering returning green jointing heading and grain filling phenology was documented using the zadoks scale zadoks et al 1974 for example when the occurrence rate of jointed winter wheat was up to 50 this day was known as jointing stage water stress occurred at an individual stage might have relatively limited influences but water stress occurred at two adjacent stages might have more serious damage on wheat growth thus each water stress period included two adjacent growth stages i e wintering returning green d1 returning green jointing d2 jointing heading d3 and heading grain filling d4 consequently there were a total of eight treatments with three replicates for each of them table 1 a total of 24 plots following a split plot experimental design were arranged under a giant movable rainout shelter to exclude the influences of rainfall on experiments the area of each plot was 8 m2 adjacent plots were separated by polyethylene plastic films buried 1 5 m below soil surface to prevent subsurface water flow additionally a check treatment ck was arranged nearby which also had three replicates the irrigation method was border irrigation experimental design was the same for both two growing seasons 2 3 ceres wheat model description the ceres wheat model in the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat software is specific for the simulation of wheat growth jones et al 2003 it was embedded in the dssat csm cropping system model platform and was able to call the common modules of soil water nitrogen and carbon balances and the meteorological and soil databases the ceres wheat model simulates the development growth yield and carbon and water balances at a daily step jones et al 2016 2003 the processes simulated include solar radiation interception and photosynthesis of canopy nutrient uptake and activity of roots assimilate partitioning water uptake and transpiration growth and respiration leaf area expansion organ genesis and senescence field management etc the data required for running ceres wheat model usually include four types weather data soil data crop genetic coefficients and management information in the dssat model daily soil water balance was simulated with the one dimensional tipping bucket method ritchie 1985 1998 vertical soil water movement and root water uptake could be simulated for each soil layer potential water uptake was a function of root length density depth distribution and actual soil water content potential evapotranspiration et could be calculated either with the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 or with the fao56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 potential crop et was a function of crop leaf area index lai and et0 dssat implemented water stress factors of turfac eq 1 and swfac eq 2 to simulate the crop growth and development as followed anapalli et al 2008 1 turfac trwup rwue p 1 e p 0 2 swfac trwup e p 0 where turfac is the first water stress or turgor factor trwup is potential root water uptake e p 0 is the potential transpiration and rwue p 1 is a species specific parameter that is currently set to 1 5 for all dssat crops under well watered conditions potential root water uptake is higher than potential transpiration as the soil dries out because of root water uptake and surface evaporation potential root water uptake decreases at a certain stage a threshold is reached where the first water stress or turgor factor turfac eq 1 is activated fig 1 this level of water stress is mainly implemented to modulate expansive growth which in many cases is more sensitive to drought stress than the other growth and development processes when potential transpiration demand equals or exceeds the potential root water uptake a second stress factor swfac eq 2 is activated fig 1 ritchie et al 1998 the water stress factor swfac mainly affects growth and biomass related processes for winter wheat a drought stress might accelerate the development rate and shorten the days to flowering seed set or physiological maturity but it might decelerate the development rate for some other crops under non stress conditions both factors are set to 1 0 once the stress factors have been activated they decrease to a value less than 1 proportionally to the severity of difference between potential transpiration demand and potential extractable soil moisture 2 4 data for model application 2 4 1 weather data daily weather data of 2012 2014 were obtained from the national general weather station at yangling which was about 100 m away from the experimental site the daily data included sunshine hour h maximum temperature oc minimum temperature oc and precipitation mm fig 2 the values of precipitation were set to 0 0 mm since the experiment was conducted under the rainout shelter daily solar radiation was estimated based on sunshine hours and the angstrom equation eq 3 angstrom 1924 3 r s r max a s b s n n where r s is the daily total solar radiation mj m 2 r max is the daily extraterrestrial solar radiation on a horizontal surface mj m 2 n is the daily sunshine hours h n is the day length h a s and b s are two empirical coefficients which are related to atmospheric conditions and set as 0 25 and 0 50 as recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao 2 4 2 soil data soil physical properties of each layer were measured directly before the experiment soil texture was analyzed with the laser particle size analyzer topsizer zhuhai omec instruments co ltd china the parameters of permanent wilting point and field capacity were measured through an indirect method based on high speed centrifugation first the cutting ring method was used to collect soil sample for each 20 cm layer to a depth of 100 cm next each soil sample was soaked more than 48 h until completely saturated third the high speed centrifugation was used to obtain soil water content and soil water potential fourth the retention curve software in hydrus 2 was used to fit the van genuchten retention function van genuchten 1980v finally the values were derived indirectly for soil parameters of permanent wilting point soil water contents at 1500 kpa field capacity soil water contents at 10 kpa and saturation soil water contents at 0 kpa based on the retention function above however the parameter of permanent wilting point was influenced by crop species soil type and crop stage of growth norton and silvertooth 1998 this indirect measurement method would introduce uncertainties in its value and then in the simulated model output variables therefore permanent wilting point was then manually tuned again through a trial and error method based on field measured soil water content to measure soil water moisture soil samples were collected randomly at representative crop covering points in the plots with an auger at every 20 cm throughout a depth of 1 0 m the soils collected were mixed and then dried in an oven at a constant temperature of 105 for 24 h the volumetric soil water moisture was obtained by the multiplication of mass soil water moisture and soil bulk density the sampling frequency was once in two weeks before the jointing stage and then once a week thereafter 2 4 3 crop growth data as mentioned above a quadrat of 1 m2 was randomly selected and marked after emergence to represent the average growth status and determine the final yield of winter wheat in each plot for plant sampling a total of five representative plant samples of winter wheat were randomly collected outside the quadrat the plants were dried in an oven at a temperature of 75 for 48 h to a constant weight then the dry matter weights were measured to determine the aboveground biomass the plant sampling frequency was as the same as soil sampling after physiological maturity all of the wheat plants in each quadrat were harvested the dry matter biomass was measured as above the number of productive ears was counted the average grain number per ear was measured based on ten representative ears finally all of the sampled ears were threshed the grains were also dried in an oven at a constant temperature of 75 for 48 h dry matter grain yield and 1000 kernel weight or unit grain weight were then measured with an electronic scale 2 5 model calibration and verification the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue is a bayesian method for parameter estimation beven and binley 1992 he 2009 he et al 2010 the glue method assumed that in the case of large models with many parameters there was no exact inverse solution hence the estimation of a unique set of parameters which optimized a goodness of fit criterion given the observations was not possible the main principle of this method was to discretize the parameter space by generating many parameter values from the prior distribution likelihood values were then calculated for each parameter set using field observations probabilities an empirical posterior distribution of the parameters were calculated using bayes equation romanowicz and beven 2006 the glue approach is implemented as a package for automatic parameter estimation in dssat the fact that it was used to estimate the genetic coefficients related to the chinese winter wheat cultivar xiaoyan 22 must come later table 2 there were two rounds of model runs in current dssat glue package genetic coefficients related to crop phenology were estimated in the first round while coefficients related to crop growth in the second main procedures in each round of glue included 1 set up of prior distributions for genetic coefficients 2 generation of random parameter sets from the prior distributions 3 model runs with the random parameter sets 4 calculation of likelihood values and 5 construction of posterior distributions at least 3000 model runs were recommended in each round of glue to ensure that the genetic coefficients were each estimated accurately and the posterior distributions were reliable he 2008 however the current dssat glue program did not consider other parameters except for genetic coefficients related to crop cultivars the soil parameters especially those related to soil water holding capacity e g saturation field capacity and pwp were usually set as the measured values and seldom be estimated again whereas we found the pwp which is heavily dependent on crop types played an important role in simulating soil water contents and final yield under soil water stress thus this parameter had to be carefully estimated unfortunately there is no such an automatic tool available to estimate the soil parameters therefore pwp was manually tuned again through a trial and error method based on the comparisons between the simulated and measured soil water contents in different soil layers the ceres wheat model was then evaluated twice based on the indirectly measure and manually tuned soil parameters respectively in this study we used four kinds of model output and observation variables for parameter estimation and model verification including phenology anthesis and maturity dates unit grain weight final biomass and grain yield the data from the non stressed ck treatment in the two growing seasons were used for model calibration a final set of genetic coefficients was obtained after 20 000 models runs in each round of glue table 2 then the data from other rest treatments were used for model verification in which the measurements and simulations of concerned output variables were compared 2 6 statistical analysis two statistics of relative mean absolute error rmae and relative root mean square error rrmse between simulated and observed output variables were used to evaluate the results of model calibration and verification both statistics were able to measure the discrepancy between model simulations and field observation additionally they were dimensionless and could be used for the comparison between different output variables usually lower values of rmae and rrmse indicate higher accuracy of model simulation 4 r m a e 1 n i 1 n s i o i o i 100 5 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 6 r r m s e r m s e o 100 where s i is the i th simulated variable o i is the i

on plant heights different irrigation scenarios had no remarkable influences on plant heights of winter wheat under the irrigation level of i1 fig 3 a but there was some difference under i2 fig 3c generally the treatments of d3 water stress at jointing and heading stages 2012 2013 season and d4 water stress at heading and grain filling stages 2013 2014 season had the highest height while d1 water stress at wintering and returning green stages had the shortest height it can be concluded that irrigations at early vegetative growth stages could to some extent increase plant height of winter wheat larger irrigation amounts might lead to more increment this kind of trend was more obvious in the field experiment of 2013 2014 fig 3b and 3d either under irrigation i1 fig 3b or i2 fig 3d treatments of d4 water stress at heading and grain filling stages and d3 water stress at jointing and heading stages had relatively similarly higher plant heights while treatments of d2 water stress at returning green and jointing stages and d1 water stress at wintering and returning green stages shared relatively similarly shorter plant heights the comparisons above proved that irrigation at the returning green stage could remarkably increase the plant height of winter wheat in other words improve the vegetative growth of winter wheat compared with the ck treatments in the two seasons all treatments had shortened plant heights fig 3 plant heights increased slowly after returning green and then increased rapidly until the heading stage for instance it took about 130 days for winter wheat to grow from emergence to a height of 15 cm the average growth rate was only about 0 12 cm d 1 however it took only about 50 days from 15 cm to 75 cm with an average growth rate of 1 2 cm d 1 or about ten times of the former rate plant heights of xiaoyan 22 the winter wheat cultivar investigated in this study kept 70 80 cm after heading stage or 180 days after planting 3 1 2 influences on winter wheat biomass the above ground biomass values of all treatments were lower than those of ck treatments in the 2012 2013 growing season fig 4 a and 4c there were no obvious differences among the treatments for their biomass under irrigation level of i1 but treatment related to d1 water stress at wintering and returning green stages had slightly lower biomass than the other treatments when under i2 however the situation was more complicated in the 2013 2014 growing season compared with the ck treatment all treatments had lower biomass in the 2013 2014 growing season fig 4c and 4d when under irrigation level of i1 except ck treatments related to d1 water stress at wintering and returning green stages had the lowest biomass and followed by d2 water stress at returning green and jointing stages while treatments related to d3 water stress at jointing and heading stages and d4 water stress at heading and grain filling stages shared the similarly highest biomass when under i2 except ck the biomass of treatments related to d1 water stress at wintering and returning green stages were remarkably lower than the other treatments while there were no great differences among the treatments related to d2 water stress at returning green and jointing stages d3 water stress at jointing and heading stages and d4 water stress at heading and grain filling stages like plant height above ground biomass of all treatments showed similar growth pattern in both two seasons the biomass grew very slowly before jointing stage about 150 days after planting then increased rapidly until arriving at its maximum at the maturity stage 3 1 3 influences on winter wheat phenology different irrigation scenarios investigated in this study all had some influence on winter wheat phenology dates to varying degrees in both 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 seasons in the 2012 2013 season main phenology dates were almost the same for all treatments before the jointing stage without significant difference fig 5 a p 0 05 however later phenology dates e g heading anthesis grain filling and maturity changed significantly p 0 05 due to different irrigation scenarios for treatment i1d1 the later phenology dates were all earlier than the other treatments since the total irrigation was only 120 mm in the whole season and water stress occurred continuously in the wintering and returning green stages the maximum advancing of maturity date was about five days under the same irrigation level i1 or i2 the heading and anthesis dates of d1 d2 d3 and d4 were delayed one to three days respectively generally the heading and anthesis dates advanced more if water stress occurred earlier irrigation levels also had some influences on phenology dates the treatments related to irrigation level i1 were generally one to three days earlier than those related to i2 for their heading and anthesis dates it confirmed the phenomenon that serious water stress could bring forward the phenology dates before anthesis to various degrees for the ck treatment the heading anthesis grain filling and maturity dates were all later than those of the other treatments in the 2012 2013 season the maximum difference between heading dates could be as large as nine days fig 5a the same phenomena were also observed in the 2013 2014 season 3 1 4 influences on winter wheat yields different irrigation scenarios obviously influenced the yield components and grain yields of winter wheat both in the 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 seasons table 3 when under irrigation level of i1 in the 2012 2013 season the numbers of productive ears and grains per ear of treatments related to d3 water stress at jointing and heading stages and d4 water stress at heading and grain filling stages were all higher than those related to d1 water stress at wintering and returning green stages and d2 water stress at returning green and jointing stages however the values of 1000 kernel weight were lower than those related to d1 and d2 generally treatments related to d1 and d2 showed no great difference for their yields and yield components as well as d3 and d4 hence it could be concluded that returning green was the critical irrigation stage for productive ears grains per ear and final yield while heading was the critical irrigation stage for 1000 kernel weight of winter wheat treatments of i1d3 and i1d1 obtained the maximum and minimum grain yields respectively the same phenomena were also observed under the irrigation level of i2 compared with the 2012 2013 season the experimental results of 2013 2014 were different to some extent since the values of productive ears grains per ear and final yields of almost all treatments were lower than the last season this was because the soil water contents were relatively low before sowing in the 2013 2014 season which led to insufficient water available for the vegetative growth before jointing stage both under i1 and i2 the values of productive ears grains per ear and 1000 kernel weight of treatments related to d3 water stress at jointing and heading stages and d4 water stress at heading and grain filling stages were close to each other but all higher than those related to d1 water stress at wintering and returning green stages and d2 water stress at returning green and jointing stages this trend agreed with the experimental results of 2012 2013 seasons either under i1 or i2 the treatments related to d1 water stress at wintering and returning green stages all gave the lowest yields or only 66 and 67 of the highest yields obtained by i1d3 and i2d2 3 2 simulation of winter wheat growth and yield under different irrigation scenarios 3 2 1 model calibration and verification with the glue estimated genetic coefficients table 2 and indirectly measured soil parameters table 4 the simulated and observed anthesis and maturity dates were almost the same with relative mean absolute error rmae of only 0 52 and 0 21 for the model calibration process table 5 the simulation accuracy of biomass and grain yield was also high with rmae values of 6 48 and 4 22 whereas the accuracy of unit weight simulation was relatively low with an rmae of greater than 10 for the model verification process the simulation accuracy of anthesis and maturity dates was 2 09 and 2 20 however the simulated anthesis and maturity dates were exactly the same for different treatments in each year while observed dates were different because of various water stress scenarios the simulation accuracy of unit grain weight biomass and grain yield was relatively poor especially for the treatments with water stress at heading and grain filling stages the rmae values of output variables concerned were all greater than 20 in contrast to grain yield biomass was poorly simulated when water stress occurred at returning green stage for example the rmae values of treatment related to d1 water stress at wintering and returning green stages and d2 water stress at returning green and jointing stages were all greater than 30 and 20 respectively this indicated that water stress before jointing could have great influences on model simulation of biomass and grain yield generally the values of overall average rmae and rrmse were all about 5 for the calibration processes and above 15 for the calibration processes 3 2 2 comparisons of time series output variables under indirectly measured soil parameters the ceres wheat model was run with the indirectly measured soil parameters i e permanent wilting point and field capacity glue estimated genetic coefficients and the relevant input data of 2012 2013 growing season the simulated dynamics of winter wheat biomass and soil water contents were compared among different treatments figs 6 8 roots of winter wheat mainly concentrated in the 0 80 cm soil profile and the 0 40 cm soil layer usually contained the majority of the root lengths and had a large root length density wang et al 2006 in addition soil water contents of 0 20 cm layer changed greatly and had a great potential influence on crop growth thus only the soil water dynamics of 0 20 cm layer was presented for the sake of brevity when sufficient irrigation was applied the dynamics of winter wheat biomass and soil moisture of ck treatment could all be accurately simulated fig 6 during the 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 growing seasons the determination coefficient r 2 and root mean square rmse between simulation and observation of biomass were 0 98 0 97 and 1 144 1 490 kg ha 1 respectively and they were 0 45 0 81 r 2 and 0 05 0 03 cm3 cm 3 rmse for soil moisture in the 0 20 cm layer generally the simulation accuracy of biomass was higher than soil moisture fig 6a but the main trend of soil water dynamics was correct since most simulations matched the corresponding observations fig 6b thus it could be concluded that the ceres wheat model was able to correctly simulate the dynamics of winter wheat biomass and soil moisture when there was sufficient irrigation water however when under different scenarios of soil water stress the simulated dynamics of biomass and soil moisture varied greatly figs 7 and 8 either under i1 or i2 if there were continuous water stress at early vegetative stages e g d1 and d2 there would be great errors in simulated biomass after jointing stage since simulations were lower than observations fig 7a b e and f this indicated that the ceres wheat model overestimated the inhibition of winter wheat growth by soil water stress at returning green stage with the delay of water stress the simulation of winter wheat biomass gradually improved if water stress occurred at the heading and grain filling stages d4 model simulated and observed results were close to each other fig 7d and h in this case the ceres wheat was able to correctly simulate winter wheat growth with water stress at later growth stages for soil moisture at the 0 20 cm layer the simulation errors would become larger with the increase of soil water stress the simulation accuracies under irrigation level of i1 fig 8a d were generally lower that those under i2 fig 8e h when under the same irrigation level of i1 if water stress occurred at early stage of winter wheat growth simulated soil moisture was usually lower than the observations in other words the model underestimated soil moistures at this stage or overestimated the level of soil water stress which probably mainly contributed to the great errors in biomass simulation fig 8a b e and f however with the delay of water stress the simulation accuracy of soil moisture gradually improved when water stress occurred at the heading and grain filling stages d4 the simulations and observations matched very well fig 8d and h which confirmed once again that the ceres wheat model was able to correctly simulate soil water content when water stress occurred at later growth stages 3 2 3 comparisons of time series output variables under manually tuned soil parameters with the manually tuned soil parameters and glue estimated genetic coefficients the simulated dynamics soil water contents simulated 2 were compared among different treatments at the 0 20 cm layer fig 9 through slightly adjusting the values of permanent wilting point and increasing field capacity table 4 the simulation accuracy was greatly improved for each treatment most simulated values matched the corresponding observations fig 9 thus it was concluded that the ceres wheat model was able to correctly simulate soil moisture under different irrigation scenarios if the soil parameters related to water holing capacity could be correctly estimated to further verify the influences of soil parameters of permanent wilting point the simulated dynamics of total water storage in the 0 100 cm soil profile fig 10 and winter wheat biomass fig 11 were compared among different treatments based on initial indirectly measured simulated 1 and new manually tuned soil parameters simulated 2 the simulation accuracies of total water storage were improved under both two irrigation levels after manually tuning the soil parameters fig 10 the improved simulation accuracies were generally higher under i2 than those under i1 for each treatment the simulation accuracy was improved obviously after 160 d day after sowing the general rmse values decreased by 3 3 0 1 0 6 1 0 0 5 0 4 1 1 0 7 mm for treatments i1d1 i1d2 i1d3 i1d4 i2d1 i2d2 i2d3 and i2d4 when compared to results simulated with initial indirect soil parameters and glue based genetic coefficients or simulated 1 respectively the overall mean rmse of all treatments decreased to 0 3 mm for different treatments the simulation accuracies decreased or increased to different extents after changing the soil parameters in addition simulated total water storage was usually lower than the observations under the same irrigation level of i1 in other words the model overestimated the level of soil water stress which might contributed to the errors in biomass simulation both under i1 and i2 the simulation accuracies of aboveground biomass were improved for almost all of the treatments after manually tuning the soil parameters fig 11 the improved simulation accuracies under i2 were higher than those under i1 for each treatment the simulation accuracies were improved obviously after 160 d day after sowing especially under irrigation level of i2 the general rmse values decreased by 1475 678 363 352 1605 1411 645 530 kg ha 1 for treatments i1d1 i1d2 i1d3 i1d4 i2d1 i2d2 i2d3 and i2d4 when compared to the results of simulated 1 respectively the simulation accuracy of i2d4 became slightly lower after manually tuning the soil parameters the overall mean rmse value decreased 750 kg ha 1 thus the simulation accuracy was improved greatly under different water stress conditions after manually tuning the soil parameters of permanent wilting point and field capacity 4 discussions 4 1 influences of different irrigation scenarios on winter wheat growth different irrigation scenarios investigated in this study showed remarkable influences on plant height and aboveground biomass of winter wheat field observations showed that soil water stress during wintering or returning green stage led to a decrease both in plant height and biomass this indicated that serious and continuous water stress at early vegetative stages could heavily reduce aboveground biomass of winter wheat which could not even be offset by later irrigations thus an irrigation at the wintering or returning green stage could alleviate the inhibition of water stress on plant growth and increase plant height and aboveground biomass of winter wheat in the guanzhong plain of china different irrigation scenarios showed remarkable influences on the phenology of winter wheat especially after the jointing stage low irrigation level could advance the maturity date up to three days earlier and more serious soil water stress would advance winter wheat phenology even more which was consistent with the finding by mavromatis 2014 winter wheat grain yields depends on the grain number and on the remobilization of the pre flowering reserve as well as on the photosynthesis occurring during the grain filling period artru et al 2018 bijanzadeh and emam 2010 meanwhile the dependent factors could be influenced by irrigation depth water stress period and their interaction both under irrigation levels of i1 and i2 soil water stress could heavily influence productive ears grains per ear unit grain weight and final grain yield continuous water stress at both wintering and returning green stages i1d1 led to a very low grain yield when continuous water stress occurred at jointing and heading stages i1d3 the highest grain yield was obtained since irrigations before jointing could guarantee the normal growth of winter wheat however unit grain weight was relatively low since water stress negatively influenced the early process of grain filling the treatment i2d2 water stress at returning green and jointing stages obtained the highest yield because of sufficient irrigation at wintering stage to meet the crop water requirements of vegetative growth two more irrigations at heading and grain filling stages increased the number of productive ears grains per ear and unit grain weight this was different with the research which found that moderate water deficit during grain filling resulting in greater grain yield zhang et al 2008 generally an irrigation at jointing could obviously increase productive ears while irrigations at heading and grain filling could markedly increase grains per ear and unit gain weight which was consistent with the study done by bakhsh et al 2013 in this study we found returning green was the critical stage for winter wheat irrigation however some other studies showed that the critical period of water requirement of winter wheat was from jointing to heading ji et al 2014 thorp 2007 the difference was mainly because previous studies were performed in open fields where rainfall could confound the results due to additional unintended water input however this current study was conducted strictly under rainfall shelter almost without any precipitation input thus soil moisture before sowing became very low and the influence of irrigation at early vegetative stage increased obviously winter wheat plants suffered longtime soil water stress in the treatments without irrigation at seedling from emergence to jointing the crop could not recover its normal growth even with sufficient irrigation at later stages and finally had very poor yields this confirmed once again that irrigation at returning green stage was crucial for a stable grain yield of winter wheat 4 2 influences of soil parameters related to water holding capacity on simulation accuracy although we found that there were only some small differences between initial indirectly measured and new manually tuned values of soil parameters of permanent wilting point table 4 the simulation accuracies of soil water contents were improved greatly in this study after using the manually tuned soil parameters instead fig 9 this also resulted in higher simulation accuracies for total water storage and biomass figs 10 and 11 therefore it could be concluded that soil parameters related to soil water holding capacity i e permanent wilting point played a very important role in simulating winter wheat growth under soil water stress conditions however permanent wilting point is very difficult to be measured directly in practice it is more functionally defined as the point at which plants wilt and do not recover overnight taiz and zeiger 1991 crop species soil type and crop stage of growth all can affect the measured values of permanent wilting point norton and silvertooth 1998 although permanent wilting point can be measured by some indirect methods this would bring large uncertainty in parameter value and finally introduce large simulation errors due to the uncertainties in indirectly measured values of permanent wilting point simulated plant available soil water which was defined as the difference between field capacity and permanent wilting point was also uncertain thus there could be some big errors in simulated biomass and yields caused only by some small differences in the values of relevant soil parameters generally we suggested that the soil parameters related to water holding capacity played a very important role in simulating winter wheat growth when under severe soil water stress hence these soil parameters should be measured more directly and accurately and need to be further tuned based on field observations when simulating crop growth under serious water stress conditions 4 3 evaluation of the ceres wheat model in arid conditions generally the ceres wheat model was able to correctly simulate the growth and yield of winter wheat with sufficient water supply and the simulation accuracy was relatively high which was in agreement with some previous studies dettori et al 2011 langensiepen et al 2008 pecetti and hollington 1997 thorp et al 2010 however when there were different scenarios of soil water stress the simulation accuracy would change a lot for phenology unit grain weight aboveground biomass and grain yield when water stress occurred at the early vegetative stage the simulation accuracy of the ceres wheat model became low it usually simulated phenology dates earlier and overestimated unit grain weight but underestimated final biomass and grain yield at the same time it also underestimated the soil moisture at the early growth stages which was probably one of the main reasons for the low simulated biomass and grain yield when water stress occurred at later growth stages the simulation accuracy of the ceres wheat model improved a lot but still had some kinds of errors for example for treatments related to d4 water stress at heading and grain filling stages in the 2013 2014 season the model seriously underestimated the unit grain weight of winter wheat rmae 40 either under irrigation level i1 or i2 in general the ceres wheat model could simulate winter wheat growth with water stress at later growth stages more accurately than the growth with water stress at early stages different reasons might contribute to such kind of simulation errors nouna et al 2003 explored the reasons for the low accuracy of ceres wheat model under water stress first they found the model did not sufficiently simulate leaf area index lai in the whole season next the water stress index calculated in the model did not consider the actual situation in field experiments dejonge et al 2012 suggested that the simulation accuracy of evapotranspiration et should be increased first if the ceres series models should be improved to simulate crop growth under water stress since the water stress indices in the model were directly related to et values while previous methods for evaluating et using a static crop coefficient have worked well for studies under non stressed water conditions few studies have emphasized et accumulation under water stress therefore they provided a new equation that calculates a dynamic crop coefficient as a function of lai in addition some studies found that moderate water stress could stimulate the growth of roots of wheat seedling and increase the root shoot ratio whereas serious water stress could inhibit root growth and decrease root activity sun et al 2003 in some treatments of this study water stress continuously occurred at wintering and returning green stages longtime water stress seriously retarded the growth of wheat roots thus we suggest that an additional water stress index should be added in the ceres wheat model to take account of the complicated relationship between water stress and root growth and to improve the simulation accuracy of wheat growth under water stress at seedling stage the ceres wheat model gave the same simulations of anthesis and maturity dates for different irrigation scenarios which contradicted the observations in other words the current ceres wheat model was unable to simulate the phenology discrepancy caused by soil water stress this was because the phenology simulation in the current model was mainly based on meteorological factors such as temperature and photoperiod without consideration of the secondary influence of water and nutrient stress mcmaster et al 2008 additionally travasso and delecolle 1995 pointed out that current ceres wheat model used air temperature in phenology prediction rather than actual temperature in crop canopy in general the current ceres wheat model had some drawbacks in phenology prediction for winter wheat growth under serious water stress 5 conclusions the experimental results showed that irrigation before jointing was necessary to reduce the inhibition of water stress on plant growth to guarantee higher plant height and aboveground biomass serious and early water stress could advance the phenology dates of winter wheat the returning green and grain filling stages were proved to be critical periods for field water management generally the ceres wheat model could simulate winter wheat growth under water stress at later reproductive stages better than the growth under water stress before jointing stages the current ceres wheat model was not able to simulate the phenology discrepancies caused by different water stress scenarios the simulation accuracies of dynamics of water contents in 0 20 cm soil layer and winter wheat biomass all improved greatly after manually tuning the initially indirectly measured soil value of permanent wilting point generally soil parameters related to soil water holding capacity played an important role in simulating winter wheat growth under severe soil water stress in general the ceres wheat model proved to have some drawbacks to simulate winter wheat growth under complicated scenarios of soil water stress to be effectively applied in winter wheat management in arid and semi arid regions of china we suggest the current ceres wheat model should be further validated modified and improved the influences on winter wheat growth by water stress at seedling stages must be well understood and quantified especially the influences on root system additionally the secondary influence of water stress on wheat phenology should also be considered in the new phenology algorithm
