15725,solar disinfection sodis was probed for its underlying mechanism when escherichia coli was exposed to uva irradiation the dominant solar fraction acting in sodis process cells exhibited a shoulder before death ensued this profile resembles cell killing by hydrogen peroxide h2o2 indeed the use of specialized strains revealed that uva exposure triggers intracellular h2o2 formation the resultant h2o2 stress was especially impactful because uva also inactivated the processes that degrade h2o2 peroxidases through the suppression of metabolism and catalases through direct enzyme damage cell killing was enhanced when water was replaced with d2o suggesting that singlet oxygen plays a role possibly as a precursor to h2o2 and or as the mediator of catalase damage uva was especially toxic to mutants lacking miniferritin dps or recombinational dna repair reca enzymes indicating that reactions between ferrous iron and uva generated h2o2 lead to lethal dna damage importantly experiments showed that the intracellular accumulation of h2o2 alone is insufficient to kill cells therefore uva must do something more to enable death a possibility is that uva stimulates the reduction of intracellular ferric iron to its ferrous form either by stimulating o 2 formation or by generating photoexcited electron donors these observations and methods open the door to follow up experiments that can probe the mechanisms of h2o2 formation catalase inactivation and iron reduction of immediate utility the data highlight the intracellular pathways formed under uva light during sodis and that the presence of micromolar iron accelerates the rate at which radiation disinfects water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords solar disinfection sodis reactive oxygen species ros e coli knock out mutants inactivation mechanism 1 introduction solar disinfection sodis is a long recognized drinking water potabilization method consisting of a vessel recipient in which water is introduced and is exposed to natural sunlight during one day or two depending on the climatological conditions mcguigan et al 2012 sodis efficacy is affected by multiple parameters including the bottle material its thickness and size keogh et al 2015 ozores diez et al 2020 the sunlight irradiance temperature and exposure time berney et al 2006a ndounla et al 2014 nelson et al 2018 as well as water quality indicators such as the turbidity organic and inorganic matter content and oxygen level keogh et al 2017 kohantorabi et al 2019 rommozzi et al 2020 further different microorganisms can manifest very different responses to sunlight with bacteria and viruses being more susceptible than protozoa fisher et al 2012 garcía gil et al 2020a gómez couso et al 2010 hence although simple in application the sodis process has been an intriguing black box process with many research axes for study to attempt to simplify the microorganism inactivation process one can distinguish thermal and optical modes thermal inactivation processes depend upon photon absorption by water mainly in the infrared region of the solar spectrum a consequent increase in water temperature is sufficient to inactivate some microbes this process has been well characterized the thermal only action can denature intracellular proteins damage dna and the cell wall and ultimately inactivate the organism baatout et al 2005 blaustein et al 2013 the optical pathways on the other hand are far more complex and intriguing the uvc component of solar radiation is fully absorbed by atmospheric ozone frederick 2015 and the trace uvb that reaches the earth s surface does not usually penetrate the glass and plastic containers that are used for sodis for example depending on the bottle composition the uvb irradiation 290 320 nm might be filtered out as in the case of polyethylene terephthalate pet or borosilicate whereas polycarbonate moderately permits its passage garcía gil et al 2020b since sodis is mainly applied in resource poor regions the materials commonly used are pet and glass which with minor deviations allow part of uva visible and infrared light to penetrate the material uva light 320 400 nm is effective at sterilizing water and many proposals have been offered regarding the underlying mechanism s early e coli experiments demonstrated that in contrast to uvc or uvb uva has mild direct effects on the dna cadet et al 2009 pfeifer et al 2005 in the past twenty years many research groups have suggested plausible indirect pathways that lead to bacterial inactivation with substantial focus upon the possibility that cells are killed by oxidative stress previous research detected the inactivation of some enzymes that scavenge reactive oxygen species ros and observed damage to proteins and the cell membrane berney et al 2006a 2006b bosshard et al 2010a 2010b catalase and superoxide dismutase degrade the h2o2 and superoxide radical o 2 that is normally generated inside the cell imlay 2008 2003 and a series of studies modeled the correlation of e coli inactivation to the loss of scavenging enzymes functions castro alférez et al 2017a garcía gil et al 2022a besides the direct effect of light during sodis temperature increase can play a key role in inactivating scavenging enzymes other researchers have unraveled the synergistic effect that temperature has on uva mediated inactivation castro alférez et al 2017b garcía gil et al 2022b and since h2o2 is a good marker of oxidative stress itself imlay 2019 the detrimental effect that h2o2 accumulation has on bacterial survival castro alférez et al 2016 these explanations on light h2o2 and temperature form an general overview of picture on the mechanisms of sodis linking it with an intracellular oxidative process giannakis et al 2016a 2016b superoxide and h2o2 can inactivate some metalloenzymes by damaging their iron cofactors but these direct effects are bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal imlay 2013 imlay et al 1988 instead the killing effect of oxidative stress typically arises from dna damage which is driven by the fenton reaction this chemistry generates the hydroxyl radical h o which unlike o 2 or h2o2 is a strong enough oxidant to directly damage dna the photo assisted fenton reaction hereon photo fenton process involves the standard reaction eq 1 but it also depends upon photo assisted fe reduction so that iron might act catalytically in producing hydroxyl radicals those events may be driven by the oxidation of an iron ligand eq 2 or by any other photo induced source of electrons that might reduce fe3 to fe2 eq 3 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h h o 2 f e 3 l light f e 2 l ox 3 f e 3 e l i g h t f e 2 the early approaches indicated a critical role of catalase and superoxide dismutase in protecting cells from uva but the interpretation was muddied by the uvb portion emitted from the lamps in those experiments complicating comparison to later findings eisenstark and perrot 1987 hoerter et al 1989 smyk randall et al 1993 the role of h2o2 in the toxicity of uva was later supported by the hypersensitivity of catalase deficient cells fisher and nelson 2014 ng et al 2015 however although these studies supported the involvement of superoxide metals and h2o2 aspects remain unclear to appraise the fenton model it is important to compare the levels of ros during uva stress with the thresholds that make them bactericidal to this end we have employed an array of e coli mutants to clarify the intracellular uva mediated inactivation pathway from rates of ros generation to the identity of the oxidative targets we sought to address several critical questions i whether uva irradiation increases intracellular h2o2 generation and concentration ii whether the effect of h2o2 production is amplified by damage to scavenging enzymes and iii whether h2o2 formation is by itself sufficient to explain the toxicity of uva our data support the view that several effects of uva converge in driving cell damage 2 materials and methods 2 1 light source and reactor the uva irradiation used in the study was emitted from three 18 w philips tl d blb lamps with relatively narrowband emission peaking at 365 nm the emission spectrum of the lamps is provided in the supplementary fig s1 a 30 2 w m2 intensity was selected for its environmental relevance pizarro 1995 5 of solar light is uva and the sodis guidelines propose a 600 w m2 irradiance threshold for a successful application a metal case housing the uva lamps and ballasts isolated the experimental area and limited exposure to the laboratory environment fans placed on top of the case ensured cooling of the lamps and temperature control to ambient values 22 1 c during testing 5 cm diameter glass petri dishes containing the bacterial suspension were placed under uva light 2 cm away from the light source the dishes were covered with their uva transparent lids to prevent contamination 2 2 bacterial strains and growth the genotypes of strains used in this study are listed in supplementary table s1 standard p1 transduction thomason et al 2007 was used to prepare the mutant strains additional details are provided in supplementary text s1 strains that grow in aerobic conditions were routinely streaked from frozen stocks onto lb plates and incubated overnight at 37 c these master plates were stored at 4 c for two weeks and then prepared anew because h2o2 contaminates oxic plates li and imlay 2018 strains with diminished oxidative defenses were streaked onto lb plates and grown in anoxic conditions to avoid any possible outgrowth of genetically suppressed mutants overnight cultures in lb medium were prepared from the master plates these cultures were then centrifuged washed and diluted to the desired cell density into water prior to tests of uva sensitivity mohammadi et al 2021 ozores diez et al 2020 as indicated in the supplementary text s2 our goal was to test uva action on cells under conditions in which reactive oxygen species were exclusively generated by intracellular chromophores double deionized water ddh2o was used to avoid external chromophores and inconsistency in water quality all experiments were repeated twice at minimum usually three times comprising biological replicates and each unique test e g strain was performed in duplicate to obtain statistical replicates for the determination of cfu ml at each point two or three consecutive dilutions were plated the results report the average the detection limit dl of the method and the standard deviation from the mean some experiments were conducted with strains that had been grown under anoxic conditions those cultures were prepared in a coy anaerobic chamber coy laboratory products inc containing an atmosphere of approximately 90 n2 5 h2 5 co2 and 100 ppm o2 the viability of cells during subsequent aerobic uva or h2o2 exposure was assessed by diluting the cells and plating them in top agar on anoxic lb 0 2 glucose plates the viable cells were counted manually after incubation for 24 h at 37 c under anoxic conditions more details on the growth and experimental preparation with anoxic strains can be found in the supplementary text s2 for test of exponentially growing e coli overnight cultures in lb medium were diluted to 0 01 od600 in fresh lb after growth for 4 5 generations od600 0 1 0 2 the cells were collected washed and then diluted down to 0 002 in water prior to illumination in order to assess the role of fe in the sensitization of e coli photo inactivation 50 or 100 μm fe2 from feso4 7h2o was added in the lb growth medium during overnight growth the stationary phase cells were harvested washed and diluted down to od600 0 002 2 3 experimental techniques h2o2 determination protein measurements galactosidase activity and respirometry a comprehensive list of chemicals and reagents is provided in the supplementary table s2 measurements of h2o2 were performed by the horseradish peroxidase amplex red method hrp ar seaver and imlay 2001a in the presence of h2o2 hrp oxidizes ar to resorufin its fluorescence was measured by a rf mini 150 fluorometer shimadzu and converted to h2o2 concentration using a standard curve the method details are provided at the supplementary material supplementary text s3 that supplement also provides detailed protocols for h2o2 scavenging tests h2o2 stress tests and h2o2 photo generation tests expression of katg was determined using a katg lacz fusion expression in both a wild type wt and an hpx strain the β galactosidase activity was assayed using ortho nitrophenyl d galactopyranoside onpg korshunov et al 2020 the protein concentration of cell lysates was determined using the bradford assay kruger 2009 details can be found in supplementary text s4 the katg and gmk mrna was quantified by qrt pcr details can be found in supplementary text s5 measurements of consumption of oxygen by e coli wt cells at 37 c was performed with a clark electrode micrometrix 10 system the initial cell density was 0 2 od600 the electrode was standardized using air saturated water 210 μm o2 at 37 c and na2s2o4 to create anoxia one ml of sample was withdrawn at intervals 0 3h 6h respiration rates were derived by normalizing oxygen consumption rates to cell density 3 results 3 1 involvement of oxidative stress in uva toxicity the ahpc ahpf katg and kate are the genes encoding primary cell defenses against h2o2 stress and soda sodb and sodc against superoxide radicals that dismute to h2o2 hence if the illumination by uva causes ros increase then the knock out mutants will be more sensitive to this end the inactivation kinetics of the wild type wt strain was compared with single and multiple knock out mutants for the genes responsible for expressing catalases and peroxidases fig 1 a in order to determine the efficiency with which uva light sterilizes water e coli cells were grown overnight to stationary phase in aerated lb medium washed with buffer and suspended at low density 0 002 od600 in distilled water the subsequent inactivation of the wild type strain by uva irradiation was described by a lag phase followed by a steady decrease in cfu ml fig 1a no resistant sub population was evident during at least five logs of killing the optical density and cellular protein content was minimally affected indicating that cells did not lyse fig s2 this pattern of killing contrasts with the single hit kinetics of uvc radiation moreno andrés et al 2018 in which bacteria lose viability due to direct dna damage notably the broad shoulder resembled that of cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide h2o2 imlay and linn 1986 to test the possibility that uva generates lethal oxidative stress the experiment was repeated with strains that lack the ability to scavenge cytoplasmic superoxide or h2o2 a soda sodb mutant sod lacks both its manganese and iron cofactored superoxide dismutases while an hpx mutant lacks nadh peroxidase encoded by ahpcf and the catalases encoded by katg and kate both expressed in stationary phase cells but the latter being the main one loewen et al 1985 schellhorn and hassan 1988 we verify that both strains died more rapidly than their parent levén et al 1990 anaerobically grown cells possess lower titers of defensive enzymes compan and touati 1993 indeed when cells were precultured anaerobically but were aerobically irradiated they were substantially more susceptible to aerobic uva irradiation fig 1b these data confirm that uva creates oxidative stress that is mediated by superoxide and h2o2 interestingly the killing curves of the ros scavenging mutants were reproducibly biphasic fig 1a b sod strain with a rapid killing phase followed by a shoulder that was eventually saturated that same profile is evident in h2o2 treated cells imlay and linn 1986 in the latter case the initial killing is known to result from oxidative dna damage while the target involved in the second phase has not yet been identified 3 2 uva both generates h2o2 and inactivates the enzymes that scavenge it e coli like many bacteria uses a consortium of peroxidases and catalases to protect itself from h2o2 sen and imlay 2021 in fed cells the nadh peroxidase encoded by ahpcf is the primary scavenger of endogenous h2o2 when the cell is exposed to higher levels of h2o2 ahpcf is saturated and induction of the katg catalase occurs driven by the oxyr transcription factor when e coli enters stationary phase the alternative kate catalase is induced schellhorn and hassan 1988 finally when hypoxic cells sense exogenous h2o2 they induce cytochrome c peroxidase ccp which allows the cell to use h2o2 as an alternative respiratory substrate khademian and imlay 2017 in the growth protocol used in our experiments the cells were likely to contain significant levels of ahpcf katg and kate whereas ccp would be minor we sought to identify the enzymes that were important during uva exposure the degradation of h2o2 by the unirradiated cell suspensions was measured using strains that lacked particular scavenging enzymes to optimize these measurements the experiments were conducted at a higher cell density 0 2 od600 control experiments confirmed that the inactivation kinetics approximated what had been seen previously supplementary text s6 supplementary figs s3 s5 wild type cells degraded virtually all of the added 10 μm h2o2 in 5 min conversely a strain lacking all four enzymes degraded only about 20 in 60 min fig 2 a the small residual scavenging is likely due to an adventitious peroxidase activity of cytochrome oxidases khademian and imlay 2017 the following approximate rates of h2o2 scavenging is found relative to wt detailed nm s rates are available in supplementary table s3 ahp 123 of wt wt kate 42 katg 39 kat 21 hpx 11 mutants possessing either katg or kate alone exhibited approximately half as much scavenging activity as wild type cells whereas a katg kate mutant possessing only ahpcf and ccp was poor at h2o2 clearance the ahpcf mutant degrades h2o2 even more quickly than do wt cells as in the absence of ahpcf the endogenous h2o2 accumulates enough during growth to activate oxyr and induce catalase seaver and imlay 2001a when cells are subsequently starved which diminishes the activity of nadh dependent ahpcf catalase becomes the primary scavenging enzyme thus the catalase rich ahpcf mutant is counterintuitively more effective at scavenging h2o2 than is the wt cell in sum these data indicate that in washed stationary phase cells the catalases provide the majority of h2o2 clearance ahpcf provides a lesser amount and ccp has very little effect this result makes sense stationary phase cells have low metabolic activity which is likely to minimize the nadh pools available to drive the ahpcf and ccp peroxidases in contrast catalases do not require a reductant and remain fully active in quiescent cells the scavenging activities were then monitored during the course of uva exposure strikingly the overall h2o2 scavenging rate of wild type cells progressively declined fig 2b over a period of five hours this activity fell about five fold the activities of the specific scavenging enzymes were then tracked using mutants fig 2c f see also supplementary text s7 the catalase expressing kate katg cells exhibited a loss of scavenging that approximately paralleled that of the wild type parent cells expressing only ahp or ccp lost scavenging activity more quickly and even the trace scavenging observed in the hpx ccp mutant disappeared within an hour the latter effects might be expected if uva exposure poisons the residual low level metabolism of these cells and indeed respiration measurements showed that illumination blocked oxygen consumption fig s6 in contrast the loss of scavenging in catalase containing cells seemed likely to reflect photon mediated damage to katg and kate the order or resistance to uva is wt kat strains ahp hpx ccp cell lysates were prepared and enzyme assays confirmed that uva treatment gradually eliminated intracellular catalase activity with half being eliminated in the first hour fig s7 this effect primarily reflected the hypersensitivity of kate which lost virtually all activity within the first hour in contrast it required 3 h to diminish katg activity by more than half fig s8 the uva sensitivity of kate is remarkable as this is the scavenging enzyme that predominates in the non growing cells against which water sterilization techniques are typically directed hence we can provisionally conclude that an order of importance for the protection of the cell among the studied peroxidases ccp ahpcf and catalases katg kate is ccp ahp kate katg wt the loss of scavenging ability is in itself not lethal to e coli as manifested by the viability of the hpx ccp null mutants for this loss to be consequential cells must also be exposed to a significant source of h2o2 accordingly we measured the level of h2o2 in cell suspensions both with and without uva exposure fig 3 if it is not scavenged endogenous hydrogen peroxide being uncharged crosses bacterial membranes and appears in the extracellular medium see also supplementary text st3 the equilibration of h2o2 across the membrane allows measurements of extracellular h2o2 concentrations to be good proxies for the intracellular ones seaver and imlay 2001b hydrogen peroxide did not accumulate in suspensions of non scavenging hpx mutants in the dark fig 3a as the metabolism of unfed cells is too minimal to produce endogenous reactive oxygen species however h2o2 was steadily produced when the suspension was irradiated its generation depended upon the cells themselves rather than vessel material as h2o2 formation was undetectable when cells were 100 fold more dilute fig 3a when wild type scavenging proficient cells were irradiated h2o2 accumulated only at the later time points fig 3b this pattern mirrors the gradual loss of scavenging ability when various strains were compared it became clear that h2o2 accumulation occurred earlier in strains lacking catalase as expected from the greater uva sensitivity of peroxidase functions fig 3c therefore the data indicate that uva not only drives h2o2 formation but also inactivates the enzymes that normally keep its concentration low 3 3 cytoplasmic superoxide accelerates cell killing when assessing the uva mediated e coli inactivation and the photo production of h2o2 the strains lacking superoxide dismutases presented a high sensitivity but also high h2o2 production fig 3b hence in this section special focus has been given in the unveiling of these events fig 4 a summarizes the experiments with sod mutants namely soda mnsod deficient sodb fesod deficient the double soda sodb mutant sod and the sodc cuznsod deficient from a distinct strain from the others assessed separately fig 4b an over expressing fesod strain was also assessed fig 4b fig 4a shows that cells lacking the two cytoplasmic sods are especially sensitive to uva both superoxide dismutases have been previously found to alleviate di hydroxyacid dehydratase from oxidative stress damage as well as reduction of iron toxicity brown et al 1995 touati et al 1995 the single mutants exhibit intermediate sensitivity in contrast the periplasmic h2o2 resistant sod benov et al 1995 korshunov and imlay 2006 2002 encoded by sodc does not affect the killing rate fig 4b because superoxide is a charged anion that does not cross membranes korshunov and imlay 2002 these data indicate that cytoplasmic superoxide is involved in killing superoxide directly damages the metal centers of enzymes releasing loose iron into the cytoplasm where it can catalyze the formation of hydroxyl radicals from h2o2 keyer and imlay 1996 interestingly h2o2 was also released more quickly into the medium from sod mutants figs 3b and s9 the basis of this effect is not clear 3 4 involvement of singlet oxygen 1o2 the illumination of some chromophores can lead them to transfer energy to molecular oxygen generating singlet oxygen as a product singlet oxygen is a potent divalent oxidant that can attack dna membranes and proteins its production can be lethal to bacteria mosteo et al 2020 szocs et al 1999 it is also known that in e coli the porphyrins that are the precursors to heme can act as photosensitizers through their capacity for 1o2 formation epe 1991 hessling et al 2017 we tested whether 1o2 is involved in uva toxicity by partially substituting d2o for h2o 50 as in porras et al 2018 water can quench 1o2 and this effect is lessened in d2o the water replacement substantially narrowed the shoulder of the killing curve fig 5 a further supplementation of cell suspensions with δ aminolevulinic acid a porphyrin precursor increased sensitivity fig 5b these results indicate that 1o2 plays a role in solar disinfection interestingly 1o2 has been observed to damage catalase in other cell systems lledías and hansberg 1999 3 5 involvement of iron in phototoxicity studies of h2o2 stress have indicated that its lethal action is due to its participation in the fenton reaction which generates hydroxyl radicals that can damage dna imlay et al 1988 in order to generate hydroxyl radical fe2 must transfer an electron to h2o2 therefore we sought to test whether i fe is involved in the key damage and ii if an h2o2 increase and the accordant ho increase damages enzymes and or dna we observed that mutants lacking dps a miniferritin that sequesters iron during h2o2 stress were especially sensitive to uva fig 6 a dps can protect cells dukan and touati 1996 martinez and kolter 1997 since it uses h2o2 as a co substrate when it stores fe ii as fe iii rychlewski et al 1999 zhao et al 2002 so its activity was presumably enabled by the intracellular h2o2 that uva generates mahaseth and kuzminov 2015 park et al 2005 in contrast to dps the bacterial ferritins bfr and ftn which are involved in iron acquisition dubrac and touati 2000 niederhoffer et al 1990 had no apparent effect on killing rate fig 6b the transcription of dps is strongly induced when cells enter stationary phase the sigma factor rpos triggers this induction and indeed rpos mutants were also rapidly killed the sensitivity of the rpos strain was greater than that of dps mutants likely because rpos also induces kate patten et al 2004 weber et al 2005 the induction of dps by rpos also may explain why cells grown into stationary phase which activates rpos maciąg et al 2011 are more resistant to uva than are exponentially growing cells black solid vs dashed curves fig 7 a reciprocal experiments confirmed the involvement of iron when fe was added during cell growth iron supplements accelerated the rate at which uva killed wild type cells fig 7a e either stationary or exponentially growing ones iron addition further sensitized hpx dps and sod strains as well indicating that the effect was not due to disruption of any of these functions interestingly a siderophore biosynthetic mutant enta was hypersensitive due to the absence of siderophore dependent iron import this strain is likely to become iron starved as it approaches stationary phase and the feo transporter would be induced as a consequence kammler et al 1993 we suspect that the subsequent addition of iron would allow it to enter the cell especially rapidly through this importer 3 6 the oxyr regulon offered minimal protection against uva like most bacteria e coli features a defensive regulon that offers strong protection against environmental h2o2 the oxyr transcription factor is activated by as little as 0 2 μm intracellular h2o2 and it induces an array of proteins that improve scavenging reactivate damaged enzymes suppress fenton chemistry and repair dna anjem and imlay 2012 mongkolsuk and helmann 2002 storz et al 1990 zheng et al 2001 one might expect the oxyr system to play an important role during uva stress however we observed no effect when the regulon was pre induced by expression of a constitutively active oxyr allele fig 8 a when oxyr was deleted cells exhibited a moderate increase in sensitivity this effect was substantially smaller than that caused by rpos deletion rt pcr showed that the oxyr controlled katg gene was strongly induced by uva illumination but tellingly a katg lacz fusion showed little translation fig 8b we infer that rigorously starved cells have little capacity to induce proteins including defensive enzymes therefore cells are better served by the rpos directed induction of defensive proteins as cells approach stationary phase this preemptive strategy can defend cells against whatever stresses might subsequently arise for this reason rpos appears to play a larger role in resisting water sterilization than does oxyr 3 7 evidence that uva provides electrons that drive fenton mediated damage fenton chemistry generates dna damage that can be fixed by base excision and or recombinational repair pathways to this end a series of tests with dna repair mutants was performed with strains lacking different repair mechanisms uva exposure was highly lethal to a reca mutant and less so to a xtha nfo double mutant fig 9 a the latter strain lacks exonuclease iii and endonuclease iv two enzymes that complete the repair of oxidized dna bases and of frank strand breaks chan and weiss 1987 daviet et al 2007 demple et al 1986 golan et al 2010 ishchenko et al 2006 in growing cells which have been the focus of repair studies the latter enzymes play an important role it is not clear why they have less impact here however the sensitivity of the reca mutant establishes that uva exposure creates potentially lethal levels of dna damage most exponentially growing wild type cells can tolerate micromolar intracellular h2o2 without any loss of viability therefore while uva deactivates scavenging enzymes and stimulates h2o2 production those actions alone might not be expected to kill cells we tested this idea by exposing starved suspended cells to h2o2 using a protocol designed to maintain substantial cytoplasmic h2o2 fig 9b hpx mutants did not lose viability during 10 h of exposure to 10 μm h2o2 the experiment was also conducted with scavenging proficient cells with intermittent measurement and supplementation to sustain 8 μm h2o2 again there was no loss of viability even for the reca mutant these h2o2 doses match or exceed the amount of h2o2 that is formed during their exposure to uva light fig s10 indicating that the toxicity of uva depends upon more than just the intracellular accumulation of h2o2 in fact previous studies have shown that intracellular h2o2 alone does not create dna damage in starved cells for lack of reducing equivalents to drive fenton chemistry imlay and linn 1986 we hypothesize that uva exposure may make electrons available to iron through routes that are not yet clear vide infra discussion section 4 discussion solar disinfection is a very effective and simple way to sterilize water in resource poor regions and a great part relies on the uva light transmitted into the vessel nelson et al 2018 this study demonstrated that uva creates oxidative stress that arises from multiple effects the generation of intracellular h2o2 the inactivation of the catalases that normally keep h2o2 within tolerable limits and the production of singlet oxygen a thorough understanding of the underlying molecular events may allow the process to be improved while an integrated graphical proposition for the e coli killing mechanisms under uva light is provided in fig 10 while this study measured the rate of h2o2 formation it did not identify the mechanism ground state molecular oxygen is a triplet species and the resultant spin restriction dictates that it must accept two electrons consecutively rather than concertedly in order to be reduced to h2o2 in aerobic unstressed cells h2o2 is continuously formed when molecular oxygen collides with the reduced flavin and metal cofactors of redox enzymes gardner and fridovich 1992 gaudu et al 1994 griffith et al 2004 imlay 2009 the consequent adventitious transfer of one electron generates superoxide and transfer of a second electron produces h2o2 in wild type e coli the titers of scavenging enzymes particularly of ahpcf are calibrated so the steady state level of h2o2 is restricted to approximately 50 nm too low to disrupt cell functions imlay 2013 the aforementioned limit is breached during uva irradiation one route by which uva may stimulate ros formation is by the promotion of electrons on flavin cofactors to high energy orbitals the electron hole thus created can be filled by electron transfer from other organic metabolites in this way a flavosemiquinone anion is formed this species is an outstanding reductant that transfers electrons directly to oxygen this mechanism is used to generate superoxide in sod activity gels given the high absorptivity of oxidized flavins in the uva spectrum and their high content inside bacteria this is a plausible mechanism of ros formation in a starved cell which otherwise has little metabolic electron flow alternatively energy transfer from excited chromophores to ground state molecular oxygen can trigger electron flipping converting 3o2 to 1o2 baier et al 2006 singlet oxygen unlike triplet oxygen can accept an electron pair and can directly oxidize a wide range of biomolecules e g guanine at a reaction rate of the order of 106 m 1 s 1 cadet et al 2006 when it does h2o2 is the product this scheme of h2o2 formation would explain how both 1o2 and h2o2 contribute to cell killing additional experimentation is planned to test these models the data show that cell death coincides with the loss of h2o2 scavenging and the accumulation of profuse h2o2 peroxidases lose activity first our data show that even in non growing cells there is enough low level metabolism that ahpcf and ccp make contributions to h2o2 clearance we think that the inactivation of these systems by uva is likely to follow from its ability to damage the metabolic pathways that provide electrons an alternative is that uva directly excites the chromophores in ahpf a flavoprotein and ccp a diheme protein leading to the abstraction of electrons from the polypeptide damage to catalase appears to be more consequential and it has been observed previously researchers have previously observed that intracellular catalase was damaged when mammalian cells were treated with the combination of visible light and rose bengal a 1o2 generating photosensitizer lledías and hansberg 1999 interestingly uva alone was sufficient to cause damage too the nature of the injury whether the heme or the polypeptide was oxidized was not determined nor was it clear whether the injury differed when samples experienced rose bengal treatment versus uva alone the extreme sensitivity of reca mutants demonstrates that uva generates dna lesions and the sensitivity of dps mutants implicates fenton chemistry gardner and fridovich 1991 gonzález flecha and demple 1999 imlay 2009 are such lesions responsible for cell death in dps proficient and repair proficient cells the fact that iron supplements accelerate the death of wild type strains suggests that fenton chemistry underlies the death of these strains too it also offers a practical benefit the addition of trace 50 μm iron may improve sodis efficiency in the field a remaining uncertainty is the source of electrons that drive the reaction by reducing intracellular fe iii to fe ii superoxide was once thought to serve this role in log phase cells through its participation in the haber weiss reaction but subsequent work refuted that model indicating that superoxide levels are too low keyer and imlay 1996 instead electrons donors such as cysteine and free flavins were implicated park and imlay 2003 woodmansee and imlay 2002 however if uva triggers superoxide production through flavin excitation above it may be that it serves this purpose in this special situation alternatively it is chemically reasonable that excited chromophores themselves play this role either mechanism might explain why uva causes cell death much more effectively than does h2o2 stress alone 5 conclusions this work has demonstrated that uva irradiation initiates germicidal processes we provide evidence to address three critical questions that pertain to the phenomenon firstly does uva increase ros levels uva caused inactivation of the ros regulating enzymes of e coli we measured the photo production of h2o2 within cells we showed that this h2o2 subsequently accumulates inside cells when the ros scavengers lose activity and proved its participation as a mediator of damage we conclude that there is more than one critical target but as long as h2o2 is not accumulated it cannot mediate the cells inactivation a separate pathway role of 1o2 was proven via kinetic isotope effect studies hence uva effectively increases intracellular ros generation h2o2 1o2 superoxide secondly given that ros increase inside the cell do they actually damage the cell we proved that ros accumulation is necessary but not sufficient fe is a required counterpart in the process that produces important damages rpos was critical in enta and dps regulation which modulate iron assimilation and storage extra iron into the cell was always detrimental indicating the involvement of fenton mediated damage while iron sequestration is a key defense so the uva mediated increase in ros levels results in cell damages finally is this damage enough to kill the cell uva produced ros damages the cell in critical functions most notably the dna integrity the reca deficient mutant presented one of the most adverse reactions to light considering the dps function the elevated h2o2 and the diffusion controlled manner of ho attacks it leads to the conclusion that dna is severely damaged among other targets hence uva increases ros levels to a level that can fatally damage the cell in natural waters the pace of sodis can be affected by the presence of organic or inorganic matter nevertheless this work evidences that uva exposure triggers both intracellular ros formation and the inactivation of ros scavengers while both fenton chemistry and 1o2 mediate damage these observations also provide some guidance into experimental approaches that might resolve the details with the ultimate goal of manipulating irradiation parameters in order to improve sodis effectiveness the present work focused upon a lab grown e coli strain and some differences are expected with naturally occurring e coli strains coliforms and or other species e g pseudomonas salmonella however the key players in e coli inactivation heme chromophores catalases peroxidases dna repair enzymes and iron storage proteins are ubiquitous among microbes providing confidence that the overall process is likely to resemble the one that was examined here finally since the addition of fe and the formation of h2o2 improved sterilization these data may be transferrable to other catalytic disinfection processes such as the application of advanced oxidation processes

15725,solar disinfection sodis was probed for its underlying mechanism when escherichia coli was exposed to uva irradiation the dominant solar fraction acting in sodis process cells exhibited a shoulder before death ensued this profile resembles cell killing by hydrogen peroxide h2o2 indeed the use of specialized strains revealed that uva exposure triggers intracellular h2o2 formation the resultant h2o2 stress was especially impactful because uva also inactivated the processes that degrade h2o2 peroxidases through the suppression of metabolism and catalases through direct enzyme damage cell killing was enhanced when water was replaced with d2o suggesting that singlet oxygen plays a role possibly as a precursor to h2o2 and or as the mediator of catalase damage uva was especially toxic to mutants lacking miniferritin dps or recombinational dna repair reca enzymes indicating that reactions between ferrous iron and uva generated h2o2 lead to lethal dna damage importantly experiments showed that the intracellular accumulation of h2o2 alone is insufficient to kill cells therefore uva must do something more to enable death a possibility is that uva stimulates the reduction of intracellular ferric iron to its ferrous form either by stimulating o 2 formation or by generating photoexcited electron donors these observations and methods open the door to follow up experiments that can probe the mechanisms of h2o2 formation catalase inactivation and iron reduction of immediate utility the data highlight the intracellular pathways formed under uva light during sodis and that the presence of micromolar iron accelerates the rate at which radiation disinfects water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords solar disinfection sodis reactive oxygen species ros e coli knock out mutants inactivation mechanism 1 introduction solar disinfection sodis is a long recognized drinking water potabilization method consisting of a vessel recipient in which water is introduced and is exposed to natural sunlight during one day or two depending on the climatological conditions mcguigan et al 2012 sodis efficacy is affected by multiple parameters including the bottle material its thickness and size keogh et al 2015 ozores diez et al 2020 the sunlight irradiance temperature and exposure time berney et al 2006a ndounla et al 2014 nelson et al 2018 as well as water quality indicators such as the turbidity organic and inorganic matter content and oxygen level keogh et al 2017 kohantorabi et al 2019 rommozzi et al 2020 further different microorganisms can manifest very different responses to sunlight with bacteria and viruses being more susceptible than protozoa fisher et al 2012 garcía gil et al 2020a gómez couso et al 2010 hence although simple in application the sodis process has been an intriguing black box process with many research axes for study to attempt to simplify the microorganism inactivation process one can distinguish thermal and optical modes thermal inactivation processes depend upon photon absorption by water mainly in the infrared region of the solar spectrum a consequent increase in water temperature is sufficient to inactivate some microbes this process has been well characterized the thermal only action can denature intracellular proteins damage dna and the cell wall and ultimately inactivate the organism baatout et al 2005 blaustein et al 2013 the optical pathways on the other hand are far more complex and intriguing the uvc component of solar radiation is fully absorbed by atmospheric ozone frederick 2015 and the trace uvb that reaches the earth s surface does not usually penetrate the glass and plastic containers that are used for sodis for example depending on the bottle composition the uvb irradiation 290 320 nm might be filtered out as in the case of polyethylene terephthalate pet or borosilicate whereas polycarbonate moderately permits its passage garcía gil et al 2020b since sodis is mainly applied in resource poor regions the materials commonly used are pet and glass which with minor deviations allow part of uva visible and infrared light to penetrate the material uva light 320 400 nm is effective at sterilizing water and many proposals have been offered regarding the underlying mechanism s early e coli experiments demonstrated that in contrast to uvc or uvb uva has mild direct effects on the dna cadet et al 2009 pfeifer et al 2005 in the past twenty years many research groups have suggested plausible indirect pathways that lead to bacterial inactivation with substantial focus upon the possibility that cells are killed by oxidative stress previous research detected the inactivation of some enzymes that scavenge reactive oxygen species ros and observed damage to proteins and the cell membrane berney et al 2006a 2006b bosshard et al 2010a 2010b catalase and superoxide dismutase degrade the h2o2 and superoxide radical o 2 that is normally generated inside the cell imlay 2008 2003 and a series of studies modeled the correlation of e coli inactivation to the loss of scavenging enzymes functions castro alférez et al 2017a garcía gil et al 2022a besides the direct effect of light during sodis temperature increase can play a key role in inactivating scavenging enzymes other researchers have unraveled the synergistic effect that temperature has on uva mediated inactivation castro alférez et al 2017b garcía gil et al 2022b and since h2o2 is a good marker of oxidative stress itself imlay 2019 the detrimental effect that h2o2 accumulation has on bacterial survival castro alférez et al 2016 these explanations on light h2o2 and temperature form an general overview of picture on the mechanisms of sodis linking it with an intracellular oxidative process giannakis et al 2016a 2016b superoxide and h2o2 can inactivate some metalloenzymes by damaging their iron cofactors but these direct effects are bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal imlay 2013 imlay et al 1988 instead the killing effect of oxidative stress typically arises from dna damage which is driven by the fenton reaction this chemistry generates the hydroxyl radical h o which unlike o 2 or h2o2 is a strong enough oxidant to directly damage dna the photo assisted fenton reaction hereon photo fenton process involves the standard reaction eq 1 but it also depends upon photo assisted fe reduction so that iron might act catalytically in producing hydroxyl radicals those events may be driven by the oxidation of an iron ligand eq 2 or by any other photo induced source of electrons that might reduce fe3 to fe2 eq 3 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h h o 2 f e 3 l light f e 2 l ox 3 f e 3 e l i g h t f e 2 the early approaches indicated a critical role of catalase and superoxide dismutase in protecting cells from uva but the interpretation was muddied by the uvb portion emitted from the lamps in those experiments complicating comparison to later findings eisenstark and perrot 1987 hoerter et al 1989 smyk randall et al 1993 the role of h2o2 in the toxicity of uva was later supported by the hypersensitivity of catalase deficient cells fisher and nelson 2014 ng et al 2015 however although these studies supported the involvement of superoxide metals and h2o2 aspects remain unclear to appraise the fenton model it is important to compare the levels of ros during uva stress with the thresholds that make them bactericidal to this end we have employed an array of e coli mutants to clarify the intracellular uva mediated inactivation pathway from rates of ros generation to the identity of the oxidative targets we sought to address several critical questions i whether uva irradiation increases intracellular h2o2 generation and concentration ii whether the effect of h2o2 production is amplified by damage to scavenging enzymes and iii whether h2o2 formation is by itself sufficient to explain the toxicity of uva our data support the view that several effects of uva converge in driving cell damage 2 materials and methods 2 1 light source and reactor the uva irradiation used in the study was emitted from three 18 w philips tl d blb lamps with relatively narrowband emission peaking at 365 nm the emission spectrum of the lamps is provided in the supplementary fig s1 a 30 2 w m2 intensity was selected for its environmental relevance pizarro 1995 5 of solar light is uva and the sodis guidelines propose a 600 w m2 irradiance threshold for a successful application a metal case housing the uva lamps and ballasts isolated the experimental area and limited exposure to the laboratory environment fans placed on top of the case ensured cooling of the lamps and temperature control to ambient values 22 1 c during testing 5 cm diameter glass petri dishes containing the bacterial suspension were placed under uva light 2 cm away from the light source the dishes were covered with their uva transparent lids to prevent contamination 2 2 bacterial strains and growth the genotypes of strains used in this study are listed in supplementary table s1 standard p1 transduction thomason et al 2007 was used to prepare the mutant strains additional details are provided in supplementary text s1 strains that grow in aerobic conditions were routinely streaked from frozen stocks onto lb plates and incubated overnight at 37 c these master plates were stored at 4 c for two weeks and then prepared anew because h2o2 contaminates oxic plates li and imlay 2018 strains with diminished oxidative defenses were streaked onto lb plates and grown in anoxic conditions to avoid any possible outgrowth of genetically suppressed mutants overnight cultures in lb medium were prepared from the master plates these cultures were then centrifuged washed and diluted to the desired cell density into water prior to tests of uva sensitivity mohammadi et al 2021 ozores diez et al 2020 as indicated in the supplementary text s2 our goal was to test uva action on cells under conditions in which reactive oxygen species were exclusively generated by intracellular chromophores double deionized water ddh2o was used to avoid external chromophores and inconsistency in water quality all experiments were repeated twice at minimum usually three times comprising biological replicates and each unique test e g strain was performed in duplicate to obtain statistical replicates for the determination of cfu ml at each point two or three consecutive dilutions were plated the results report the average the detection limit dl of the method and the standard deviation from the mean some experiments were conducted with strains that had been grown under anoxic conditions those cultures were prepared in a coy anaerobic chamber coy laboratory products inc containing an atmosphere of approximately 90 n2 5 h2 5 co2 and 100 ppm o2 the viability of cells during subsequent aerobic uva or h2o2 exposure was assessed by diluting the cells and plating them in top agar on anoxic lb 0 2 glucose plates the viable cells were counted manually after incubation for 24 h at 37 c under anoxic conditions more details on the growth and experimental preparation with anoxic strains can be found in the supplementary text s2 for test of exponentially growing e coli overnight cultures in lb medium were diluted to 0 01 od600 in fresh lb after growth for 4 5 generations od600 0 1 0 2 the cells were collected washed and then diluted down to 0 002 in water prior to illumination in order to assess the role of fe in the sensitization of e coli photo inactivation 50 or 100 μm fe2 from feso4 7h2o was added in the lb growth medium during overnight growth the stationary phase cells were harvested washed and diluted down to od600 0 002 2 3 experimental techniques h2o2 determination protein measurements galactosidase activity and respirometry a comprehensive list of chemicals and reagents is provided in the supplementary table s2 measurements of h2o2 were performed by the horseradish peroxidase amplex red method hrp ar seaver and imlay 2001a in the presence of h2o2 hrp oxidizes ar to resorufin its fluorescence was measured by a rf mini 150 fluorometer shimadzu and converted to h2o2 concentration using a standard curve the method details are provided at the supplementary material supplementary text s3 that supplement also provides detailed protocols for h2o2 scavenging tests h2o2 stress tests and h2o2 photo generation tests expression of katg was determined using a katg lacz fusion expression in both a wild type wt and an hpx strain the β galactosidase activity was assayed using ortho nitrophenyl d galactopyranoside onpg korshunov et al 2020 the protein concentration of cell lysates was determined using the bradford assay kruger 2009 details can be found in supplementary text s4 the katg and gmk mrna was quantified by qrt pcr details can be found in supplementary text s5 measurements of consumption of oxygen by e coli wt cells at 37 c was performed with a clark electrode micrometrix 10 system the initial cell density was 0 2 od600 the electrode was standardized using air saturated water 210 μm o2 at 37 c and na2s2o4 to create anoxia one ml of sample was withdrawn at intervals 0 3h 6h respiration rates were derived by normalizing oxygen consumption rates to cell density 3 results 3 1 involvement of oxidative stress in uva toxicity the ahpc ahpf katg and kate are the genes encoding primary cell defenses against h2o2 stress and soda sodb and sodc against superoxide radicals that dismute to h2o2 hence if the illumination by uva causes ros increase then the knock out mutants will be more sensitive to this end the inactivation kinetics of the wild type wt strain was compared with single and multiple knock out mutants for the genes responsible for expressing catalases and peroxidases fig 1 a in order to determine the efficiency with which uva light sterilizes water e coli cells were grown overnight to stationary phase in aerated lb medium washed with buffer and suspended at low density 0 002 od600 in distilled water the subsequent inactivation of the wild type strain by uva irradiation was described by a lag phase followed by a steady decrease in cfu ml fig 1a no resistant sub population was evident during at least five logs of killing the optical density and cellular protein content was minimally affected indicating that cells did not lyse fig s2 this pattern of killing contrasts with the single hit kinetics of uvc radiation moreno andrés et al 2018 in which bacteria lose viability due to direct dna damage notably the broad shoulder resembled that of cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide h2o2 imlay and linn 1986 to test the possibility that uva generates lethal oxidative stress the experiment was repeated with strains that lack the ability to scavenge cytoplasmic superoxide or h2o2 a soda sodb mutant sod lacks both its manganese and iron cofactored superoxide dismutases while an hpx mutant lacks nadh peroxidase encoded by ahpcf and the catalases encoded by katg and kate both expressed in stationary phase cells but the latter being the main one loewen et al 1985 schellhorn and hassan 1988 we verify that both strains died more rapidly than their parent levén et al 1990 anaerobically grown cells possess lower titers of defensive enzymes compan and touati 1993 indeed when cells were precultured anaerobically but were aerobically irradiated they were substantially more susceptible to aerobic uva irradiation fig 1b these data confirm that uva creates oxidative stress that is mediated by superoxide and h2o2 interestingly the killing curves of the ros scavenging mutants were reproducibly biphasic fig 1a b sod strain with a rapid killing phase followed by a shoulder that was eventually saturated that same profile is evident in h2o2 treated cells imlay and linn 1986 in the latter case the initial killing is known to result from oxidative dna damage while the target involved in the second phase has not yet been identified 3 2 uva both generates h2o2 and inactivates the enzymes that scavenge it e coli like many bacteria uses a consortium of peroxidases and catalases to protect itself from h2o2 sen and imlay 2021 in fed cells the nadh peroxidase encoded by ahpcf is the primary scavenger of endogenous h2o2 when the cell is exposed to higher levels of h2o2 ahpcf is saturated and induction of the katg catalase occurs driven by the oxyr transcription factor when e coli enters stationary phase the alternative kate catalase is induced schellhorn and hassan 1988 finally when hypoxic cells sense exogenous h2o2 they induce cytochrome c peroxidase ccp which allows the cell to use h2o2 as an alternative respiratory substrate khademian and imlay 2017 in the growth protocol used in our experiments the cells were likely to contain significant levels of ahpcf katg and kate whereas ccp would be minor we sought to identify the enzymes that were important during uva exposure the degradation of h2o2 by the unirradiated cell suspensions was measured using strains that lacked particular scavenging enzymes to optimize these measurements the experiments were conducted at a higher cell density 0 2 od600 control experiments confirmed that the inactivation kinetics approximated what had been seen previously supplementary text s6 supplementary figs s3 s5 wild type cells degraded virtually all of the added 10 μm h2o2 in 5 min conversely a strain lacking all four enzymes degraded only about 20 in 60 min fig 2 a the small residual scavenging is likely due to an adventitious peroxidase activity of cytochrome oxidases khademian and imlay 2017 the following approximate rates of h2o2 scavenging is found relative to wt detailed nm s rates are available in supplementary table s3 ahp 123 of wt wt kate 42 katg 39 kat 21 hpx 11 mutants possessing either katg or kate alone exhibited approximately half as much scavenging activity as wild type cells whereas a katg kate mutant possessing only ahpcf and ccp was poor at h2o2 clearance the ahpcf mutant degrades h2o2 even more quickly than do wt cells as in the absence of ahpcf the endogenous h2o2 accumulates enough during growth to activate oxyr and induce catalase seaver and imlay 2001a when cells are subsequently starved which diminishes the activity of nadh dependent ahpcf catalase becomes the primary scavenging enzyme thus the catalase rich ahpcf mutant is counterintuitively more effective at scavenging h2o2 than is the wt cell in sum these data indicate that in washed stationary phase cells the catalases provide the majority of h2o2 clearance ahpcf provides a lesser amount and ccp has very little effect this result makes sense stationary phase cells have low metabolic activity which is likely to minimize the nadh pools available to drive the ahpcf and ccp peroxidases in contrast catalases do not require a reductant and remain fully active in quiescent cells the scavenging activities were then monitored during the course of uva exposure strikingly the overall h2o2 scavenging rate of wild type cells progressively declined fig 2b over a period of five hours this activity fell about five fold the activities of the specific scavenging enzymes were then tracked using mutants fig 2c f see also supplementary text s7 the catalase expressing kate katg cells exhibited a loss of scavenging that approximately paralleled that of the wild type parent cells expressing only ahp or ccp lost scavenging activity more quickly and even the trace scavenging observed in the hpx ccp mutant disappeared within an hour the latter effects might be expected if uva exposure poisons the residual low level metabolism of these cells and indeed respiration measurements showed that illumination blocked oxygen consumption fig s6 in contrast the loss of scavenging in catalase containing cells seemed likely to reflect photon mediated damage to katg and kate the order or resistance to uva is wt kat strains ahp hpx ccp cell lysates were prepared and enzyme assays confirmed that uva treatment gradually eliminated intracellular catalase activity with half being eliminated in the first hour fig s7 this effect primarily reflected the hypersensitivity of kate which lost virtually all activity within the first hour in contrast it required 3 h to diminish katg activity by more than half fig s8 the uva sensitivity of kate is remarkable as this is the scavenging enzyme that predominates in the non growing cells against which water sterilization techniques are typically directed hence we can provisionally conclude that an order of importance for the protection of the cell among the studied peroxidases ccp ahpcf and catalases katg kate is ccp ahp kate katg wt the loss of scavenging ability is in itself not lethal to e coli as manifested by the viability of the hpx ccp null mutants for this loss to be consequential cells must also be exposed to a significant source of h2o2 accordingly we measured the level of h2o2 in cell suspensions both with and without uva exposure fig 3 if it is not scavenged endogenous hydrogen peroxide being uncharged crosses bacterial membranes and appears in the extracellular medium see also supplementary text st3 the equilibration of h2o2 across the membrane allows measurements of extracellular h2o2 concentrations to be good proxies for the intracellular ones seaver and imlay 2001b hydrogen peroxide did not accumulate in suspensions of non scavenging hpx mutants in the dark fig 3a as the metabolism of unfed cells is too minimal to produce endogenous reactive oxygen species however h2o2 was steadily produced when the suspension was irradiated its generation depended upon the cells themselves rather than vessel material as h2o2 formation was undetectable when cells were 100 fold more dilute fig 3a when wild type scavenging proficient cells were irradiated h2o2 accumulated only at the later time points fig 3b this pattern mirrors the gradual loss of scavenging ability when various strains were compared it became clear that h2o2 accumulation occurred earlier in strains lacking catalase as expected from the greater uva sensitivity of peroxidase functions fig 3c therefore the data indicate that uva not only drives h2o2 formation but also inactivates the enzymes that normally keep its concentration low 3 3 cytoplasmic superoxide accelerates cell killing when assessing the uva mediated e coli inactivation and the photo production of h2o2 the strains lacking superoxide dismutases presented a high sensitivity but also high h2o2 production fig 3b hence in this section special focus has been given in the unveiling of these events fig 4 a summarizes the experiments with sod mutants namely soda mnsod deficient sodb fesod deficient the double soda sodb mutant sod and the sodc cuznsod deficient from a distinct strain from the others assessed separately fig 4b an over expressing fesod strain was also assessed fig 4b fig 4a shows that cells lacking the two cytoplasmic sods are especially sensitive to uva both superoxide dismutases have been previously found to alleviate di hydroxyacid dehydratase from oxidative stress damage as well as reduction of iron toxicity brown et al 1995 touati et al 1995 the single mutants exhibit intermediate sensitivity in contrast the periplasmic h2o2 resistant sod benov et al 1995 korshunov and imlay 2006 2002 encoded by sodc does not affect the killing rate fig 4b because superoxide is a charged anion that does not cross membranes korshunov and imlay 2002 these data indicate that cytoplasmic superoxide is involved in killing superoxide directly damages the metal centers of enzymes releasing loose iron into the cytoplasm where it can catalyze the formation of hydroxyl radicals from h2o2 keyer and imlay 1996 interestingly h2o2 was also released more quickly into the medium from sod mutants figs 3b and s9 the basis of this effect is not clear 3 4 involvement of singlet oxygen 1o2 the illumination of some chromophores can lead them to transfer energy to molecular oxygen generating singlet oxygen as a product singlet oxygen is a potent divalent oxidant that can attack dna membranes and proteins its production can be lethal to bacteria mosteo et al 2020 szocs et al 1999 it is also known that in e coli the porphyrins that are the precursors to heme can act as photosensitizers through their capacity for 1o2 formation epe 1991 hessling et al 2017 we tested whether 1o2 is involved in uva toxicity by partially substituting d2o for h2o 50 as in porras et al 2018 water can quench 1o2 and this effect is lessened in d2o the water replacement substantially narrowed the shoulder of the killing curve fig 5 a further supplementation of cell suspensions with δ aminolevulinic acid a porphyrin precursor increased sensitivity fig 5b these results indicate that 1o2 plays a role in solar disinfection interestingly 1o2 has been observed to damage catalase in other cell systems lledías and hansberg 1999 3 5 involvement of iron in phototoxicity studies of h2o2 stress have indicated that its lethal action is due to its participation in the fenton reaction which generates hydroxyl radicals that can damage dna imlay et al 1988 in order to generate hydroxyl radical fe2 must transfer an electron to h2o2 therefore we sought to test whether i fe is involved in the key damage and ii if an h2o2 increase and the accordant ho increase damages enzymes and or dna we observed that mutants lacking dps a miniferritin that sequesters iron during h2o2 stress were especially sensitive to uva fig 6 a dps can protect cells dukan and touati 1996 martinez and kolter 1997 since it uses h2o2 as a co substrate when it stores fe ii as fe iii rychlewski et al 1999 zhao et al 2002 so its activity was presumably enabled by the intracellular h2o2 that uva generates mahaseth and kuzminov 2015 park et al 2005 in contrast to dps the bacterial ferritins bfr and ftn which are involved in iron acquisition dubrac and touati 2000 niederhoffer et al 1990 had no apparent effect on killing rate fig 6b the transcription of dps is strongly induced when cells enter stationary phase the sigma factor rpos triggers this induction and indeed rpos mutants were also rapidly killed the sensitivity of the rpos strain was greater than that of dps mutants likely because rpos also induces kate patten et al 2004 weber et al 2005 the induction of dps by rpos also may explain why cells grown into stationary phase which activates rpos maciąg et al 2011 are more resistant to uva than are exponentially growing cells black solid vs dashed curves fig 7 a reciprocal experiments confirmed the involvement of iron when fe was added during cell growth iron supplements accelerated the rate at which uva killed wild type cells fig 7a e either stationary or exponentially growing ones iron addition further sensitized hpx dps and sod strains as well indicating that the effect was not due to disruption of any of these functions interestingly a siderophore biosynthetic mutant enta was hypersensitive due to the absence of siderophore dependent iron import this strain is likely to become iron starved as it approaches stationary phase and the feo transporter would be induced as a consequence kammler et al 1993 we suspect that the subsequent addition of iron would allow it to enter the cell especially rapidly through this importer 3 6 the oxyr regulon offered minimal protection against uva like most bacteria e coli features a defensive regulon that offers strong protection against environmental h2o2 the oxyr transcription factor is activated by as little as 0 2 μm intracellular h2o2 and it induces an array of proteins that improve scavenging reactivate damaged enzymes suppress fenton chemistry and repair dna anjem and imlay 2012 mongkolsuk and helmann 2002 storz et al 1990 zheng et al 2001 one might expect the oxyr system to play an important role during uva stress however we observed no effect when the regulon was pre induced by expression of a constitutively active oxyr allele fig 8 a when oxyr was deleted cells exhibited a moderate increase in sensitivity this effect was substantially smaller than that caused by rpos deletion rt pcr showed that the oxyr controlled katg gene was strongly induced by uva illumination but tellingly a katg lacz fusion showed little translation fig 8b we infer that rigorously starved cells have little capacity to induce proteins including defensive enzymes therefore cells are better served by the rpos directed induction of defensive proteins as cells approach stationary phase this preemptive strategy can defend cells against whatever stresses might subsequently arise for this reason rpos appears to play a larger role in resisting water sterilization than does oxyr 3 7 evidence that uva provides electrons that drive fenton mediated damage fenton chemistry generates dna damage that can be fixed by base excision and or recombinational repair pathways to this end a series of tests with dna repair mutants was performed with strains lacking different repair mechanisms uva exposure was highly lethal to a reca mutant and less so to a xtha nfo double mutant fig 9 a the latter strain lacks exonuclease iii and endonuclease iv two enzymes that complete the repair of oxidized dna bases and of frank strand breaks chan and weiss 1987 daviet et al 2007 demple et al 1986 golan et al 2010 ishchenko et al 2006 in growing cells which have been the focus of repair studies the latter enzymes play an important role it is not clear why they have less impact here however the sensitivity of the reca mutant establishes that uva exposure creates potentially lethal levels of dna damage most exponentially growing wild type cells can tolerate micromolar intracellular h2o2 without any loss of viability therefore while uva deactivates scavenging enzymes and stimulates h2o2 production those actions alone might not be expected to kill cells we tested this idea by exposing starved suspended cells to h2o2 using a protocol designed to maintain substantial cytoplasmic h2o2 fig 9b hpx mutants did not lose viability during 10 h of exposure to 10 μm h2o2 the experiment was also conducted with scavenging proficient cells with intermittent measurement and supplementation to sustain 8 μm h2o2 again there was no loss of viability even for the reca mutant these h2o2 doses match or exceed the amount of h2o2 that is formed during their exposure to uva light fig s10 indicating that the toxicity of uva depends upon more than just the intracellular accumulation of h2o2 in fact previous studies have shown that intracellular h2o2 alone does not create dna damage in starved cells for lack of reducing equivalents to drive fenton chemistry imlay and linn 1986 we hypothesize that uva exposure may make electrons available to iron through routes that are not yet clear vide infra discussion section 4 discussion solar disinfection is a very effective and simple way to sterilize water in resource poor regions and a great part relies on the uva light transmitted into the vessel nelson et al 2018 this study demonstrated that uva creates oxidative stress that arises from multiple effects the generation of intracellular h2o2 the inactivation of the catalases that normally keep h2o2 within tolerable limits and the production of singlet oxygen a thorough understanding of the underlying molecular events may allow the process to be improved while an integrated graphical proposition for the e coli killing mechanisms under uva light is provided in fig 10 while this study measured the rate of h2o2 formation it did not identify the mechanism ground state molecular oxygen is a triplet species and the resultant spin restriction dictates that it must accept two electrons consecutively rather than concertedly in order to be reduced to h2o2 in aerobic unstressed cells h2o2 is continuously formed when molecular oxygen collides with the reduced flavin and metal cofactors of redox enzymes gardner and fridovich 1992 gaudu et al 1994 griffith et al 2004 imlay 2009 the consequent adventitious transfer of one electron generates superoxide and transfer of a second electron produces h2o2 in wild type e coli the titers of scavenging enzymes particularly of ahpcf are calibrated so the steady state level of h2o2 is restricted to approximately 50 nm too low to disrupt cell functions imlay 2013 the aforementioned limit is breached during uva irradiation one route by which uva may stimulate ros formation is by the promotion of electrons on flavin cofactors to high energy orbitals the electron hole thus created can be filled by electron transfer from other organic metabolites in this way a flavosemiquinone anion is formed this species is an outstanding reductant that transfers electrons directly to oxygen this mechanism is used to generate superoxide in sod activity gels given the high absorptivity of oxidized flavins in the uva spectrum and their high content inside bacteria this is a plausible mechanism of ros formation in a starved cell which otherwise has little metabolic electron flow alternatively energy transfer from excited chromophores to ground state molecular oxygen can trigger electron flipping converting 3o2 to 1o2 baier et al 2006 singlet oxygen unlike triplet oxygen can accept an electron pair and can directly oxidize a wide range of biomolecules e g guanine at a reaction rate of the order of 106 m 1 s 1 cadet et al 2006 when it does h2o2 is the product this scheme of h2o2 formation would explain how both 1o2 and h2o2 contribute to cell killing additional experimentation is planned to test these models the data show that cell death coincides with the loss of h2o2 scavenging and the accumulation of profuse h2o2 peroxidases lose activity first our data show that even in non growing cells there is enough low level metabolism that ahpcf and ccp make contributions to h2o2 clearance we think that the inactivation of these systems by uva is likely to follow from its ability to damage the metabolic pathways that provide electrons an alternative is that uva directly excites the chromophores in ahpf a flavoprotein and ccp a diheme protein leading to the abstraction of electrons from the polypeptide damage to catalase appears to be more consequential and it has been observed previously researchers have previously observed that intracellular catalase was damaged when mammalian cells were treated with the combination of visible light and rose bengal a 1o2 generating photosensitizer lledías and hansberg 1999 interestingly uva alone was sufficient to cause damage too the nature of the injury whether the heme or the polypeptide was oxidized was not determined nor was it clear whether the injury differed when samples experienced rose bengal treatment versus uva alone the extreme sensitivity of reca mutants demonstrates that uva generates dna lesions and the sensitivity of dps mutants implicates fenton chemistry gardner and fridovich 1991 gonzález flecha and demple 1999 imlay 2009 are such lesions responsible for cell death in dps proficient and repair proficient cells the fact that iron supplements accelerate the death of wild type strains suggests that fenton chemistry underlies the death of these strains too it also offers a practical benefit the addition of trace 50 μm iron may improve sodis efficiency in the field a remaining uncertainty is the source of electrons that drive the reaction by reducing intracellular fe iii to fe ii superoxide was once thought to serve this role in log phase cells through its participation in the haber weiss reaction but subsequent work refuted that model indicating that superoxide levels are too low keyer and imlay 1996 instead electrons donors such as cysteine and free flavins were implicated park and imlay 2003 woodmansee and imlay 2002 however if uva triggers superoxide production through flavin excitation above it may be that it serves this purpose in this special situation alternatively it is chemically reasonable that excited chromophores themselves play this role either mechanism might explain why uva causes cell death much more effectively than does h2o2 stress alone 5 conclusions this work has demonstrated that uva irradiation initiates germicidal processes we provide evidence to address three critical questions that pertain to the phenomenon firstly does uva increase ros levels uva caused inactivation of the ros regulating enzymes of e coli we measured the photo production of h2o2 within cells we showed that this h2o2 subsequently accumulates inside cells when the ros scavengers lose activity and proved its participation as a mediator of damage we conclude that there is more than one critical target but as long as h2o2 is not accumulated it cannot mediate the cells inactivation a separate pathway role of 1o2 was proven via kinetic isotope effect studies hence uva effectively increases intracellular ros generation h2o2 1o2 superoxide secondly given that ros increase inside the cell do they actually damage the cell we proved that ros accumulation is necessary but not sufficient fe is a required counterpart in the process that produces important damages rpos was critical in enta and dps regulation which modulate iron assimilation and storage extra iron into the cell was always detrimental indicating the involvement of fenton mediated damage while iron sequestration is a key defense so the uva mediated increase in ros levels results in cell damages finally is this damage enough to kill the cell uva produced ros damages the cell in critical functions most notably the dna integrity the reca deficient mutant presented one of the most adverse reactions to light considering the dps function the elevated h2o2 and the diffusion controlled manner of ho attacks it leads to the conclusion that dna is severely damaged among other targets hence uva increases ros levels to a level that can fatally damage the cell in natural waters the pace of sodis can be affected by the presence of organic or inorganic matter nevertheless this work evidences that uva exposure triggers both intracellular ros formation and the inactivation of ros scavengers while both fenton chemistry and 1o2 mediate damage these observations also provide some guidance into experimental approaches that might resolve the details with the ultimate goal of manipulating irradiation parameters in order to improve sodis effectiveness the present work focused upon a lab grown e coli strain and some differences are expected with naturally occurring e coli strains coliforms and or other species e g pseudomonas salmonella however the key players in e coli inactivation heme chromophores catalases peroxidases dna repair enzymes and iron storage proteins are ubiquitous among microbes providing confidence that the overall process is likely to resemble the one that was examined here finally since the addition of fe and the formation of h2o2 improved sterilization these data may be transferrable to other catalytic disinfection processes such as the application of advanced oxidation processes

europe lough neagh peipsi mälaren and china taihu chaohu dianchi bunting et al 2016 conley et al 2009 qin et al 2019 watson et al 2016 it is well recognized that the prevalence of eutrophication varies with respect to watershed geology climate land use landscape position connectivity and lake morphology each of which varies with lake district or ecoregion dolman et al 2016 heino et al 2021 hutchinson 1967 noted the difference of lake trophic state between upland and lowland however relatively little is known of how these factors interact particularly at continental scales birk et al 2020 in general human activities increase with decreasing altitude with plain and lowland areas being subject to intense agricultural activities urban development and population aggregation solheim et al 2019 as the morphological characteristics of basins are largely determined by underlying geology and land forms lakes in the plains and lowlands are often shallow scheffer and van nes 2007 as a result it may be difficult to isolate the unique effects of basin morphology and human activities on lake trophic state and water quality in some lake regions hutchinson 1967 taranu and gregory eaves 2008 further many studies to date have focused on single lakes rather than landscape patterns of inland waters across continental scales moorhouse et al 2018 instead a holistic understanding of lake eutrophication and improved lake management strategies requires freshwaters to be considered as part of an integrated socio ecological system dearing et al 2015 schindler 2006 in this study we analyzed 1151 lakes fig 1 with area 0 5 km2 located within the europe eu and the united states of america us to identify how lake morphology and regional social ecological systems interact to affect the susceptibility of lakes to anthropogenic eutrophication based on regional studies birk et al 2020 ho et al 2019 we predicted that trophic state would be greatest in shallow lakes due to elevated rates of external and internal nutrient loading particularly in areas with intensive human activities our goal was to develop a synthetic understanding of causes and correlates of lake eutrophication with particular emphasis on evaluation of how physical features interact with social activities as controls of the eutrophication of lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 lake data national lake surveys nla of us were conducted during may to september in 2007 and 2012 by the environmental protection agency of us epa to provide an unbiased assessment of lake quality similarly the eu multi lake survey emls was conducted in the summer of 2015 across 27 countries to obtain a deeper insight into the dynamics of cyanobacteria across europe mantzouki et al 2018 in the current study very small lakes area 0 5 km2 were excluded from this analysis because small lakes are in generally shallow with small and diverse watersheds and wide distribution that could mask the causal mechanisms regulating these ecosystems accordingly 215 689 and 407 lakes were extracted in the emls nla 2007 and nla 2012 respectively the 162 us lakes surveyed in both 2007 and 2012 were used to quantify sub decadal changes in lake trophic state and land use overall 1151 lakes with area 0 5 km2 were selected for the current study fig 1 2 2 lake features survey parameters included lake morphometry area maximum depth transparency secchi depth nutrients total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ammonia and algal abundance as chlorophyll a chl a and cyanobacterial toxins microcystins the physical chemical and biological variables of lakes were collected and analyzed in a fully standardized manner detailed in mantzouki et al 2018 and https www epa gov national aquatic resource surveys manuals used national aquatic resource surveys national 20lakes 20assessment survey lakes included a wide range in area depth elevation and trophic state table s1 of these 217 18 9 lakes were oligotrophic chl a 2 µg l 1 360 31 3 were mesotrophic 2 µg l 1 chl a 7 µg l 1 and 306 26 6 were eutrophic 7 µg l 1 chl a 30 µg l 1 with a further 268 23 3 classified as hypereutrophic chl a 30 µg l 1 table s2 2 3 ecoregions us and eu lakes were grouped into three main ecoregions plains and lowlands highlands and mountains as defined by us epa herlihy et al 2008 and de blij 1978 respectively in this database 240 lakes 20 9 are located in the highlands 308 26 8 lakes are located in the mountains and 603 lakes 52 3 are located in the plains and lowlands table s2 2 4 land use and land cover the nla data set of 2007 and 2012 included land use and land cover data for each lake watershed derived from the 2001 and 2006 national land cover database nlcd fry et al 2011 homer et al 2007 respectively according to the methods of nlcd landsat images with a spatial resolution of 30 m were obtained from the united states geological survey and were used to obtain lake area and land use data of each lake in the emls in the summer of 2015 the area and percentage of land use for each lake watershed was characterized for eight types including developed agriculture planted cultivated water barren forest shrubland herbaceous and wetlands in the present study land use is further divided into human land developed agriculture and natural land water barren forest shrubland herbaceous wetlands 2 5 trophic state index key indicators of water quality are the concentrations of chl a and nutrients in particular tp and tn as well as water transparency secchi depth accordingly trophic state index tsi of carlson 1977 can be calculated using each measure in this paper we calculated a mean value from all three tsi chl a tp and secchi and used that as our metric of trophic state at each lake the tsi were calculated by 1 tsi secchi 10 6 lnsecchi ln 2 2 tsi tp 10 6 ln 48 tp ln 2 3 tsi chl a 10 6 2 04 0 68 lnchl a ln 2 where secchi is the depth of secchi disk transparency m tp and chl a are the concentrations of total phosphorus µg l 1 and chlorophyll a µg l 1 2 6 statistical analysis the decision tree heatmaps is a new type of integrated visualization of decision trees and heatmaps which provides a comprehensive data overview as well as model interpretation this integration uncovers meaningful patterns among the predictive features and highlights the important elements of decision trees including feature splits and several leaf node characteristics such as prediction value impurity and number of leaf samples in this study decision tree heatmaps were used to predict the threshold of different trophic states based on the interactions between ecoregion features land use and maximum lake depth using the package treeheatr in r 4 0 4 le and moore 2021 the relative cover of each of eight land cover types was estimated for each lake and their distribution with lake depth was estimated using generalized additive model in the mgcv package statistical differences of lake depth among ecoregions were examined with mann whitney u test because the distributions of lake depth were not normally distributed correlations among water depth trophic state nutrient input and land use variables were explored with spearman s correlation coefficient using the package stats pearson s chi square test was used to evaluate correlations among lake depth ecoregion land use and trophic state and cramer s v coefficients were calculated to evaluate the magnitude of the correlation all analyses performed in r 4 0 4 r core team 2021 the level of significance used for all tests was p 0 05 2 7 data

set of eu multi lake survey is available at https portal edirepository org nis mapbrowse packageid edi 176 5 3 results 3 1 distribution of lake depth among ecoregions maximum lake depth ranged from 0 5 m to 350 m with significant variation among ecoregions fig 2 in general lakes were significantly shallower in the plains and lowlands 8 8 8 8 m compared to the highlands 20 8 33 4 m and mountains 22 6 35 1 m fig 2a p 0 001 lakes located in the plain and lowland areas were generally shallow while deep lakes were frequently distributed in the mountain and highland regions fig 2b 3 2 relationships among lake depth land use and trophic state watersheds of shallow lakes were composed mainly of human influenced land use types while watersheds of deep lakes were frequently dominated by natural land use fig 3 a in this analysis the percentage of developed agriculture water herbaceous and wetlands exhibited a significant decreasing trend with increasing maximum lake depth while the opposite was observed for barren forest and shrubland covers fig 3a and b p 0 05 human land use was correlated negatively with lake depth spearman s r 0 21 p 0 001 while it was opposite for natural land use spearman s r 0 2 p 0 001 fig s1 in particular forest 34 5 28 5 and agriculture 21 5 23 7 were the two predominant land types both of which were correlated strongly to lake depth fig 3b p 0 001 lake productivity and microcystins showed a consistent negative correlation with the percentage of natural land use yet were correlated positively with human land fig 3b p 0 05 eutrophic conditions were mainly concentrated in shallow lakes fig 3c and d according to the tp chl a and secchi depth indices the trophic state index of lakes showed a significant decreasing trend with increasing depth fig 3c spearman s r 0 584 p 0 001 furthermore based on the lake trophic categories lake depth varied widely in both the oligotrophic and mesotrophic lake categories whereas eutrophic and hypereutrophic lakes were frequently confined to shallow water depths fig 3d 3 3 variations of land use and trophic state with lake depth from 2007 to 2012 based on the 162 lakes surveyed in both nla 2007 and nla 2012 the variations in land use and trophic state between 2007 and 2012 mainly distributed in shallow lakes while there were few marked variations in deep lakes fig 4 from 2007 to 2012 the average percentage of natural land decreased 0 06 2 5 overall whereas human influenced land use increased 0 05 2 5 these variations mainly occurred in shallow lake catchments while deep basins were relatively unchanged fig 4a moreover from 2007 to 2012 the values of tn tp secchi and chl a increased 0 07 0 56 mg l 1 0 008 0 21 mg l 1 0 09 1 37 m and 0 55 24 7 µg l 1 respectively table s3 similar to land use the variations of tn tp and chl a generally occurred in shallow lakes but deep lakes remain stable fig 4b overall lakes in the plain and lowland areas exhibited intensified eutrophication as chl a whereas water quality mainly improved in highland and mountain ecoregions table s3 3 4 relationships among lake depth ecoregion land use and trophic state decision tree heatmap analysis demonstrated that water depth was closely related to ecoregion and land use likely reflecting an intrinsic relationship between water depth and lake productivity fig 5 a for example lakes were eutrophic or hypereutrophic if their maximum depth was 13 8 m unless located in natural landscape of highland and mountain ecoregions fig 5a in contrast oligotrophic or mesotrophic lakes were routinely deeper than 13 8 m especially 34 1 m irrespective of ecoregion or land use within the lake catchment fig 5a correlation analysis revealed a significant association among lake depth ecoregion land use and trophic state table 1 χ 2 test p 0 001 80 6 lakes in the plains and lowlands were 13 8 m while deeper lakes were more common in the highland 41 2 and mountain 50 7 regions fig 5b similarly 83 3 lakes in human dominated watersheds were 13 8 m while lake depth varied widely in nature dominated landscapes fig 5b as well 63 2 of the lakes 13 8 m were eutrophic or hypereutrophic whereas only 19 8 of lakes 13 8 m depth were highly productive fig 5b furthermore 44 6 of 13 8 m lakes located in the mountain and highland areas and dominated by natural land were eutrophic and hypereutrophic compared to only 10 5 in lakes 13 8 m deep fig 5b however 33 3 of 13 8 m lakes in the plains and lowland regions and human dominant land were eutrophic compared to 82 8 of shallow lakes 13 8 m fig 5b accordingly although human land use in watersheds influences all lakes lake depth can act as a filter that modifies lake response to disturbance with greater influence of land use on water quality in shallow lakes 4 discussion a better understanding of the dynamic relationships between lake depth social and environmental phenomena is necessary to improve lake management strategies dearing et al 2015 randomized unequal probability surveys conducted by the us epa and emls provide unbiased estimates of lake eutrophication and allows us to infer the causal relationships between lake trophic state and environmental conditions needed to advance the restoration and protection of lakes stoddard et al 2016 our analysis suggests that lake depth is linked to the ecoregion and land use of lake ecosystems which largely determines the intensity of human activities and consequently lake productivity this information may help clarify why shallow lakes are prone to eutrophication and improve lake management strategies for a sustainable future the ecoregional characteristics of lake watersheds provide an important basis predicting the trophic state of lakes largely reflecting the underlying climatic soil topographical and hydrological characteristics tang et al 2020 generally in plain and lowland areas the terrain is flat and soil is naturally fertile with a well developed drainage system that is consequently subject to agricultural activities and urban development heino et al 2021 read et al 2015 solheim et al 2019 since the start of the 20th century the global expansion of agricultural activities and urbanization associated with widespread socio economic development is occurring in plain and lowland ecoregions resulting in marked changes in land cover and enhanced anthropogenic nutrient inputs beaver et al 2014 in contrast steep slopes and poor soil development in upland regions usually make lake watersheds unsuitable for agriculture and urban development aranguren riano et al 2018 indeed agricultural land use of lakes is dominant in the plains and lowlands 30 4 25 3 but not upland regions highlands 14 7 16 4 mountains 9 3 17 5 while forests are the main land cover at higher elevations highlands 59 3 20 9 mountains 41 4 28 2 than occur in plains and lowlands 21 2 23 0 fig s2 moreover compared to the lakes situated in upland regions the water temperature of lakes is generally higher in plain and lowland regions which could provide a favorable environment for cyanobacteria paerl and huisman 2008 agriculture is one of the most important drivers of lake eutrophication at a global scale nielsen et al 2012 contributing 84 of the p discharged into us surface waters carpenter et al 1998 however watersheds dominated by forest and natural vegetation generally export lower amounts of allochthonous material to surface waters nobre et al 2020 consistent with these patterns in this study 67 0 of lakes in plains and lowlands were eutrophic while only 27 6 of lakes in the upland areas were eutrophic table s2 as a result of limited land suitable for future agricultural expansion yet a growing human population fertilization and disturbance of plain and lowland regions is likely to intensify on a global basis tilman 1999 laurance et al 2014 for example according to nlcd 1 77 of land cover was mapped as changed from 2006 to 2011 of the continental united states which mainly occurred in the plains and lowlands of southeastern united states homer et al 2015 the largest net losses occurred in the forest classes 31 038 km2 while the land use of developed classes and cultivated crop increased 7 631 km2 and 696 km2 respectively homer et al 2015 indeed according to the nla 2012 the proportion of lakes in the most disturbed condition for tp were mainly 80 located in the northern plains as compared to the western mountains 17 while the southern plains exhibited the highest proportion of disturbed condition 41 6 based on chl a analysis in sharp contrast to the low proportion disturbed only 0 7 in the western mountain ecoregion usepa 2016 together these patterns suggest that lakes in the plain and lowland areas are both generally shallow and more susceptible to human activities whereas deep lakes are distributed mainly in mountain and highland regions with little anthropogenic nutrient input although external nutrient inputs are the main determinants of lake eutrophication effects of allochthonous nutrients will also be modified by in lake biogeochemical processes such as sedimentation export and sedimentary exchange all factors which vary strongly with water depth qin et al 2020 the susceptibility of lakes to anthropogenic eutrophication and water quality degradation may be more pronounced in shallow lakes richardson et al 2018 eutrophic shallow lakes generally have high catchment area to lake area or volume ratios and short water residence times which are particularly sensitive to anthropogenic forcing tammelin and kauppila 2018 further in shallow lakes strong water sediment interactions are more common and sediment is more prone to resuspension fig s3 leading to elevated internal nutrient loading and higher productivity havens and james 2005 in contrast deep lakes have a greater ability to dilute nutrients exported from watersheds fig s4 and may exhibit a slower response to eutrophication and other pollutants liu et al 2010 deep lakes also lose a greater proportion of nutrients through sedimentation due to generally longer water residence times and lower turbulence at depth brooks et al 2014 vollenweider 1975 not surprisingly the ratio of epilimnetic sediment to lake volume ratio is a parameter that predicts the retention and cycling of internal nutrients and generally decreases with increasing depth qin et al 2020 read et al 2015 in the present study the threshold of lake depth occurred at 13 8 m based on the interactions between ecoregion features land use and trophic state fig 5a in addition according to our analysis although watershed land use influences all lakes lake depth can act as a filter that modifies lake response to disturbance fig 5b with greater influence of land use on water quality in shallow lakes blenckner 2005 leavitt et al 2009 tammelin and kauppila 2018 taranu and gregory eaves 2008 therefore many shallow lakes have shifted between stable states from clear state macrophyte dominant to turbid state phytoplankton dominant as a result of anthropogenic or natural drivers janssen et al 2021 the alternative stable states in shallow lakes may further promote the nutrients release from macrophyte and sediment to increase the trophic state affecting key supporting provisioning regulating and cultural ecosystem services supplied by lakes scheffer and van nes 2007 our analyses suggest that lake depth correlates the effects of socio economic development and natural landscape features to regulate the susceptibility of lakes to anthropogenic stressors fig 6 in the future increased agricultural production to meet demands for food and energy will intensify both point and diffuse sources nutrients carpenter et al 2007 tomer et al 2013 many shallow lakes already exhibit eutrophic conditions yet lie in watersheds where further eutrophication may be an inevitable rather than an occasional occurrence consistent with this hypothesis eutrophication is extensively studied in many large relatively shallow lakes e g okeechobee winnipeg and erie yet continues to be the central factor reducing water quality despite intensive management bunting et al 2016 michalak et al 2013 zhang et al 2011 these lakes display many features typical of shallow freshwater ecosystem including lowland location high agricultural land use and symptoms of recently accelerated eutrophication havens and james 2005 similar patterns are also seen for other lakes in the basin of rivers havel and spree germany schönfelder and steinberg 2004 and the middle and lower reaches yangtze river basin in china e g lakes taihu and chaohu dearing et al 2012 these lakes lie in watersheds where rapid population growth and cultivation during the past 70 years has favoured eutrophication schönfelder and steinberg 2004 wang et al 2014 unlike natural lake ontogeny which leads to slow gradual changes as lakes infill human activities have greatly accelerated water eutrophication by altering external and internal nutrient supplies carpenter et al 1998 we propose that lakes now exist as coupled socio ecological systems in which water depth integrates economic societal and ecological factors related to lake production heino et al 2021 in fact the susceptibility of lake to anthropogenic eutrophication and consequently the risk of water quality issues is not the same for all lakes our findings suggest that shallow lakes are more susceptible to human forcing and are predisposed to receiving large quantities of nutrients in addition in shallow lakes even though external nutrient inputs have been controlled nutrients stored in the sediments can be continuously released to support high phytoplankton populations qin et al 2020 accordingly special attention should be given to shallow lakes that are at high risk of waters quality degradation borics et al 2013 yet may be more resistant to restoration compared to deep lakes martin et al 2011 tammelin and kauppila 2018 these findings could enhance our understanding of why the efforts in controlling lake eutrophication have failed in a number of shallow lakes but are often effective in deep lakes schindler et al 2016 this study convinces stakeholders to continue to invest in nutrient reductions despite slow rates of recovery in eutrophic shallow lakes overall societal expectations policy goals and management plans should reflect this observation 5 conclusion lake eutrophication is a great international concern because of its economic and ecological consequences our findings demonstrate that lake depth correlates socio ecological systems as well as lake susceptibility to potential anthropogenic stressors and that shallow lakes exhibit disproportionately degraded water quality and trophic state accordingly freshwater management will become increasingly necessary for shallow lakes this information may help clarify why shallow lakes are prone to eutrophication and why some efforts to control eutrophication have resulted in frustratingly slow or modest effects in shallow productive lakes this study helps set realistic goals and adjusts community expectations to advance the protection and restoration of lakes globally it may be a challenge that convincing stakeholders continue to invest in nutrient reductions without evidence of rapid improvement but it is necessary for long term water quality improvement we hope that these findings will increase understanding for limnologists stakeholders and

europe lough neagh peipsi mälaren and china taihu chaohu dianchi bunting et al 2016 conley et al 2009 qin et al 2019 watson et al 2016 it is well recognized that the prevalence of eutrophication varies with respect to watershed geology climate land use landscape position connectivity and lake morphology each of which varies with lake district or ecoregion dolman et al 2016 heino et al 2021 hutchinson 1967 noted the difference of lake trophic state between upland and lowland however relatively little is known of how these factors interact particularly at continental scales birk et al 2020 in general human activities increase with decreasing altitude with plain and lowland areas being subject to intense agricultural activities urban development and population aggregation solheim et al 2019 as the morphological characteristics of basins are largely determined by underlying geology and land forms lakes in the plains and lowlands are often shallow scheffer and van nes 2007 as a result it may be difficult to isolate the unique effects of basin morphology and human activities on lake trophic state and water quality in some lake regions hutchinson 1967 taranu and gregory eaves 2008 further many studies to date have focused on single lakes rather than landscape patterns of inland waters across continental scales moorhouse et al 2018 instead a holistic understanding of lake eutrophication and improved lake management strategies requires freshwaters to be considered as part of an integrated socio ecological system dearing et al 2015 schindler 2006 in this study we analyzed 1151 lakes fig 1 with area 0 5 km2 located within the europe eu and the united states of america us to identify how lake morphology and regional social ecological systems interact to affect the susceptibility of lakes to anthropogenic eutrophication based on regional studies birk et al 2020 ho et al 2019 we predicted that trophic state would be greatest in shallow lakes due to elevated rates of external and internal nutrient loading particularly in areas with intensive human activities our goal was to develop a synthetic understanding of causes and correlates of lake eutrophication with particular emphasis on evaluation of how physical features interact with social activities as controls of the eutrophication of lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 lake data national lake surveys nla of us were conducted during may to september in 2007 and 2012 by the environmental protection agency of us epa to provide an unbiased assessment of lake quality similarly the eu multi lake survey emls was conducted in the summer of 2015 across 27 countries to obtain a deeper insight into the dynamics of cyanobacteria across europe mantzouki et al 2018 in the current study very small lakes area 0 5 km2 were excluded from this analysis because small lakes are in generally shallow with small and diverse watersheds and wide distribution that could mask the causal mechanisms regulating these ecosystems accordingly 215 689 and 407 lakes were extracted in the emls nla 2007 and nla 2012 respectively the 162 us lakes surveyed in both 2007 and 2012 were used to quantify sub decadal changes in lake trophic state and land use overall 1151 lakes with area 0 5 km2 were selected for the current study fig 1 2 2 lake features survey parameters included lake morphometry area maximum depth transparency secchi depth nutrients total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ammonia and algal abundance as chlorophyll a chl a and cyanobacterial toxins microcystins the physical chemical and biological variables of lakes were collected and analyzed in a fully standardized manner detailed in mantzouki et al 2018 and https www epa gov national aquatic resource surveys manuals used national aquatic resource surveys national 20lakes 20assessment survey lakes included a wide range in area depth elevation and trophic state table s1 of these 217 18 9 lakes were oligotrophic chl a 2 µg l 1 360 31 3 were mesotrophic 2 µg l 1 chl a 7 µg l 1 and 306 26 6 were eutrophic 7 µg l 1 chl a 30 µg l 1 with a further 268 23 3 classified as hypereutrophic chl a 30 µg l 1 table s2 2 3 ecoregions us and eu lakes were grouped into three main ecoregions plains and lowlands highlands and mountains as defined by us epa herlihy et al 2008 and de blij 1978 respectively in this database 240 lakes 20 9 are located in the highlands 308 26 8 lakes are located in the mountains and 603 lakes 52 3 are located in the plains and lowlands table s2 2 4 land use and land cover the nla data set of 2007 and 2012 included land use and land cover data for each lake watershed derived from the 2001 and 2006 national land cover database nlcd fry et al 2011 homer et al 2007 respectively according to the methods of nlcd landsat images with a spatial resolution of 30 m were obtained from the united states geological survey and were used to obtain lake area and land use data of each lake in the emls in the summer of 2015 the area and percentage of land use for each lake watershed was characterized for eight types including developed agriculture planted cultivated water barren forest shrubland herbaceous and wetlands in the present study land use is further divided into human land developed agriculture and natural land water barren forest shrubland herbaceous wetlands 2 5 trophic state index key indicators of water quality are the concentrations of chl a and nutrients in particular tp and tn as well as water transparency secchi depth accordingly trophic state index tsi of carlson 1977 can be calculated using each measure in this paper we calculated a mean value from all three tsi chl a tp and secchi and used that as our metric of trophic state at each lake the tsi were calculated by 1 tsi secchi 10 6 lnsecchi ln 2 2 tsi tp 10 6 ln 48 tp ln 2 3 tsi chl a 10 6 2 04 0 68 lnchl a ln 2 where secchi is the depth of secchi disk transparency m tp and chl a are the concentrations of total phosphorus µg l 1 and chlorophyll a µg l 1 2 6 statistical analysis the decision tree heatmaps is a new type of integrated visualization of decision trees and heatmaps which provides a comprehensive data overview as well as model interpretation this integration uncovers meaningful patterns among the predictive features and highlights the important elements of decision trees including feature splits and several leaf node characteristics such as prediction value impurity and number of leaf samples in this study decision tree heatmaps were used to predict the threshold of different trophic states based on the interactions between ecoregion features land use and maximum lake depth using the package treeheatr in r 4 0 4 le and moore 2021 the relative cover of each of eight land cover types was estimated for each lake and their distribution with lake depth was estimated using generalized additive model in the mgcv package statistical differences of lake depth among ecoregions were examined with mann whitney u test because the distributions of lake depth were not normally distributed correlations among water depth trophic state nutrient input and land use variables were explored with spearman s correlation coefficient using the package stats pearson s chi square test was used to evaluate correlations among lake depth ecoregion land use and trophic state and cramer s v coefficients were calculated to evaluate the magnitude of the correlation all analyses performed in r 4 0 4 r core team 2021 the level of significance used for all tests was p 0 05 2 7 data

set of eu multi lake survey is available at https portal edirepository org nis mapbrowse packageid edi 176 5 3 results 3 1 distribution of lake depth among ecoregions maximum lake depth ranged from 0 5 m to 350 m with significant variation among ecoregions fig 2 in general lakes were significantly shallower in the plains and lowlands 8 8 8 8 m compared to the highlands 20 8 33 4 m and mountains 22 6 35 1 m fig 2a p 0 001 lakes located in the plain and lowland areas were generally shallow while deep lakes were frequently distributed in the mountain and highland regions fig 2b 3 2 relationships among lake depth land use and trophic state watersheds of shallow lakes were composed mainly of human influenced land use types while watersheds of deep lakes were frequently dominated by natural land use fig 3 a in this analysis the percentage of developed agriculture water herbaceous and wetlands exhibited a significant decreasing trend with increasing maximum lake depth while the opposite was observed for barren forest and shrubland covers fig 3a and b p 0 05 human land use was correlated negatively with lake depth spearman s r 0 21 p 0 001 while it was opposite for natural land use spearman s r 0 2 p 0 001 fig s1 in particular forest 34 5 28 5 and agriculture 21 5 23 7 were the two predominant land types both of which were correlated strongly to lake depth fig 3b p 0 001 lake productivity and microcystins showed a consistent negative correlation with the percentage of natural land use yet were correlated positively with human land fig 3b p 0 05 eutrophic conditions were mainly concentrated in shallow lakes fig 3c and d according to the tp chl a and secchi depth indices the trophic state index of lakes showed a significant decreasing trend with increasing depth fig 3c spearman s r 0 584 p 0 001 furthermore based on the lake trophic categories lake depth varied widely in both the oligotrophic and mesotrophic lake categories whereas eutrophic and hypereutrophic lakes were frequently confined to shallow water depths fig 3d 3 3 variations of land use and trophic state with lake depth from 2007 to 2012 based on the 162 lakes surveyed in both nla 2007 and nla 2012 the variations in land use and trophic state between 2007 and 2012 mainly distributed in shallow lakes while there were few marked variations in deep lakes fig 4 from 2007 to 2012 the average percentage of natural land decreased 0 06 2 5 overall whereas human influenced land use increased 0 05 2 5 these variations mainly occurred in shallow lake catchments while deep basins were relatively unchanged fig 4a moreover from 2007 to 2012 the values of tn tp secchi and chl a increased 0 07 0 56 mg l 1 0 008 0 21 mg l 1 0 09 1 37 m and 0 55 24 7 µg l 1 respectively table s3 similar to land use the variations of tn tp and chl a generally occurred in shallow lakes but deep lakes remain stable fig 4b overall lakes in the plain and lowland areas exhibited intensified eutrophication as chl a whereas water quality mainly improved in highland and mountain ecoregions table s3 3 4 relationships among lake depth ecoregion land use and trophic state decision tree heatmap analysis demonstrated that water depth was closely related to ecoregion and land use likely reflecting an intrinsic relationship between water depth and lake productivity fig 5 a for example lakes were eutrophic or hypereutrophic if their maximum depth was 13 8 m unless located in natural landscape of highland and mountain ecoregions fig 5a in contrast oligotrophic or mesotrophic lakes were routinely deeper than 13 8 m especially 34 1 m irrespective of ecoregion or land use within the lake catchment fig 5a correlation analysis revealed a significant association among lake depth ecoregion land use and trophic state table 1 χ 2 test p 0 001 80 6 lakes in the plains and lowlands were 13 8 m while deeper lakes were more common in the highland 41 2 and mountain 50 7 regions fig 5b similarly 83 3 lakes in human dominated watersheds were 13 8 m while lake depth varied widely in nature dominated landscapes fig 5b as well 63 2 of the lakes 13 8 m were eutrophic or hypereutrophic whereas only 19 8 of lakes 13 8 m depth were highly productive fig 5b furthermore 44 6 of 13 8 m lakes located in the mountain and highland areas and dominated by natural land were eutrophic and hypereutrophic compared to only 10 5 in lakes 13 8 m deep fig 5b however 33 3 of 13 8 m lakes in the plains and lowland regions and human dominant land were eutrophic compared to 82 8 of shallow lakes 13 8 m fig 5b accordingly although human land use in watersheds influences all lakes lake depth can act as a filter that modifies lake response to disturbance with greater influence of land use on water quality in shallow lakes 4 discussion a better understanding of the dynamic relationships between lake depth social and environmental phenomena is necessary to improve lake management strategies dearing et al 2015 randomized unequal probability surveys conducted by the us epa and emls provide unbiased estimates of lake eutrophication and allows us to infer the causal relationships between lake trophic state and environmental conditions needed to advance the restoration and protection of lakes stoddard et al 2016 our analysis suggests that lake depth is linked to the ecoregion and land use of lake ecosystems which largely determines the intensity of human activities and consequently lake productivity this information may help clarify why shallow lakes are prone to eutrophication and improve lake management strategies for a sustainable future the ecoregional characteristics of lake watersheds provide an important basis predicting the trophic state of lakes largely reflecting the underlying climatic soil topographical and hydrological characteristics tang et al 2020 generally in plain and lowland areas the terrain is flat and soil is naturally fertile with a well developed drainage system that is consequently subject to agricultural activities and urban development heino et al 2021 read et al 2015 solheim et al 2019 since the start of the 20th century the global expansion of agricultural activities and urbanization associated with widespread socio economic development is occurring in plain and lowland ecoregions resulting in marked changes in land cover and enhanced anthropogenic nutrient inputs beaver et al 2014 in contrast steep slopes and poor soil development in upland regions usually make lake watersheds unsuitable for agriculture and urban development aranguren riano et al 2018 indeed agricultural land use of lakes is dominant in the plains and lowlands 30 4 25 3 but not upland regions highlands 14 7 16 4 mountains 9 3 17 5 while forests are the main land cover at higher elevations highlands 59 3 20 9 mountains 41 4 28 2 than occur in plains and lowlands 21 2 23 0 fig s2 moreover compared to the lakes situated in upland regions the water temperature of lakes is generally higher in plain and lowland regions which could provide a favorable environment for cyanobacteria paerl and huisman 2008 agriculture is one of the most important drivers of lake eutrophication at a global scale nielsen et al 2012 contributing 84 of the p discharged into us surface waters carpenter et al 1998 however watersheds dominated by forest and natural vegetation generally export lower amounts of allochthonous material to surface waters nobre et al 2020 consistent with these patterns in this study 67 0 of lakes in plains and lowlands were eutrophic while only 27 6 of lakes in the upland areas were eutrophic table s2 as a result of limited land suitable for future agricultural expansion yet a growing human population fertilization and disturbance of plain and lowland regions is likely to intensify on a global basis tilman 1999 laurance et al 2014 for example according to nlcd 1 77 of land cover was mapped as changed from 2006 to 2011 of the continental united states which mainly occurred in the plains and lowlands of southeastern united states homer et al 2015 the largest net losses occurred in the forest classes 31 038 km2 while the land use of developed classes and cultivated crop increased 7 631 km2 and 696 km2 respectively homer et al 2015 indeed according to the nla 2012 the proportion of lakes in the most disturbed condition for tp were mainly 80 located in the northern plains as compared to the western mountains 17 while the southern plains exhibited the highest proportion of disturbed condition 41 6 based on chl a analysis in sharp contrast to the low proportion disturbed only 0 7 in the western mountain ecoregion usepa 2016 together these patterns suggest that lakes in the plain and lowland areas are both generally shallow and more susceptible to human activities whereas deep lakes are distributed mainly in mountain and highland regions with little anthropogenic nutrient input although external nutrient inputs are the main determinants of lake eutrophication effects of allochthonous nutrients will also be modified by in lake biogeochemical processes such as sedimentation export and sedimentary exchange all factors which vary strongly with water depth qin et al 2020 the susceptibility of lakes to anthropogenic eutrophication and water quality degradation may be more pronounced in shallow lakes richardson et al 2018 eutrophic shallow lakes generally have high catchment area to lake area or volume ratios and short water residence times which are particularly sensitive to anthropogenic forcing tammelin and kauppila 2018 further in shallow lakes strong water sediment interactions are more common and sediment is more prone to resuspension fig s3 leading to elevated internal nutrient loading and higher productivity havens and james 2005 in contrast deep lakes have a greater ability to dilute nutrients exported from watersheds fig s4 and may exhibit a slower response to eutrophication and other pollutants liu et al 2010 deep lakes also lose a greater proportion of nutrients through sedimentation due to generally longer water residence times and lower turbulence at depth brooks et al 2014 vollenweider 1975 not surprisingly the ratio of epilimnetic sediment to lake volume ratio is a parameter that predicts the retention and cycling of internal nutrients and generally decreases with increasing depth qin et al 2020 read et al 2015 in the present study the threshold of lake depth occurred at 13 8 m based on the interactions between ecoregion features land use and trophic state fig 5a in addition according to our analysis although watershed land use influences all lakes lake depth can act as a filter that modifies lake response to disturbance fig 5b with greater influence of land use on water quality in shallow lakes blenckner 2005 leavitt et al 2009 tammelin and kauppila 2018 taranu and gregory eaves 2008 therefore many shallow lakes have shifted between stable states from clear state macrophyte dominant to turbid state phytoplankton dominant as a result of anthropogenic or natural drivers janssen et al 2021 the alternative stable states in shallow lakes may further promote the nutrients release from macrophyte and sediment to increase the trophic state affecting key supporting provisioning regulating and cultural ecosystem services supplied by lakes scheffer and van nes 2007 our analyses suggest that lake depth correlates the effects of socio economic development and natural landscape features to regulate the susceptibility of lakes to anthropogenic stressors fig 6 in the future increased agricultural production to meet demands for food and energy will intensify both point and diffuse sources nutrients carpenter et al 2007 tomer et al 2013 many shallow lakes already exhibit eutrophic conditions yet lie in watersheds where further eutrophication may be an inevitable rather than an occasional occurrence consistent with this hypothesis eutrophication is extensively studied in many large relatively shallow lakes e g okeechobee winnipeg and erie yet continues to be the central factor reducing water quality despite intensive management bunting et al 2016 michalak et al 2013 zhang et al 2011 these lakes display many features typical of shallow freshwater ecosystem including lowland location high agricultural land use and symptoms of recently accelerated eutrophication havens and james 2005 similar patterns are also seen for other lakes in the basin of rivers havel and spree germany schönfelder and steinberg 2004 and the middle and lower reaches yangtze river basin in china e g lakes taihu and chaohu dearing et al 2012 these lakes lie in watersheds where rapid population growth and cultivation during the past 70 years has favoured eutrophication schönfelder and steinberg 2004 wang et al 2014 unlike natural lake ontogeny which leads to slow gradual changes as lakes infill human activities have greatly accelerated water eutrophication by altering external and internal nutrient supplies carpenter et al 1998 we propose that lakes now exist as coupled socio ecological systems in which water depth integrates economic societal and ecological factors related to lake production heino et al 2021 in fact the susceptibility of lake to anthropogenic eutrophication and consequently the risk of water quality issues is not the same for all lakes our findings suggest that shallow lakes are more susceptible to human forcing and are predisposed to receiving large quantities of nutrients in addition in shallow lakes even though external nutrient inputs have been controlled nutrients stored in the sediments can be continuously released to support high phytoplankton populations qin et al 2020 accordingly special attention should be given to shallow lakes that are at high risk of waters quality degradation borics et al 2013 yet may be more resistant to restoration compared to deep lakes martin et al 2011 tammelin and kauppila 2018 these findings could enhance our understanding of why the efforts in controlling lake eutrophication have failed in a number of shallow lakes but are often effective in deep lakes schindler et al 2016 this study convinces stakeholders to continue to invest in nutrient reductions despite slow rates of recovery in eutrophic shallow lakes overall societal expectations policy goals and management plans should reflect this observation 5 conclusion lake eutrophication is a great international concern because of its economic and ecological consequences our findings demonstrate that lake depth correlates socio ecological systems as well as lake susceptibility to potential anthropogenic stressors and that shallow lakes exhibit disproportionately degraded water quality and trophic state accordingly freshwater management will become increasingly necessary for shallow lakes this information may help clarify why shallow lakes are prone to eutrophication and why some efforts to control eutrophication have resulted in frustratingly slow or modest effects in shallow productive lakes this study helps set realistic goals and adjusts community expectations to advance the protection and restoration of lakes globally it may be a challenge that convincing stakeholders continue to invest in nutrient reductions without evidence of rapid improvement but it is necessary for long term water quality improvement we hope that these findings will increase understanding for limnologists stakeholders and

15727,acid mine drainage amd contains abundant iron sulfates and various metal ions and it causes environmental pollution the traditional amd lime neutralization forms a layer of iron hydroxide and gypsum on the surface of the lime particles preventing continuous reaction and leading to excessive lime addition and neutralized sludge production in this study an approach for treating amd using a cyclic process of biooxidation and electroreduction before lime neutralization was proposed in which the fe2 in amd was oxidized to fe3 and induced to form schwertmannite through acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans the remaining fe3 was reduced to fe2 using an electric field after three biooxidation and two electroreduction cycles 98 2 of fe and 62 4 of so4 2 in amd precipitated as schwertmannite fe8o8 oh 5 16 so4 1 37 the yield of schwertmannite reached 33 98 g lamd with a high specific surface area of 112 59 m2 g the lime dosage and sludge yield of the treated amd in the subsequent neutralization stage ph 7 00 decreased by 85 0 and 74 5 respectively than those of raw amd the pilot test results showed that the integrated treatment of biooxidation electroreduction cyclic

drainage amd is the acidic water obtained from the tail drainage of coal mines and various metal mining sites akcil and koldas 2006 kefeni et al 2017 qureshi et al 2016 old mine workings tomiyama et al 2019 2020 open pits monjardin et al 2022 waste dumps lambert et al 2015 tabelin et al 2021 and rock excavated through tunnel projects tabelin et al 2018 tatsuhara et al 2012 owing to its strong acidity and the high concentration of soluble metals fe2 fe3 mn2 cu2 zn2 cd2 and other heavy metals and so4 2 amd poses a threat to soil water resources and surrounding organisms kefeni et al 2017 the two main reasons for amd formation are as follows 1 in an environment with weak buffering capacity sulfide ores are easily oxidized when exposed to oxygen water and microorganisms excess ions including h soluble fe and so4 2 can be obtained through different oxidation reactions under different conditions 2 the hydrolysis of heavy metal ions produces hydroxide precipitate resulting in a large amount of h in amd tabelin et al 2018 2020 neutralization is the most used amd remediation technique johnson and hallberg 2005 tolonen et al 2014 it can raise ph and alkalinity as well as form iron hydroxide and calcium sulfate precipitates to remove fe and so4 2 by adding alkaline substances such as lime akcil and koldas 2006 however this method exhibited two major disadvantages 1 a large amount of sludge is produced which is difficult to stack and dispose and 2 metal ions will form a precipitation coating on the surface of lime particles hindering the precipitation reaction and increasing lime consumption santomartino and webb 2007 tolonen et al 2014 from an economic viewpoint the traditional lime neutralization method not only requires an expensive neutralizing agent but also increases the dewatering cost associated with amd neutralization and the cost of sludge transportation and disposal meanwhile a large amount of sludge can easily stick to pipelines or equipment reducing the maintenance cycle of the amd treatment system and increasing the operational cost igarashi et al 2020 park et al 2019 to reduce the amount of lime neutralization fe so4 2 and other heavy metals must be subjected to pretreatment parikh and chorover 2006 many scholars have reported methods or processes for amd treatment such as energy generation using wastes and the recovered valuable byproducts ai et al 2020 igarashi et al 2020 turingan et al 2022 for example igarashi et al introduced a new amd treatment approach called the two step neutralization ferrite formation this new technology can produce valuable magnetic ferrite and sludge with high solid content igarashi et al 2020 biomineralization is common in amd under natural conditions baker and banfield 2003 the most typical phenomenon is that fe and so4 2 are induced in amd using acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans a ferrooxidans to form secondary iron minerals jarosite or schwertmannite that can remove metal or metalloid ions gagliano et al 2004 song et al 2014 xiong et al 2008 presently many studies using the biomineralization method mediated by a ferrooxidans to eliminate metals or metal like ions in amd were explored and three advantages were found during the process 1 a ferrooxidans are chemoautotrophic bacteria which can obtain energy from autotrophic metabolism without additional carbon 2 no anaerobic environment is required 3 the secondary iron minerals have direct application potential in environmental science antelo et al 2005 2012 song et al 2018 however the biomineralization method has an major problem the mineralization rate of a single process fe2 fe3 secondary iron minerals is low only about one third of soluble fe3 can sediment to form minerals which limits fe and so4 2 efficient removal from amd liu et al 2015a thus using certain methods to re reduce fe3 to fe2 is necessary for the next biomineralization process and achieve considerable mineralization efficiency through multiple cycles recently many studies have designed the pretreatment methods of amd cyclic mineralization based on the secondary iron minerals formation followed by neutralization naidu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 for instance fe0 was used to reduce the remaining fe3 in amd the generated fe2 was oxidized using h2o2 to form schwertmannite wang et al 2019 results showed that about 86 of fe and 38 of so4 2 were removed in the form of schwertmannite after chemical reaction based amd cyclic mineralization and the mineralization process requires up to 15 cycles in the fe0 mediated fe3 reduction method wang et al 2019 requirement of multiple cycles was attributed to two main reasons 1 fe3 reduction using fe0 added new soluble fe to amd 2 fe precipitation rate in a single mineralization process was only 35 in addition the specific surface area of schwertmannite generated using chemical cyclic mineralization was only 3 9 m2 g which was less than that of a ferrooxidans mediated schwertmannite bigham et al 1990 paikaray et al 2011 the method from jin et al involves using the mixed medium of fe3 reducing bacteria acidiphilium multivorum a multivorum and fe2 oxidic bacteria a ferrooxidan complete fe and nearly 40 of so4 2 in amd can be removed after five cycles by switching between fe2 oxidation and fe3 reduction and adjusting the condition of dissolved oxygen however al mn cu ni and zn can hardly be removed jin et al 2020 a disadvantage of this method is that mineral filtration and collection can reduce the density of free state mixed microorganisms another disadvantage was that each cycle took 3 0 to 8 3 d thus it can consume a longer time total wang et al constructed a biomineralization system based on a ferrooxidans fe2 oxidation and a multivorum fe3 reduction bacteria in the system were inoculated on a carrier in the form of a biofilm operation results of the system showed that approximately 89 fe and 60 so4 2 in amd were precipitated as jarosite after five cycle biomineralization wang et al 2021 this biomineralization system improved the microbial stability however its total elapsed time 25 d is long in addition the experimental design capacity of this biomineralization system was 8 5 ml min no larger pilot experiment has been conducted and the feasibility of its practical application requires verification owing to the redox properties of metals electrochemical processes using electrons rather than exogenous chemicals as oxidants reductants have been used for source management sustainable recovery of metal containing waste amd control and mineral processing aikawa et al 2020 krishnan et al 2021 parikh and chorover 2006 seng et al 2019a 2019b shi et al 2021 electrochemical processes do not require chemicals they are efficient and selective but require viable operations and controls these methods have been used to treat wastewater containing heavy metals jin 2021 jin et al reported that 97 8 cu and 93 4 bi can be recovered from highly acidic sulfate industrial wastewater 604 g l h2so4 concentration in 110 min using mass transfer enhanced electrodeposition technique by controlling current density in two steps 75 and 350 a m2 jin et al 2015 obviously the reduction of fe3 to fe2 using electric field action has potential advantages e g short time small influencing factors and no additive carbon source than the microbial reduction method therefore amd treatment technology combined with biomineralization and electroreduction methods can obtain high specific surface area secondary iron minerals and solve the problem of time consumption in this paper a cyclic mineralization method combining biooxidation mediated by a ferrooxidans and electroreduction is proposed as a pretreatment measure for amd lime neutralization this work aims at 1 studying the removal efficiency of fe so4 2 and various heavy metal ions 2 identifying the species of secondary iron minerals collected at the biooxidation stage and mineral s physicochemical properties and 3 using a pilot experiment to evaluate the stability and feasibility of the practical application of the two step treatment method biooxidation electroreduction cyclic mineralization followed by lime neutralization 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 collection of amd the amd in this study was collected from a sediment retained reservoir shaoguan guangdong province china the mine at the sampling site is a polymetallic deposit and limonite is the main mineral type the amd was acidic with so4

exponential growth approximately 2 3 d then the culture medium was filtered using filter paper pore diameter is 1 3 μm to remove the generated iron precipitate the bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 3000 g relative centrifugal force 4 10 min and washed using acid water ph 1 50 prepared with h2so4 thrice to remove various miscellaneous ions the suspension of these bacteria in the acid water obtained a ferrooxidans resting cell solution with 8 2 108 cells ml measured using the double layer plate method jin et al 2019 2 2 treatment of amd 2 2 1 cyclic mineralization biooxidation stage the biooxidation was conducted in a 1000 ml conical flask containing 495 ml amd and 5 ml a ferrooxidans concentrate i e 1 microbial inoculation ratio v v the flask was placed in a rotating shaker at 180 rpm and 28 to initiate the biooxidation during the biooxidation 2 ml liquid samples were taken periodically 0 10 5 22 5 34 5 46 5 58 5 70 5 82 5 h and the ph value fe2 total fe tfe so4 2 and heavy metal cu2 zn2 mn2 cd2 concentration of the solution were determined after filtration using a 0 45 μm membrane a certain amount of deionized water needs to be replenished before each sample to replace volatilized water as constant volume is the basis for accurate stoichiometric calculations after the biooxidation the filtrate and secondary iron minerals were separated using filter paper pore diameter is 1 3 μm and the minerals were weighed after being dried at 50 electroreduction stage the electroreduction device consists of a 500 ml beaker an adjustable dc regulated power supply mp6010d and cathode anode plates the anode is made of ti with ir and ta coating and the cathode is pure ti the cathode and anode plates are fixed on both sides of the beaker at 35 mm spacing the spacing of the plates was determined by the pre experiment as shown in fig s1 and connected to the dc regulated power supply using cu wire the filtrate obtained at the endpoint of the biooxidation stage was added to a 500 ml beaker and an electric field was applied to the solution at a current density of 150 a m2 the current density was determined by the pre experiment as shown in fig s2 and a stirrer d40 2f was used to stir at 60 rpm to ensure the solution mixing uniformity samples were taken periodically 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 h and relevant indexes were measured during the electroreduction a certain amount of deionized water should be added before each sampling to replace the lost water since the application of an electric field will decompose small volume water into oxygen and hydrogen 2h2o 2h2 o2 the electric field will decrease the solution ph 2h2o 4e o2 4h and ph 2 50 4 50 is conducive for the efficient activity of a ferrooxidans and the formation of secondary iron minerals liao et al 2009 zhou et al 2021 therefore after the electroreduction ph 2 10 a small amount of low concentration naoh 40 mmol l was used to adjust the solution ph to 2 50 and then start the second round of biooxidation filtration electroreduction named b f e treatment fig 1 a in addition to simplify the operation steps secondary iron mineral filtration and separation after biooxidation was omitted in the control test the mixed solution containing minerals was directly transferred to the electroreduction device to start the reduction process named b e treatment fig 1b after the same number of cycles of biooxidation electroreduction filtrate and secondary iron minerals were separated using filter paper pore diameter is 1 3 μm the minerals were dried at 50 and analyzed using a scanning electron microscope sem x ray diffraction xrd energy disperse spectroscopy eds and brunauer emmett teller bet 2 2 2 lime neutralization the results of 2 2 1 showed that more than 90 of tfe can be precipitated after three times biooxidation and two times electoreduction b e treatment the color of the solution changes from deep orange to light yellow fig s3 the treated amd t amd from the cyclic process was treated with lime as neutralizer lime was slowly added to 300 ml t amd and the 2 ml solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm microporous membrane at different ph to collect the filtrate when the solution ph raised to 7 00 the neutralized sludge was collected by filtration dried at 50 and weighed the filtrate was stored at 4 and the concentration of heavy metals cu2 zn2 mn2 and cd2 was determined in this study the raw amd r amd was treated using lime directly in the conventional method 2 2 3 pilot test to verify the feasibility of biooxidation electroreduction cycle for amd treatment a pilot test was conducted on a movable test device the test device includes amd disposal reactor 700 l effective volume microporous aerator was set at the bottom electrolytic device fixed in the reactor air compressor provided aeration to ensure the solution mixing uniformity air storage tank pneumatic diaphragm pump conveyed the material to the filter press chamber filter press solid liquid separation dc regulated power supply power distribution cabinet fig 2 pilot test steps add 693 l amd to the reactor and inoculate 7 l a ferrooxidans concentrate on a 1 ratio start the air compressor and adjust the aeration device aeration speed was approximately 1 2 m3 h after 36 h biooxidation preliminary results showed that the rate of tfe precipitation slightly increased after 36 h the electrolytic reaction was conducted at 150 a m2 current density for 4 h preliminary results showed that the concentration of fe2 tends to be stable after 4 h of electrolytic reaction then 7 l microorganisms were reinoculated and ph was adjusted to 2 50 using lime owing to the high price of naoh and the second round biooxidation electroreduction was conducted under the same conditions finally we reinoculated 7 l microorganisms and adjusted ph to 2 50 for the third biooxidation reaction thus completing one batch of amd the ph fe2 tfe and other indicators of the reaction system were monitored during the entire test process at the end of the first batch the reactor was emptied and cleaned and five batches were completed as described above after treating the fifth batch the pneumatic diaphragm pump was started to pump the mixed solution into the filter press for pressure filtration dehydration to obtain minerals and filtrate the feed pressure was increased from 0 4 to 0 8 mpa pressing pressure was 1 2 mpa the obtained minerals were weighed and their water content was measured the filtrate t amd about 700 l was neutralized using lime until ph 7 00 the amount of lime added was recorded and the raw amd r amd was neutralized with lime as a control finally neutralized amd was dehydrated using the filter press and mud cake was collected weighed and its moisture content measured the lime demands and neutralization mud cake productions of amd before and after biooxidation electroreduction treatment were compared 2 3 calculation fe3 concentration was calculated

ag jena germany song et al 2018 fe2 concentration was determined using the 1 10 phenanthroline colorimetric method and a t 6 spectrophotometer philes china apha 1981 harvey et al 1955 when it was necessary to distinguish between fe3 and fe2 fe2 concentration was measured before and after reduction using excess ascorbic acid and then fe3 concentration was calculated based on the difference between two of such measurements heavy metal elements were determined using a shimadzu icps 7500 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer icp aes shimadzu japan todolí and mermet 2006 whereas so4 2 concentrations were determined using a 792 bastc ic ion chromatography system metrohm switzerland haddad et al 2008 the margins of error and detection limits of each method were given in

areas sing 2001 3 results and discussion 3 1 cyclic mineralization 3 1 1 ph and concentration of fe2 and fe3 in cyclic mineralization during the first biooxidation process after 34 5 h the ph of the solution decreased rapidly from 2 50 to 2 00 fig 3 a although the oxidation of fe2 is an h consuming reaction the generated fe3 will undergo hydrolysis and produce h hedrich and johnson 2012 kefeni et al 2017 therefore the hydrolysis rate of fe3 in this process was faster than the oxidation rate of fe2 the oxidation rate of abiotic fe2 is low at ph 3 50 even in oxygen saturated water however a ferrooxidans can accelerate the oxidation of fe2 in acidic water lacey and lawson 1970 singer and stumm 1970 stumm and morgan 1995 the fe2 concentration decreased from 9 44 g l to 1 07 mg l during the first 34 5 h of the first biooxidation process corresponding to the change in solution ph fig 3b the oxidation rate of fe2 in the first 34 5 h ranged from 0 27 to 0 42 g l h which was close to the results obtained by li et al 0 37 g l h li et al 2011 in the subsequent first electroreduction process the concentration of fe2 increased from 1 07 mg l to 2 60 g l in 5 h and the reduction rate of fe3 was 32 7 when the fe2 generated by the first electroreduction was used as the energy substrate for the second biooxidation the minerals formed in the first oxidation stage would reduce the biooxidation rate of fe2 and prolong its complete oxidation time as shown in b e treatment moreover the difference in fe2 oxidation rate between b e treatment and b f e treatment was evident in the third biooxidation process fig 3b the possible reason is that a ferrooxidans can secrete extracellular polymeric substances eps which can adhere to the mineral surface and a ferrooxidans will be adsorbed on the mineral instead of the free state reducing the contact frequency with fe2 wang and zhou 2011 however the concentration of fe3 considerably decreased during the b e treatment for example after the second oxidation stage the reduction of fe3 concentration in the b e treatment was 3 61 g l which was higher than that in the b f e treatment 2 72 g l fig 3c there is a short induction period before the precipitation of fe in the solution and the mineral particles existing at the beginning of the reaction can be used to inhibit the induction period and improve the precipitation rate of fe dutrizac 1996 studies by zhang et al showed that introducing additional schwertmannite before the biosynthesis of schwertmannite by a ferrooxidans can promote more schwertmannite generated zhang et al 2017 therefore compared with b f e treatment b e treatment was easier to operate and had a better amd treatment effect 3 1 2 concentrations of tfe so4 2 and heavy metals in cyclic mineralization the decrease in tfe concentration reflects the mineralization of fe3 as shown in fig 4 a the removal rates of tfe in the three oxidation stages of b f e treatment cycle mineralization were 33 8 47 4 and 12 3 respectively and the final tfe removal rate was 93 5 the removal of so4 2 was almost synchronous with tfe and the final cumulative removal rate was 53 1 fig 4b the b e treatment cyclic mineralization treatment obtained better amd treatment efficiency than the above results its cumulative removal rates of tfe and so4 2 were increased to 98 2 and 62 4 respectively as shown in fig 4c the removal effect of cd2 mn2 cu2 and zn2 in the biooxidation stage during mineralization was insignificant for example after the first oxidation treatment the concentration of the four heavy metals decreased by 8 3 9 0 0 2 and 9 0 respectively notably the concentration of cu2 considerably decreased during the first reduction stage from 2 15 to 1 10 mg l which can be attributed to the reduction of cu2 under electric field cu2 2e cu0 desmarquest et al 1970 and the precipitation of elemental cu0 was on the surface of the cathode plate during the experiment fig s4 notably after the electroreduction a small amount of low concentration naoh 40 mmol l was used to adjust the solution ph to 2 50 and then start the second round of mineralization 88 5 h this operation may be the main reason for promoting the removal of cd2 mn2 and zn2 3 1 3 secondary iron minerals as shown in fig 5 a the mass of minerals collected after b e treatment was 16 99 g higher than the amount of minerals collected during b f e treatment 15 53 g the morphological characteristics chemical structure elemental composition and specific surface area of minerals collected after b e treatment are shown in figs 5b e these precipitated particles were uniform spherules with a diameter of 2 5 μm their surfaces were covered with long needles and had the hedgehog morphology of schwertmannite particles regenspurg et al 2004 fig 5b unlike that formed via chemosynthesis which were smooth wang et al 2019 the xrd patterns of the mineral samples were the same as the schwertmannite standard template pdf 47 1775 fig 5c eds analysis indicated that fe o and s were the main elements existing in the mineral fig 5d based on the n2 sorption isotherm curve the calculated specific surface area of schwertmannite was 112 59 m2 g fig 5e which was much higher than that formed in chemical method feso4 h2o2 2 06 16 30 m2 g liu et al 2015b wang et al 2019 after the determination of the fe and so4 2 contents using icp aes and ion chromatography respectively the structural formula of the schwertmannite could be expressed as fe8o8 oh 5 16 so4 1 37 this is similar to the schwertmannite structure fe8o8 oh 4 50 so4 1 75 synthesized using chemical method wang et al 2019 3 2 lime neutralization adding lime to amd can neutralize acid and promote metal ions to generate hydroxide precipitation to be removed kalin et al 2006 tolonen et al 2014 300 ml treated amd t amd of b e treatment was taken as the object of the lime neutralization experiment in addition the same volume of raw amd r amd was used as a control considering ph 7 00 and 12 00 as nodes the lime required by 300 ml t amd are 0 9 and 1 5 g respectively which were less than r amd that are 6 0 and 6 7 g fig 6 in addition when reaching neutral ph 7 00 the amount of neutralized sludge of the former was 4 7 g only one quarter of that in the latter 18 4 g cu2 zn2 mn2 and cd2 in t amd were completely removed when the solution reached neutral regardless of their concentrations at the end of the cyclic mineralization treatment in contrast none of the four heavy metals were completely removed in r amd at ph 7 00 3 3 pilot test to verify the feasibility of the biooxidation electroreduction cyclic mineralization system in practical applications a pilot experiment similar to the laboratory experiment was needed the ph fe2 and fe3 concentration of the solution were monitored during the pilot cyclic mineralization to evaluate the stability of the system in the five mineralization batches after the first oxidation reduction cycle the ph was reduced from 2 50 to 2 00 and then adjusted to 2 50 suitable for the a ferrooxidans biooxidation reaction fig 7 a finally it was reduced to 1 80 at the end of the oxidation reduction cycle at the end of each batch there was no residual fe2 in the solution and the residual fe3 concentration was stable below 1 22 g l in conclusion the mineralization system exhibited good stability over multiple runs the average removal rates of tfe and so4 2 of the five batches were 91 6 and 63 6 respectively fig 7b the sludge sedimentation rates of r amd and t amd after lime neutralization were 62 and 82 standing time 10 min respectively fig s5 the fifth batch yielded 16 6 kg schwertmannite and in the subsequent lime neutralization test the t amd from this batch produced 5 1 kg neutralized sludge 86 3 less than that obtained using r amd 37 2 kg figs 7c s5 the pilot experiment proved that the treatment of amd via biooxidation electroreduction cyclic mineralization followed by lime neutralization was technically feasible notably the average removal rates of tfe and so4 2 of amd reached 84 8 and 57 2 at the end of the second oxidation respectively indicating that the amd treatment efficiency obtained in this study was sufficiently high after two cycles of biooxidation and one cycle of electroreduction therefore the number of oxidation reduction cycles can be increased or decreased according to the actual amd properties and operation effects 4 conclusions the integrated treatment of biooxidation electroreduction cyclic mineralization and lime neutralization is a feasible method for treating amd this method has the following advantages 1 biooxidation does not need additional oxidants or carbon sources secondary pollutants 2 the electroreduction method does not need an additional reducing agent moreover it improves the stability and decreases the reduction time when compared with the anaerobic biological method 3 the two step cyclic process can be conducted in the same container using simple equipment and with convenient operations making it suitable for the amd sequential batch operation mode 4 the sequence of cyclic mineralization is not invariable when the concentration of fe3 in amd is much higher than that of fe2 electrolytic reduction can be started first and followed by biological oxidation 5 schwertmannite the final sediment obtained after the biooxidation electroreduction cyclic mineralization is an environmentally friendly adsorption material 6 the pretreatment of amd using the biooxidation electroreduction cycle can reduce the amount of neutralized sludge produced by applying the subsequent lime neutralization treatment by six times pilot test although the current study shows that this amd treatment is technically feasible its practical application can be realized with a better understanding of its potential drawbacks presently the main problem is that a ferrooxidans needs to be reinoculated when a new round of biooxidation stage start and the ph needs to be adjusted again after each electroreduction which increases the workload and cost during continuous operation the feasible solution is to investigate the continuous mineralization effect at low current density under the premise of not affecting bacteria activity conducting oxidation and reduction at the same time the specific feasibility and various optimal conditions need to be studied in the future authorship contribution statement zehao guo conceptualization designed this study

15727,acid mine drainage amd contains abundant iron sulfates and various metal ions and it causes environmental pollution the traditional amd lime neutralization forms a layer of iron hydroxide and gypsum on the surface of the lime particles preventing continuous reaction and leading to excessive lime addition and neutralized sludge production in this study an approach for treating amd using a cyclic process of biooxidation and electroreduction before lime neutralization was proposed in which the fe2 in amd was oxidized to fe3 and induced to form schwertmannite through acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans the remaining fe3 was reduced to fe2 using an electric field after three biooxidation and two electroreduction cycles 98 2 of fe and 62 4 of so4 2 in amd precipitated as schwertmannite fe8o8 oh 5 16 so4 1 37 the yield of schwertmannite reached 33 98 g lamd with a high specific surface area of 112 59 m2 g the lime dosage and sludge yield of the treated amd in the subsequent neutralization stage ph 7 00 decreased by 85 0 and 74 5 respectively than those of raw amd the pilot test results showed that the integrated treatment of biooxidation electroreduction cyclic

r amd raw amd t amd treated amd toc total organic carbon eps extracellular polymeric substances data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction acid mine drainage amd is the acidic water obtained from the tail drainage of coal mines and various metal mining sites akcil and koldas 2006 kefeni et al 2017 qureshi et al 2016 old mine workings tomiyama et al 2019 2020 open pits monjardin et al 2022 waste dumps lambert et al 2015 tabelin et al 2021 and rock excavated through tunnel projects tabelin et al 2018 tatsuhara et al 2012 owing to its strong acidity and the high concentration of soluble metals fe2 fe3 mn2 cu2 zn2 cd2 and other heavy metals and so4 2 amd poses a threat to soil water resources and surrounding organisms kefeni et al 2017 the two main reasons for amd formation are as follows 1 in an environment with weak buffering capacity sulfide ores are easily oxidized when exposed to oxygen water and microorganisms excess ions including h soluble fe and so4 2 can be obtained through different oxidation reactions under different conditions 2 the hydrolysis of heavy metal ions produces hydroxide precipitate resulting in a large amount of h in amd tabelin et al 2018 2020 neutralization is the most used amd remediation technique johnson and hallberg 2005 tolonen et al 2014 it can raise ph and alkalinity as well as form iron hydroxide and calcium sulfate precipitates to remove fe and so4 2 by adding alkaline substances such as lime akcil and koldas 2006 however this method exhibited two major disadvantages 1 a large amount of sludge is produced which is difficult to stack and dispose and 2 metal ions will form a precipitation coating on the surface of lime particles hindering the precipitation reaction and increasing lime consumption santomartino and webb 2007 tolonen et al 2014 from an economic viewpoint the traditional lime neutralization method not only requires an expensive neutralizing agent but also increases the dewatering cost associated with amd neutralization and the cost of sludge transportation and disposal meanwhile a large amount of sludge can easily stick to pipelines or equipment reducing the maintenance cycle of the amd treatment system and increasing the operational cost igarashi et al 2020 park et al 2019 to reduce the amount of lime neutralization fe so4 2 and other heavy metals must be subjected to pretreatment parikh and chorover 2006 many scholars have reported methods or processes for amd treatment such as energy generation using wastes and the recovered valuable byproducts ai et al 2020 igarashi et al 2020 turingan et al 2022 for example igarashi et al introduced a new amd treatment approach called the two step neutralization ferrite formation this new technology can produce valuable magnetic ferrite and sludge with high solid content igarashi et al 2020 biomineralization is common in amd under natural conditions baker and banfield 2003 the most typical phenomenon is that fe and so4 2 are induced in amd using acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans a ferrooxidans to form secondary iron minerals jarosite or schwertmannite that can remove metal or metalloid ions gagliano et al 2004 song et al 2014 xiong et al 2008 presently many studies using the biomineralization method mediated by a ferrooxidans to eliminate metals or metal like ions in amd were explored and three advantages were found during the process 1 a ferrooxidans are chemoautotrophic bacteria which can obtain energy from autotrophic metabolism without additional carbon 2 no anaerobic environment is required 3 the secondary iron minerals have direct application potential in environmental science antelo et al 2005 2012 song et al 2018 however the biomineralization method has an major problem the mineralization rate of a single process fe2 fe3 secondary iron minerals is low only about one third of soluble fe3 can sediment to form minerals which limits fe and so4 2 efficient removal from amd liu et al 2015a thus using certain methods to re reduce fe3 to fe2 is necessary for the next biomineralization process and achieve considerable mineralization efficiency through multiple cycles recently many studies have designed the pretreatment methods of amd cyclic mineralization based on the secondary iron minerals formation followed by neutralization naidu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 for instance fe0 was used to reduce the remaining fe3 in amd the generated fe2 was oxidized using h2o2 to form schwertmannite wang et al 2019 results showed that about 86 of fe and 38 of so4 2 were removed in the form of schwertmannite after chemical reaction based amd cyclic mineralization and the mineralization process requires up to 15 cycles in the fe0 mediated fe3 reduction method wang et al 2019 requirement of multiple cycles was attributed to two main reasons 1 fe3 reduction using fe0 added new soluble fe to amd 2 fe precipitation rate in a single mineralization process was only 35 in addition the specific surface area of schwertmannite generated using chemical cyclic mineralization was only 3 9 m2 g which was less than that of a ferrooxidans mediated schwertmannite bigham et al 1990 paikaray et al 2011 the method from jin et al involves using the mixed medium of fe3 reducing bacteria acidiphilium multivorum a multivorum and fe2 oxidic bacteria a ferrooxidan complete fe and nearly 40 of so4 2 in amd can be removed after five cycles by switching between fe2 oxidation and fe3 reduction and adjusting the condition of dissolved oxygen however al mn cu ni and zn can hardly be removed jin et al 2020 a disadvantage of this method is that mineral filtration and collection can reduce the density of free state mixed microorganisms another disadvantage was that each cycle took 3 0 to 8 3 d thus it can consume a longer time total wang et al constructed a biomineralization system based on a ferrooxidans fe2 oxidation and a multivorum fe3 reduction bacteria in the system were inoculated on a carrier in the form of a biofilm operation results of the system showed that approximately 89 fe and 60 so4 2 in amd were precipitated as jarosite after five cycle biomineralization wang et al 2021 this biomineralization system improved the microbial stability however its total elapsed time 25 d is long in addition the experimental design capacity of this biomineralization system was 8 5 ml min no larger pilot experiment has been conducted and the feasibility of its practical application requires verification owing to the redox properties of metals electrochemical processes using electrons rather than exogenous chemicals as oxidants reductants have been used for source management sustainable recovery of metal containing waste amd control and mineral processing aikawa et al 2020 krishnan et al 2021 parikh and chorover 2006 seng et al 2019a 2019b shi et al 2021 electrochemical processes do not require chemicals they are efficient and selective but require viable operations and controls these methods have been used to treat wastewater containing heavy metals jin 2021 jin et al reported that 97 8 cu and 93 4 bi can be recovered from highly acidic sulfate industrial wastewater 604 g l h2so4 concentration in 110 min using mass transfer enhanced electrodeposition technique by controlling current density in two steps 75 and 350 a m2 jin et al 2015 obviously the reduction of fe3 to fe2 using electric field action has potential advantages e g short time small influencing factors and no additive carbon source than the microbial reduction method therefore amd treatment technology combined with biomineralization and electroreduction methods can obtain high specific surface area secondary iron minerals and solve the problem of time consumption in this paper a cyclic mineralization method combining biooxidation mediated by a ferrooxidans and electroreduction is proposed as a pretreatment measure for amd lime neutralization this work aims at 1 studying the removal efficiency of fe so4 2 and various heavy metal ions 2 identifying the species of secondary iron minerals collected at the biooxidation stage and mineral s physicochemical properties and 3 using a pilot experiment to evaluate the stability and feasibility of the practical application of the two step treatment method biooxidation electroreduction cyclic mineralization followed by lime neutralization 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 collection of amd the amd in this study was collected from a sediment retained reservoir shaoguan guangdong province china the mine at the sampling site is a polymetallic deposit and limonite is the main mineral type the amd was acidic with so4 2 and fe ions as the main species the characteristics of amd are listed in table 1 2 1 2 preparation of a ferrooxidans cell suspensions the bacteria that were used in the experiment were acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans lx5 cgmcc no 0727 obtained from china general microbiological culture collection center cgmcc cultured in a 9k medium developed by silverman and lundgren silverman and lundgren 1959 the following medium components were all analytically pure 1 l deionized water 3 00 g nh4 2so4 0 10 g kcl 0 50 g k2hpo4 0 50 g mgso4 7h2o 0 01 g ca no3 2 and 44 48 g feso4 7h2o the medium was adjusted to ph 2 50 using h2so4 a ferrooxidans was inoculated in an improved 9k medium and shaken cultured in a 180 rpm shaker at 28 the culture was stopped at the later stage of exponential growth approximately 2 3 d then the culture medium was filtered using filter paper pore diameter is 1 3 μm to remove the generated iron precipitate the bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 3000 g relative centrifugal force 4 10 min and washed using acid water ph 1 50 prepared with h2so4 thrice to remove various miscellaneous ions the suspension of these bacteria in the acid water obtained a ferrooxidans resting cell solution with 8 2 108 cells ml measured using the double layer plate method jin et al 2019 2 2 treatment of amd 2 2 1 cyclic mineralization biooxidation stage the biooxidation was conducted in a 1000 ml conical flask containing 495 ml amd and 5 ml a ferrooxidans concentrate i e 1 microbial inoculation ratio v v the flask was placed in a rotating shaker at 180 rpm and 28 to initiate the biooxidation during the biooxidation 2 ml liquid samples were taken periodically 0 10 5 22 5 34 5 46 5 58 5 70 5 82 5 h and the ph value fe2 total fe tfe so4 2 and heavy metal cu2 zn2 mn2 cd2 concentration of the solution were determined after filtration using a 0 45 μm membrane a certain amount of deionized water needs to be replenished before each sample to replace volatilized water as constant volume is the basis for accurate stoichiometric calculations after the biooxidation the filtrate and secondary iron minerals were separated using filter paper pore diameter is 1 3 μm and the minerals were weighed after being dried at 50 electroreduction stage the electroreduction device consists of a 500 ml beaker an adjustable dc regulated power supply mp6010d and cathode anode plates the anode is made of ti with ir and ta coating and the cathode is pure ti the cathode and anode plates are fixed on both sides of the beaker at 35 mm spacing the spacing of the plates was determined by the pre experiment as shown in fig s1 and connected to the dc regulated power supply using cu wire the filtrate obtained at the endpoint of the biooxidation stage was added to a 500 ml beaker and an electric field was applied to the solution at a current density of 150 a m2 the current density was determined by the pre experiment as shown in fig s2 and a stirrer d40 2f was used to stir at 60 rpm to ensure the solution mixing uniformity samples were taken periodically 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 h and relevant indexes were measured during the electroreduction a certain amount of deionized water should be added before each sampling to replace the lost water since the application of an electric field will decompose small volume water into oxygen and hydrogen 2h2o 2h2 o2 the electric field will decrease the solution ph 2h2o 4e o2 4h and ph 2 50 4 50 is conducive for the efficient activity of a ferrooxidans and the formation of secondary iron minerals liao et al 2009 zhou et al 2021 therefore after the electroreduction ph 2 10 a small amount of low concentration naoh 40 mmol l was used to adjust the solution ph to 2 50 and then start the second round of biooxidation filtration electroreduction named b f e treatment fig 1 a in addition to simplify the operation steps secondary iron mineral filtration and separation after biooxidation was omitted in the control test the mixed solution containing minerals was directly transferred to the electroreduction device to start the reduction process named b e treatment fig 1b after the same number of cycles of biooxidation electroreduction filtrate and secondary iron minerals were separated using filter paper pore diameter is 1 3 μm the minerals were dried at 50 and analyzed using a scanning electron microscope sem x ray diffraction xrd energy disperse spectroscopy eds and brunauer emmett teller bet 2 2 2 lime neutralization the results of 2 2 1 showed that more than 90 of tfe can be precipitated after three times biooxidation and two times electoreduction b e treatment the color of the solution changes from deep orange to light yellow fig s3 the treated amd t amd from the cyclic process was treated with lime as neutralizer lime was slowly added to 300 ml t amd and the 2 ml solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm microporous membrane at different ph to collect the filtrate when the solution ph raised to 7 00 the neutralized sludge was collected by filtration dried at 50 and weighed the filtrate was stored at 4 and the concentration of heavy metals cu2 zn2 mn2 and cd2 was determined in this study the raw amd r amd was treated using lime directly in the conventional method 2 2 3 pilot test to verify the feasibility of biooxidation electroreduction cycle for amd treatment a pilot test was conducted on a movable test device the test device includes amd disposal reactor 700 l effective volume microporous aerator was set at the bottom electrolytic device fixed in the reactor air compressor provided aeration to ensure the solution mixing uniformity air storage tank pneumatic diaphragm pump conveyed the material to the filter press chamber filter press solid liquid separation dc regulated power supply power distribution cabinet fig 2 pilot test steps add 693 l amd to the reactor and inoculate 7 l a ferrooxidans concentrate on a 1 ratio start the air compressor and adjust the aeration device aeration speed was approximately 1 2 m3 h after 36 h biooxidation preliminary results showed that the rate of tfe precipitation slightly increased after 36 h the electrolytic reaction was conducted at 150 a m2 current density for 4 h preliminary results showed that the concentration of fe2 tends to be stable after 4 h of electrolytic reaction then 7 l microorganisms were reinoculated and ph was adjusted to 2 50 using lime owing to the high price of naoh and the second round biooxidation electroreduction was conducted under the same conditions finally we reinoculated 7 l microorganisms and adjusted ph to 2 50 for the third biooxidation reaction thus completing one batch of amd the ph fe2 tfe and other indicators of the reaction system were monitored during the entire test process at the end of the first batch the reactor was emptied and cleaned and five batches were completed as described above after treating the fifth batch the pneumatic diaphragm pump was started to pump the mixed solution into the filter press for pressure filtration dehydration to obtain minerals and filtrate the feed pressure was increased from 0 4 to 0 8 mpa pressing pressure was 1 2 mpa the obtained minerals were weighed and their water content was measured the filtrate t amd about 700 l was neutralized using lime until ph 7 00 the amount of lime added was recorded and the raw amd r amd was neutralized with lime as a control finally neutralized amd was dehydrated using the filter press and mud cake was collected weighed and its moisture content measured the lime demands and neutralization mud cake productions of amd before and after biooxidation electroreduction treatment were compared 2 3 calculation fe3 concentration was calculated

ag jena germany song et al 2018 fe2 concentration was determined using the 1 10 phenanthroline colorimetric method and a t 6 spectrophotometer philes china apha 1981 harvey et al 1955 when it was necessary to distinguish between fe3 and fe2 fe2 concentration was measured before and after reduction using excess ascorbic acid and then fe3 concentration was calculated based on the difference between two of such measurements heavy metal elements were determined using a shimadzu icps 7500 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer icp aes shimadzu japan todolí and mermet 2006 whereas so4 2 concentrations were determined using a 792 bastc ic ion chromatography system metrohm switzerland haddad et al 2008 the margins of error and detection limits of each method were given in supplemental material table s1 the crystal structures of the collected minerals were determined using an x ray diffractometer bruker d8 germany cu kα radiation source 40 kv 40 ma fewster 2004 a su8010 sem hitachi japan was used to observe the mineral morphologies operated at a 1 5 kv acceleration voltage weaver et al 2010 the elemental composition was examined by eds 20 kv the nitrogen adsorption

areas sing 2001 3 results and discussion 3 1 cyclic mineralization 3 1 1 ph and concentration of fe2 and fe3 in cyclic mineralization during the first biooxidation process after 34 5 h the ph of the solution decreased rapidly from 2 50 to 2 00 fig 3 a although the oxidation of fe2 is an h consuming reaction the generated fe3 will undergo hydrolysis and produce h hedrich and johnson 2012 kefeni et al 2017 therefore the hydrolysis rate of fe3 in this process was faster than the oxidation rate of fe2 the oxidation rate of abiotic fe2 is low at ph 3 50 even in oxygen saturated water however a ferrooxidans can accelerate the oxidation of fe2 in acidic water lacey and lawson 1970 singer and stumm 1970 stumm and morgan 1995 the fe2 concentration decreased from 9 44 g l to 1 07 mg l during the first 34 5 h of the first biooxidation process corresponding to the change in solution ph fig 3b the oxidation rate of fe2 in the first 34 5 h ranged from 0 27 to 0 42 g l h which was close to the results obtained by li et al 0 37 g l h li et al 2011 in the subsequent first electroreduction process the concentration of fe2 increased from 1 07 mg l to 2 60 g l in 5 h and the reduction rate of fe3 was 32 7 when the fe2 generated by the first electroreduction was used as the energy substrate for the second biooxidation the minerals formed in the first oxidation stage would reduce the biooxidation rate of fe2 and prolong its complete oxidation time as shown in b e treatment moreover the difference in fe2 oxidation rate between b e treatment and b f e treatment was evident in the third biooxidation process fig 3b the possible reason is that a ferrooxidans can secrete extracellular polymeric substances eps which can adhere to the mineral surface and a ferrooxidans will be adsorbed on the mineral instead of the free state reducing the contact frequency with fe2 wang and zhou 2011 however the concentration of fe3 considerably decreased during the b e treatment for example after the second oxidation stage the reduction of fe3 concentration in the b e treatment was 3 61 g l which was higher than that in the b f e treatment 2 72 g l fig 3c there is a short induction period before the precipitation of fe in the solution and the mineral particles existing at the beginning of the reaction can be used to inhibit the induction period and improve the precipitation rate of fe dutrizac 1996 studies by zhang et al showed that introducing additional schwertmannite before the biosynthesis of schwertmannite by a ferrooxidans can promote more schwertmannite generated zhang et al 2017 therefore compared with b f e treatment b e treatment was easier to operate and had a better amd treatment effect 3 1 2 concentrations of tfe so4 2 and heavy metals in cyclic mineralization the decrease in tfe concentration reflects the mineralization of fe3 as shown in fig 4 a the removal rates of tfe in the three oxidation stages of b f e treatment cycle mineralization were 33 8 47 4 and 12 3 respectively and the final tfe removal rate was 93 5 the removal of so4 2 was almost synchronous with tfe and the final cumulative removal rate was 53 1 fig 4b the b e treatment cyclic mineralization treatment obtained better amd treatment efficiency than the above results its cumulative removal rates of tfe and so4 2 were increased to 98 2 and 62 4 respectively as shown in fig 4c the removal effect of cd2 mn2 cu2 and zn2 in the biooxidation stage during mineralization was insignificant for example after the first oxidation treatment the concentration of the four heavy metals decreased by 8 3 9 0 0 2 and 9 0 respectively notably the concentration of cu2 considerably decreased during the first reduction stage from 2 15 to 1 10 mg l which can be attributed to the reduction of cu2 under electric field cu2 2e cu0 desmarquest et al 1970 and the precipitation of elemental cu0 was on the surface of the cathode plate during the experiment fig s4 notably after the electroreduction a small amount of low concentration naoh 40 mmol l was used to adjust the solution ph to 2 50 and then start the second round of mineralization 88 5 h this operation may be the main reason for promoting the removal of cd2 mn2 and zn2 3 1 3 secondary iron minerals as shown in fig 5 a the mass of minerals collected after b e treatment was 16 99 g higher than the amount of minerals collected during b f e treatment 15 53 g the morphological characteristics chemical structure elemental composition and specific surface area of minerals collected after b e treatment are shown in figs 5b e these precipitated particles were uniform spherules with a diameter of 2 5 μm their surfaces were covered with long needles and had the hedgehog morphology of schwertmannite particles regenspurg et al 2004 fig 5b unlike that formed via chemosynthesis which were smooth wang et al 2019 the xrd patterns of the mineral samples were the same as the schwertmannite standard template pdf 47 1775 fig 5c eds analysis indicated that fe o and s were the main elements existing in the mineral fig 5d based on the n2 sorption isotherm curve the calculated specific surface area of schwertmannite was 112 59 m2 g fig 5e which was much higher than that formed in chemical method feso4 h2o2 2 06 16 30 m2 g liu et al 2015b wang et al 2019 after the determination of the fe and so4 2 contents using icp aes and ion chromatography respectively the structural formula of the schwertmannite could be expressed as fe8o8 oh 5 16 so4 1 37 this is similar to the schwertmannite structure fe8o8 oh 4 50 so4 1 75 synthesized using chemical method wang et al 2019 3 2 lime neutralization adding lime to amd can neutralize acid and promote metal ions to generate hydroxide precipitation to be removed kalin et al 2006 tolonen et al 2014 300 ml treated amd t amd of b e treatment was taken as the object of the lime neutralization experiment in addition the same volume of raw amd r amd was used as a control considering ph 7 00 and 12 00 as nodes the lime required by 300 ml t amd are 0 9 and 1 5 g respectively which were less than r amd that are 6 0 and 6 7 g fig 6 in addition when reaching neutral ph 7 00 the amount of neutralized sludge of the former was 4 7 g only one quarter of that in the latter 18 4 g cu2 zn2 mn2 and cd2 in t amd were completely removed when the solution reached neutral regardless of their concentrations at the end of the cyclic mineralization treatment in contrast none of the four heavy metals were completely removed in r amd at ph 7 00 3 3 pilot test to verify the feasibility of the biooxidation electroreduction cyclic mineralization system in practical applications a pilot experiment similar to the laboratory experiment was needed the ph fe2 and fe3 concentration of the solution were monitored during the pilot cyclic mineralization to evaluate the stability of the system in the five mineralization batches after the first oxidation reduction cycle the ph was reduced from 2 50 to 2 00 and then adjusted to 2 50 suitable for the a ferrooxidans biooxidation reaction fig 7 a finally it was reduced to 1 80 at the end of the oxidation reduction cycle at the end of each batch there was no residual fe2 in the solution and the residual fe3 concentration was stable below 1 22 g l in conclusion the mineralization system exhibited good stability over multiple runs the average removal rates of tfe and so4 2 of the five batches were 91 6 and 63 6 respectively fig 7b the sludge sedimentation rates of r amd and t amd after lime neutralization were 62 and 82 standing time 10 min respectively fig s5 the fifth batch yielded 16 6 kg schwertmannite and in the subsequent lime neutralization test the t amd from this batch produced 5 1 kg neutralized sludge 86 3 less than that obtained using r amd 37 2 kg figs 7c s5 the pilot experiment proved that the treatment of amd via biooxidation electroreduction cyclic mineralization followed by lime neutralization was technically feasible notably the average removal rates of tfe and so4 2 of amd reached 84 8 and 57 2 at the end of the second oxidation respectively indicating that the amd treatment efficiency obtained in this study was sufficiently high after two cycles of biooxidation and one cycle of electroreduction therefore the number of oxidation reduction cycles can be increased or decreased according to the actual amd properties and operation effects 4 conclusions the integrated treatment of biooxidation electroreduction cyclic mineralization and lime neutralization is a feasible method for treating amd this method has the following advantages 1 biooxidation does not need additional oxidants or carbon sources secondary pollutants 2 the electroreduction method does not need an additional reducing agent moreover it improves the stability and decreases the reduction time when compared with the anaerobic biological method 3 the two step cyclic process can be conducted in the same container using simple equipment and with convenient operations making it suitable for the amd sequential batch operation mode 4 the sequence of cyclic mineralization is not invariable when the concentration of fe3 in amd is much higher than that of fe2 electrolytic reduction can be started first and followed by biological oxidation 5 schwertmannite the final sediment obtained after the biooxidation electroreduction cyclic mineralization is an environmentally friendly adsorption material 6 the pretreatment of amd using the biooxidation electroreduction cycle can reduce the amount of neutralized sludge produced by applying the subsequent lime neutralization treatment by six times pilot test although the current study shows that this amd treatment is technically feasible its practical application can be realized with a better understanding of its potential drawbacks presently the main problem is that a ferrooxidans needs to be reinoculated when a new round of biooxidation stage start and the ph needs to be adjusted again after each electroreduction which increases the workload and cost during continuous operation the feasible solution is to investigate the continuous mineralization effect at low current density under the premise of not affecting bacteria activity conducting oxidation and reduction at the same time the specific feasibility and various optimal conditions need to be studied in the future authorship contribution statement zehao guo conceptualization designed this study

15728,waste activated sludge was contains high concentrations of microplastics mps which could serve as vectors of various organic pollutants and heavy metals causing synergistic transportation and pollution the application of combined hydrothermal pretreatment htp and anaerobic digestion ad has raised growing concerns since the low temperature hydrothermal treatment could enhance the biogas production of was however the changes in physicochemical properties adsorption performances and effects on ad of mps by htp have not been studied the study used three typical mps in was and it was found that the htp 170 c 30min increased mps specific surface area and carbonyl index ci while decreasing the relative crystallinity the adsorption capacity to cd increased through the carbonylation for polyethylene microplastic pe mp and polystyrene microplastic ps mp while decreasing by the dechlorination for polyvinyl chloride microplastic pvc mp meanwhile increased hydrophilicity reduced the adsorption capacities of all three typical mps for ofloxacin the above results indicated that the htp could be worth blocking the adsorption of polar mps for polar pollutants for the pristine mps only pvc mp at the highest concentration 0 5 g kg 1 vs significantly p 0 05 reduced methane production by 16 2 3 3 of was without the htp however the htp resulted in significant p 0 05 inhibition of methane production of was at high concentrations of pe mp and pvc mp e g 0 1 and 0 5 g kg 1 vs which was due to the acceleration of the released toxic plastic additives dibutyl phthalate dimethyl phthalate and bisphenol a microbial analysis showed the abundances of vital anaerobes such as acid producing bacteria acetoanerrobium and mesotoga proteolytic bacteria proteiniborus and methanogens methanosaeta clearly decreased with the pe mp and pvc mp after the htp which might result in the decreased methane production the study provided deep insight of mps behaviors during the combined htp ad process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics waste activated sludge hydrothermal pretreatment physicochemical property adsorption anaerobic digestion data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the population growth and rapid urbanization lead to the production of a significant amount of sewage sludge generated at municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps peccia and westerhoff 2015 according to the statistics in 2018 the production of waste activated sludge was in the world s major economies was about 38 million tons in the us 44 million tons in the european union and 55 million tons in china zhang et al 2017 was has incredible potential for energy and nutrient recovery since it contains rich amounts of organic matter nutrients and trace constituents yang et al 2015 however was also contains a wide variety of emerging contaminants such as pathogens antibiotics antibiotic resistant genes and microplastics mps which have high risks to the water and soil environments raju et al 2018 studies of the properties and trends of these emerging pollutants in was treatment could help understand their environmental behaviors and synergistic effects mps generally defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm thompson et al 2004 were reported as an emerging contaminant with potential hazards to the ecological environment daily human activities continue to discharge both primary katsnelson 2015 and secondary arthur et al 2009 he et al 2019 lassen et al 2015 mps into sewage water wastewater treatment plants could effectively remove mps from the sewage through sedimentation floatation and membrane filtration which led to the enrichment of approximately 99 of the mps in wastewater into was mahon et al 2017 currently several studies comprehensively reported that the concentrations of sludge based mps ranged from 4 2 103 to 6 4 106 particles kg dw chand et al 2022 lassen et al 2015 ni et al 2020 meaning was may act as an important long term sink for mps and keep delivering them into the water and soil environments rochman 2018 the high density of crosslinks that gives plastics functional properties for example chemical and thermal resistance and tensile strength comes at the expense of degradability shieh et al 2020 which means mps are challenging to be removed by sludge treatment processes mahon et al 2017 several studies found that mps could serve as potential carriers to adsorb other pollutants such as antibiotics and heavy metals due to the large specific surface areas and strong hydrophobicity hüffer and hofmann 2016 rochman et al 2013 zou et al 2020 ding et al 2020 found that the specific surface areas and oxygen containing surface groups of mps were significantly increased by environmental factors like oxygen solar radiation and mechanical abrasion in the environment which was highly responsible for increasing the adsorption capacities of mps to antibiotics li et al 2019 reported that the adsorption capacity of sludge based mps for cd was one order of magnitude higher than pristine mps which was attributed to changed physicochemical properties of mps by mechanical abrasion e g grating and aeration tank biological degradation e g digestion and aeration tank chemical effects e g lime stabilization at wwtps the above research demonstrated that the intensive physical chemical and biological processes changed the physicochemical properties of mps which could enhance their adsorption potential for pollutants in addition several studies demonstrated that mps could significantly affect the performance of anaerobic digestion ad and the corresponding impact was considerably related to the content of mps feng et al 2021 wei et al 2019b 2019a reported polyvinyl chloride pvc particles and polyethylene pe particles caused adverse impact on the microbial communities through leaching the toxic bisphenol a and inducing reactive oxygen species ros and then inhibited the ad of was as a common practice for was stabilization ad converts high strength organic wastes into bioenergy and stable organic residues and low temperature hydrothermal treatment lower than 180 c is commonly used as pretreatment to enhance downstream biogas production by spilling intracellular matters and hydrolyzing extracellular polymeric substances in was chen et al 2019 fang et al 2019 thus the application of combined hydrothermal pretreatment htp and ad processes has recently raised growing concerns chen et al 2019 fang et al 2019 htp at 170 c 30 min was the most widely used condition for the pretreatment of was to enhance ad in practice ambye jensen et al 2013 qiao et al 2011 compared to the stress factors solar radiation temperature and humidity in the natural environment more severe condition was created in thermochemical process with higher temperature and humidity the hypothesis was that mps adsorption performances and effects on ad of was could be changed via the htp process which has not been studied until now in order to fill the above knowledge gap this study chose typical mps polyethylene microplastic polystyrene microplastic and polyvinyl chloride microplastic murphy et al 2016 in was to investigate 1 the physicochemical property changes of mps via htp by comparing the changes of morphology

the pretreatment of was to enhance ad in practice ambye jensen et al 2013 chen et al 2019 qiao et al 2011 thus the raw was with three different concentrations of mps 0 02 0 1 0 5 g kg 1 vs was treated by an htp reactor with a volume of 250 ml custom made htlab china at 170 c 30 min and then used as the substrate for batch ad to determine mps effects on methane production the pure mps pe mp ps mp pvc mp were treated in another autoclave reactor with a volume of 150 ml custom made htlab china to obtain treated mps and hydrothermal liquid htl in a typical run the reactor was sealed and heated to 170 c holding for 30 min when 5 g of pe mp with 95 ml of ultrapure water was added zhao et al 2018b the heating rate was 15 c min 1 and agitation was 600 rpm a metal mesh was used to filter hydrothermal mixtures to obtain hydrothermal treated mps and htl all of obtained samples were sealed in glass reagent bottles and stored in a 4 c refrigerator for further analysis 2 3 leached toc of

of 50 days the toc concentrations of the leachate were measured every 5 10 days the organic components of the leachate were analyzed on the 50th day as well as the htl 2 4 adsorption experiments in this study cd and ofloxacin ofl which are widespread heavy metal and antibiotic pollutants in the natural environment and was were used as representative absorbates to explore the adsorption of mps to metal and antibiotic pollutants li et al 2019 oberoi et al 2019 respectively in order to design sorption isotherms of mps cdso4 aladdin chemistry co ltd was used to prepare 1 2 4 8 16 20 mg l 1 of cd

were carried out by a prodigy spec icp oes leeman labs inc usa and the concentrations of ofl were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent technologies 1200 usa equipped with a reversed phase c8 column 5 μm 4 6 150 mm and an uv detector at 265 and 286 nm 2 6 3 microbial community analysis at the final stage of methane production the hw hw pe hw ps and hw pvc were collected and centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 10 min the triplicate samples three parallel reactors of each set were blended together and stored in a 80 c freezer for further analyses the extraction of total genomic dna real time qpcr sequencing via illumina hiseq 2000 platform with 101 bp paired end strategy and bioinformatics analyses were conducted based on our previous study usman et al 2020 2 6 4 others the biogas composition of ad ch4 and co2 was measured using gas chromatography gc 960 chen et al 2021 2019 the ph total and volatile solids ts vs were measured according to procedures described in standard methods eaton et al 2014 2 7 data analysis the one way analysis of variance anova was performed to compare results from different treatments the tukey hsd test was used to determine significant differences at a significance level of 0 05 all statistical tests were performed by spss statistics 20 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mps before and after htp 3 1 1 morphologies the mps structure changes surface morphologies functional groups and elements via htp were carefully delineated as shown in fig 1 a c all the pristine mps were observed to have relatively smooth surfaces the morphology of mps displayed much rougher surfaces and irregular cracks along with deformation textures after being treated via htp fig 1d e the morphology changes of different mp types were not exactly the same pe mp and ps mp were shrunken shapes with debris and crakes while pvc mp was inflation with many holes moreover a large number of debris size of 1 μm appeared on the surface of treated pe mp and ps mp which seemed to peel off at any time those debris could be attributed to the hydraulic shearing of htp mahon et al 2017 the relative crystallinity of pe mp ps mp and pvc mp decreased via htp fig s1 si and the specific surface area of pe mp and pvc mp increased table s1 si previous studies reported the activation energies for the pyrolysis of polymers pvc 119 297 kj mol pe 117 176 kj mol ps 103 116 kj mol alsewailem and almutabaqani 2013 wang et al 2019 indicating that the morphological destruction of mps via htp presented the following descending order ps mp pe mp pvc mp 3 1 2 functional groups micro ftir was performed to analyze surface functional groups of mps in the ftir spectra of pe mp ps mp and pvc mp fig s2 si the characteristic bands at 2922 1745 and 1407 cm 1 displayed strong intensities representing stretching vibration of methylene ch2 stretching vibration of carbonyl co and bending vibration of methylene attached to carbonyl ochch2 respectively the three types of htp treated mps displayed several similar infrared absorption bands with pristine ones indicating the polymer backbones of mps were not completely changed during htp at 170 c for 30 min compared with the single point measurement of ftir the imaging of ftir enabled the infrared imaging spectra of an indicated region on 500 500 μm mps surface which is more favorable for clarifying the various characteristics of surface functional groups liu et al 2019a the surface alteration properties of pe mp ps mp and pvc mp could be quantitatively described by the rocking vibration of consecutive methylene 719 cm 1 stretching vibration of the benzene ring 1601 1548 1495 1455 cm 1 and stretching vibration of chlorine 696 cm 1 respectively fig 2 a c the decreased intensity of consecutive methylene benzene ring and chlorine suggested that these poor thermal stability groups on the surface of mps might be initially replaced by oh radical min et al 2020 and the de hydroxylation of the htp process subsequently generated ketone or carboxyl groups 1745 cm 1 zhang et al 2021c the carbonyl index ci was an essential parameter to quantitatively describe the aging degree of mps which was calculated by the intensity of carbonyl relative to the methylene peak 1712 2922 brandon et al 2016 the heat map clearly showed the distribution of carbonyl groups on the mps surfaces fig 2d the ci of the three types of pristine mps increased obviously after htp and the increment was pvc mp ps mp pe mp which means the chlorine on the carbon chain was the easiest to be replaced followed by benzene ring and hydrogen methylene in addition infrared imaging results showed that the aging of mps during the htp process was uneven which might be because the chain reactions of polymer depolymerization were more likely to occur at the site of structural damage zhang et al 2021a the o c ratio was an alternative parameter to the ci to characterize the aging degree of mps liu et al 2019b the results of xps showed that the o c ratio of the three types of mps increased via htp table s2 si which further confirmed the increase in oxygen containing groups ding et al 2020 in the high resolution xps spectra of c1s and o1s fig s3 si the c c h 284 8 ev for bonds pe mp and ps mp or the ccl 285 0 ev bonds for pvc mp were initially changed to co 288 4 ev and then partly converted to co 290 6 ev could be clearly detected which agreed with the results of ftir imaging analysis 3 1 3 leached toc as previously reported mps could release potentially toxic substances including monomers plasticizers and antioxidants into the environment along with its aging and degradation in the long term zhu et al 2020 mps concentration will not be the limiting factor of toc release since the leaching of organic matters from mps is very slow the amounts of toc leached from pristine pe mp ps mp and pvc mp were 0 649 0 071 0 328 0 054 and 2 813 0 209 mg g 1 respectively which was higher than that from treated mps 0 481 0 01 0 275 0 044 1 612 0 207 mg g 1 on the 50th day fig 3 a however high concentrations of toc were detected in htl fig 3b which were 9 12 0 49 5 65 0 76 and 15 69 0 89 mg g 1 for pe mp ps mp and pvc mp respectively indicating that the leached toc of mps could be significantly p 0 05 accelerated by the htp gc ms was further used to analyze the organic components of leached toc qualitatively the relative abundances of the detected organics are presented in fig 3c methylenebisbutylcresol is a widely used antioxidant with excellent dispersibility in water solution zhang et al 2021b which had a high proportion in leachate and htl of pristine mps but a low proportion in treated mp similarly some plasticizers bisphenol a and dibutyl phthalate were detected in the leachate and htl of pristine mps but not in the leachate of treated pvc mp only a few kinds of organic matters in htl were intermediate substances valeric acid and 2 methylcyclopent while most were additives bisphenol a dibutyl phthalate diisobutyl phthalate dimethyl phthalate and methylenebisbutylcresol zhao et al 2018a the above results proved that htp could cause the additives in mps to be quickly released into htl and the treated mps almost no longer leached additives during the experiment however considering that plastics are carbon based chain structures the release of toc occurs throughout mps lifecycle long term leaching experiments of mps in the aqueous phase require further investigation 3 2 adsorption capacity of mps before and after htp previous studies reported that the interactions between mps and pollutants e g intermolecular force hydrogen bond hydrophobic force aromatic ring stacking and halogen bond are related to their functional groups and the adsorption sites are related to the specific surface and crystallinity of mps xu et al 2019 therefore the adsorption performances of pristine and treated mps were investigated and correlated to physicochemical feature changes 3 2 1 metal as shown in fig 4 a c the qe of pristine pe mp ps mp and pvc mp mps for cd was 0 58 0 04 0 68 0 19 and 0 48 0 11 mg g 1 respectively according to the fitting results tables s3 si the adsorption isotherms of cd on pristine and treated mps fitted the freundlich model well suggesting it was multilayer adsorption wang et al 2018 several previous studies demonstrated that the adsorption of mps to cd was dominated by electrostatic interaction and surface complexation li et al 2019 tourinho et al 2019 which means the increasing polarity and decreasing relative crystallinity were conducive to the adsorption of cd ions the results showed that htp significantly p 0 05 increased the adsorption capacities of pe mp and ps mp to cd by 28 2 9 9 and 16 7 7 1 respectively the ch2 groups of pe mp or cc groups of ps mp were converted to co groups fig 2d which provided more hydrogen bonds as adsorption sites zou et al 2020 meanwhile the relative crystallinity of three types of mps was reduced via htp table s1 si which formed free volume between the polymer for mobility and diffusivity of metal ions teuten et al 2009 however the adsorption capacity of pvc mp was significantly weakened p 0 05 by htp zou et al 2020 reported that the cl groups could enhance the polarity and negativity of pvc and promote its surface affinity with metal ions the c cl ratio of pvc mp was decreased from 0 138 to 0 035 via htp table s2 si which led to a decrease in adsorption performance to cd li et al 2019 reported that sludge based mps had an adsorption capacity of 2 5 mg g 1 to heavy metals and thought that types of mps had a significant effect on the adsorption of metal pollutants in this study htp decreased the adsorption capacity of pvc mp to cd but increased pe mp and ps mp by changing their physicochemical properties suggesting that treated mps might exert a substantial effect on the transport of metal pollutants during the sludge treatment process 3 2 2 antibiotic the adsorption isotherm of ofl could be better fitted with langmuir model than the freundlich model fig 4d f tables s3 si indicating it was mainly monolayer saturated adsorption razanajatovo et al 2018 several studies demonstrated that the adsorption of mps to organic pollutants is mainly dominated by hydrophobic interaction and the non linear adsorption isotherms also indicated the effect of micropore filling and van der waals force hüffer and hofmann 2016 liu et al 2019a velzeboer et al 2014 the maximum adsorption capacity qm of ofl on ps mp was 15 769 1 402 mg g 1 while the qm of ofl on pe mp and pvc mp was 8 641 0 774 and 4 88 0 867 mg g 1 respectively in this study the relative crystallinity of ps mp was the lowest which might lead to the maximum free volume between the polymer chains teuten et al 2009 thus the structure of ps mp allowed higher pollutant mobility and diffusivity rate than pe mp and pvc mp resulting in the highest adsorption capacity to ofl pascall et al 2004 in addition the presence of benzene rings on ps mp increased its aromaticity which produced strong sorption by π π interactions to molecules with the aromatic surface velzeboer et al 2014 previous studies found that the adsorption affinity of ps to pcbs and pahs was higher than other non aromatic polymers pe pp and pvc which was consistent with the above mentioned π π interactions of aromaticity rochman et al 2013 ding et al 2020 found that air aged ps mp got higher adsorption capacity for 6 types of organic pollutants which was thought to be attributed to the increased specific area and oxygen containing functional groups however in this study the adsorption capacities of three types of treated mps to ofl were decreased by 22 93 0 66 19 93 1 33 and 30 01 10 56 p 0 05 respectively as mentioned above the hydrophobic interaction governed the adsorption capacity of mps to organic pollutants the ofl is a polar molecule containing hydrophobic functional groups f and htp considerably reduced the hydrophobicity of the mps which could lead to the decreased adsorption capacity to ofl moreover the aromaticity of ps mp and chlorine of pvc mp were reduced by carbonylation carbonyl groups replaced benzene rings or chlorines during htp which could also lead to the decrease of their aromatic ring stacking and halogen bond to ofl respectively the changed hydrophilicity and functional groups of mps via htp decreased their adsorption properties for ofl and probably also other polar organic pollutants including polychlorinated biphenyls polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane zou et al 2020 the above results suggested that htp of was may decrease adsorption capacity of mps to some pollutants e g pcv mp to cd and pvc mp to ofl by altering mps physicochemical properties which could be worthy for blocking the synergistic occurrence and transportation of them the adsorption performances and mechanisms of different types of mps to different pollutants deserves further study 3 3 effects mps before and after htp on ad 3 3 1 methane production batch experiments were performed to investigate the impact of mps on methane production of was as shown in fig 5 the batch ad was considered complete when cumulative methane production of each set reached a stationary level on the 50th day the methane production of hw fig 5d f was significantly 28 1 2 2 p 0 05 higher than that of rw fig 5a c which proved the promoting effect of htp for the batch ad using raw was and pristine mps as substrates only pristine pvc mp at the highest concentration 0 5 g kg 1 vs significantly p 0 05 reduced methane production by 16 2 3 3 fig 5f the fig 5d f showed that a low concentration i e 0 02 g kg 1 vs of mps did not significantly p 0 05 affect methane production compared to the htp treated was without mps however the hw pe and hw pvc with higher concentrations i e 0 1 and 0 5 g kg 1 vs significantly p 0 05 inhibited the methane production reaching up to 12 6 3 7 and 52 3 7 1 of the hw it could be supposed that htp enhanced the inhibitory effect of pe mp and pvc mp on methane production which might be attributed to the promotion of leached toc the effects of treated mps and htl of mps on ad were further investigated respectively as shown in fig 5 g i an outstanding inhibition of methane production happened when 0 5 ml of htl equivalent to 0 1 g kg 1 vs of mps was added into the ad digesters the htl of pvc mp showed the most significant p 0 05 inhibition by decreasing methane production from 3 9 0 7 to 50 4 0 8 of the control with the equivalent concentrations of pvc mp increased from 0 02 to 0 5 g kg 1 vs fig 5l however the three types of treated mps did not decrease methane production the above results indicated that the htp of pe mp and ps mp with a concentration higher than 0 1 g kg 1 vs had a significant p 0 05 inhibitory effect on methane production of ad this inhibition was caused by htl rather than treated mps which further indicated that the leached toc was the main factor causing the decrease in methane production in this study the toc concentrations of htl were present in the following descending order pvc mp pe mp ps mp the htl of mp contained a wider variety of phthalic acid esters dibutyl phthalate diisobutyl phthalate and dimethyl phthalate which were reported to have acute toxicity on microorganisms staples et al 1997 bisphenol a had a high proportion in htl of pvc mp that could inhibit the undomesticated anaerobes at the early stage of ad wei et al 2019b thus the results implied that the inhibitory effect of mps on ad depended on concentrations types and additives however considering the promoting effect of htp chen et al 2017 fang et al 2019 even if the inhibition effect of sludge based mps might be enhanced after htp the overall methane production of htp treated was would still be higher than untreated 3 3 2 microbiological analyses as mentioned in 3 3 1 the htp treated mps 0 5 g kg 1 vs had a greater impact on methane production of was therefore the microbial communities in ad of htp treated was with and without mps were analyzed to explore the effect of mps on microorganisms the alpha diversity showed that the pd whole tree index shannon index and chao index were not obviously changed by mps table s4 si which means the microbial diversity of ad was not affected by mps phylum level distributions of microbial populations of these sets were presented in fig 6 a in this study the most abundant bacterial populations of batch ad were firmicutes synergistota acidobacteriota and bacteroidota accounting for 72 3 to 83 2 of the total bacterial community in each set compared with the control the abundance of firmicutes decreased by 5 8 to 24 6 in all the experimental set and the abundance of acidobacteriota and bacteroidota variated obviously these three phyla were reported to possess abilities to convert organic compounds e g proteins and carbohydrates into volatile fatty acids under anaerobic conditions ariesyady et al 2007 which means their abundance variation could be aligned with the lower methane production under the presence of mps in this study further exploration at the genus level showed that the microbial communities in each set were composed of various anaerobes relevant to hydrolysis e g aminicenantales alkaliphilus mesotoga and fitmicutes acidogenesis e g proteiniborus garcielles and acetoanaerobium and methanogenesis e g methanosaeta fig 6b chen et al 2019 luo et al 2016 the abundance of acetoanerrobium and mesotoga the main acid producing bacteria reported previously luo et al 2016 clearly decreased in hm pe the pe mp could release a high proportion of dibutyl phthalate and diisobutyl phthalate via htp which was reported to decrease the abundances of various vital anaerobes similarly the htl of pvc mp contained high proportions of dibutyl phthalate and bisphenol a which led to the lowest abundances of methanogens methanosaeta and proteolytic bacteria proteiniborus wei et al 2019b thus the set of hw pvc showed the highest degree of ad inhibition on methane production reaching 52 3 7 1 production fig 5 although the htl of ps mp also changed the microbial community methane production of hw ps did not significantly decrease fig 5e the reason could be that the ps mp released less concentration of toc and was mainly methylenebisbutylcresol which was reported to be a low toxicity antioxidant zhang et al 2021a therefore the effect of different types of mps on the anaerobic microflora was different which was strongly associated with the components of leached toc in the follow up research it is worth studying the final trend of residual mps and released additives in biogas residue deposal it should also be noted that a large number of daughter mps smaller than 1 μm were generated on the surface of htp treated mps since these nano plastics were partially oxidized or hydrated with a high specific surface area their absorption potentials for pollutants colonization for microorganisms and adverse effects on creatures would be facilitated dang et al 2022 thus the occurrence and toxicology of nano plastics are also worthy of development in the future 4 conclusions the present study showed that the htp at 170 c and 30 min increased mps specific surface area ci value and leached toc while decreasing their relative crystallinity which caused changes in their environmental behaviors the htl of mps contained a variety of plastic additives such as bisphenol a dibutyl phthalate diisobutyl phthalate dimethyl phthalate and methylenebisbutylcresol as the carbonylation of htp changed the surface functional groups the adsorption capacity of treated pe mp and ps mp to cd was significantly p 0 05 increased while that of pvc was significantly p 0 05 weakened meanwhile the potential adsorption capacity of all treated mps to ofl significantly p 0 05 decreased under severe conditions high temperature pressure humidity and mechanical stress of the htp process which was related to the adsorption mechanism monolayer adsorption dominated by hydrophobic interaction ad experiments showed that the pristine mps did not significantly inhibit the methane production of raw was except pristine pvc mp at the highest concentration 0 5 g kg 1 vs however the htp treated was with a high concentration i e 0 1 and 0 5 g kg 1 vs of pe mp and pvc mp significantly p 0 05 inhibited the methane production reaching up to 12 6 3 7 and 52 3 7 1 of the control the inhibition of high concentration mps i e 0 5 g kg 1 vs on ad was mainly caused by the large amount of leached toc which contained a variety of toxic additives the htp could accelerate the release of plastic additives into htl thus increasing the inhibitory effect of mps on ad the abundance of vital anaerobes such as acid producing bacteria acetoanerrobium and mesotoga proteolytic bacteria proteiniborus and methanogens methanosaeta were clearly decreased after the htp of pe mp and pvc mp which was attributed to high proportions of bisphenol a and phthalates plasticizers therefore the inhibitory effects of mps on ad and anaerobic microflora were strongly associated with the concentrations types and additives

15728,waste activated sludge was contains high concentrations of microplastics mps which could serve as vectors of various organic pollutants and heavy metals causing synergistic transportation and pollution the application of combined hydrothermal pretreatment htp and anaerobic digestion ad has raised growing concerns since the low temperature hydrothermal treatment could enhance the biogas production of was however the changes in physicochemical properties adsorption performances and effects on ad of mps by htp have not been studied the study used three typical mps in was and it was found that the htp 170 c 30min increased mps specific surface area and carbonyl index ci while decreasing the relative crystallinity the adsorption capacity to cd increased through the carbonylation for polyethylene microplastic pe mp and polystyrene microplastic ps mp while decreasing by the dechlorination for polyvinyl chloride microplastic pvc mp meanwhile increased hydrophilicity reduced the adsorption capacities of all three typical mps for ofloxacin the above results indicated that the htp could be worth blocking the adsorption of polar mps for polar pollutants for the pristine mps only pvc mp at the highest concentration 0 5 g kg 1 vs significantly p 0 05 reduced methane production by 16 2 3 3 of was without the htp however the htp resulted in significant p 0 05 inhibition of methane production of was at high concentrations of pe mp and pvc mp e g 0 1 and 0 5 g kg 1 vs which was due to the acceleration of the released toxic plastic additives dibutyl phthalate dimethyl phthalate and bisphenol a microbial analysis showed the abundances of vital anaerobes such as acid producing bacteria acetoanerrobium and mesotoga proteolytic bacteria proteiniborus and methanogens methanosaeta clearly decreased with the pe mp and pvc mp after the htp which might result in the decreased methane production the study provided deep insight of mps behaviors during the combined htp ad process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics waste activated sludge hydrothermal pretreatment physicochemical property adsorption anaerobic digestion data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the population growth and rapid urbanization lead to the production of a significant amount of sewage sludge generated at municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps peccia and westerhoff 2015 according to the statistics in 2018 the production of waste activated sludge was in the world s major economies was about 38 million tons in the us 44 million tons in the european union and 55 million tons in china zhang et al 2017 was has incredible potential for energy and nutrient recovery since it contains rich amounts of organic matter nutrients and trace constituents yang et al 2015 however was also contains a wide variety of emerging contaminants such as pathogens antibiotics antibiotic resistant genes and microplastics mps which have high risks to the water and soil environments raju et al 2018 studies of the properties and trends of these emerging pollutants in was treatment could help understand their environmental behaviors and synergistic effects mps generally defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm thompson et al 2004 were reported as an emerging contaminant with potential hazards to the ecological environment daily human activities continue to discharge both primary katsnelson 2015 and secondary arthur et al 2009 he et al 2019 lassen et al 2015 mps into sewage water wastewater treatment plants could effectively remove mps from the sewage through sedimentation floatation and membrane filtration which led to the enrichment of approximately 99 of the mps in wastewater into was mahon et al 2017 currently several studies comprehensively reported that the concentrations of sludge based mps ranged from 4 2 103 to 6 4 106 particles kg dw chand et al 2022 lassen et al 2015 ni et al 2020 meaning was may act as an important long term sink for mps and keep delivering them into the water and soil environments rochman 2018 the high density of crosslinks that gives plastics functional properties for example chemical and thermal resistance and tensile strength comes at the expense of degradability shieh et al 2020 which means mps are challenging to be removed by sludge treatment processes mahon et al 2017 several studies found that mps could serve as potential carriers to adsorb other pollutants such as antibiotics and heavy metals due to the large specific surface areas and strong hydrophobicity hüffer and hofmann 2016 rochman et al 2013 zou et al 2020 ding et al 2020 found that the specific surface areas and oxygen containing surface groups of mps were significantly increased by environmental factors like oxygen solar radiation and mechanical abrasion in the environment which was highly responsible for increasing the adsorption capacities of mps to antibiotics li et al 2019 reported that the adsorption capacity of sludge based mps for cd was one order of magnitude higher than pristine mps which was attributed to changed physicochemical properties of mps by mechanical abrasion e g grating and aeration tank biological degradation e g digestion and aeration tank chemical effects e g lime stabilization at wwtps the above research demonstrated that the intensive physical chemical and biological processes changed the physicochemical properties of mps which could enhance their adsorption potential for pollutants in addition several studies demonstrated that mps could significantly affect the performance of anaerobic digestion ad and the corresponding impact was considerably related to the content of mps feng et al 2021 wei et al 2019b 2019a reported polyvinyl chloride pvc particles and polyethylene pe particles caused adverse impact on the microbial communities through leaching the toxic bisphenol a and inducing reactive oxygen species ros and then inhibited the ad of was as a common practice for was stabilization ad converts high strength organic wastes into bioenergy and stable organic residues and low temperature hydrothermal treatment lower than 180 c is commonly used as pretreatment to enhance downstream biogas production by spilling intracellular matters and hydrolyzing extracellular polymeric substances in was chen et al 2019 fang et al 2019 thus the application of combined hydrothermal pretreatment htp and ad processes has recently raised growing concerns chen et al 2019 fang et al 2019 htp at 170 c 30 min was the most widely used condition for the pretreatment of was to enhance ad in practice ambye jensen et al 2013 qiao et al 2011 compared to the stress factors solar radiation temperature and humidity in the natural environment more severe condition was created in thermochemical process with higher temperature and humidity the hypothesis was that mps adsorption performances and effects on ad of was could be changed via the htp process which has not been studied until now in order to fill the above knowledge gap this study chose typical mps polyethylene microplastic polystyrene microplastic and polyvinyl chloride microplastic murphy et al 2016 in was to investigate 1 the physicochemical property changes of mps via htp by comparing the changes of morphology functional groups and leached toc 2 the effects of htp on the adsorption performances of heavy metal and antibiotic pollutants by mps 3 the effects of mps on methane production and microbial communities in ad process with htp of was 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates inoculum and typical mps the dewatered was was collected from a domestic wastewater treatment plant in shanghai china the total solids ts and volatile solids vs of the dewatered was were 21 3 and 14 7 respectively the inoculum for ad used in this study was collected from a continuous stirred tank reactor treating was the ts and vs of the inoculum were 4 5 and 3 4 respectively the polyethylene microplastic pe mp polystyrene microplastic ps mp and polyvinyl chloride microplastic pvc mp used in this study all in the form of particles were sponsored by tianqiang co ltd shanghai china the mean sizes of these mps were 500 50 μm 2 2 hydrothermal pretreatment htp at 170 c 30 min was the most widely used condition for the pretreatment of was to enhance ad in practice ambye jensen et al 2013 chen et al 2019 qiao et al 2011 thus the raw was with three different concentrations of mps 0 02 0 1 0 5 g kg 1 vs was treated by an htp reactor with a volume of 250 ml custom made htlab china at 170 c 30 min and then used as the substrate for batch ad to determine mps effects on methane production the pure mps pe mp ps mp pvc mp were treated in another autoclave reactor with a volume of 150 ml custom made htlab china to obtain treated mps and hydrothermal liquid htl in a typical run the reactor was sealed and heated to 170 c holding for 30 min when 5 g of pe mp with 95 ml of ultrapure water was added zhao et al 2018b the heating rate was 15 c min 1 and agitation was 600 rpm a metal mesh was used to filter hydrothermal mixtures to obtain hydrothermal treated mps and htl all of obtained samples were sealed in glass reagent bottles and stored in a 4 c refrigerator for further analysis 2 3 leached toc of mps leaching experiments were conducted at a fixed mps dose 0 5 g l 1 to compare the amount of toc released by pristine and treated mps typically 0 05 g mps and 100 ml ultrapure water were added into 150 ml conical bottles to achieve the 0 5 g l 1 of mps concentrations the conical bottles were incubated in the dark at 37 1 c all tests were conducted in triplicate throughout the incubation period of 50 days the toc concentrations of the leachate were measured every 5 10 days the organic components of the leachate were analyzed on the 50th day as well as the htl 2 4 adsorption experiments in this study cd and ofloxacin ofl which are widespread heavy metal and antibiotic pollutants in the natural environment and was were used as representative absorbates to explore the adsorption of mps to metal and antibiotic pollutants li et al 2019 oberoi et al 2019 respectively in order to design sorption isotherms of mps cdso4 aladdin chemistry co ltd was used to prepare 1 2 4 8 16 20 mg l 1 of cd solutions and ofl aladdin chemistry co ltd was prepared as 1 2 4 8 10 mg l 1 solutions the concentration ranges of the cd and ofl fell within the ranges of mps adsorption capacity observed in previous studies ding et al 2020 li et al 2019 firstly 10 ml of prepared solution and 0 1 g of mps was added into 20 ml brown glass bottles secondly the ph of each bottle was adjusted to about 7 5 with 2 m of naoh and hcl all the bottles were placed in a thermostatic oscillator 25 c 160 rpm for 48 h to achieve the adsorption equilibrium finally the mps were sieved out and the solutions were filtered into glass bottles using 0 45 μm membranes to measure the equilibrium concentrations qe mg l 1 of the absorbates each concentration of solution was performed in triplicate the eqs 1 and 2 which could describe langmuir and freundlich models were applied to fit adsorption isotherms of cd and ofl on mps respectively ding et al 2020 li et al 2019 1 q e q m b c e 1 b c e 2 q e k f c e n ce mg l 1 and

sets were added htp treated was with htl of mp hw htl pe ps and pvc and htp treated was with treated mp hw htmp pe ps and pvc in this study mps concentrations were 0 02 0 1 and 0 5 g mps kg 1 vs which was consistent with its actual concentration in sludge chand et al 2022 and fell within the ranges used in previous studies feng et al 2021 zhang and chen 2020 the htl with original concentration of 50g mp l 1 could be diluted in ad to reach the equivalent doses with mp particles firstly certain doses of mp particles 0 1 0 5 2 5 mg or mp htl 0 1 0 5 2 5 ml were spiked into the serum bottles then 30 ml of prepared was substrate 15 ml of the seed inoculum and 5 ml of anoxic medium were transferred into the bottles finally the ph was adjusted to 7 5 using 2 m of naoh and hcl all the serum bottles were flushed with nitrogen for 5 min to eliminate air and capped with butyl rubber stoppers triplicate bottles were used for each set and incubated in the dark at 37 c for the batch ad process

significant differences at a significance level of 0 05 all statistical tests were performed by spss statistics 20 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mps before and after htp 3 1 1 morphologies the mps structure changes surface morphologies functional groups and elements via htp were carefully delineated as shown in fig 1 a c all the pristine mps were observed to have relatively smooth surfaces the morphology of mps displayed much rougher surfaces and irregular cracks along with deformation textures after being treated via htp fig 1d e the morphology changes of different mp types were not exactly the same pe mp and ps mp were shrunken shapes with debris and crakes while pvc mp was inflation with many holes moreover a large number of debris size of 1 μm appeared on the surface of treated pe mp and ps mp which seemed to peel off at any time those debris could be attributed to the hydraulic shearing of htp mahon et al 2017 the relative crystallinity of pe mp ps mp and pvc mp decreased via htp fig s1 si and the specific surface area of pe mp and pvc mp increased table s1 si previous studies reported the activation energies for the pyrolysis of polymers pvc 119 297 kj mol pe 117 176 kj mol ps 103 116 kj mol alsewailem and almutabaqani 2013 wang et al 2019 indicating that the morphological destruction of mps via htp presented the following descending order ps mp pe mp pvc mp 3 1 2 functional groups micro ftir was performed to analyze surface functional groups of mps in the ftir spectra of pe mp ps mp and pvc mp fig s2 si the characteristic bands at 2922 1745 and 1407 cm 1 displayed strong intensities representing stretching vibration of methylene ch2 stretching vibration of carbonyl co and bending vibration of methylene attached to carbonyl ochch2 respectively the three types of htp treated mps displayed several similar infrared absorption bands with pristine ones indicating the polymer backbones of mps were not completely changed during htp at 170 c for 30 min compared with the single point measurement of ftir the imaging of ftir enabled the infrared imaging spectra of an indicated region on 500 500 μm mps surface which is more favorable for clarifying the various characteristics of surface functional groups liu et al 2019a the surface alteration properties of pe mp ps mp and pvc mp could be quantitatively described by the rocking vibration of consecutive methylene 719 cm 1 stretching vibration of the benzene ring 1601 1548 1495 1455 cm 1 and stretching vibration of chlorine 696 cm 1 respectively fig 2 a c the decreased intensity of consecutive methylene benzene ring and chlorine suggested that these poor thermal stability groups on the surface of mps might be initially replaced by oh radical min et al 2020 and the de hydroxylation of the htp process subsequently generated ketone or carboxyl groups 1745 cm 1 zhang et al 2021c the carbonyl index ci was an essential parameter to quantitatively describe the aging degree of mps which was calculated by the intensity of carbonyl relative to the methylene peak 1712 2922 brandon et al 2016 the heat map clearly showed the distribution of carbonyl groups on the mps surfaces fig 2d the ci of the three types of pristine mps increased obviously after htp and the increment was pvc mp ps mp pe mp which means the chlorine on the carbon chain was the easiest to be replaced followed by benzene ring and hydrogen methylene in addition infrared imaging results showed that the aging of mps during the htp process was uneven which might be because the chain reactions of polymer depolymerization were more likely to occur at the site of structural damage zhang et al 2021a the o c ratio was an alternative parameter to the ci to characterize the aging degree of mps liu et al 2019b the results of xps showed that the o c ratio of the three types of mps increased via htp table s2 si which further confirmed the increase in oxygen containing groups ding et al 2020 in the high resolution xps spectra of c1s and o1s fig s3 si the c c h 284 8 ev for bonds pe mp and ps mp or the ccl 285 0 ev bonds for pvc mp were initially changed to co 288 4 ev and then partly converted to co 290 6 ev could be clearly detected which agreed with the results of ftir imaging analysis 3 1 3 leached toc as previously reported mps could release potentially toxic substances including monomers plasticizers and antioxidants into the environment along with its aging and degradation in the long term zhu et al 2020 mps concentration will not be the limiting factor of toc release since the leaching of organic matters from mps is very slow the amounts of toc leached from pristine pe mp ps mp and pvc mp were 0 649 0 071 0 328 0 054 and 2 813 0 209 mg g 1 respectively which was higher than that from treated mps 0 481 0 01 0 275 0 044 1 612 0 207 mg g 1 on the 50th day fig 3 a however high concentrations of toc were detected in htl fig 3b which were 9 12 0 49 5 65 0 76 and 15 69 0 89 mg g 1 for pe mp ps mp and pvc mp respectively indicating that the leached toc of mps could be significantly p 0 05 accelerated by the htp gc ms was further used to analyze the organic components of leached toc qualitatively the relative abundances of the detected organics are presented in fig 3c methylenebisbutylcresol is a widely used antioxidant with excellent dispersibility in water solution zhang et al 2021b which had a high proportion in leachate and htl of pristine mps but a low proportion in treated mp similarly some plasticizers bisphenol a and dibutyl phthalate were detected in the leachate and htl of pristine mps but not in the leachate of treated pvc mp only a few kinds of organic matters in htl were intermediate substances valeric acid and 2 methylcyclopent while most were additives bisphenol a dibutyl phthalate diisobutyl phthalate dimethyl phthalate and methylenebisbutylcresol zhao et al 2018a the above results proved that htp could cause the additives in mps to be quickly released into htl and the treated mps almost no longer leached additives during the experiment however considering that plastics are carbon based chain structures the release of toc occurs throughout mps lifecycle long term leaching experiments of mps in the aqueous phase require further investigation 3 2 adsorption capacity of mps before and after htp previous studies reported that the interactions between mps and pollutants e g intermolecular force hydrogen bond hydrophobic force aromatic ring stacking and halogen bond are related to their functional groups and the adsorption sites are related to the specific surface and crystallinity of mps xu et al 2019 therefore the adsorption performances of pristine and treated mps were investigated and correlated to physicochemical feature changes 3 2 1 metal as shown in fig 4 a c the qe of pristine pe mp ps mp and pvc mp mps for cd was 0 58 0 04 0 68 0 19 and 0 48 0 11 mg g 1 respectively according to the fitting results tables s3 si the adsorption isotherms of cd on pristine and treated mps fitted the freundlich model well suggesting it was multilayer adsorption wang et al 2018 several previous studies demonstrated that the adsorption of mps to cd was dominated by electrostatic interaction and surface complexation li et al 2019 tourinho et al 2019 which means the increasing polarity and decreasing relative crystallinity were conducive to the adsorption of cd ions the results showed that htp significantly p 0 05 increased the adsorption capacities of pe mp and ps mp to cd by 28 2 9 9 and 16 7 7 1 respectively the ch2 groups of pe mp or cc groups of ps mp were converted to co groups fig 2d which provided more hydrogen bonds as adsorption sites zou et al 2020 meanwhile the relative crystallinity of three types of mps was reduced via htp table s1 si which formed free volume between the polymer for mobility and diffusivity of metal ions teuten et al 2009 however the adsorption capacity of pvc mp was significantly weakened p 0 05 by htp zou et al 2020 reported that the cl groups could enhance the polarity and negativity of pvc and promote its surface affinity with metal ions the c cl ratio of pvc mp was decreased from 0 138 to 0 035 via htp table s2 si which led to a decrease in adsorption performance to cd li et al 2019 reported that sludge based mps had an adsorption capacity of 2 5 mg g 1 to heavy metals and thought that types of mps had a significant effect on the adsorption of metal pollutants in this study htp decreased the adsorption capacity of pvc mp to cd but increased pe mp and ps mp by changing their physicochemical properties suggesting that treated mps might exert a substantial effect on the transport of metal pollutants during the sludge treatment process 3 2 2 antibiotic the adsorption isotherm of ofl could be better fitted with langmuir model than the freundlich model fig 4d f tables s3 si indicating it was mainly monolayer saturated adsorption razanajatovo et al 2018 several studies demonstrated that the adsorption of mps to organic pollutants is mainly dominated by hydrophobic interaction and the non linear adsorption isotherms also indicated the effect of micropore filling and van der waals force hüffer and hofmann 2016 liu et al 2019a velzeboer et al 2014 the maximum adsorption capacity qm of ofl on ps mp was 15 769 1 402 mg g 1 while the qm of ofl on pe mp and pvc mp was 8 641 0 774 and 4 88 0 867 mg g 1 respectively in this study the relative crystallinity of ps mp was the lowest which might lead to the maximum free volume between the polymer chains teuten et al 2009 thus the structure of ps mp allowed higher pollutant mobility and diffusivity rate than pe mp and pvc mp resulting in the highest adsorption capacity to ofl pascall et al 2004 in addition the presence of benzene rings on ps mp increased its aromaticity which produced strong sorption by π π interactions to molecules with the aromatic surface velzeboer et al 2014 previous studies found that the adsorption affinity of ps to pcbs and pahs was higher than other non aromatic polymers pe pp and pvc which was consistent with the above mentioned π π interactions of aromaticity rochman et al 2013 ding et al 2020 found that air aged ps mp got higher adsorption capacity for 6 types of organic pollutants which was thought to be attributed to the increased specific area and oxygen containing functional groups however in this study the adsorption capacities of three types of treated mps to ofl were decreased by 22 93 0 66 19 93 1 33 and 30 01 10 56 p 0 05 respectively as mentioned above the hydrophobic interaction governed the adsorption capacity of mps to organic pollutants the ofl is a polar molecule containing hydrophobic functional groups f and htp considerably reduced the hydrophobicity of the mps which could lead to the decreased adsorption capacity to ofl moreover the aromaticity of ps mp and chlorine of pvc mp were reduced by carbonylation carbonyl groups replaced benzene rings or chlorines during htp which could also lead to the decrease of their aromatic ring stacking and halogen bond to ofl respectively the changed hydrophilicity and functional groups of mps via htp decreased their adsorption properties for ofl and probably also other polar organic pollutants including polychlorinated biphenyls polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane zou et al 2020 the above results suggested that htp of was may decrease adsorption capacity of mps to some pollutants e g pcv mp to cd and pvc mp to ofl by altering mps physicochemical properties which could be worthy for blocking the synergistic occurrence and transportation of them the adsorption performances and mechanisms of different types of mps to different pollutants deserves further study 3 3 effects mps before and after htp on ad 3 3 1 methane production batch experiments were performed to investigate the impact of mps on methane production of was as shown in fig 5 the batch ad was considered complete when cumulative methane production of each set reached a stationary level on the 50th day the methane production of hw fig 5d f was significantly 28 1 2 2 p 0 05 higher than that of rw fig 5a c which proved the promoting effect of htp for the batch ad using raw was and pristine mps as substrates only pristine pvc mp at the highest concentration 0 5 g kg 1 vs significantly p 0 05 reduced methane production by 16 2 3 3 fig 5f the fig 5d f showed that a low concentration i e 0 02 g kg 1 vs of mps did not significantly p 0 05 affect methane production compared to the htp treated was without mps however the hw pe and hw pvc with higher concentrations i e 0 1 and 0 5 g kg 1 vs significantly p 0 05 inhibited the methane production reaching up to 12 6 3 7 and 52 3 7 1 of the hw it could be supposed that htp enhanced the inhibitory effect of pe mp and pvc mp on methane production which might be attributed to the promotion of leached toc the effects of treated mps and htl of mps on ad were further investigated respectively as shown in fig 5 g i an outstanding inhibition of methane production happened when 0 5 ml of htl equivalent to 0 1 g kg 1 vs of mps was added into the ad digesters the htl of pvc mp showed the most significant p 0 05 inhibition by decreasing methane production from 3 9 0 7 to 50 4 0 8 of the control with the equivalent concentrations of pvc mp increased from 0 02 to 0 5 g kg 1 vs fig 5l however the three types of treated mps did not decrease methane production the above results indicated that the htp of pe mp and ps mp with a concentration higher than 0 1 g kg 1 vs had a significant p 0 05 inhibitory effect on methane production of ad this inhibition was caused by htl rather than treated mps which further indicated that the leached toc was the main factor causing the decrease in methane production in this study the toc concentrations of htl were present in the following descending order pvc mp pe mp ps mp the htl of mp contained a wider variety of phthalic acid esters dibutyl phthalate diisobutyl phthalate and dimethyl phthalate which were reported to have acute toxicity on microorganisms staples et al 1997 bisphenol a had a high proportion in htl of pvc mp that could inhibit the undomesticated anaerobes at the early stage of ad wei et al 2019b thus the results implied that the inhibitory effect of mps on ad depended on concentrations types and additives however considering the promoting effect of htp chen et al 2017 fang et al 2019 even if the inhibition effect of sludge based mps might be enhanced after htp the overall methane production of htp treated was would still be higher than untreated 3 3 2 microbiological analyses as mentioned in 3 3 1 the htp treated mps 0 5 g kg 1 vs had a greater impact on methane production of was therefore the microbial communities in ad of htp treated was with and without mps were analyzed to explore the effect of mps on microorganisms the alpha diversity showed that the pd whole tree index shannon index and chao index were not obviously changed by mps table s4 si which means the microbial diversity of ad was not affected by mps phylum level distributions of microbial populations of these sets were presented in fig 6 a in this study the most abundant bacterial populations of batch ad were firmicutes synergistota acidobacteriota and bacteroidota accounting for 72 3 to 83 2 of the total bacterial community in each set compared with the control the abundance of firmicutes decreased by 5 8 to 24 6 in all the experimental set and the abundance of acidobacteriota and bacteroidota variated obviously these three phyla were reported to possess abilities to convert organic compounds e g proteins and carbohydrates into volatile fatty acids under anaerobic conditions ariesyady et al 2007 which means their abundance variation could be aligned with the lower methane production under the presence of mps in this study further exploration at the genus level showed that the microbial communities in each set were composed of various anaerobes relevant to hydrolysis e g aminicenantales alkaliphilus mesotoga and fitmicutes acidogenesis e g proteiniborus garcielles and acetoanaerobium and methanogenesis e g methanosaeta fig 6b chen et al 2019 luo et al 2016 the abundance of acetoanerrobium and mesotoga the main acid producing bacteria reported previously luo et al 2016 clearly decreased in hm pe the pe mp could release a high proportion of dibutyl phthalate and diisobutyl phthalate via htp which was reported to decrease the abundances of various vital anaerobes similarly the htl of pvc mp contained high proportions of dibutyl phthalate and bisphenol a which led to the lowest abundances of methanogens methanosaeta and proteolytic bacteria proteiniborus wei et al 2019b thus the set of hw pvc showed the highest degree of ad inhibition on methane production reaching 52 3 7 1 production fig 5 although the htl of ps mp also changed the microbial community methane production of hw ps did not significantly decrease fig 5e the reason could be that the ps mp released less concentration of toc and was mainly methylenebisbutylcresol which was reported to be a low toxicity antioxidant zhang et al 2021a therefore the effect of different types of mps on the anaerobic microflora was different which was strongly associated with the components of leached toc in the follow up research it is worth studying the final trend of residual mps and released additives in biogas residue deposal it should also be noted that a large number of daughter mps smaller than 1 μm were generated on the surface of htp treated mps since these nano plastics were partially oxidized or hydrated with a high specific surface area their absorption potentials for pollutants colonization for microorganisms and adverse effects on creatures would be facilitated dang et al 2022 thus the occurrence and toxicology of nano plastics are also worthy of development in the future 4 conclusions the present study showed that the htp at 170 c and 30 min increased mps specific surface area ci value and leached toc while decreasing their relative crystallinity which caused changes in their environmental behaviors the htl of mps contained a variety of plastic additives such as bisphenol a dibutyl phthalate diisobutyl phthalate dimethyl phthalate and methylenebisbutylcresol as the carbonylation of htp changed the surface functional groups the adsorption capacity of treated pe mp and ps mp to cd was significantly p 0 05 increased while that of pvc was significantly p 0 05 weakened meanwhile the potential adsorption capacity of all treated mps to ofl significantly p 0 05 decreased under severe conditions high temperature pressure humidity and mechanical stress of the htp process which was related to the adsorption mechanism monolayer adsorption dominated by hydrophobic interaction ad experiments showed that the pristine mps did not significantly inhibit the methane production of raw was except pristine pvc mp at the highest concentration 0 5 g kg 1 vs however the htp treated was with a high concentration i e 0 1 and 0 5 g kg 1 vs of pe mp and pvc mp significantly p 0 05 inhibited the methane production reaching up to 12 6 3 7 and 52 3 7 1 of the control the inhibition of high concentration mps i e 0 5 g kg 1 vs on ad was mainly caused by the large amount of leached toc which contained a variety of toxic additives the htp could accelerate the release of plastic additives into htl thus increasing the inhibitory effect of mps on ad the abundance of vital anaerobes such as acid producing bacteria acetoanerrobium and mesotoga proteolytic bacteria proteiniborus and methanogens methanosaeta were clearly decreased after the htp of pe mp and pvc mp which was attributed to high proportions of bisphenol a and phthalates plasticizers therefore the inhibitory effects of mps on ad and anaerobic microflora were strongly associated with the concentrations types and additives

15729,hypersaline endorheic aquatic systems h seas are lakes shallow playas in arid and semiarid regions that undergo extreme oscillations in salinity and severe drought episodes although their geochemical uniqueness and microbiome have been deeply studied very little is known about the availability and quality of dissolved organic matter dom in the water column a h seas from the monegros desert zaragoza ne spain was studied during a hydrological wetting drying rewetting cycle dom analysis included i a dissolved organic carbon doc mass balance ii spectroscopy absorbance and fluorescence and iii a molecular characterization with fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms the studied system stored a large amount of doc and under the highest salinity conditions salt saturated waters i e brines with salinity 30 accumulated a disproportionate quantity of doc indicating a significant in situ net dom production simultaneously during the hydrological transition from wet to dry the dom pool showed strong alterations of it molecular composition spectroscopic methods indicated that aromatic and degraded dom was rapidly replaced by fresher relatively small microbial derived moieties with a large c n ratio ft icr ms highlighted the accumulation of small saturated and oxidized molecules molecular o c 0 5 with a remarkable increase in the relative contribution of highly oxygenated molecular o c 0 9 compounds and a decrease of aliphatic and carboxyl rich alicyclic moleculesthese results indicated that h seas are extremely active in accumulating and processing dom with the notable release of organic solutes probably originated from decaying microplankton under large osmotic stress at extremely high salinities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter hypersaline waters endorheic spectroscopy ft icr ms 1 introduction hypersaline endorheic aquatic systems h seas are harsh and vulnerable ecosystems widely distributed in arid and semiarid regions worldwide wang et al 2018 that undergo large oscillations in salinity with maxima at the salt saturation level some recent geo statistical estimates suggest that inland saline and hypersaline waters might account for 47 of global lakes volumes and small saline waters bodies might represent up to the 3 of global lakes volumes messager et al 2016 h seas attracted researches for hosting diverse and dynamic halophilic consortiums of archaea bacteria plankton fungi protists and invertebrates lee et al 2018 menéndez serra et al 2021 belilla et al 2021 by contrast information about dissolved organic matter dom in these ecosystems is still scarce and unconnected mariot et al 2007 butturini et al 2020 boros et al 2020 jiang et al 2022 despite it being an indispensable source of carbon and energy for the abundant heterotrophic bacteria occurring in these habitats lee et al 2018 and probably an important component for explaining anomalous methane production measured in a productive saline soda lake fazi et al 2021 consequently determining the dynamic of the dom in these ecosystems is a fundamental step in understanding how microbiota proliferate in these harsh habitats and the relevance of the carbon cycle in these ecosystems the abundance and quality of dom in aquatic ecosystems are the result of an intricate balance between terrestrial allochthonous inputs da silva et al 2021 autochthonous biotic releases morling et al 2017a heterotrophic consumption morling et al 2017b and photodegradation gonsior et al 2013 herzsprung et al 2020 research on dom in endorheic saline waters typically focus on the variability in the quality of dom across water bodies at the regional scale wen et al 2018 song et al 2019 xu et al 2020 jiang et al 2022 or among water layers in stratified lakes butturini et al 2020 however knowledge about temporal changes of dom quality is still scarce jiang et al 2022 shallow h seas are extremely dynamic in terms of hydrology and water salinity which dramatically increases when the surface water evaporates therefore only temporal monitoring can capture the dynamics and magnitude of these changes and determine their relevance in shaping the quantity and qualitative properties of dom in these systems the fate of dom during a hydrological transition from wet to dry conditions in h seas can reflect the superposition of complex processes on the one hand during drying water evaporation should cause a sharp rise in the dom concentration in the water column on the other hand the increase in salinity during dry conditions is expected to reduce the solubility of some organic solutes the salting out phenomenon xie et al 1997 especially proteinaceous li et al 2012 and amphiphilic compounds lechtenfeld et al 2013 accordingly the concentrations of some dom moieties might decrease under high salinities simultaneously the lack of interception of solar radiation by terrestrial vegetation should facilitate the photodegradation of aromatic fractions del vecchio and blough 2006 finally the increase in temperature associated with drying might promote the growth of benthic and pelagic microbiota consequently increasing the release uptake of organic solutes all together these in situ processes are expected to have a discernible influence on dom properties and its potential bioavailability for heterotrophic microbiota or its photoreactivity for instance increased osmotic pressure in salt saturated waters i e brines with salinities 30 might lead to the release of osmoregulatory compounds by the microbiota or cell lysis resulting in the exudation and hydrolysis of organic moieties from stressed halotolerant organisms altendorf et al 2009 therefore an accumulation of fresh and saturated autochthonous compounds might be expected at high salinities furthermore if the solubility of proteinaceous moieties decreases at high salinities the c n ratio is expected to increase however the opposite is expected if the dom is absorbed onto the salt precipitates as a consequence of salt oversaturation li et al 2012 finally the ecological context of the surrounding area also matters shallow h seas are typically located in flat and arid zones with very little littoral and terrestrial vegetation and no canopy conesa mor et al 2011 therefore allochthonous inputs are expected to be small and sporadic but might be relevant at certain times especially during storm episodes in this context the three main objectives of this study were to 1 determine the mass balance of dissolved organic carbon doc in the water column during the transition from wet to dry conditions in an extremely dynamic h seas to discern the impact of evaporation on in situ doc consumption release 2 detail the synchrony asynchrony of the doc concentration based on its qualitative e g spectroscopic properties during the wet to dry transition 3 explore if and how the molecular chemo diversity of the dom changes as dryness and salinity increase to address these objectives water samples were collected from a shallow h seas in the monegros desert ne spain for almost one year during a hydrological wetting drying rewetting transition furthermore dom from interstitial waters collected during the summer was analyzed as well as that from a sample of salt crust that precipitated in the summer salts are a highly reflective material surface albedo over 40 according to craft and horel 2019 consequently the impact of photodegradation on dom accumulation within the salt crust and interstitial waters is expected to be small the qualitative characterization of dom was performed with optical spectroscopy absorbance and fluorescence stoichiometry the molar c n ratio and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms 2 material methods 2 1 study site this study focused on la salineta a hypersaline shallow playa lake 41 28 53 n 0 9 32 o

the salt crust 3 5 cm thick due to the proximity of a permanent water table in the summer the salt crust covers approximately 60 of the total lake bed and is mainly composed of halite 84 2 and

from the authors 2 2 field sampling la salineta was sampled from january to december 2020 sampling started january 28th under extremely wet conditions due to the occurrence of storm gloria a few days earlier water samples were collected from the surface on seven dates 28 01 21 05 15 06 30 06 20 07 09 10 and 29 12 and interstitial waters on four dates 30 06 20 07 09 10 and 29 12 surface waters with salinity higher than 30 were defined as brines in addition dom was analyzed from a sample of salt crust that had precipitated on the playa lake bed in the summer on each sampling date 0 5 l of surface water were filtered in the field with precombusted gf f glass fiber filters whatman an aliquot 250 ml was acidified to ph 2 with an hcl solution all samples acidified or not were stored at 4 c prior to analysis waters with salinities higher than 20 were diluted to 10 to avoid salt precipitation interstitial waters were collected at a depth of 20 cm from sediments using four tensiometers equipped with a ceramic suction cup irrometer model ssat tensiometers were inserted into the sediments for 3 4 h before water collection a few milliliters of water were typically collected with each tensiometer therefore all the samples were merged into one larger sample of 80 120 ml the sample was then filtered in the field with precombusted gf f glass fiber filters and acidfied to ph 2 a plate of salt crust measuring approximately 0 05 m2 and 3 cm thick was collected in the summer and transported to the laboratory under dark conditions at 4 c in the laboratory the salt crust was dissolved in 2 l of ultrapure water and filtered with precombusted gf f glass fiber filters the resulting solution was acidified to ph 2 and stored at 4 c prior to analysis the salinity of the surface and interstitial waters was measured in situ with a refractometer hrs 8 t kruss germany 2 3 environmental descriptors the temperatures of surface waters and in interstitial saturated sediments were monitored continuously with hobo pendant mx water temperature data loggers sensors were installed in january at the lake edge and inserted into sediments at a depth of 10 cm the sensor submerged in the water column leaned on the lake bed and remained out of the water from june 15th 2020 to november 5th 2020 as a consequence of the surface water contraction this interval could be identified by the hobo temperature sensor recording anomalous large daily temperature oscillations revealing that the sensor was out of the water and measuring the temperature of the air in contact with the salt crust fig 2 c pluviometry and daily air temperature data were obtained from a meteorological station located at the zaragoza airport 65 km away from the sampling site and managed by the agencia española de metereología aemet www aemet es variations in the surface water of la salineta were monitored during the study period using sentinel playground which provides satellite images that are refreshed every 7 10 days 2 4 biogeochemical analysis dissolved organic carbon doc content and total dissolved nitrogen tdn levels in water samples were measured with the multi n c 3100 analyzer analytik jena detection limit is 0 1 mg l 1 all samples were diluted 1 5 1 20 to minimize the impact of the salts on instrument performance dissolved organic nitrogen don content was analyzed by subtracting the amount of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din from that of tdn din content was determined with colorimetric methods nitrate nitrite was estimated with a bran luebbe autoanalyzer equipped with a reductive copper cadmium column detection limit 50 mg l 1 ammonium levels were estimated with the salicylate method of reardon 1969 detection limit 25 mg l 1 to minimize interference from the salts and sulfite all samples were diluted 1 5 1 10 with ultrapure milli q water to measure the impact of storm gloria on the input of new water into la salineta dd and d18o of the water samples were

fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms 2 4 1 spectroscopy and the c n ratio due to the extremely high doc values in brines during the summer and the large differences in doc concentrations among samples see the results section all acidified samples were diluted to a final doc concentration of 5 10 mg l and to a final salinity ranging from 0 5 to 1 5 to mitigate the interference from the inner filter effect during the spectroscopy measurements samples were maintained at room temperature and filtered with 0 2 mm nylon filters prior to analysis the uv1700 pharmaspec spectrophotometer shimadzu japan was used to obtain absorbance spectra data were obtained in the double beam mode with the wavelength scanned from 200 to 600 nm the slit width was set to 1 nm deionized water with 1 salinity was used as the blank absorbance spectra were used to estimate the specific aromaticity at 254 nm suva254 and the spectral slope between 275 and 295 nm s275 295 suva254 was estimated according to the method of weishaar et al 2003 s275 295 was estimated by fitting the log transformed absorption spectra obtained between 275 and 295 nm s275 295 values typically increase upon irradiation and inversely correlate with the molecular weight of the dom helms et al 2008 fluorescence spectra were obtained with an rf 5301 pc spectrofluorometer shimadzu japan equipped with a xenon lamp and a light source compensation system s r mode for each sample a three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem was obtained each eem consisted of 21 synchronous scans with 1 nm increments both in emission and in excitation the excitation wavelength ranged from 250 to 410 nm with intervals of 10 nm the emission wavelength ranged from 310 to 530 nm with intervals of 10 nm the bandwidth used for both excitation and emission was 5 nm a 1 cm quartz cell was used to perform the measurements each eem was corrected and normalized following the steps described by goletz et al 2011 the excitation correction function was determined using rhodamine b as a quantum counter lakowicz 2006 whereas the emission correction was obtained by comparing the reference spectra of quinine sulfate and tryptophan provided by the national institute of standards and technology nist gardecki and maroncelli 1998 data were normalized by the area under the raman peak obtained for an ultrapure mq water sample at λex350 nm λem371 428 nm lawaetz and stedmon 2009 the inner filter effect was corrected by comparing absorbance measurements larsson et al 2007 lakowicz 2006 eem spectra were used to estimate three dom qualitative proxies the fluorescence index fi the biological index bix and the humification index hix the fi positively correlates with the accumulation of microbial derived dom relative to terrestrial inputs mcknight et al 2001 it is the ratio of the fluorescence intensity emitted at 470 nm to that at 520 nm at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm bix values positively correlate with the accumulation of recent autochthonous dom it is the ratio of the fluorescence intensity emitted at 380 nm to that at 430 nm at an excitation wavelength of 310 nm huguet et al 2009 the hix is a proxy for the amount of humic substances higher values indicate a higher humification degree ohno 2002 it is calculated by dividing the area of the emission spectra between 435 and 480 nm by the sum of the areas of the emission spectra between 435 and 480 nm and between 300 and 345 nm at an excitation wavelength of 254 nm the molar c n ratio of the dom was calculated after estimating the molar concentrations of doc and don 2 4 2 spe extraction and ft icr ms the solid phase extraction spe of dom spe dom was performed in all the samples the spe dom recovery efficiency averaged 36 5 appendix si3 however the recovery rate of the sup200720 sample 18 5 remained outside the interquartile range therefore the results from this sample were removed from the data analysis appendix si4 filtered acidified samples were concentrated through 100 mg styrene divinylbenzene polymer type ppl solid phase cartridges agilent technologies santa clara ca united states according to the protocol described by dittmar et al 2008 spe dom extracts were diluted 1 1 v v with ultrapure water and analyzed with an ft icr ms equipped with a dynamically harmonized analyzer cell solarix xr bruker

c1 60h1 120o1 40n0 4s0 1 with an error range of 0 5 ppm according to lechtenfeld et al 2015 relative peak intensities were calculated based on the summed intensities of all the assigned peaks in each sample the molecular formula of a mass peak is referred to as molecule in this article although one molecular formula can represent several or even millions of different structural isomers only formulas with 10 dbe o 10 dbe double bound equivalents were considered for further data evaluation herzsprung et al 2014 after molecular formula assignement the following molecular descriptors were calculated the number of detected molecules richness and intensity weighted averages of molecular mass the h c o c and c n ratios double bound equivalent dbe modified aromaticity index aimod koch and

of saturation of a molecule i e the number of c c double bounds whereas the o c ratio and nosc are descriptors of the average carbon oxidation state according to the values of the different dom indicators the dom molecular classes were split into carboxyl rich alicyclic like molecules cram aliphatic like substances aromatic like compounds condensed and aromatic like substances ca and highly oxygenated molecules criteria adopted to constrain the molecular classes are detailed in appendix si5 each formula can describe numerous isomers therefore this classification suggests the most likely structure rossel et al 2017 2 5 data analysis and statistics a doc mass balance was determined to discern the impact of evaporation from in situ processes on doc concentration potassium concentrations

e t describes the expected values of doc concentration at each sampling time t doc m 0 is the measured value of doc at time 0 and k t and k 0 are the measured concentrations of potassium at each sampling time t and at time 0 respectively time 0 corresponds to the sampling performed right after storm gloria when la salineta was under extreme wet conditions comparison between the measured and expected values of doc was used to determine the following net balance 2 if d o c e t d o c m t i n d i c a t e s a n e t i n s i t u d e p l e t i o n o f d o c d o c m t i n d i c a t e s t h a t e

qualitative proxies was explored by visualizing the relationships of the dom proxies with the doc plots the shape hysteresis and rotational pattern of these plots provide a rapid indication of the strength and non linearity of the coupling butturini et al 2008 correlations between variables were assumed to be statistically significant at p 0 05 paired t test was used to evaluate differences in the dom optical descriptors between brines and interstitial waters both collected exclusively in the summer differences were assumed to be statistically significant at p 0 05 differences in the ft icr ms elemental formula among the samples were tested with a hierarchical cluster analysis hca the analysis included the 2914 molecules detected in all the samples after ranking the spe dom mass peak intensities for each of the eleven samples separately squared euclidean distances with ward s linkage were applied murtagh and legendre 2014 by assigning first rank to the variable with the highest intensity visualization of the qualitative differences of spe dom involved the use of van krevelen diagrams from an inter sample ranking analysis herzsprung et al 2017 for each spe dom molecular class and descriptor the weighted average was estimated from the relative intensity of the peak of each assigned molecule rank correlation analysis was performed with components that were present in 10 of the 11 samples 6 surface water samples 4 interstitial water samples 1 salt crust leachate the ranks of mass peak intensities were calculated for each of the 10 samples the inter sample ranks were calculated from the intensity ranks as explained by herzsprung et al 2017 the inter sample ranks were correlated with the doc concentration ranks for each of the 2914 formulas using spearman s rank correlation as described earlier herzsprung et al 2012 the rank correlation coefficients and corresponding p values are listed in the appendix excel file allmolecule rankanalysis supwater spearmanresults xls 3 results 3 1 climatic hydrological and geochemical context storm gloria caused the total flooding of the la salineta shallow lake after that the wetted area of the lake gradually contracted at a rate of approximately 945 m2 d 1 with transient rises in april may 2020 after a few rain episodes fig 2a b evaporation accelerated in late june and a shallow 3 cm in depth brine layer was constrained to the more depressed part of the shallow lake approximately 5000 m2 in short 97 of the flooded playa had disappeared in 5 months brines persisted throughout the summer and up to the middle of november when an autumnal rain episode reflooded 50 of the depression fig 2b in the summer the temperature of the air in contact with the salt crust showed daily oscillations within the range of 35 c with 20 c and 55 c being the lowest and highest values respectively in the shallow sediments the daily temperature oscillations were of 20 c with the highest temperatures rarely exceeding 45 c fig 2c right after storm gloria the d18o and dd values measured in the waters from la salineta were identical to the long term weighted δ18o and dd values recorded for the precipitation in zaragoza araguas araguas and teijeiro 2005 indicating that the playa was totally flooded by new rain water evaporation strongly intensified the fractionation of the two isotopes consequently the d18o and dd values showed a strong deviation from meteoric water lines autumnal rewetting affected the input of new water however the d18o and dd values showed little deviation from meteoric water lines revealing that the new water from the rain had mixed with the residual old water from the brines and that the rain episodes were far from being comparable to storm gloria appendix si6 salinity and the main metals appendix si7 and water temperature were significantly correlated r 0 89 g f 5 p 0 05 the increase in water temperature late spring early summer preceded that of salinity and dissolved salt concentrations after storm gloria under wet conditions salinity in la salineta 5 1 was a little higher than that of marine waters after that salinity increased progressively up to 34 45 in june october in december after the autumnal rewetting salinity returned to 9 interstitial waters were sampled during the driest period only the salinity of interstitial waters 32 2 5 was slightly lower than that of brines 39 5 but this difference was not statistically significant tpaired 2 27 p 0 05 3 2 doc dynamics and mass balance doc concentration in the water column ranged from 28 to 1174 mg l correlating significantly with salinity r 0 86 d f 5 p 0 01 but not with temperature r 0 65 d f 5 n s although the doc peak concentration coincided with that of temperature and salinity its pulse began with a time delay with respect to the environmental variables fig 3 the doc level in interstitial waters 225 113 mg l was significantly lower than that in surface waters collected during the same period 842 340 mg l tpaired 4 56 p 0 05 fig 2d the doc mass balance obtained from the potassium concentrations revealed that doc behaved nearly conservatively during wet conditions i e may and december however in june and more remarkably in july october a net release of doc was estimated during the driest conditions july october the measured doc content was almost double the expected concentration fig 3 3 3 dom optical qualitative descriptors as a whole spectroscopic analysis revealed that the dom from la salineta showed remarkably low aromaticity low suva254 values a low humification degree low hix values and an accumulation of small sized moieties large s250 275 values and fresh organics of an autochthonous origin large bix values when the values were compared to those of typical freshwater ecosystems appendix si8 eems showed classic bimodal features with the largest peaks corresponding to humic and fulvic like fluorophores fig 4 chen et al 2003 however the fulvic peak was strongly attenuated for the dom obtained from the salt crust fig 4e comparing the shape of the eem of the sample collected under wet conditions january with that of the brine july a depletion in the fluorophore signal typically assigned to protein like substances b t peaks and an increase in fluorescence in the region of the spectrum close to that corresponding to marine humic like fluorophores m peak were observed for the brine sample fig 4c on the other hand the eem of the salt crust leachate showed the strongest signal for the tryptophan like fluorophore peak t fig 4e the optical descriptors of dom i e suva254 e2 e3 bix hix and fi were not significantly different between the interstitial waters and brines paired t test all t values 2 1 p 0 05 however dom from interstitial waters tended to be slightly more humified aromatic larger in relative size and degraded compared to that of surface water table 1 dom from the salt crust sample was richer in aromatic larger suva254 values and microbial like moieties larger fi compared to that from brines table 1 regarding the surface waters almost all the dom descriptors showed remarkable fluctuations during the study period however only s275 295 significantly positively correlated with an environmental parameter i e with salinity p 0 05 when the changes in the quality proxies for dom were compared to those of the doc content three main responses were observed a the most important one included three dom parameters s275 295 fi and the c n ratio whose highest values preceded that of the doc concentration peaks therefore their relationships with doc concentration were non linear and with a clockwise hysteresis pattern fig 5 a revealing that these parameters increased faster than the doc content fig 4a b the bix parameter fig 5b showed an abrupt increase in may remained almost steady during the driest period and showed a final increase coinciding with the autumnal rewetting hence the bix doc relationship showed a counter clock loop fig 4b c suva254 and the hix abruptly decreased in may but remained almost steady thereafter for the rest of the study period fig 5c 3 4 ft icr ms of spe dom a total of 9415 distinct molecular formulas mfs was detected by ft icr ms the number of mfs in each sample ranged from 4028 to 5830 the six samples from surface waters brines included shared 3449 mfs weighted average masses of all the samples ranged from 354 to 370 m z with larger values observed for the surface waters the hca grouped the samples into two main clusters one cluster comprised the interstitial waters and brines while the other included the three surface water samples with lower salinity and interestingly the salt crust leachate fig 6 for a visualization of the van krevelen diagrams see appendix si9 overall the most abundant group in spe dom was cram like substances 46 52 of the relative peak intensity followed by the aliphatic like group between 5 8 and 19 5 and aromatic like group 1 5 3 4 by contrast ca represented less than 0 5 spe dom from the salt crust sample stood out for having the lowest percentage of cram like molecules and the highest percentage of aliphatic like groups spe dom from surface and interstitial waters showed similar compositions however interstitial waters tended to have a more aromatic and unsaturated molecules higher aimod and dbe and fewer aliphatic substances the c n ratio ranged between 29 and 50 being the lowest for the salt crust spe dom table 2 more details at appendix si10 suggesting a selective accumulation of nitrogen bearing molecules in the salt crust in the surface waters the relative contribution of the compositional groups changed during the study period fig 7 after storm gloria spe dom was rich in cram like molecules with a moderate high level of aromaticity and unsaturation high aimod and dbe respectively and a low carbon oxidation state i e low nosc in may under moderate salinity and doc concentration the nosc remained almost constant but both the aimod and dbe decreased substantially furthermore the relative contribution of cram like molecules decreased strongly while the contribution of aliphatic like molecules slightly increased under increased salinity and doc concentration i e brines spe dom quality shifted towards a higher oxidation state while neither aromaticity nor the saturation degree changed substantially the contributions of cram like and aliphatic like molecules decreased while a substantial increase in highly oxygenated molecules was detected finally during the autumnal rewetting spe dom showed low aromaticity low aimod more saturation low dbe and less oxidation low nosc the relative contributions of cram like and aliphatic like molecules increased again while that of the highly oxygenated molecules returned to low values remarkably the relative intensities of the highly oxygenated moieties strongly covaried with the doc content during the entire study period r 0 98 d f 4 p 0 001 fig 7b molecular changes under high doc salinity conditions were visualized with the spearman s rank correlation analysis fig 8 a shows that almost 30 of the mfs significantly correlated with the doc concentration p 0 05 of these 14 correlated positively with doc while the rest were correlated negatively these two groups were clearly separated along the o c ratio axis with the mfs positively correlating with the doc concentration showing an o c ratio larger than 0 5 furthermore the mfs positively correlating with the doc concentration were typically smaller than 450 m z by contrast there were no trends observed in the mass of the mfs negatively correlating with the doc level fig 8b a positive correlation between the relative contribution of nitrogen bearing molecules and the doc concentration was also observed r 0 875 g l 4 p 0 025 for example 62 of the mfs that accumulated at high doc levels according to the spearman s rank correlation contained nitrogen this percentage decreased to 22 for the molecules that decreased in abundance at high doc levels spe dom collected just after storm gloria and that collected after the autumnal rewetting showed clearly different signatures the sample collected after storm gloria had more aromatic and more unsaturated molecules but only few aliphatic like molecules by contrast the spe dom collected during rewetting shared several similarities with that obtained from the salt crust low values of nosc aimod and dbe as well as a high relative contribution of aliphatic like compounds and a low relative contribution of highly oxygenated compounds fig 7 non oxygen heteroatom molecules chno chos and chnos molecules accounted for the 18 25 13 18 and 2 4 respectively of spe dom total peak intensity table 2 and appendix si10 larger relative intensities occurred in summer brines among heteroatom molecular categories the most remarkable result was the accumulation of s bearing highly oxygenated molecules with a peak relative signal higher than that of cho analogous molecules in contrast n bearing highly oxygenated molecules did not showed such accumulation in brines appendix si10 overall heteroatom molecules were typically more oxidized and less aromatic ie higher nosc and lower aimod and dbe values respectively than cho ones 4 discussion the shallow lake of la salineta is a highly dynamic system that undergoes large oscillations in salinity as a result of the alternation of wet and dry phases this study highlighted how this dynamism alters the quantity and quality of dom doc levels increased by up to two orders of magnitude during the transition from wet conditions to brine formation such an increase is inconceivable in lotic systems and is much larger than that reported in other organic rich saline systems in the world mariot et al 2007 osburn et al 2011 butturini et al 2020 although information from h seas lakes worldwide is scarce and incomplete these large oscillations in doc content are probably a remarkable signature of these harsh systems the mass balance in la salineta revealed a large amount of doc emerging with the formation of brines approximately 45 of this could not be attributed to evapoconcentration this indicated an outstanding net in situ production that could not be counterbalanced by photooxidation the reduction in solubility of dom molecules at high salinities or by heterotrophic consumption the doc increase detected in brines showed a time delay with respect to the increase in temperature and salinity previous studies have reported that la salineta hosts a highly dynamic and diverse microbial planktonic community composed of bacteria archaea microeukaryotes and fungi with heterotrophic prokaryotes and photoautotrophic eukaryotic chlorophyta dunaliella salina being predominant under high salinities menéndez serra et al 2021 prokaryotes and microeukaryotes that thrive in such oscillating and extreme salinity conditions synthesize and accumulate organic compounds as carbon reservoirs and osmolytes to counteract the external osmotic stress i e a salt out osmoadaptation strategy menéndez serra et al 2021 for instance healthy and senescent dunaliella salina excretes large amounts of glycerol and derivatives that in turn can support a high density of heterotrophic bacteria and archaea oren 1993 bardavid et al 2008 orellana et al 2013 therefore the delayed increase in the doc concentration might reflect a rising imbalance between the dom mineralization caused by heterotrophic consumption and photodegradation and the dom released by primary producers and any senescent lysed cells under osmotic stress la salineta and almost all of the hypersaline playa lakes in arid zones are totally unshaded and permanently irradiated by the sun the impact of solar radiation on dom is well recognized and has been comprehensively studied del vecchio and blough 2006 gonsior et al 2013 herzsprung et al 2020 however our results suggested that the effects of photodegradation on dom appeared to be relevant at the beginning of the study period january may based on the observed reductions in aromaticity decreases in the suva254 and aimod the relative molecular size increase of s250 275 and the unsaturation degree decrease in the dbe helms et al 2008 vähätalo and wetzel 2008 xu et al 2020 dom from interstitial waters and the salt crust leachate was slightly richer in aromatic descriptors suva254 aromatic like and ca like proxies indicating that the effects of photodegradation must be minor in these cases especially in interstitial waters once brines were formed and the doc concentration had increased the relevance of photodegradation on dom declined suva254 s250 275 aimod and dbe remained almost constant in these samples by contrast the excess of doc was coupled with an increase in autochthonous and fresh moieties as suggested by the high values of the bix and fi reinforcing the suggestion that the doc had originated from the microbiota as described above simultaneously ft icr ms revealed the accumulation of oxidized molecules under the highest salinity and doc concentrations this shift was opposite to that expected if the effects of photodegradation were relevant stubbins et al 2006 xu et al 2020 wilske et al 2020 further corroborating the reduced impact of photodegradation on the dom accumulated in brines the accumulation of saturated low dbe and relatively oxidized high nosc molecules and the absence of aromatic like substances i e aimod 0 in the brines as well as the increase in the relative contribution of highly oxygenated mfs are evidencing in depth transformation of the dom pool during drying and simultaneous exacerbation of salinity jiang et al 2022 as mentioned previously halophytic communities in highly dynamic saline hypersaline lagoons typically counteract external osmotic stress by accumulating a high amount of small sized organic solutes roberts 2005 all these osmolytes polyols sugars betaines and ectoines and their hydrolyzed derivatives are non aromatic compounds i e aimod 0 and most are oxidized i e o c 0 5 and nosc 0 the spearman rank analysis selected 26 highly oxygenated mfs that significantly and positively correlated with the doc concentration moreover relative peak intensity of s bearing highly oxygenated molecules was higher than that of cho analogous are these molecules mirroring the release of osmolytes from decaying planktonic microbiota due to the increase in salinity simultaneously does the abundance of chos highly oxygenated molecules indicating that these compounds are susceptible to be sulfurized by microbiota or by sulfide rich anoxic waters gomez saez et al 2017 almost nothing is known about how and if osmolytes in these systems are released degraded and transformed it is important to remark that most of the osmolytes are typically smaller than 200 daltons therefore they are out of the detectable mass range for the ft icr ms method used in this study however in all samples we identified the mf c12h18o6 to our best knowledge this mf has not been reported in freshwater ecosystems such as reservoirs dadi et al 2017 and might be a putative a three units of the glycerol based molecule phb c4h6o2 3 a well known carbon reservoir for salt adapted microorganisms that acts as an osmolyte at high salinity roberts 2005 moreover in all samples we also identified the mfs c12h20o7 and c12h18o9s that might the putative hydrolyzed h2o and sulfurized so3 molecules respectively of c4h6o2 3 among salt adapted microbiota halobacteria and halomonas are known to accumulate phb quillaguamán et al 2010 fernandez castillo et al 1986 abd el malex et al 2020 and both have been reported at relatively high abundances in monegros h seas lakes including la salineta menéndez serra et al 2020 we did not investigate the molecular structure of this molecule and caution is needed when relating a molecular formula identified by ft icr ms to a specific compound however the ubiquity of peaks identified as corresponding to putative phb represents an intriguing starting point for future investigations aiming to evaluate the hypothesis that the release of osmolytes from halophytic live and decaying microbiota might be key to understanding the production accumulation and fate of doc in hypersaline waters as indicated by the isotopic signal of dd and d18o storm gloria caused the input of completely new water the dom detected under this wet condition showed the highest aromaticity humification and unsaturation degree with the relative contribution of cram like substances being the highest and that of the highly oxygenated ones being the lowest storm gloria could have led to surface runoff from the surrounding flat lands of the playa lake with the subsequent input of terrigenous aromatic and unsaturated organic substances by contrast the dom obtained after the rewetting caused by the autumn rains did not show this consistent terrigenous signature the signal of dd and d18o in this sample revealed the input of new water but the isotopic signature was slightly separated from the meteoric water line indicating a mixture of new rain with old water from the residual brines as a consequence the autumnal rewetting was not a severe flushing episode that dragged terrestrial material solutes from the surrounding lands interestingly ft icr ms revealed that the spe dom of the autumnal rewetting water shared molecular characteristics observed in the spe dom obtained from the salt crust leachate indicating that the re dissolution of the spe dom trapped in the salt crust during the previous dry period might partly explain the properties of the dom obtained from the autumnal rewetting conditions therefore this old dom might help to sustain the new planktonic heterotrophs proliferating in the water column during rewetting the dom from the salt crust sample stood out for having a large proportion of n i e the lowest c n ratio in the spe dom and in the bulk dom with respect to that of the brines in addition fluorescence analysis revealed a significantly stronger signal for protein like fluorophores since this information came from only one sample it is only preliminary and indicates that the high salinity found at la salineta may cause the sequestration of n bearing molecules in the salt crust resulting in a qualitative shift of the dom pool this result is consistent with the salting out phenomenon which is well recognized by chemists and is used in the purification of chemicals grover and ryall 2005 and the reduction of organic contaminants in aquatic ecosystems xie et al 1997 however to our knowledge our report is the first to provide preliminary findings that this phenomenon could be relevant in controlling the quality of dom in h seas in the near future it will be significant to explore how salinity affects the structure of dom molecules and if these putative alterations modify its bioavailability to halophytic heterotrophic bacteria going beyond and placing our results in a more global context spe dom from la salineta showed very low aromaticity low aimod even lower than that previously reported for a highly productive saline soda lake butturini et al 2020 and a relatively high oxidation state nosc that was similar to that reported for streams small rivers that are usually not affected much by photodegradation fig 9 therefore the accumulation of oxidized and non aromatic moieties in la salineta especially in brines emerges as an outstanding distinctive biogeochemical signature of h seas providing further evidence of the uniqueness of these extreme and fragile ecosystems caution must be taken when comparing results obtained with different instrumentations different extraction protocols different data analysis tools or different habitats see jian et al 2022 for more details about some technical drawbacks in our example to constrain these limitations we used data obtained from only two studies one that describe data from a variety of freshwater systems across united states kellerman et al 2018 and the second one from a productive saline soda lake butturini et al 2020 which applied the same instrumentation and identical solid phase extraction protocol of the present study be aware on the need to solve the technical limitations to advance in our understanding of how dom molecular chemodiversity change across aquatic ecosystems it will be essential to promote more accurate and exhaustive comparative studies integrating the larger variety of ecosystems and therefore expanding our studies to more anomalous habitats such as the hypersaline water bodies 5 conclusions 1 the evaporative cycle in a shallow hypersaline lake culminated with the formation of a dense salt saturated and organic rich solution high evaporation converted the playa lake into a natural reactor with a disproportionate excess of doc under the most extreme hypersaline conditions 2 a temporal asynchrony was observed between the temporal dynamics in the doc concentration and dom qualitative proxies with most of the qualitative changes in the dom preceded by the quantitative ones this asynchrony likely reflects the prevalence of dom photodegradation at the beginning of the hydrological cycle and the delayed dom accumulation of fresh autochthonous substances coinciding with the net doc accrual during dry conditions 3 oxidized small no aromatic and saturated spe dom molecules tended to covary positively with the doc concentration and accumulated in brines the relative contribution of highly oxygenated o c 0 9 molecules increased remarkably under high doc concentrations 4 the presence of highly oxygenated molecules together with the occurrence of putative pbh and its hydrolyzed and sulfonated derivates suggested that the dom released by live and decaying microplankton is key to

15729,hypersaline endorheic aquatic systems h seas are lakes shallow playas in arid and semiarid regions that undergo extreme oscillations in salinity and severe drought episodes although their geochemical uniqueness and microbiome have been deeply studied very little is known about the availability and quality of dissolved organic matter dom in the water column a h seas from the monegros desert zaragoza ne spain was studied during a hydrological wetting drying rewetting cycle dom analysis included i a dissolved organic carbon doc mass balance ii spectroscopy absorbance and fluorescence and iii a molecular characterization with fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms the studied system stored a large amount of doc and under the highest salinity conditions salt saturated waters i e brines with salinity 30 accumulated a disproportionate quantity of doc indicating a significant in situ net dom production simultaneously during the hydrological transition from wet to dry the dom pool showed strong alterations of it molecular composition spectroscopic methods indicated that aromatic and degraded dom was rapidly replaced by fresher relatively small microbial derived moieties with a large c n ratio ft icr ms highlighted the accumulation of small saturated and oxidized molecules molecular o c 0 5 with a remarkable increase in the relative contribution of highly oxygenated molecular o c 0 9 compounds and a decrease of aliphatic and carboxyl rich alicyclic moleculesthese results indicated that h seas are extremely active in accumulating and processing dom with the notable release of organic solutes probably originated from decaying microplankton under large osmotic stress at extremely high salinities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter hypersaline waters endorheic spectroscopy ft icr ms 1 introduction hypersaline endorheic aquatic systems h seas are harsh and vulnerable ecosystems widely distributed in arid and semiarid regions worldwide wang et al 2018 that undergo large oscillations in salinity with maxima at the salt saturation level some recent geo statistical estimates suggest that inland saline and hypersaline waters might account for 47 of global lakes volumes and small saline waters bodies might represent up to the 3 of global lakes volumes messager et al 2016 h seas attracted researches for hosting diverse and dynamic halophilic consortiums of archaea bacteria plankton fungi protists and invertebrates lee et al 2018 menéndez serra et al 2021 belilla et al 2021 by contrast information about dissolved organic matter dom in these ecosystems is still scarce and unconnected mariot et al 2007 butturini et al 2020 boros et al 2020 jiang et al 2022 despite it being an indispensable source of carbon and energy for the abundant heterotrophic bacteria occurring in these habitats lee et al 2018 and probably an important component for explaining anomalous methane production measured in a productive saline soda lake fazi et al 2021 consequently determining the dynamic of the dom in these ecosystems is a fundamental step in understanding how microbiota proliferate in these harsh habitats and the relevance of the carbon cycle in these ecosystems the abundance and quality of dom in aquatic ecosystems are the result of an intricate balance between terrestrial allochthonous inputs da silva et al 2021 autochthonous biotic releases morling et al 2017a heterotrophic consumption morling et al 2017b and photodegradation gonsior et al 2013 herzsprung et al 2020 research on dom in endorheic saline waters typically focus on the variability in the quality of dom across water bodies at the regional scale wen et al 2018 song et al 2019 xu et al 2020 jiang et al 2022 or among water layers in stratified lakes butturini et al 2020 however knowledge about temporal changes of dom quality is still scarce jiang et al 2022 shallow h seas are extremely dynamic in terms of hydrology and water salinity which dramatically increases when the surface water evaporates therefore only temporal monitoring can capture the dynamics and magnitude of these changes and determine their relevance in shaping the quantity and qualitative properties of dom in these systems the fate of dom during a hydrological transition from wet to dry conditions in h seas can reflect the superposition of complex processes on the one hand during drying water evaporation should cause a sharp rise in the dom concentration in the water column on the other hand the increase in salinity during dry conditions is expected to reduce the solubility of some organic solutes the salting out phenomenon xie et al 1997 especially proteinaceous li et al 2012 and amphiphilic compounds lechtenfeld et al 2013 accordingly the concentrations of some dom moieties might decrease under high salinities simultaneously the lack of interception of solar radiation by terrestrial vegetation should facilitate the photodegradation of aromatic fractions del vecchio and blough 2006 finally the increase in temperature associated with drying might promote the growth of benthic and pelagic microbiota consequently increasing the release uptake of organic solutes all together these in situ processes are expected to have a discernible influence on dom properties and its potential bioavailability for heterotrophic microbiota or its photoreactivity for instance increased osmotic pressure in salt saturated waters i e brines with salinities 30 might lead to the release of osmoregulatory compounds by the microbiota or cell lysis resulting in the exudation and hydrolysis of organic moieties from stressed halotolerant organisms altendorf et al 2009 therefore an accumulation of fresh and saturated autochthonous compounds might be expected at high salinities furthermore if the solubility of proteinaceous moieties decreases at high salinities the c n ratio is expected to increase however the opposite is expected if the dom is absorbed onto the salt precipitates as a consequence of salt oversaturation li et al 2012 finally the ecological context of the surrounding area also matters shallow h seas are typically located in flat and arid zones with very little littoral and terrestrial vegetation and no canopy conesa mor et al 2011 therefore allochthonous inputs are expected to be small and sporadic but might be relevant at certain times especially during storm episodes in this context the three main objectives of this study were to 1 determine the mass balance of dissolved organic carbon doc in the water column during the transition from wet to dry conditions in an extremely dynamic h seas to discern the impact of evaporation on in situ doc consumption release 2 detail the synchrony asynchrony of the doc concentration based on its qualitative e g spectroscopic properties during the wet to dry transition 3 explore if and how the molecular chemo diversity of the dom changes as dryness and salinity increase to address these objectives water samples were collected from a shallow h seas in the monegros desert ne spain for almost one year during a hydrological wetting drying rewetting transition furthermore dom from interstitial waters collected during the summer was analyzed as well as that from a sample of salt crust that precipitated in the summer salts are a highly reflective material surface albedo over 40 according to craft and horel 2019 consequently the impact of photodegradation on dom accumulation within the salt crust and interstitial waters is expected to be small the qualitative characterization of dom was performed with optical spectroscopy absorbance and fluorescence stoichiometry the molar c n ratio and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms 2 material methods 2 1 study site this study focused on la salineta a hypersaline shallow playa lake 41 28 53 n 0 9 32 o that covers a depression of 0 15 km2 la salineta is one of the numerous saline shallow lakes in karsic depressions in the monegros desert huesca zaragoza locally called saladas conesa et al 2011 fig 1 this area in northeast spain is a warm semi arid region according to the koppen geiger classification rubel and kottek 2010 with an extreme water deficit and a mean annual precipitation and evapotransporation of 350 mm and 1225 mm respectively domínguez beisiegel et al 2013 these shallow depressions originated from the dissolution of limestone gypsum and lutites and evaporitic materials salvany et al 1995 these lagoons are surrounded by flat dry agricultural lands and not impacted by industrial activities in comparison to the nearby shallow saline lakes la salineta shows the longest wet cycle castañeda and herrero 2005 when flooded the water column is typically 20 30 cm depth in contrast in the summer the water column is simply a thin layer 1 2 cm in depth of brine that rests on the salt crust 3 5 cm thick due to the proximity of a permanent water table in the summer the salt crust covers approximately 60 of the total lake bed and is mainly composed of halite 84 2 and bloedite na2mg so4 2 4h2o 15 1 with a small amount of calcite 0 7 appendix si1 particulate organic matter in the salt crust averages 9 3 gc m2 in the water column the ph typically ranges from 7 5 to 8 8 while the oxide reduction potential orp varies from 330 to 175 mv with the lowest values occurring in brines chlorophyll concentration in the water column ranged between 2 4 and 230 mg l being the high value the highest in comparison to that of the other nearby h seas menendez serra et al 2020 while the density of planktonic prokaryotes ranges between 9 105 and 8 107 cells ml 1 unpublished data from the authors 2 2 field sampling la salineta was sampled from january to december 2020 sampling started january 28th under extremely wet conditions due to the occurrence of storm gloria a few days earlier water samples were collected from the surface on seven dates 28 01 21 05 15 06 30 06 20 07 09 10 and 29 12 and interstitial waters on four dates 30 06 20 07 09 10 and 29 12 surface waters with salinity higher than 30 were defined as brines in addition dom was analyzed from a sample of salt crust that had precipitated on the playa lake bed in the summer on each sampling date 0 5 l of surface water were filtered in the field with precombusted gf f glass fiber filters whatman an aliquot 250 ml was acidified to ph 2 with an hcl solution all samples acidified or not were stored at 4 c prior to analysis waters with salinities higher than 20 were diluted to 10 to avoid salt precipitation interstitial waters were collected at a depth of 20 cm from sediments using four tensiometers equipped with a ceramic suction cup irrometer model ssat tensiometers were inserted into the sediments for 3 4 h before water collection a few milliliters of water were typically collected with each tensiometer therefore all the samples were merged into one larger sample of 80 120 ml the sample was then filtered in the field with precombusted gf f glass fiber filters and acidfied to ph 2 a plate of salt crust measuring approximately 0 05 m2 and 3 cm thick was collected in the summer and transported to the laboratory under dark conditions at 4 c in the laboratory the salt crust was dissolved in 2 l of ultrapure water and filtered with precombusted gf f glass fiber filters the resulting solution was acidified to ph 2 and stored at 4 c prior to analysis the salinity of the surface and interstitial waters was measured in situ with a refractometer hrs 8 t kruss germany 2 3 environmental descriptors the temperatures of surface waters and in interstitial saturated sediments were monitored continuously with hobo pendant mx water temperature data loggers sensors were installed in january at the lake edge and inserted into sediments at a depth of 10 cm the sensor submerged in the water column leaned on the lake bed and remained out of the water from june 15th 2020 to november 5th 2020 as a consequence of the surface water contraction this interval could be identified by the hobo temperature sensor recording anomalous large daily temperature oscillations revealing that the sensor was out of the water and measuring the temperature of the air in contact with the salt crust fig 2 c pluviometry and daily air temperature data were obtained from a meteorological station located at the zaragoza airport 65 km away from the sampling site and managed by the agencia española de metereología aemet www aemet es variations in the surface water of la salineta were monitored during the study period using sentinel playground which provides satellite images that are refreshed every 7 10 days 2 4 biogeochemical analysis dissolved organic carbon doc content and total dissolved nitrogen tdn levels in water samples were measured with the multi n c 3100 analyzer

subtracting the amount of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din from that of tdn din content was determined with colorimetric methods nitrate nitrite was estimated with a bran luebbe autoanalyzer equipped with a reductive copper cadmium column detection limit 50 mg l 1 ammonium levels were estimated with the salicylate method of reardon 1969 detection limit 25 mg l 1 to minimize interference from the salts and sulfite all samples were diluted 1 5 1 10 with ultrapure milli q water to measure the impact of storm gloria on the input of new water into la salineta dd and d18o of the water samples were measured by pyrolysis using a thermo quest high temperature conversion elemental analyzer tc ea unit with a finnigan mat delta xp irms the results are expressed in terms of δ relative to international

doc concentrations among samples see the results section all acidified samples were diluted to a final doc concentration of 5 10 mg l and to a final salinity ranging from 0 5 to 1 5 to mitigate the interference from the inner filter effect during the spectroscopy measurements samples were maintained at room temperature and filtered with 0 2 mm nylon filters prior to analysis the uv1700 pharmaspec spectrophotometer shimadzu japan was used to obtain absorbance spectra data were obtained in the double beam mode with the wavelength scanned from 200 to 600 nm the slit width was set to 1 nm deionized water with 1 salinity was used as the blank absorbance spectra were used to estimate the specific aromaticity at 254 nm suva254 and the spectral slope between 275 and 295 nm s275 295 suva254 was estimated according to the method of weishaar et al 2003 s275 295 was estimated by fitting the log transformed absorption spectra obtained between 275 and 295 nm s275 295 values typically increase upon irradiation and inversely correlate with the molecular weight of the dom helms et al 2008 fluorescence spectra were obtained with an rf 5301 pc spectrofluorometer shimadzu japan equipped with a xenon lamp and a light source compensation system s r mode for each sample a three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem was obtained each eem consisted of 21 synchronous scans with 1 nm increments both in emission and in excitation the excitation wavelength ranged from 250 to 410 nm with intervals of 10 nm the emission wavelength ranged from 310 to 530 nm with intervals of 10 nm the bandwidth used for both excitation and emission was 5 nm a 1 cm quartz cell was used to perform the measurements each eem was corrected and normalized following the steps described by goletz et al 2011 the excitation correction function was determined using rhodamine b as a quantum counter lakowicz 2006 whereas the emission correction was obtained by comparing the reference spectra of quinine sulfate and tryptophan provided by the national institute of standards and technology nist gardecki and maroncelli 1998 data were normalized by the area under the raman peak obtained for an ultrapure mq water sample at λex350 nm λem371 428 nm lawaetz and stedmon 2009 the inner filter effect was corrected by comparing absorbance measurements larsson et al 2007 lakowicz 2006 eem spectra were used to estimate three dom qualitative proxies the fluorescence index fi the biological index bix and the humification index hix the fi positively correlates with the accumulation of microbial derived dom relative to terrestrial inputs mcknight et al 2001 it is the ratio of the fluorescence intensity emitted at 470 nm to that at 520 nm at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm bix values positively correlate with the accumulation of recent autochthonous dom it is the ratio of the fluorescence intensity emitted at 380 nm to that at 430 nm at an excitation wavelength of 310 nm huguet et al 2009 the hix is a proxy for the amount of humic substances higher values indicate a higher humification degree ohno 2002 it is calculated by dividing the area of the emission spectra between 435 and 480 nm by the sum of the areas of the emission spectra between 435 and 480 nm and between 300 and 345 nm at an excitation wavelength of 254 nm the molar c n ratio of the dom was calculated after estimating the molar concentrations of doc and don 2 4 2 spe extraction and ft icr ms the solid phase extraction spe of dom spe dom was performed in all the samples the spe dom recovery efficiency averaged 36 5 appendix si3 however the recovery rate of the sup200720 sample 18 5 remained outside the interquartile range therefore the results from this sample were removed from the data analysis appendix si4

c1 60h1 120o1 40n0 4s0 1 with an error range of 0 5 ppm according to lechtenfeld et al 2015 relative peak intensities were calculated based on the summed intensities of all the assigned peaks in each sample the molecular formula of a mass peak is referred to as molecule in this article although one molecular formula can represent several or even millions of different structural isomers only formulas with 10 dbe o 10 dbe double bound equivalents were considered for further data evaluation herzsprung et al 2014 after molecular formula assignement the following molecular descriptors were

of saturation of a molecule i e the number of c c double bounds whereas the o c ratio and nosc are descriptors of the average carbon oxidation state according to the values of the different dom indicators the dom molecular classes were split into carboxyl rich alicyclic like molecules cram aliphatic like substances aromatic like compounds condensed and aromatic like substances ca and highly oxygenated molecules criteria adopted to constrain the molecular classes are detailed in appendix si5 each formula can describe numerous isomers therefore this classification suggests the most likely structure rossel et al 2017 2 5 data analysis and statistics a doc mass balance was determined to discern the impact of evaporation from in situ processes on doc concentration potassium concentrations

e t describes the expected values of doc concentration at each sampling time t doc m 0 is the measured value of doc at time 0 and k t and k 0 are the measured concentrations of potassium at each sampling time t and at time 0 respectively time 0 corresponds to the sampling performed right after storm gloria when la salineta was under extreme wet conditions comparison between the measured and expected values of doc was used to determine the following net balance 2 if d o c e t d o c m t i n d i c a t e s a n e t i n s i t u d e p l e t i o n o f d o c d o c m t i n d i c a t e s t h a t e

qualitative proxies was explored by visualizing the relationships of the dom proxies with the doc plots the shape hysteresis and rotational pattern of these plots provide a rapid indication of the strength and non linearity of the coupling butturini et al 2008 correlations between variables were assumed to be statistically significant at p 0 05 paired t test was used to evaluate differences in the dom optical descriptors between brines and interstitial waters both collected exclusively in the summer differences were assumed to be statistically significant at p 0 05 differences in the ft icr

intensities for each of the eleven samples separately squared euclidean distances with ward s linkage were applied murtagh and legendre 2014 by assigning first rank to the variable with the highest intensity visualization of the qualitative differences of spe dom involved the use of van krevelen diagrams from an inter sample ranking analysis herzsprung et al 2017 for each spe dom molecular class

spearmanresults xls 3 results 3 1 climatic hydrological and geochemical context storm gloria caused the total flooding of the la salineta shallow lake after that the wetted area of the lake gradually contracted at a rate of approximately 945 m2 d 1 with transient rises in april may 2020 after a few rain episodes fig 2a b evaporation accelerated in late june and a shallow 3 cm in depth brine layer was constrained to the more depressed part of the shallow lake approximately 5000 m2 in short 97 of the flooded playa had disappeared in 5 months brines persisted throughout the summer and up to the middle of november when an autumnal rain episode reflooded 50 of the depression fig 2b in the summer the temperature of the air in contact with the salt crust showed daily oscillations within the range of 35 c with 20 c and 55 c being the lowest and highest values respectively in the shallow sediments the daily temperature oscillations were of 20 c with the highest temperatures rarely exceeding 45 c fig 2c right after storm gloria the d18o and dd values measured in the waters from la salineta were identical to the long term weighted δ18o and dd values recorded for the precipitation in zaragoza araguas araguas and teijeiro 2005 indicating that the playa was totally flooded by new rain water evaporation strongly intensified the fractionation of the two isotopes consequently the d18o and dd values showed a strong deviation from meteoric water lines autumnal rewetting affected the input of new water however the d18o and dd values showed little deviation from meteoric water lines revealing that the new water from the rain had mixed with the residual old water from the brines and that the rain episodes were far from being comparable to storm gloria appendix si6 salinity and the main metals appendix si7 and water temperature were significantly correlated r 0 89 g f 5 p 0 05 the increase in water temperature late spring early summer preceded that of salinity and dissolved salt concentrations after storm gloria under wet conditions salinity in la salineta 5 1 was a little higher than that of marine waters after that salinity increased progressively up to 34 45 in june october in december after the autumnal rewetting salinity returned to 9 interstitial waters were sampled during the driest period only the salinity of interstitial waters 32 2 5 was slightly lower than that of brines 39 5 but this difference was not statistically significant tpaired 2 27 p 0 05 3 2 doc dynamics and mass balance doc concentration in the water column ranged from 28 to 1174 mg l correlating significantly with salinity r 0 86 d f 5 p 0 01 but not with temperature r 0 65 d f 5 n s although the doc peak concentration coincided with that of temperature and salinity its pulse began with a time delay with respect to the environmental variables fig 3 the doc level in interstitial waters 225 113 mg l was significantly lower than that in surface waters collected during the same period 842 340 mg l tpaired 4 56 p 0 05 fig 2d the doc mass balance obtained from the potassium concentrations revealed that doc behaved nearly conservatively during wet conditions i e may and december however in june and more remarkably in july october a net release of doc was estimated during the driest conditions july october the measured doc content was almost double the expected concentration fig 3 3 3 dom optical qualitative descriptors as a whole spectroscopic analysis revealed that the dom from la salineta showed remarkably low aromaticity low suva254 values a low humification degree low hix values and an accumulation of small sized moieties large s250 275 values and fresh organics of an autochthonous origin large bix values when the values were compared to those of typical freshwater ecosystems appendix si8 eems showed classic bimodal features with the largest peaks corresponding to humic and fulvic like fluorophores fig 4 chen et al 2003 however the fulvic peak was strongly attenuated for the dom obtained from the salt crust fig 4e comparing the shape of the eem of the sample collected under wet conditions january with that of the brine july a depletion in the fluorophore signal typically assigned to protein like substances b t peaks and an increase in fluorescence in the region of the spectrum close to that corresponding to marine humic like fluorophores m peak were observed for the brine sample fig 4c on the other hand the eem of the salt crust leachate showed the strongest signal for the tryptophan like fluorophore peak t fig 4e the optical descriptors of dom i e suva254 e2 e3 bix hix and fi were not significantly different between the interstitial waters and brines paired t test all t values 2 1 p 0 05 however dom from interstitial waters tended to be slightly more humified aromatic larger in relative size and degraded compared to that of surface water table 1 dom from the salt crust sample was richer in aromatic larger suva254 values and microbial like moieties larger fi compared to that from brines table 1 regarding the surface waters almost all the dom descriptors showed remarkable fluctuations during the study period however only s275 295 significantly positively correlated with an environmental parameter i e with salinity p 0 05 when the changes in the quality proxies for dom were compared to those of the doc content three main responses were observed a the most important one included three dom parameters s275 295 fi and the c n ratio whose highest values preceded that of the doc concentration peaks therefore their relationships with doc concentration were non linear and with a clockwise hysteresis pattern fig 5 a revealing that these parameters increased faster than the doc content fig 4a b the bix parameter fig 5b showed an abrupt increase in may remained almost steady during the driest period and showed a final increase coinciding with the autumnal rewetting hence the bix doc relationship showed a counter clock loop fig 4b c suva254 and the hix abruptly decreased in may but remained almost steady thereafter for the rest of the study period fig 5c 3 4 ft icr ms of spe dom a total of 9415 distinct molecular formulas mfs was detected by ft icr ms the number of mfs in each sample ranged from 4028 to 5830 the six samples from surface waters brines included shared 3449 mfs weighted average masses of all the samples ranged from 354 to 370 m z with larger values observed for the surface waters the hca grouped the samples into two main clusters one cluster comprised the interstitial waters and brines while the other included the three surface water samples with lower salinity and interestingly the salt crust leachate fig 6 for a visualization of the van krevelen diagrams see appendix si9 overall the most abundant group in spe dom was cram like substances 46 52 of the relative peak intensity followed by the aliphatic like group between 5 8 and 19 5 and aromatic like group 1 5 3 4 by contrast ca represented less than 0 5 spe dom from the salt crust sample stood out for having the lowest percentage of cram like molecules and the highest percentage of aliphatic like groups spe dom from surface and interstitial waters showed similar compositions however interstitial waters tended to have a more aromatic and unsaturated molecules higher aimod and dbe and fewer aliphatic substances the c n ratio ranged between 29 and 50 being the lowest for the salt crust spe dom table 2 more details at appendix si10 suggesting a selective accumulation of nitrogen bearing molecules in the salt crust in the surface waters the relative contribution of the compositional groups changed during the study period fig 7 after storm gloria spe dom was rich in cram like molecules with a moderate high level of aromaticity and unsaturation high aimod and dbe respectively and a low carbon oxidation state i e low nosc in may under moderate salinity and doc concentration the nosc remained almost constant but both the aimod and dbe decreased substantially furthermore the relative contribution of cram like molecules decreased strongly while the contribution of aliphatic like molecules slightly increased under increased salinity and doc concentration i e brines spe dom quality shifted towards a higher oxidation state while neither aromaticity nor the saturation degree changed substantially the contributions of cram like and aliphatic like molecules decreased while a substantial increase in highly oxygenated molecules was detected finally during the autumnal rewetting spe dom showed low aromaticity low aimod more saturation low dbe and less oxidation low nosc the relative contributions of cram like and aliphatic like molecules increased again while that of the highly oxygenated molecules returned to low values remarkably the relative intensities of the highly oxygenated moieties strongly covaried with the doc content during the entire study period r 0 98 d f 4 p 0 001 fig 7b molecular changes under high doc salinity conditions were visualized with the spearman s rank correlation analysis fig 8 a shows that almost 30 of the mfs significantly correlated with the doc concentration p 0 05 of these 14 correlated positively with doc while the rest were correlated negatively these two groups were clearly separated along the o c ratio axis with the mfs positively correlating with the doc concentration showing an o c ratio larger than 0 5 furthermore the mfs positively correlating with the doc concentration were typically smaller than 450 m z by contrast there were no trends observed in the mass of the mfs negatively correlating with the doc level fig 8b a positive correlation between the relative contribution of nitrogen bearing molecules and the doc concentration was also observed r 0 875 g l 4 p 0 025 for example 62 of the mfs that accumulated at high doc levels according to the spearman s rank correlation contained nitrogen this percentage decreased to 22 for the molecules that decreased in abundance at high doc levels spe dom collected just after storm gloria and that collected after the autumnal rewetting showed clearly different signatures the sample collected after storm gloria had more aromatic and more unsaturated molecules but only few aliphatic like molecules by contrast the spe dom collected during rewetting shared several similarities with that obtained from the salt crust low values of nosc aimod and dbe as well as a high relative contribution of aliphatic like compounds and a low relative contribution of highly oxygenated compounds fig 7 non oxygen heteroatom molecules chno chos and chnos molecules accounted for the 18 25 13 18 and 2 4 respectively of spe dom total peak intensity table 2 and appendix si10 larger relative intensities occurred in summer brines among heteroatom molecular categories the most remarkable result was the accumulation of s bearing highly oxygenated molecules with a peak relative signal higher than that of cho analogous molecules in contrast n bearing highly oxygenated molecules did not showed such accumulation in brines appendix si10 overall heteroatom molecules were typically more oxidized and less aromatic ie higher nosc and lower aimod and dbe values respectively than cho ones 4 discussion the shallow lake of la salineta is a highly dynamic system that undergoes large oscillations in salinity as a result of the alternation of wet and dry phases this study highlighted how this dynamism alters the quantity and quality of dom doc levels increased by up to two orders of magnitude during the transition from wet conditions to brine formation such an increase is inconceivable in lotic systems and is much larger than that reported in other organic rich saline systems in the world mariot et al 2007 osburn et al 2011 butturini et al 2020 although information from h seas lakes worldwide is scarce and incomplete these large oscillations in doc content are probably a remarkable signature of these harsh systems the mass balance in la salineta revealed a large amount of doc emerging with the formation of brines approximately 45 of this could not be attributed to evapoconcentration this indicated an outstanding net in situ production that could not be counterbalanced by photooxidation the reduction in solubility of dom molecules at high salinities or by heterotrophic consumption the doc increase detected in brines showed a time delay with respect to the increase in temperature and salinity previous studies have reported that la salineta hosts a highly dynamic and diverse microbial planktonic community composed of bacteria archaea microeukaryotes and fungi with heterotrophic prokaryotes and photoautotrophic eukaryotic chlorophyta dunaliella salina being predominant under high salinities menéndez serra et al 2021 prokaryotes and microeukaryotes that thrive in such oscillating and extreme salinity conditions synthesize and accumulate organic compounds as carbon reservoirs and osmolytes to counteract the external osmotic stress i e a salt out osmoadaptation strategy menéndez serra et al 2021 for instance healthy and senescent dunaliella salina excretes large amounts of glycerol and derivatives that in turn can support a high density of heterotrophic bacteria and archaea oren 1993 bardavid et al 2008 orellana et al 2013 therefore the delayed increase in the doc concentration might reflect a rising imbalance between the dom mineralization caused by heterotrophic consumption and photodegradation and the dom released by primary producers and any senescent lysed cells under osmotic stress la salineta and almost all of the hypersaline playa lakes in arid zones are totally unshaded and permanently irradiated by the sun the impact of solar radiation on dom is well recognized and has been comprehensively studied del vecchio and blough 2006 gonsior et al 2013 herzsprung et al 2020 however our results suggested that the effects of photodegradation on dom appeared to be relevant at the beginning of the study period january may based on the observed reductions in aromaticity decreases in the suva254 and aimod the relative molecular size increase of s250 275 and the unsaturation degree decrease in the dbe helms et al 2008 vähätalo and wetzel 2008 xu et al 2020 dom from interstitial waters and the salt crust leachate was slightly richer in aromatic descriptors suva254 aromatic like and ca like proxies indicating that the effects of photodegradation must be minor in these cases especially in interstitial waters once brines were formed and the doc concentration had increased the relevance of photodegradation on dom declined suva254 s250 275 aimod and dbe remained almost constant in these samples by contrast the excess of doc was coupled with an increase in autochthonous and fresh moieties as suggested by the high values of the bix and fi reinforcing the suggestion that the doc had originated from the microbiota as described above simultaneously ft icr ms revealed the accumulation of oxidized molecules under the highest salinity and doc concentrations this shift was opposite to that expected if the effects of photodegradation were relevant stubbins et al 2006 xu et al 2020 wilske et al 2020 further corroborating the reduced impact of photodegradation on the dom accumulated in brines the accumulation of saturated low dbe and relatively oxidized high nosc molecules and the absence of aromatic like substances i e aimod 0 in the brines as well as the increase in the relative contribution of highly oxygenated mfs are evidencing in depth transformation of the dom pool during drying and simultaneous exacerbation of salinity jiang et al 2022 as mentioned previously halophytic communities in highly dynamic saline hypersaline lagoons typically counteract external osmotic stress by accumulating a high amount of small sized organic solutes roberts 2005 all these osmolytes polyols sugars betaines and ectoines and their hydrolyzed derivatives are non aromatic compounds i e aimod 0 and most are oxidized i e o c 0 5 and nosc 0 the spearman rank analysis selected 26 highly oxygenated mfs that significantly and positively correlated with the doc concentration moreover relative peak intensity of s bearing highly oxygenated molecules was higher than that of cho analogous are these molecules mirroring the release of osmolytes from decaying planktonic microbiota due to the increase in salinity simultaneously does the abundance of chos highly oxygenated molecules indicating that these compounds are susceptible to be sulfurized by microbiota or by sulfide rich anoxic waters gomez saez et al 2017 almost nothing is known about how and if osmolytes in these systems are released degraded and transformed it is important to remark that most of the osmolytes are typically smaller than 200 daltons therefore they are out of the detectable mass range for the ft icr ms method used in this study however in all samples we identified the mf c12h18o6 to our best knowledge this mf has not been reported in freshwater ecosystems such as reservoirs dadi et al 2017 and might be a putative a three units of the glycerol based molecule phb c4h6o2 3 a well known carbon reservoir for salt adapted microorganisms that acts as an osmolyte at high salinity roberts 2005 moreover in all samples we also identified the mfs c12h20o7 and c12h18o9s that might the putative hydrolyzed h2o and sulfurized so3 molecules respectively of c4h6o2 3 among salt adapted microbiota halobacteria and halomonas are known to accumulate phb quillaguamán et al 2010 fernandez castillo et al 1986 abd el malex et al 2020 and both have been reported at relatively high abundances in monegros h seas lakes including la salineta menéndez serra et al 2020 we did not investigate the molecular structure of this molecule and caution is needed when relating a molecular formula identified by ft icr ms to a specific compound however the ubiquity of peaks identified as corresponding to putative phb represents an intriguing starting point for future investigations aiming to evaluate the hypothesis that the release of osmolytes from halophytic live and decaying microbiota might be key to understanding the production accumulation and fate of doc in hypersaline waters as indicated by the isotopic signal of dd and d18o storm gloria caused the input of completely new water the dom detected under this wet condition showed the highest aromaticity humification and unsaturation degree with the relative contribution of cram like substances being the highest and that of the highly oxygenated ones being the lowest storm gloria could have led to surface runoff from the surrounding flat lands of the playa lake with the subsequent input of terrigenous aromatic and unsaturated organic substances by contrast the dom obtained after the rewetting caused by the autumn rains did not show this consistent terrigenous signature the signal of dd and d18o in this sample revealed the input of new water but the isotopic signature was slightly separated from the meteoric water line indicating a mixture of new rain with old water from the residual brines as a consequence the autumnal rewetting was not a severe flushing episode that dragged terrestrial material solutes from the surrounding lands interestingly ft icr ms revealed that the spe dom of the autumnal rewetting water shared molecular characteristics observed in the spe dom obtained from the salt crust leachate indicating that the re dissolution of the spe dom trapped in the salt crust during the previous dry period might partly explain the properties of the dom obtained from the autumnal rewetting conditions therefore this old dom might help to sustain the new planktonic heterotrophs proliferating in the water column during rewetting the dom from the salt crust sample stood out for having a large proportion of n i e the lowest c n ratio in the spe dom and in the bulk dom with respect to that of the brines in addition fluorescence analysis revealed a significantly stronger signal for protein like fluorophores since this information came from only one sample it is only preliminary and indicates that the high salinity found at la salineta may cause the sequestration of n bearing molecules in the salt crust resulting in a qualitative shift of the dom pool this result is consistent with the salting out phenomenon which is well recognized by chemists and is used in the purification of chemicals grover and ryall 2005 and the reduction of organic contaminants in aquatic ecosystems xie et al 1997 however to our knowledge our report is the first to provide preliminary findings that this phenomenon could be relevant in controlling the quality of dom in h seas in the near future it will be significant to explore how salinity affects the structure of dom molecules and if these putative alterations modify its bioavailability to halophytic heterotrophic bacteria going beyond and placing our results in a more global context spe dom from la salineta showed very low aromaticity low aimod even lower than that previously reported for a highly productive saline soda lake butturini et al 2020 and a relatively high oxidation state nosc that was similar to that reported for streams small rivers that are usually not affected much by photodegradation fig 9 therefore the accumulation of oxidized and non aromatic moieties in la salineta especially in brines emerges as an outstanding distinctive biogeochemical signature of h seas providing further evidence of the uniqueness of these extreme and fragile ecosystems caution must be taken when comparing results obtained with different instrumentations different extraction protocols different data analysis tools or different habitats see jian et al 2022 for more details about some technical drawbacks in our example to constrain these limitations we used data obtained from only two studies one that describe data from a variety of freshwater systems across united states kellerman et al 2018 and the second one from a productive saline soda lake butturini et al 2020 which applied the same instrumentation and identical solid phase extraction protocol of the present study be aware on the need to solve the technical limitations to advance in our understanding of how dom molecular chemodiversity change across aquatic ecosystems it will be essential to promote more accurate and exhaustive comparative studies integrating the larger variety of ecosystems and therefore expanding our studies to more anomalous habitats such as the hypersaline water bodies 5 conclusions 1 the evaporative cycle in a shallow hypersaline lake culminated with the formation of a dense salt saturated and organic rich solution high evaporation converted the playa lake into a natural reactor with a disproportionate excess of doc under the most extreme hypersaline conditions 2 a temporal asynchrony was observed between the temporal dynamics in the doc concentration and dom qualitative proxies with most of the qualitative changes in the dom preceded by the quantitative ones this asynchrony likely reflects the prevalence of dom photodegradation at the beginning of the hydrological cycle and the delayed dom accumulation of fresh autochthonous substances coinciding with the net doc accrual during dry conditions 3 oxidized small no aromatic and saturated spe dom molecules tended to covary positively with the doc concentration and accumulated in brines the relative contribution of highly oxygenated o c 0 9 molecules increased remarkably under high doc concentrations 4 the presence of highly oxygenated molecules together with the occurrence of putative pbh and its hydrolyzed and sulfonated derivates suggested that the dom released by live and decaying microplankton is key to
