23135,this paper presents a new concept for integrating compressed air energy storage caes into spar type floating wind turbine platforms a preliminary investigation of the implications of integrating the proposed concept on the design and dynamic characteristics of a 5 mw floating offshore wind turbine fowt system is presented a simplified numerical model for sizing the spar to cater for a given compressed air pressure and energy storage capacity is presented this is then used in a parametric analysis to establish the relationship between the storage capacity the spar geometry and the additional mass of the floating configuration to support high air pressures numerical simulations for the dynamic response are then performed using the marine engineering software tool ansys aqwa to study the effect of the added steel mass of the spar resulting from caes integration on the dynamic response characteristics under irregular wave conditions the results are compared to those derived for a conventional fowt spar configuration without an energy storage system it is shown that it is technically feasible to integrate short term energy storage capacities on the order of megawatt hours although integration of caes in the floating spar results in a significant increase in the weight of the floating structure it is shown that this also results in a reduction in the motion experienced

root mean square rna rotor nacelle assembly tlp tension leg platform 1 introduction floating offshore wind turbine fowt technology will unlock the vast wind resources available at more distant and deeper offshore sites 100 m depth where environmental and planning issues are expected to be less problematic a number of full scale prototypes have been deployed it is estimated that eventually fowt technology will become cost competitive when compared to existing seabed mounted technologies currently used in shallow waters james and costa ros 2015 myhr et al 2014 many different fowt support structure concepts are currently under development james and costa ros 2015 the majority of concepts may be classified into three different groups depending on the governing principles used to achieve stability spar type buoys which are stabilised using ballast located below the centre of buoyancy of the floater to create a positive metacentric height semi submersible platforms which achieve stability through a distributed buoyancy and a wide water plane area and tension leg platforms tlps which rely on multiple tensioned moorings to keep the floater stable the floating spar buoy concept is apparently the most technically proven concept for floating wind turbines considering the fact that this technology was adopted in the first ever full scale fowt prototype hywind that had been deployed in norway by statoil way back in 2009 skaare et al 2015 the first commercial floating wind farm consisting of five 6 mw fowts supported using similar spar technology has been commissioned by statoil off the coast of scotland last year 1 1 statoil https www statoil com en news worlds first floating wind farm started production html accessed december 2017 as offshore wind capacity is expected to grow significantly over the next decades the implementation of energy storage technologies will become indispensable to solve the grid related issues arising from the intermittency of wind power different storage technologies for wind farm applications have been considered díaz gonzález et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 integrating energy storage within the wind turbine structure offshore will not only facilitate energy management but will also offer opportunities for further cost reductions associated with the long power transmission cables required to transmit the energy to shore this paper investigates the possibility of integrating compressed air energy storage caes within fowt spar type structures using a new concept which is patent pending sant and buhagiar 2016 in the present paper a concept for integrating caes is presented the same concept but applied to fowt tlp platforms has already been presented by sant et al 2017 elsewhere this paper presents a preliminary evaluation of the caes concept for fowt spar type floating platforms a simplified model is presented to determine the spar dimensions for given buoyancy requirements metacentric height energy storage capacity and other caes parameters a parametric study is then carried out with this numerical model for the nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 this is followed by a preliminary structural dynamic analysis of different spar geometries when operating under irregular wave conditions 2 background 2 1 a floating spar type platform with integrated energy storage fig 1 shows the proposed caes concept integrated in a fowt spar type supporting platform it consists of two pressure vessels interconnected by a pneumatic umbilical the lower vessel is installed on the seabed while the floating spar serves as a larger second pressure vessel and keeps the fowt stable and afloat once the entire system is deployed at sea the pressure vessels are pre charged with compressed air to a pre set level excess energy from the wind turbine during periods of high wind speeds and low energy demand is used to operate a hydraulic machine in pump mode to inject deep sea water at high pressure into the lower pressure vessel consequently energy is stored in the form of compressed air with a uniform pressure maintained in both upper and lower pressure vessels during periods of high energy demand stored energy is released by operating the hydraulic machine in motor mode to power an electrical generator a thermodynamic analysis of the proposed energy storage concept has recently been presented by buhagiar and sant 2017 the study has shown that the overall thermal efficiency of the storage cycle was found to reach 95 when excluding losses associated with the hydraulic machine the concept presents a number of advantages increasing the volume of air by using the floater as a pneumatically interconnected pressure vessel reduces the pressure ratio of the air compression process required to achieve a desired energy storage capacity in reality this reduces the air temperature rise hence minimising thermal loses and improving the efficiency of each energy storage cycle compressing air hydraulically through a liquid piston reduces the physical dimensions of the machinery required given that hydraulic pumps and motors have a higher power to weight ratio compared to air compressors and turbines dedicating the floater support structure to also serve as a caes vessel may offer potential of cost reductions associated with the integration of caes in fowts locating the lower vessel below thermocline formations makes it possible to store cooler deep sea water with significant cooling potential this would effectively result in a net increase in renewable energy provision from offshore turbines buhagiar and sant 2014 spar type floating structures may be more readily adaptable for the proposed caes concept than semi subs and tlp platforms given that the large draft reduces the overall length of the pneumatic umbilical required a major challenge associated with the proposed concept is the additional mass of steel required for the floater to accommodate compressed air at high pressures this matter is investigated in the present study 3 methodology 3 1 the mathematical model this section describes a simple mathematical model designed to investigate the relation between the spar dimensions and thermodynamic parameters associated with the caes process the model has already been presented by sant et al 2017 for a tlp but is being adapted here for a spar type floating platform the model is based on an ideal isothermal compression expansion process with the air assumed to behave as a perfect gas under such conditions the energy storage capacity for given values of the internal volumes of the floating spar and sea bottom mounted vessel is given by 1 e p 2 v b ln v a v b v b 2 p 2 p 1 v a v b v b where p 1 is the pre charge or initial pressure of the system once the fowt is deployed at sea and v b is the net internal volume of the spar excluding that occupied by the ballast the internal volume of the pneumatic umbilical interconnecting the two pressure vessels fig 1 is ignored as this will be negligible in practice the main dimensions defining the buoyant spar when installed in still water are shown in fig 2 the total thickness of the spar cylindrical wall t sp is assumed to be composed of two sections t st which is the wall thickness required to support the wind turbine alone without the presence of compressed air and t ca which is the thickness required to accommodate compressed air only such that 3 t s p t s t t c a in accordance with thin cylinder theory the induced stress in the cylindrical wall resulting from compressed air is made up of two components the hoop stress σ h and the longitudinal stress σ l where 4a σ h p 2 d 2 t c a 4b σ l p 2 d 4 t c a using eq 4a and b in conjunction with the von mises theory for elastic failure which is typically applicable to ductile materials it can be shown that the additional thickness required for the spar cylindrical wall to be able to support compressed air at the maximum pressure p 2 is 5 t c a 3 f s p d 4 p 2 σ y the derivation of eq 5 is presented in sant et al 2017 in this simplified model a further assumption is that the end surfaces of the spar are flat with a total wall thickness of t sp in reality these end caps are spherical or quasi spherical in order to reduced material stresses induced by the air pressurisation process the total spar mass which in the present study is being assumed to consist of a hollow steel cylinder of uniform wall thickness tst tca may be expressed as 6 m s p ρ s p π 2 d t s t t c a d 2 h 2 where h 2 is the total height of the spar the above relation excludes the mass of concrete ballast fig 1 which is defined as 7 m s p b ρ c π d 2 h 4 4 meanwhile h 4 is the height of concrete ballast located at the lowest extremity of the spar internal volume fig 2 the mass of compressed air in the spar reaches a maximum value at pressure p 2 when the sea bottom pressure vessel is full of water under such conditions this mass may be approximated by applying the ideal thermodynamic gas equation 8 m c a p 2 v b r t the total mass of the entire floating system m tot includes the mass of the wind turbine the steel spar the ballast and compressed air 9 m t o t m f o w t m s p m s p b m c a in accordance with archimedes principle m tot should be equal to the mass of sea water displaced assuming static equilibrium under still water conditions and substituting eqs 6 8 into 9 it can be shown that the total height of the spar required to support both the fowt and the compressed air is 10 h 2 ρ s w h 3 4 m f o w t m s p b π d 2 d 3 2 f s p p 2 ρ s p σ y 2 ρ s p t s t d p 2 h 4 r t ρ s w p 2 1 r t 3 f s p ρ s p σ y 4 ρ s p t s d the required draft of the spar may simply be determined from the relation h 1 h 2 h 3 in this model the loads induced by the moorings on the floating structure are ignored 3 2 parametric analyses this section presents a parametric analysis to examine the relation between the various parameters defined in the simplified model described above it is assumed that an nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine is being supported jonkman et al 2009 the analysis evaluates how the spar requirements in particular the draft and mass deviate from that of a reference fowt spar that does not integrate energy storage for which p 1 p 2 0 bar and which has the characteristics similar to those of the oc3 design jonkman 2010 table 1 provides details of the reference spar while table 2 lists all parameters that were maintained constant throughout the parametric study the spar diameter was kept fixed at 9 4 m throughout the analysis the cog in table 1 denotes the centre of gravity location of the spar alone with reference to the mean sea level and along the spar centreline an iterative procedure was applied to solve eq 10 required to determine the spar dimensions and ballast mass m sp b for a given maximum compressed air pressure p 2 while ensuring that a desired value of the metacentric height gm for the entire floating system is achieved the determination of metacentre height was computed using a second equation normally used for simple stability analysis where the distance bm between the centre of buoyancy and the metacentre is equal to i v d for stability gm 0 the parametric study considered different maximum pressure values p 2 ranging from 0 to 80 bar with p 2 0 bar representing the reference spar without a caes system table 1 computations were repeated for three different values of gm namely for gm ref 0 7 gm ref and 0 4 gm ref where gm ref is the metacentric height of the fowt having the reference spar equal to 18 38 m it should be noted that gm denotes the metacentric height when no compressed air is present in the spar once the system is charged the mass of compressed air lowers the cog and increases the metacentric height 4 results figs 3 and 4 show the non linear dependency of the draft and volumetric displacement of the spar with the maximum operating compressed air pressure higher peak pressures call for increasing wall thicknesses of the spar hence also increasing the spar weight and buoyancy requirements the rate of increase in the spar draft and displacement also increases at higher peak pressure values this trend is observed for all selected metacentric heights however lower metacentric heights reduce the required spar draft and displacement this is primarily a consequence of the fact that a lower gm value reduces the ballast mass required hence also reducing the buoyancy needed to keep the entire system afloat the maximum allowable draft of the spar will have to be physically constrained by the sea depth it will also have to be limited by the need to keep the spar rigid for a given material yield strength and factor of safety f sp the spar wall thickness required to support compressed air increases linearly with pressure p 2 in accordance with eqs 3 and 5 the total thickness t sp increases linearly with the peak pressure and is independent of the metacentric height as may be observed in fig 5 at a pressure p 2 0 t sp is equal to the thickness of the reference fowt spar with no integrated storage the total thickness t st is equal to 0 045 m see table 1 the energy storage capacity also increases linearly with p 2 and is also independent of gm fig 6 on the other hand the pressure ratio r p of the caes compression process exhibits a linear decrease with increases in pressure p 2 fig 7 hence it can be concluded that higher peak pressures not only yield higher storage capacities but also result in higher storage efficiencies given that lower pressure ratios would in reality yield lower temperature increments during the air compression process yet this comes at the expense of lower specific energy storage values which in the present study is being defined as the energy storage capacity divided by the total mass of steel required to support compressed air taking into consideration both the mass of the floater and seabed mounted vessels refer to fig 8 reducing the metacentric height of the floating system results in larger compression ratios and an increase in specific energy storage values as may be noted in fig 9 the mass of compressed air in the spar is substantial reaching 1400 tonnes at a maximum operating pressure p 2 of 80 bar this is equivalent to 19 of the total mass of the reference fowt spar listed in table 1 reducing the design metacentric height reduces the mass of compressed air for a given storage capacity in mwh this is due to the smaller draft and volume of the spar it may also be observed that higher values of p 2 lead to a larger spar draft and mass lowering both the centre of buoyancy and the centre of gravity of the entire floating system and thus resulting in an increase in the metacentric height gm f consequently higher peak pressures also enhance the stability of the system see fig 10 fig 11 shows plots of the variation in the mass of compressed air within the spar between the pre charge and fully charged states i e when the sea bottom accumulator is empty and completely full of sea water respectively this variation is expressed as a percentage of the total mass of the floating system comprising the wind turbine assembly spar and the ballast it is observed that this variation does not exceed 1 consequently it may be assumed that the dynamic response characteristics of the floating structure are unaffected by the state of charge of the integrated compressed air storage system however this is only because the volume of the seabed mounted vessel v a is small compared to that of the spar hence resulting in lower operating pressure ratios for the air compression process the additional mass of steel of the spar for caes is quantified through the steel mass factor which is defined as the ratio of the steel mass of the spar at a selected pressure p 2 to that of the reference spar table 1 p 2 0 this factor increases significantly with p 2 for higher pressures but is shown to decrease for smaller design metacentric heights fig 12 the variation in the ballast mass is quantified through the ballast mass factor which in this case is the ballast required at a selected p 2 divided by that for the reference spar table 1 p 2 0 as observed from fig 13 the ballast required with compressed air integrated in the spar is not more than 1 42 times that of the baseline value although higher pressures lead to a reduction in ballast the overall spar weight still increases due to a significant increase in steel mass fig 14 shows the variation of the cost factor with p 2 this factor is defined as the overall cost of the spar structure taking into consideration the additional mass of steel and ballast to integrate caes divided by that for the reference spar the estimates shown in this figure are based on the assumption that the costs for steel and ballast are equal to euro 2 2 kg and euro 0 1 kg respectively it is observed that the cost of the spar structure increases significantly for caes integration increasing more than fivefold at p 2 80 bar the cost of a floating spar with no integrated storage is expected to cost around 20 of the entire capital costs of a floating wind farm james and costa ros 2015 this implies that doubling the cost of the floating spar to integrate caes would approximately lead to a 20 increase in the capital cost of the farm on the other hand a five fold increase in the spar cost would nearly double the overall wind farm cost 4 1 modelling the structural dynamic response this section describes an analysis to evaluate the influence of caes integration on the dynamic response characteristics of the fowt structure in depth dynamic response studies of spar type structures for wind energy applications has been documented in many literature sources such as for instance jonkman 2010 jeon et al 2013 sethuraman and venugopal 2013 karimirad and moan 2012 however only a preliminary evaluation is being presented here in order to provide insight of the effect of the added structural material for caes integration on the motion of the fowt 4 1 1 design variants the analysis was carried out using ansys aqwa 2 2 ansys academic research release 17 0 ansys inc seven different fowt structures were simulated with each design variant having a different spar geometry established in accordance with the numerical model described in section 3 1 all design variants had the common parameters listed in tables 2 and 3 the mooring system parameters which were also common to all variants are presented in table 4 parameters differentiating between the seven spar designs are shown in table 5 spar 1 denotes the reference fowt with no caes and having the parameters listed in table 1 spar 2 to spar 4 have a common peak operating pressure equal to 40 bar and an energy storage capacity of around 1 5 mwh but different values for the draft and metacentric height spar 5 to spar 7 have an increasing peak operating pressure and storage capacity up to 70 bar and 2 71 mwh respectively it was ensured that the metacentric height of each spar design was also positive when no compressed air is present this is an essential requirement to ensure that the entire floating structure is stable during the deployment process 4 1 2 the numerical model each spar was modelled in ansys aqwa as a thin surface body with the hydrodynamic wave diffraction and radiative loads computed using the panel method details about this approach may be found in ansys aqwa theory manual the entire spar surface was discretized into a fixed number of panels with the size of each panel not exceeding 1 2 m given that this method is based on the potential flow theory it is only applicable to inviscid and unseparated flows around the spar it was therefore ensured that the kueleger carpenter parameter along the spar did not exceed 2 faltinsen 2009 the entire floating structure was modelled to be rigid and the flexibility of the wind turbine and the spar were ignored a lumped mass model was used to represent the mass inertia and cog locations for the rotor nacelle assembly rna assembly turbine tower spar steel cylinder ballast and compressed air the rna was modelled as a single point mass at the elevation given in table 3 and the mass and inertias values of the nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 were applied the tower was represented using 11 nodal elements with the mass and inertia values prescribed at each node a non linear catenary model was selected for the three mooring lines the lines were assumed to have uniform characteristics throughout in the dynamic model for the moorings the lines were discretized into 100 elements in all simulations the presence of the pneumatic umbilical fig 1 was ignored as its diameter typically 0 2 m is too small to have an appreciable effect on the dynamic behaviour of the system the aerodynamic axial thrust induced by the wind turbine rotor on the floating structure was simply represented as a point force at the tower top and moving with the structure this was computed using gh bladed 3 3 gl garrard hassan bladed ver 4 4 0 67 st vincent works silverthorne lane bristol bs2 0qd england for a turbine with a fixed base the influence of unsteady aerodynamic phenomena resulting from the stochastic behaviour of the wind and the wave induced spar motions was ignored wind loads on the tower were modelled through a simple drag equation applied to each of the 11 cylindrical tower elements the drag coefficient was assumed to be fixed table 3 but a power law with a wind shear exponent was applied to correct for the lower wind speeds affecting the lower tower sections all hydrodynamic time response computations were carried out for a total duration of 2000 s with incremental time steps of 0 05 s and the first 500 s which include the transient response of the numerical solution being ignored in the analysis of results the derived results only deviated by 1 when compared to those obtained when running the same simulations with a total duration of 1600 s 4 1 3 modelling environmental conditions table 6 summarises the environmental conditions modelled in the present study waves were modelled to be irregular in accordance to the pierson moskovitz spectrum faltinsen 2009 the selected significant wave height and period have a probability of exceedance of 1 28 under central mediterranean conditions and may thus be considered as a relatively severe wave state 4 4 bmt argoss met ocean database www bmtargoss com the same seed value for the irregular wave modelling was used in all computations the wind speed was assumed to be fixed and equal to the turbine rated wind speed at hub height under such conditions the axial thrust is at the peak value reached over the entire operational envelope of the turbine jonkman et al 2009 the presence of sea currents and wind wave misalignment was ignored 4 1 4 results and discussion fig 15 shows the mean position for the surge displacement of the turbine nacelle with respect to the equilibrium position for all the seven fowt spar design variants as predicted by the numerical model it is noted that this value is smaller for spars having larger drafts and a larger metacentric height gm the standard and maximum deviations of the surge position from the mean value are also displayed in fig 15 the values for spar 2 to spar 7 are smaller than the corresponding values for the reference fowt with no caes spar 1 the maximum pitch values are plotted in fig 16 it is evident that a larger draft lowers the maximum pitch angles experienced by the floating system it is predicted that the maximum pitch angle experienced by spars 4 5 and 6 is larger than that of the reference spar spar1 spar 4 which has the shortest spar draft is predicted to suffer from the largest pitch angle reaching a value of 8 on the other hand spar 2 which has a large draft is predicted to experience a maximum pitch angle that is lower than that being estimated for the reference system spar 1 platform pitching causes the rotor plane to be misaligned with respect to the wind the resulting effects are similar to those encountered when the rotor is yawed as a result of misalignment between the main rotor shaft and the direction of the wind flow these are normally characterised by a reduction in the power coefficient and higher levels of unsteadiness in the aerodynamic blade loads however such effects are generally negligible for misalignment angles less than 5 sant and cuschieri 2016 it should be noted that while caes integration may lead to lower motions to be experienced by the wind turbine the resulting increase in the spar mass and draft will require a more complex installation process it is also noted that although the draft and total mass of spar 2 and spar 7 are only marginally different the maximum pitch angle of spar 2 is considerably smaller this is due to the larger gm value and ballast mass of spar 2 fig 17 plots the standard deviation and the maximum deviation for the heave motion with respect to the heave position of the turbine when no waves are present spar 4 is predicted to experience the largest heave yet this is not in excess of 1 2 m figs 18 and 19 show that all spar options with integrated caes spar 2 to spar 7 are estimated to encounter a nacelle surge velocity and acceleration that are considerably lower than those for the reference fowt spar spar 1 the resulting rms and maximum froude krylov loads acting horizontally on the floating structure tend to be nearly equal for all spar variants fig 20 this is primarily because all modelled spars have the same diameter and in all cases the draft extends well below the sea depth range where largest wave excitation forces are encountered spars having a larger draft will exert a larger damping effect on thus excitation forces hence resulting in lower motions to be experienced by the wind turbine nacelle the values of the tension loads acting on the three spar moorings are plotted in figs 21 and 22 mooring line 1 denotes the upwind mooring line that is aligned with the wind flow and direction of wave propagation mooring line 2 is one of the two lines downwind of the turbine and aligned 60 with respect to the wind flow mooring line 1 will have to counteract the large axial thrust of the wind turbine as well as the hydrodynamic loads of the waves propagating downstream hence justifying why this line experiences significantly larger loads than in the case of mooring line 2 however it is observed that the predicted tensions in both lines do not differ significantly for the different spar geometries 5 conclusions the preliminary analysis presented in this study has shown the technical potential for integrating the proposed caes concept in spar type floating wind turbine structures to provide short term energy storage with capacities on the order of mwh while retaining a low compression ratio thereby to maintain higher efficiencies the study provides insight on how the floating structure may be optimised to integrate the proposed energy storage concept a major engineering challenge is the significant increase in the spar steel mass required to store compressed air the additional mass required is shown to increase non linearly with the peak pressure and energy storage capacity on the other hand it is noted that the increase in the spar mass and inertia in effect result in lower nacelle motion for the environmental conditions investigated in this study the allowable increase in cost to integrate caes may only be justified by potential increases in revenue by being able to extend the lifetime of the wind turbines as a result of reduced fatigue loads and higher revenues due to more favourable prices for electricity supplied to the grid with lower levels of intermittency the variation in the mass of compressed air within the spar between the pre charged and fully charged states is shown to be negligible when compared to the total mass of the spar hence the state of charge is not expected to influence the dynamic characteristics of the floating system however further research is required to explore the dynamic characteristics of the system over different wind and wave conditions further work should also involve more detailed analysis involving fully coupled aero hydro structural dynamic analyses using more complex simulation tools to account for unsteady rotor aerodynamics wind turbine blade and tower flexibility and appropriate control strategies the research should aim at design optimisation for minimising the spar steel weight for a given storage capacity while ensuring that the floating system is stable over a wide range of met ocean conditions the present study has ignored the role of the hydro static pressure in reducing the spar wall thickness requirements in deeper waters furthermore the thickness requirements of the spar for supporting the wind turbine and compressed air t st and t ca were treated in isolation detailed structural integrity analysis modelling the spar material stress resulting from the combined wind wave mooring and compressed air loading may identify opportunities for reducing the spar weight and associated costs acknowledgements this work is part

capacity and other caes parameters a parametric study is then carried out with this numerical model for the nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 this is followed by a preliminary structural dynamic analysis of different spar geometries when operating under irregular wave conditions 2 background 2 1 a floating spar type platform with integrated energy storage fig 1 shows the proposed caes concept integrated in a fowt spar type supporting platform it consists of two pressure vessels interconnected by a pneumatic umbilical the lower vessel is installed on the seabed while the floating spar serves as a larger second pressure vessel and keeps the fowt stable and afloat once the entire system is deployed at sea the pressure vessels are pre charged with compressed air to a pre set level excess energy from the wind turbine during periods of high wind speeds and low energy demand is used to operate a hydraulic machine in pump mode to inject deep sea water at high pressure into the lower pressure vessel consequently energy is stored in the form of compressed air with a uniform pressure maintained in both upper and lower pressure vessels during periods of high energy demand stored energy is released by operating the hydraulic machine in motor mode to power an electrical generator a thermodynamic analysis of the proposed energy storage concept has recently been presented by buhagiar and sant 2017 the study has shown that the overall thermal efficiency of the storage cycle was found to reach 95 when excluding losses associated with the hydraulic machine the concept presents a number of advantages increasing the volume of air by using the floater as a pneumatically interconnected pressure vessel reduces the pressure ratio of the air compression process required to achieve a desired energy storage capacity in reality this reduces the air temperature rise hence minimising thermal loses and improving the efficiency of each energy storage cycle compressing air hydraulically through a liquid piston reduces the physical dimensions of the machinery required given that hydraulic pumps and motors have a higher power to weight ratio compared to air compressors and turbines dedicating the floater support structure to also serve as a caes vessel may offer potential of cost reductions associated with the integration of caes in fowts locating the lower vessel below thermocline formations makes it possible to store cooler deep sea water with significant cooling potential this would effectively result in a net increase in renewable energy provision from offshore turbines buhagiar and sant 2014 spar type floating structures may be more readily adaptable for the proposed caes concept than semi subs and tlp platforms given that the large draft reduces the overall length of the pneumatic umbilical required a major challenge associated with the proposed concept is the additional mass of steel required for the floater to accommodate compressed air at high pressures this matter is investigated in the present study 3 methodology 3 1 the mathematical model this section describes a simple mathematical model designed to investigate the relation between the spar dimensions and thermodynamic parameters associated with the caes process the model has already been presented by sant et al 2017 for a tlp but is being adapted here for a spar type floating platform the model is based on an ideal isothermal compression expansion process with the air assumed to behave as a perfect gas under such conditions the energy storage capacity for given values of the internal volumes of the floating spar and sea bottom mounted vessel is given by 1 e p 2 v b ln v a v b v b 2 p 2 p 1 v a v b v b where p 1 is the pre charge or initial pressure of the system once the fowt is deployed at sea and v b is the net internal volume of the spar excluding that occupied by the ballast the internal volume of the pneumatic umbilical interconnecting the two pressure vessels fig 1 is ignored as this will be negligible in practice the main dimensions defining the buoyant spar when installed in still water are shown in fig 2 the total thickness of the spar cylindrical wall t sp is assumed to be composed of two sections t st which is the wall thickness required to support the wind turbine alone without the presence of compressed air and t ca which is the thickness required to accommodate compressed air only such that 3 t s p t s t t c a in accordance with thin cylinder theory the induced stress in the cylindrical wall resulting from compressed air is made up of two components the hoop stress σ h and the longitudinal stress σ l where 4a σ h p 2 d 2 t c a 4b σ l p 2 d 4 t c a using eq 4a and b in conjunction with the von mises theory for elastic failure which is typically applicable to ductile materials it can be shown that the additional thickness required for the spar cylindrical wall to be able to support compressed air at the maximum pressure p 2 is 5 t c a 3 f s p d 4 p 2 σ y the derivation of eq 5 is presented in sant et al 2017 in this simplified model a further assumption is that the end surfaces of the spar are flat with a total wall thickness of t sp in reality these end caps are spherical or quasi spherical in order to reduced material stresses induced by the air pressurisation process the total spar mass which in the present study is being assumed to consist of a hollow steel cylinder of uniform wall thickness tst tca may be expressed as 6 m s p ρ s p π 2 d t s t t c a d 2 h 2 where h 2 is the total height of the spar the above relation excludes the mass of concrete ballast fig 1 which is defined as 7 m s p b ρ c π d 2 h 4 4 meanwhile h 4 is the height of concrete ballast located at the lowest extremity of the spar internal volume fig 2 the mass of compressed air in the spar reaches a maximum value at pressure p 2 when the sea bottom pressure vessel is full of water under such conditions this mass may be approximated by applying the ideal thermodynamic gas equation 8 m c a p 2 v b r t the total mass of the entire floating system m tot includes the mass of the wind turbine the steel spar the ballast and compressed air 9 m t o t m f o w t m s p m s p b m c a in accordance with archimedes principle m tot should be equal to the mass of sea water displaced assuming static equilibrium under still water conditions and substituting eqs 6 8 into 9 it can be shown that the total height of the spar required to support both the fowt and the compressed air is 10 h 2 ρ s w h 3 4 m f o w t m s p b π d 2 d 3 2 f s p p 2 ρ s p σ y 2 ρ s p t s t d p 2 h 4 r t ρ s w p 2 1 r t 3 f s p ρ s p σ y 4 ρ s p t s d the required draft of the spar may simply be determined from the relation h 1 h 2 h 3 in this model the loads induced by the moorings on the floating structure are ignored 3 2 parametric analyses this section presents a parametric analysis to examine the relation between the various parameters defined in the simplified model described above it is assumed that an nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine is being supported jonkman et al 2009 the analysis evaluates how the spar requirements in particular the draft and mass deviate from that of a reference fowt spar that does not integrate energy storage for which p 1 p 2 0 bar and which has the characteristics similar to those of the oc3 design jonkman 2010 table 1 provides details of the reference spar while table 2 lists all parameters that were maintained constant throughout the parametric study the spar diameter was kept fixed at 9 4 m throughout the analysis the cog in table 1 denotes the centre of gravity location of the spar alone with reference to the mean sea level and along the spar centreline an iterative procedure was applied to solve eq 10 required to determine the spar dimensions and ballast mass m sp b for a given maximum compressed air pressure p 2 while ensuring that a desired value of the metacentric height gm for the entire floating system is achieved the determination of metacentre height was computed using a second equation normally used for simple stability analysis where the distance bm between the centre of buoyancy and the metacentre is equal to i v d for stability gm 0 the parametric study considered different maximum pressure values p 2 ranging from 0 to 80 bar with p 2 0 bar representing the reference spar without a caes system table 1 computations were repeated for three different values of gm namely for gm ref 0 7 gm ref and 0 4 gm ref where gm ref is the metacentric height of the fowt having the reference spar equal to 18 38 m it should be noted that gm denotes the metacentric height when no compressed air is present in the spar once the system is charged the mass of compressed air lowers the cog and increases the metacentric height 4 results figs 3 and 4 show the non linear dependency of the draft and volumetric displacement of the spar with the maximum operating compressed air pressure higher peak pressures call for increasing wall thicknesses of the spar hence also increasing the spar weight and buoyancy requirements the rate of increase in the spar draft and displacement also increases at higher peak pressure values this trend is observed for all selected metacentric heights however lower metacentric heights reduce the required spar draft and displacement this is primarily a consequence of the fact that a lower gm value reduces the ballast mass required hence also reducing the buoyancy needed to keep the entire system afloat the maximum allowable draft of the spar will have to be physically constrained by the sea depth it will also have to be limited by the need to keep the spar rigid for a given material yield strength and factor of safety f sp the spar wall thickness required to support compressed air increases linearly with pressure p 2 in accordance with eqs 3 and 5 the total thickness t sp increases linearly with the peak pressure and is independent of the metacentric height as may be observed in fig 5 at a pressure p 2 0 t sp is equal to the thickness of the reference fowt spar with no integrated storage the total thickness t st is equal to 0 045 m see table 1 the energy storage capacity also increases linearly with p 2 and is also independent of gm fig 6 on the other hand the pressure ratio r p of the caes compression process exhibits a linear decrease with increases in pressure p 2 fig 7 hence it can be concluded that higher peak pressures not only yield higher storage capacities but also result in higher storage efficiencies given that lower pressure ratios would in reality yield lower temperature increments during the air compression process yet this comes at the expense of lower specific energy storage values which in the present study is being defined as the energy storage capacity divided by the total mass of steel required to support compressed air taking into consideration both the mass of the floater and seabed mounted vessels refer to fig 8 reducing the metacentric height of the floating system results in larger compression ratios and an increase in specific energy storage values as may be noted in fig 9 the mass of compressed air in the spar is substantial reaching 1400 tonnes at a maximum operating pressure p 2 of 80 bar this is equivalent to 19 of the total mass of the reference fowt spar listed in table 1 reducing the design metacentric height reduces the mass of compressed air for a given storage capacity in mwh this is due to the smaller draft and volume of the spar it may also be observed that higher values of p 2 lead to a larger spar draft and mass lowering both the centre of buoyancy and the centre of gravity of the entire floating system and thus resulting in an increase in the metacentric height gm f consequently higher peak pressures also enhance the stability of the system see fig 10 fig 11 shows plots of the variation in the mass of compressed air within the spar between the pre charge and fully charged states i e when the sea bottom accumulator is empty and completely full of sea water respectively this variation is expressed as a percentage of the total mass of the floating system comprising the wind turbine assembly spar and the ballast it is observed that this variation does not exceed 1 consequently it may be assumed that the dynamic response characteristics of the floating structure are unaffected by the state of charge of the integrated compressed air storage system however this is only because the volume of the seabed mounted vessel v a is small compared to that of the spar hence resulting in lower operating pressure ratios for the air compression process the additional mass of steel of the spar for caes is quantified through the steel mass factor which is defined as the ratio of the steel mass of the spar at a selected pressure p 2 to that of the reference spar table 1 p 2 0 this factor increases significantly with p 2 for higher pressures but is shown to decrease for smaller design metacentric heights fig 12 the variation in the ballast mass is quantified through the ballast mass factor which in this case is the ballast required at a selected p 2 divided by that for the reference spar table 1 p 2 0 as observed from fig 13 the ballast required with compressed air integrated in the spar is not more than 1 42 times that of the baseline value although higher pressures lead to a reduction in ballast the overall spar weight still increases due to a significant increase in steel mass fig 14 shows the variation of the cost factor with p 2 this factor is defined as the overall cost of the spar structure taking into consideration the additional mass of steel and ballast to integrate caes divided by that for the reference spar the estimates shown in this figure are based on the assumption that the costs for steel and ballast are equal to euro 2 2 kg and euro 0 1 kg respectively it is observed that the cost of the spar structure increases significantly for caes integration increasing more than fivefold at p 2 80 bar the cost of a floating spar with no integrated storage is expected to cost around 20 of the entire capital costs of a floating wind farm james and costa ros 2015 this implies that doubling the cost of the floating spar to integrate caes would approximately lead to a 20 increase in the capital cost of the farm on the other hand a five fold increase in the spar cost would nearly double the overall wind farm cost 4 1 modelling the structural dynamic response this section describes an analysis to evaluate the influence of caes integration on the dynamic response characteristics of the fowt structure in depth dynamic response studies of spar type structures for wind energy applications has been documented in many literature sources such as for instance jonkman 2010 jeon et al 2013 sethuraman and venugopal 2013 karimirad and moan 2012 however only a preliminary evaluation is being presented here in order to provide insight of the effect of the added structural material for caes integration on the motion of the fowt 4 1 1 design variants the analysis was carried out using ansys aqwa 2 2 ansys academic research release 17 0 ansys inc seven different fowt structures were simulated with each design variant having a different spar geometry established in accordance with the numerical model described in section 3 1 all design variants had the common parameters listed in tables 2 and 3 the mooring system parameters which were also common to all variants are presented in table 4 parameters differentiating between the seven spar designs are shown in table 5 spar 1 denotes the reference fowt with no caes and having the parameters listed in table 1 spar 2 to spar 4 have a common peak operating pressure equal to 40 bar and an energy storage capacity of around 1 5 mwh but different values for the draft and metacentric height spar 5 to spar 7 have an increasing peak operating pressure and storage capacity up to 70 bar and 2 71 mwh respectively it was ensured that the metacentric height of each spar design was also positive when no compressed air is present this is an essential requirement to ensure that the entire floating structure is stable during the deployment process 4 1 2 the numerical model each spar was modelled in ansys aqwa as a thin surface body with the hydrodynamic wave diffraction and radiative loads computed using the panel method details about this approach may be found in ansys aqwa theory manual the entire spar surface was discretized into a fixed number of panels with the size of each panel not exceeding 1 2 m given that this method is based on the potential flow theory it is only applicable to inviscid and unseparated flows around the spar it was therefore ensured that the kueleger carpenter parameter along the spar did not exceed 2 faltinsen 2009 the entire floating structure was modelled to be rigid and the flexibility of the wind turbine and the spar were ignored a lumped mass model was used to represent the mass inertia and cog locations for the rotor nacelle assembly rna assembly turbine tower spar steel cylinder ballast and compressed air the rna was modelled as a single point mass at the elevation given in table 3 and the mass and inertias values of the nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 were applied the tower was represented using 11 nodal elements with the mass and inertia values prescribed at each node a non linear catenary model was selected for the three mooring lines the lines were assumed to have uniform characteristics throughout in the dynamic model for the moorings the lines were discretized into 100 elements in all simulations the presence of the pneumatic umbilical fig 1 was ignored as its diameter typically 0 2 m is too small to have an appreciable effect on the dynamic behaviour of the system the aerodynamic axial thrust induced by the wind turbine rotor on the floating structure was simply represented as a point force at the tower top and moving with the structure this was computed using gh bladed 3 3 gl garrard hassan bladed ver 4 4 0 67 st vincent works silverthorne lane bristol bs2 0qd england for a turbine with a fixed base the influence of unsteady aerodynamic phenomena resulting from the stochastic behaviour of the wind and the wave induced spar motions was ignored wind loads on the tower were modelled through a simple drag equation applied to each of the 11 cylindrical tower elements the drag coefficient was assumed to be fixed table 3 but a power law with a wind shear exponent was applied to correct for the lower wind speeds affecting the lower tower sections all hydrodynamic time response computations were carried out for a total duration of 2000 s with incremental time steps of 0 05 s and the first 500 s which include the transient response of the numerical solution being ignored in the analysis of results the derived results only deviated by 1 when compared to those obtained when running the same simulations with a total duration of 1600 s 4 1 3 modelling environmental conditions table 6 summarises the environmental conditions modelled in the present study waves were modelled to be irregular in accordance to the pierson moskovitz spectrum faltinsen 2009 the selected significant wave height and period have a probability of exceedance of 1 28 under central mediterranean conditions and may thus be considered as a relatively severe wave state 4 4 bmt argoss met ocean database www bmtargoss com the same seed value for the irregular wave modelling was used in all computations the wind speed was assumed to be fixed and equal to the turbine rated wind speed at hub height under such conditions the axial thrust is at the peak value reached over the entire operational envelope of the turbine jonkman et al 2009 the presence of sea currents and wind wave misalignment was ignored 4 1 4 results and discussion fig 15 shows the mean position for the surge displacement of the turbine nacelle with respect to the equilibrium position for all the seven fowt spar design variants as predicted by the numerical model it is noted that this value is smaller for spars having larger drafts and a larger metacentric height gm the standard and maximum deviations of the surge position from the mean value are also displayed in fig 15 the values for spar 2 to spar 7 are smaller than the corresponding values for the reference fowt with no caes spar 1 the maximum pitch values are plotted in fig 16 it is evident that a larger draft lowers the maximum pitch angles experienced by the floating system it is predicted that the maximum pitch angle experienced by spars 4 5 and 6 is larger than that of the reference spar spar1 spar 4 which has the shortest spar draft is predicted to suffer from the largest pitch angle reaching a value of 8 on the other hand spar 2 which has a large draft is predicted to experience a maximum pitch angle that is lower than that being estimated for the reference system spar 1 platform pitching causes the rotor plane to be misaligned with respect to the wind the resulting effects are similar to those encountered when the rotor is yawed as a result of misalignment between the main rotor shaft and the direction of the wind flow these are normally characterised by a reduction in the power coefficient and higher levels of unsteadiness in the aerodynamic blade loads however such effects are generally negligible for misalignment angles less than 5 sant and cuschieri 2016 it should be noted that while caes integration may lead to lower motions to be experienced by the wind turbine the resulting increase in the spar mass and draft will require a more complex installation process it is also noted that although the draft and total mass of spar 2 and spar 7 are only marginally different the maximum pitch angle of spar 2 is considerably smaller this is due to the larger gm value and ballast mass of spar 2 fig 17 plots the standard deviation and the maximum deviation for the heave motion with respect to the heave position of the turbine when no waves are present spar 4 is predicted to experience the largest heave yet this is not in excess of 1 2 m figs 18 and 19 show that all spar options with integrated caes spar 2 to spar 7 are estimated to encounter a nacelle surge velocity and acceleration that are considerably lower than those for the reference fowt spar spar 1 the resulting rms and maximum froude krylov loads acting horizontally on the floating structure tend to be nearly equal for all spar variants fig 20 this is primarily because all modelled spars have the same diameter and in all cases the draft extends well below the sea depth range where largest wave excitation forces are encountered spars having a larger draft will exert a larger damping effect on thus excitation forces hence resulting in lower motions to be experienced by the wind turbine nacelle the values of the tension loads acting on the three spar moorings are plotted in figs 21 and 22 mooring line 1 denotes the upwind mooring line that is aligned with the wind flow and direction of wave propagation mooring line 2 is one of the two lines downwind of the turbine and aligned 60 with respect to the wind flow mooring line 1 will have to counteract the large axial thrust of the wind turbine as well as the hydrodynamic loads of the waves propagating downstream hence justifying why this line experiences significantly larger loads than in the case of mooring line 2 however it is observed that the predicted tensions in both lines do not differ significantly for the different spar geometries 5 conclusions the preliminary analysis presented in this study has shown the technical potential for integrating the proposed caes concept in spar type floating wind turbine structures to provide short term energy storage with capacities on the order of mwh while retaining a low compression ratio thereby to maintain higher efficiencies the study provides insight on how the floating structure may be optimised to integrate the proposed energy storage concept a major engineering challenge is the significant increase in the spar steel mass required to store compressed air the additional mass required is shown to increase non linearly with the peak pressure and energy storage capacity on the other hand it is noted that the increase in the spar mass and inertia in effect result in lower nacelle motion for the environmental conditions investigated in this study the allowable increase in cost to integrate caes may only be justified by potential increases in revenue by being able to extend the lifetime of the wind turbines as a result of reduced fatigue loads and higher revenues due to more favourable prices for electricity supplied to the grid with lower levels of intermittency the variation in the mass of compressed air within the spar between the pre charged and fully charged states is shown to be negligible when compared to the total mass of the spar hence the state of charge is not expected to influence the dynamic characteristics of the floating system however further research is required to explore the dynamic characteristics of the system over different wind and wave conditions further work should also involve more detailed analysis involving fully coupled aero hydro structural dynamic analyses using more complex simulation tools to account for unsteady rotor aerodynamics wind turbine blade and tower flexibility and appropriate control strategies the research should aim at design optimisation for minimising the spar steel weight for a given storage capacity while ensuring that the floating system is stable over a wide range of met ocean conditions the present study has ignored the role of the hydro static pressure in reducing the spar wall thickness requirements in deeper waters furthermore the thickness requirements of the spar for supporting the wind turbine and compressed air t st and t ca were treated in isolation detailed structural integrity analysis modelling the spar material stress resulting from the combined wind wave mooring and compressed air loading may identify opportunities for reducing the spar weight and associated costs acknowledgements this work is part

otto nielsens veg 10 trondheim 7491 norway marine autonomous surface ships mass are tested in public waters a requirement for mass to be operated is that they should be at least as safe as conventional ships hence this paper investigates how far the current ship risk models for ship ship collision ship structure collision and groundings are applicable for risk assessment of mass nine criteria derived from a systems engineering approach are used to assess relevant ship risk models these criteria aim at assessing relevant considerations for the operation of mass such as technical reliability software performance human machine interfaces operating and several aspects of communication from 64 assessed models published since 2005 ten fulfilled six or more of these criteria these models were investigated more closely none of them are suitable to be directly used for risk assessment of mass however they can be used as basis for developing relevant risk models for mass which especially need to consider the aspects of software and control algorithms and human machine interaction keywords marine autonomous surface ship autonomous vessel collision risk allision risk grounding risk 1 introduction marine autonomous surface ships mass are becoming increasingly interesting for the commercial maritime sector as an alternative to conventional ships several research projects have investigated mass concepts e g revolt dnv gl 2015 maritime unmanned navigation through intelligence in networks munin 2012 advanced autonomous waterborne applications 2016 norway announced the first field test area for mass which is shared with public marine traffic norwegian maritime authority 2016 the first autonomous cargo ship is supposed to be in operation by fall 2018 kongsberg maritime 2017 a mass may be low manned or unmanned rødseth and nordahl 2017 which creates challenges in operation the mass will influence risk in relation to several marine stakeholders the environment and the mass itself collisions and groundings contribute most to the risk level for conventional ships pedersen 2010 the mass will be equipped with collision avoidance systems and sensory equipment for safe operation moreover the mass should at least be as safe as conventional ships advanced autonomous waterborne applications 2016 nautilus federation 2018 pedersen 2010 to be acceptable for use in public ocean space risk assessments serve to demonstrate a certain level of risk and are an important tool for making relevant design decisions rausand 2011 wróbel et al 2017 assessed the effect of unmanned vessels and conclude that masss will reduce the collision frequency while the severity of consequences might increase due to the reduced recovery capability hence risk models integrating technical human and organizational factors are needed that reflect the operation of mass the danish maritime authority 2018 has suggested adapting the international regulations such that mass shall be developed following a goal and risk based regulatory approach autonomous underwater vehicles auv have been in the focus of risk research such as risk management frameworks brito et al 2012 thieme et al 2015a and risk assessments brito and griffiths 2016 brito et al 2010 griffiths and brito 2008 thieme and utne 2017 thieme et al 2015b for mass less research has been conducted rødseth and burmeister 2015b and rødseth and tjora 2014 analyzed and presented the risk based design methodology applied in the munin project munin 2012 which is based on the formal safety assessment fsa process of the international maritime organization imo 2002 the qualitative and quantitative analyses including considerations of risk of the munin project were summarized by kretschmann et al 2015a b the detailed analysis of the munin project was presented by jensen 2015 section 4 in the advanced autonomous waterborne applications 2016 white paper summarizes safety and security considerations and associated challenges for the development of mass wrobel et al 2016 presented a bayesian belief network bbn for assessing accidents for unmanned ships based on the mutual influence of different risk factors wróbel et al 2018 developed a safety control structure model of mass it is analyzed with the system theoretic process analysis stpa to identify possible scenarios where control structures may become inadequate both articles address the uncertainty in relation to mass their operation and risk which makes it difficult to develop a generic and comprehensive risk model for mass the present article reviews selected grounding and collision risk models to identify practices and modelling approaches that may be applicable for risk modelling of mass it attempts to assess whether current collision and grounding risk models or parts of these can capture the unique aspects of mass operation a risk model for mass operation needs to assess the level of risk for example the probability of ship collision the systems engineering process is used to identify criteria which reflect aspects that should be represented in a risk model for mass the purpose is to identify potential gaps and focus areas that need to be especially addressed by new risk models developed for mass further this article focuses on operation of mass i e during transit in the oceans and seas including vessel approaching ports or offshore installations vessels that are not in transit which carry out specific tasks and operations e g fishing vessels offshore vessels moored or in dynamic positioning mode research vessels military vessels and other special purpose vessels are excluded furthermore security aspects are disregarded i e the possibility of willful collision or grounding current international maritime legislation such as the united nations convention of the law of the seas unclos 1982 is not adapted to the advent of mass this aspect is disregarded in this article assuming that conventional vessels and mass are treated alike models for detailed consequence analysis as part of risk assessment are not considered only limited information on mass concepts is available to limit the scope of this article only risk models that were developed since 2005 are considered in the article the selected risk models assess the probability of ships colliding stranding and or grounding a recent literature review by lim et al 2018 on maritime risk models summarizes the model types modelling methods and research contributions lim et al 2018 identified future research directions in the maritime risk and security domain for conventional ships this current article is different from lim et al s 2018 because this current article assesses possible modelling approaches from current risk models for conventional ships to mass the next section presents the background and definitions this is followed by the methodology the criteria for the assessment of the risk models are identified in the section thereafter the results section presents the findings and identifies gaps in the risk models that need to be addressed in future risk models for mass the models and approaches that are relevant for mass are discussed in section 6 this is followed by concluding remarks and an outlook on further work 2 background risk models for ships are used to assess the risk arising from ship traffic during ship operation or for a marine area goerlandt and montewka 2015 reviewed the use of risk definitions and quantification of risk of published maritime risk models in many cases these models do not state the risk definition or risk measure a clear definition of the concept of risk and other related terms is necessary to clearly describe communicate and manage risk aven and zio 2014 in addition the international maritime organization imo 2002 defines risk for the framework of fsa as the combination of the frequency and the severity of the consequence moreover sn iso guide 73 2009 defines risk as the effect of uncertainty on objectives whereas the effect can be positive or negative considering mass such a risk definition might be more suitable due to the expected uncertainties regarding the technical solutions operation and environment 2 1 autonomy and marine autonomous surface ships autonomous systems may have different levels of autonomy loa autonomy is a system s ability to make independent decisions from a supervising agent and execute these decisions vagia et al 2016 for conventional marine vessels the supervising operators are the crew for mass only one or a few operators will take a supervising role and intervene when necessary this is described in more detail in section 2 2 the loa describes the degree of this ability to make independent decisions vagia et al 2016 typically applied loa scales are presented by sheridan and verplank 1978 or endsley and kaber 1999 comprehensive reviews are provided by insaurralde 2012 or vagia et al 2016 rødseth and nordahl 2017 and utne et al 2017 defined each specific scale for mass with four levels these scales define the decision authority and the tasks that the human operators and the autonomous system carry out implicitly affecting risk in this case the term tasks refers to information acquisition information analysis decision selection and action implementation parasuraman et al 2000 in the lowest loa i e manual control endsley and kaber 1999 vagia et al 2016 the human operator does everything and the autonomous system does not assist in intermediate loas the autonomous system and the operators cooperate endsley and kaber 1999 rødseth and nordahl 2017 utne et al 2017 in the highest loa full autonomy the human operator has no possibility to intervene with the system endsley and kaber 1999 rødseth and nordahl 2017 sheridan and verplank 1978 utne et al 2017 this is not likely for mass at least in the near future autonomy and automation are used often interchangeably although different aspects are included in the concepts vagia et al 2016 the term autonomy will be solely used in this article an autonomous system capable of changing the loa according to the circumstances is designed with adaptive autonomy sheridan 2011 2 2 operation of conventional versus autonomous ships no formal definition of a conventional ship exists the unclos 1982 does not define a ship or vessel danish maritime authority 2018 therefore information on common practices is used a ship or vessel has a crew for the engine department the bridge the deck department and stewards the crew level of a cargo ship ranges between ten and 21 people curley 2012 the master of a vessel has the responsibility for the vessel its safety personnel cargo and passengers the master has the aboard decision authority the master acts as a communication point between the shipping company crew and other actors norwegian shipowners association 2003 the bridge crew is responsible for navigation and control over the ship moreover unclos 1982 requires a lookout at all times according to the conditions and that communication via radio is maintained the bridge must be staffed according to weather and visibility conditions a voyage plan must be determined and approved by the master before the vessel sets sail norwegian shipowners association 2003 unclos 1982 the chief officer is responsible for the navigation and is second in command mates and able sea folk act as lookouts the deck crew handles the cargo and loads and offloads the vessel norwegian shipowners association 2003 the stewards are responsible for crew well being the engine department is responsible for supervision and preventive and corrective maintenance of the machinery curley 2012 the chief engineer is responsible for the engine department norwegian shipowners association 2003 rødseth and burmeister 2015a and advanced autonomous waterborne applications 2016 showed that there will be several technical solutions for mass the mass need to be designed for their purpose with different performances advantages and disadvantages three main concepts of operation of autonomous ships can be differentiated i mass with low manning bertram 2016 ii master slave supervision bertram 2016 and iii shore control center scc supervised masss munin 2012 rødseth and nordahl 2017 rødseth et al 2014 the main difference in these concepts is the location of the operators or supervisors since none of these concepts are fully autonomous current concepts rely on an operator with decision authority supervising the mass the operational concepts can only be described superficially since they depend on the size and purpose of the vessel advanced autonomous waterborne applications 2016 the three concepts mentioned above all have a control system of the mass that collects information on the environment analyses it makes decisions based on these analyses and acts accordingly the mass needs to be able to sense the environment through machine vision and sensor fusion for example advanced autonomous waterborne applications 2016 bertram 2016 the operators have a supervisory role during voyages and can take control of the mass when necessary e g if several obstacles are detected in dense traffic or during port approach the operators also handle necessary radio communications with other vessels or vessel traffic service vts the mass with low manning i are an intermediate solution during the transition period to autonomous vessels that are unmanned bertram 2016 kongsberg maritime 2017 the crew on board a vessel is then reduced in comparison to conventional shipping the crew can perform necessary maintenance and take control of the mass if necessary the mass will be mostly in autonomous mode and does not require operator input in the master slave supervision system ii one manned vessel supervises several unmanned vessels all vessels travel together and the crew of the manned vessel can take control of the unmanned vessels if necessary near ports pilots and tug boats might assist the vessels bertram 2016 maintenance of components is in this concept rather limited during the voyage and advanced monitoring systems are needed a scc supervised mass iii configuration munin 2012 rødseth and nordahl 2017 rødseth et al 2014 is not manned during voyage and is remotely supervised from a land based scc the scc communicates with the mass through satellites or through radio based systems when the mass is near the shore the munin project envisions that for entering ports a crew boards the vessel and takes manual control over the vessel rødseth et al 2014 the revolt concept envisions low aid needed through adapted port design and new docking technology tvete 2015 since mass that are supervised by a scc are mainly unmanned the opportunities for maintenance are limited preventive and corrective maintenance can only be executed during port time or dry docking rødseth and burmeister 2015a this demands a highly reliable system and proactive condition monitoring that identifies incipient failures bertram 2016 argued that conventional diesel engines might not be suited for unmanned shipping since they need frequent maintenance new concepts such as hydrogen or battery driven propulsion are needed bertram 2016 tvete 2015 3 method 3 1 selection of risk models this article considers only models developed since 2005 the mass concept has received increased attention in recent years due to technical availability and expected financial feasibility only models that assess the risk associated with collisions allisions or grounding are considered allisions are ship structure collisions hassel 2017 hassel et al 2017 the scopus 1 1 www scopus com accessed on nov 3 2017 database was searched for the keywords ship or vessel and collision model ship or vessel and allision and ship or vessel and grounding or stranding model the search was conducted on november 3 2017 additionally publications referenced in the literature were included if possible additional references were found in work by goerlandt and montewka 2015 one master thesis and one doctoral thesis were included that were not listed in scopus or by goerlandt and montewka 2015 jensen 2015 and hassel 2017 three publications that address mass are included these are jensen 2015 wrobel et al 2016 and wróbel et al 2018 models that do not give enough information on how the frequency or probability were assessed have been excluded in accordance with the scope models covering inland waterways rivers or arctic areas have been excluded such as those by almaz 2012 or zhang et al 2013 similarly valdez banda et al 2015 presented a model for risk assessment in ice operation which resembles a special operation johansson and molitor 2011 presented a risk assessment for the baltic sea reusing existing models and software goerlandt et al 2012 presented a holistic risk assessment based on previously defined risk models by hänninen and kujala 2010 and goerlandt and kujala 2011 these three models are assessed as one model in the analysis since they build upon each other 3 2 development of assessment criteria to identify suitable and relevant criteria for assessing the existing risk models a systems engineering approach is employed first the problem and the desired systems are described i e the mass operation this is the first phase of a systems engineering process blanchard 2008 in the second step system requirements are described and functional needs with respect to safety are identified typical questions answered in the requirement identification are as follows blanchard 2008 1 what is required from the system stated in functional terms 2 what specific functions must the system accomplish 3 what are the primary functions to be accomplished 4 what are secondary functions to be accomplished 5 what must be accomplished to completely alleviate the stated deficiency 6 why must these functions be accomplished 7 when must these functions be accomplished 8 where is this to be accomplished and for how long 9 how many times must these functions be accomplished not all of these questions can be answered in this article however they are used as guidelines for the identification of the needs and requirements for mass these give input to the identification of suitable assessment criteria 3 3 assessment procedure the identified relevant ship risk models are categorized according to their approach to risk assessment the approaches are generally discussed for their applicability and possible further use for mass the identified models are assessed against the criteria from table 2 in section 4 2 the models that fulfil most of the criteria are further analyzed in section 6 models that fulfill several criteria are assumed to reflect a high level of detailed modeling of the interaction between the risk relevant modelling aspects summarized in the criteria the suitability of the models and possible learnings from these are highlighted this does not imply that the models may be used as they are but they may be used as basis for developing mass specific risk models 4 evaluation criteria 4 1 functional requirements with respect to risk the main function of mass is to transport goods or people from one port to another this is the same main function as for conventional ships the transport needs to be safe cost efficient and reliable the main difference between mass and conventional ships is the reduced crew which may have implications for the design of the vessels safety related functions currently executed by the crew must be carried out by the mass and its subsystems the functions in relation to safety are situational awareness of the environment and the surroundings of the vessel which is the task of the lookout and the purpose of the navigational systems e g radar on a conventional vessel a more detailed functional analysis and description for autonomous ships can be found in the work by rødseth and nordahl 2017 table 1 summarizes the requirements for mass that follow from the description in the previous section the mass should identify obstacles and potential hazards and react appropriately in a timely manner r1 sensors computers and actuators need to execute these functions in a reliable manner and they need to be available during the voyage the opportunities for maintenance and repairs are limited the mass need to be reliable with respect to sensor systems machinery and the control system to achieve their mission goals r2 the software side and algorithms need to be robust and verification of their safe performance is desirable r3 due to the natural differences between software and hardware different methods for risk assessment of these are needed leveson 2011 current concepts for mass i to iii still rely on human operators to some degree partly on board the mass they supervise the mass adapt the mission plan or take over control if necessary concepts ii and iii require that reliable communication lines with sufficient transmission capacity exist between the mass and the operators such that safe operation is possible r4 there is need for suitable provisions for a crew since it might be necessary to board the ship for berthing munin 2012 rødseth and nordahl 2017 two more types of communication need to be considered reliable and adequate communication among the crew operators in the ssc or on board a low manned vessel in situations that require the human operators to intervene r5 and communication between mass operators and other ships or vts r6 both types of communication need to be unambiguous and goal oriented to ensure safe operation the mass should be easily accessible for the operators through the provided user interfaces r7 the operators need to be able to assess the present situation quickly to develop a good situation awareness and be able to reason about necessary actions hence human machine interfaces hmi need to be optimized for usability and accessibility in cases in which the operators take control of the mass the loa will change which is called adaptive autonomy r8 the system and operators must be able to adapt quickly to the new operational mode with a different loa 4 2 evaluation criteria based on the previously identified requirements cf table 1 the criteria for evaluating the risk models are derived the criteria reflect the needs of a mass i e what aspects a ship risk model should cover to be suitable for mass table 2 summarizes the identified criteria for risk model evaluation it is not possible to rank the importance of these criteria since each criterion covers important aspects of risk modelling for mass that need to be included in a risk model criterion 1 summarizes the main difference between mass and conventional ships mass operation will to a large degree depend on software functionality autonomous functions control algorithms and other software aspects that are failing influence risk mass operation may require a substantial amount of interaction between the mass and its operators during parts of the voyage therefore it is necessary to consider the hmi and the operators interaction with the hmi c2 communication is also an important aspect in the cooperation and interaction between actors the operators of one vessel mainly concepts i and ii need to communicate to detect and resolve hazardous situations c3 criterion 4 investigates remote communication with the shore base conventional vessels should receive substantial support from the shore organization norwegian shipowners association 2003 which requires robust communication lines with the scc the mass may be monitored from a scc concept iii which requires that remote connections are considered the mass operating with concepts i and ii might have less contact with the scc mass may be unmanned and it may not be possible to perform maintenance immediately when necessary this is especially true for long voyages hence the system reliability and maintenance c5 and backup solutions in case of failure of a sub system through functional redundancy c6 are important a risk model should consider functional redundancies that were introduced in the system to reflect the risk level accurately the mass will employ several sensor systems to create a holistic operational picture via for example sensor fusion criterion 7 aims at the assessment of the models with respect to different operational modes and loa such as piloted auto piloted manual control or autonomous voyage consideration of the operational mode is necessary since the operators interaction with the vessel and the performance of the vessel itself will change the vessel navigation will vary in these modes criterion 8 assesses whether the risk models consider communication between the vessel crew and other marine participants such as other ships or manned structures criterion 9 assesses whether the risk models include considerations of personnel e g different manning levels different roles on board the ship and operating the vessel this is closely connected to the operational mode and loa c1 and communication aspect between operators c4 the crew level c9 dependends on the operational concept and may not be relevant for complete unmanned systems however it is important for low manned or partially unmanned systems 5 results table 3 summarizes the 64 reviewed models with the following information accident type object of analysis model aim modeling methods model parameters and data sources with respect to the type of accident 14 models cover collision and grounding seven models focus on grounding or stranding seven models 28 models cover ship ship collision and nine models cover allision three models include both ship ship collision and allision the object of analysis refers to the target of the risk assessment these are general maritime transportation systems referring to any of the following systems certain ship types or specific waterways most reviewed models aim at risk assessment for a certain region or waterway 43 six models aim at a specific ship type in a waterway e g ferries in a harbor area m1 or specific oil tanker traffic areas m12 m25 and m47 models for specific vessels are presented for generic maritime transportation systems m7 m15 and m51 for general cargo ships m23 and m36 and autonomous vessels m45 m57 m64 the models addressing mass are described and discussed in more detail in section 5 most models aim to assess the risk level in a waterway and assess the effect of risk reducing measures such as adapted traffic schemes and patterns some of these consider the change of the risk level through obstructions or structures such as anchoring vessels m36 bridges and structures m4 m16 m46 and m62 offshore oil and gas platforms m38 m44 and m60 or wind parks m30 and m35 only one model aims at the risk assessment of an mass on a certain route assessing the potential encounter frequency and probability of collision m45 the most commonly used modeling techniques and assessment approaches used in the risk models are geometric models 35 models bbns 24 models and simulations 18 models less used methods include the analytical hierarchy process ahp one model bayesian theorem calculations three models fuzzy inference six models event tree analysis eta three models failure mode and effect analysis fmea one model fault tree analysis fta 7 models regression modeling one model and stpa for detailed description of these methods the reader is referred to the respective literature data sources refer to the input for modeling and quantification of the models most models use historical data 48 models expert judgment 31 models published data 30 models or a combination of these few models are not quantified due to their generic nature or the modelling approach m15 m57 and m64 historical data includes information obtained through automatic identification system ais data vts or other records of shipping information expert judgment refers to parameters or probabilities that have been assessed and elicited by domain experts in this case published data refer to data on human and technical reliability found in the literature and the accepted values for the aforementioned causation probability eleven models primarily use accident data to assess the risk level which is collected from accident and incident databases and reports such models are not yet directly applicable for mass since they will be operated differently and rely on different technical solutions only six models use discretized real time information to assess the current level of risk the next sections categorize the models similar to the groups in li et al 2012 who reviewed ship risk models the focus of the next sections is to generally describe the model types and assess their suitability for mass generally 5 1 modelling categories 5 1 1 models for assessing the risk in waterways collision and grounding risk models for waterways are often based on geometric models the probability of an accident p is derived through the multiplication of two parameters the probability to encounter a vessel that will result in a collision if no avoiding measures are taken p a and the causation probability p c which represents the probability that no evasive maneuver is taken fujii and shiobara 1971 macduff 1974 1 p p a p c the encounter probability is in most cases based on the geometrical traffic distribution in the fairway the overlap between different fairways is used to find p a for head on collisions for overtaking or crossing collisions similar considerations have been presented a summary of possible methods for calculating the encounter probability can be found for example in kristiansen 2005 or li et al 2012 the grounding frequency can be determined similarly for coastal areas or areas with shallow water the ship traffic density can be determined and multiplied with a causation probability pedersen 2010 this is based on the considerations of macduff 1974 and fujii et al 1974 one differentiates between powered groundings and drift groundings mazaheri et al 2014 the causation probability summarizes considerations of vessel maneuverability crew equipment etc pedersen 2010 the probability is often determined through bbn eta or fta or a combination of these these methods will not be explained further both the encounter probability and causation probability may be derived from historical data on the traffic distribution in an area and the available accident data models that fall in this category are m3 m5 m11 m16 m18 m26 m27 m30 m32 m34 m37 m41 m46 m48 m61 and m62 these models aim mostly at assessing the average risk in a waterway they enable analysts to suggest regulatory measures for reducing the level of risk hence these kind of models are not applicable to determine the level of risk of mass since mass are not yet an integral part of the maritime traffic in the future these types of models need to account for mass 5 1 2 causation probability models some publications present only a model for the causation probability once a vessel is on collision course these models employ mostly bbn eta and fta the models aim in many cases at one ship type a specific fleet or a specific ship some address specific factors such as fatigue m36 human operator performance m12 or operation in arctic areas m63 models that fall in this category are m7 m12 m15 m36 m38 m40 m42 m51 m52 m56 m58 m60 and m63 where m7 and m15 are generic frameworks for risk modelling of maritime transport systems these models may provide some basis for risk modelling of mass since they model certain risk aspects with a high level of detail however the focus of the models may not always be adequate 5 1 3 simulation approaches to determine the encounter probability and consequently the accident risk simulations may be used these models frequently use a causation probability which is derived through bbn eta and fta however not all models used for deriving the causation probability are presented by the literature the simulations use ais data and other ship traffic data to simulate the paths of ships and identify potential collision candidates simulations may also be used to assess the allision risk or the grounding risk the models are useful when areas with regular sea traffic shall be assessed such as harbor areas ferry or tanker traffic models that use simulations are m1 m6 m8 m13 m14 m19 m20 m22 m24 m25 m28 m29 m33 m35 m47 m49 m54 and m59 simulations in general may be useful to model the risk of mass operation especially for mass being employed in route traffic it seems to be a promising tool characteristics of the mass can be modeled and the behavior of the control software may be implemented particular traffic operating on the mass route may be assessed and critical situations identified 5 1 4 real time decision support several models and approaches have been developed to give real time decision support to ship navigators and vts operators these approaches use underlying risk models in combination with calculation of the nearest point of approach to identify possible collision candidates models in this category are m9 m10 m21 m23 m44 m50 m55 and m61 these models may provide information to operators however they are not suitable for direct risk assessment for mass such models do generally not model the ship in detail since the focus lies on the surrounding vessels 5 1 5 other risk assessment approaches hu et al 2007 m2 used a fuzzy logic approach to the risk assessment of waterways this may address uncertainties and probability ranges of scenarios however the model aims at specific waterways and hence their specific work has little relevance for mass fuzzy logic though may be used to address the uncertainties in risk assessment of mass zaman et al 2014 used a combination of fmea and fuzzy logic to address the risk assessment of the strait of malaga they identify hazards for the strait and assess the magnitude of risk contribution hence the knowledge gained from the model has few implications for mass however the method may support the design of mass nivolianitou et al 2016 presented a bbn for assessing the risk of ships passing an area the assessment is based on accidents statistics using characteristics of vessels that have been involved in accidents such an approach is not suitable for risk assessment of mass since it is reactive and based on the accident statistics which do not exist for mass wróbel et al 2018 m64 developed a stpa model to identify possible system hazards the use of stpa reveals where control through additional measures and functionalities is needed to prevent the manifestation of hazards and consequently accidents this model is further described in section 6 5 2 parameters in the assessed ship risk models this section provides an overview of parameters that have been used in the models this corresponds to the second to last column in table 3 this description forms the basis for the assessment of the models against the criteria outlined previously each model considers several parameters that influence the probability of an accident however the number of parameters that are considered varies from model to model some models only consider a few vessel and fairway parameters while others consider and describe in detail technical human environmental and organizational factors that are considered thus table 3 contains a summary of parameters that have been included in the different models to give a comprehensive and comparable overview of the models these parameters are used to assess the models against the identified criteria traffic flow relates to the distribution of ship traffic over identified shipping lanes the ship traffic is often gaussian distributed it contains information on the number of vessels passing a certain area their trajectories and speed some models consider seasonal daily and hourly variations of the traffic flow the traffic flow is often associated with the vessel traffic characteristics these are the parameters of the vessels such as ship type length width and draught fairway characteristics refers to the dimensions of the waterway in question in which the traffic is traveling these are the length width and depth of the waterway and the spatial distribution of these several models split the fairway into several smaller segments to linearize meandering waterways geometric models make use of most of these parameters to be concise environmental technical human and organizational factors that were similarly mentioned are presented in a summarized description in table 3 for example if human error was mentioned several times with respect to similar tasks e g lookout this is summarized as human error to avoid excessive repetition crew characteristics are used if several human and organizational factors were included e g training competence experience stress alcohol consumption tiredness fatigue etc with respect to environmental factors weather describes the atmospheric environment the sea state describes waves and currents with the associated directions visibility is mentioned as a separate factor although dependent on weather the reviewed models cover different levels of technical factors some models include failure of subsystems e g propulsion or navigational aid failure other models include very detailed failures e g radar failure table 3 attempts to reflect these differences 5 3 evaluation against the criteria table 4 shows the results of the model evaluation against the criteria four models had insufficient information to assess all criteria this is indicated in the table some models were assessed as partly fulfilling the criteria c1 c2 c5 c6 c7 and c8 this was the case in which models included considerations similar to the ones in the criteria however not enough information was presented to assure that these criteria are met criterion 1 is fulfilled by 21 models through failure of navigation aids however this is not a very detailed analysis of software systems one model m42 was assessed as partly fulfilling the criterion since technical reliability was mentioned as a factor however it was not clear if this referred also to hardware and software reliability to assess c2 the models were checked for human error and associated ergonomic considerations such as navigational aid failure 13 models fulfill criterion c2 and an additional 19 fulfill this criterion at least partly twenty four of the analyzed models fulfill c5 and include considerations for hardware reliability and maintenance for c5 one model m41 was assessed as partly meeting the criterion since only failure of the steering was mentioned c6 is addressed by six risk models three consider it partly if the description of the events in the risk models indicated it but did not explicitly model it for the models fulfilling it factors are included such as auxiliary systems regarding c7 14 models consider different operational modes most models consider different modes through the inclusion of pilotage or external assistance model m38 contains the autopilot as part of the considerations model m45 compares unmanned and conventional shipping and therefore includes different operational modes only six models fulfil c3 criterion 4 is fulfilled by 12 models ten models address c9 ten models fulfilled six or more criteria these are m7 trucco et al 2008 m24 goerlandt et al 2012 goerlandt and kujala 2011 hänninen and kujala 2010 m41 tvedt 2014 m44 jensen 2015 m45 khaled and kawamura 2015 m50 mazaheri et al 2016 m51 haugen et al 2016 nilsen 2016 m57 m58 hassel 2017 6 discussion of the most promising models wróbel et al 2018 m64 used stpa to identify possible causes and contributors of the different system functions to system hazards almost all criteria except for c4 which covers the interaction between operators are covered by wróbel et al 2018 the stpa method may be an important tool for the design and evaluation of mass stpa has also been used on for the assessment of dynamic positioning systems of ships to derive verification goals and identify hazards rokseth et al 2016 2017 wrobel et al 2016 m57 used a bbn to assess the risk level of mass with respect to several possible accidents collision grounding foundering fire or cargo related accidents the bbn is divided into three levels the first level represents the risk in relation to the aforementioned accidents the second level summarizes possible initiating events these are related to navigation engineering stability and buoyancy or miscellaneous the third level summarizes causes to the accidents five main groups are identified alerting control algorithms external information quality maintenance regime and sensors performance the groups and their possible inclusion are not further described or developed and the model is not quantified wrobel et al 2016 address several important issues with their model therefore it may form a suitable basis for further development however assessing several accident types in one model may be a major challenge since a variety of risk influencing factors may interact in different ways for different accidents jensen 2015 presented a risk assessment m44 for a prototype unmanned bulk carrier using eta and fta following the fsa process in addition to ship ship collisions foundering of the vessel is investigated the models are used to compare conventional with autonomous operation therefore the models have been specifically developed for autonomous ships communication between the members of the scc crew is not included and human factors are only considered for the manned case however human factors should be included in a revised version of the model for remote control the collision encounter probability is assessed with geometric models based on the international association of marine aids to navigation and lighthouse authorities iala waterways risk management program iwrap mark 2 this may be a good starting point to assess the possible encounters on a long voyage route however simulations to assess the possible encounters may be more suitable in areas where traffic patterns vary strongly during a day or for traffic on a specific route li et al 2012 overall the models in m45 outline well how a risk analysis may be structured using fta and eta the presented models include high level function failures of the equipment engine steering software and hardware for a real system these function failures need to be modeled in more detail to represent the ship and its particulars the models lack detail in terms of the control system components however these are essential parts of a mass and need to be considered trucco et al 2008 presented a general framework m7 for risk assessment of maritime transportation systems a bbn is used to model the interaction of human organizational and technical factors which influence the basic event probability of fault trees the fault trees are used to assess the probability of accidental events as a case study trucco et al 2008 assessed the collision probability of a high speed vessel they consider three elements leading to a collision human errors automation and mechanical failures and maneuvering errors the modelling framework developed by trucco et al 2008 seems appropriate as a starting point for the development of risk models for mass the interaction between different risk influencing factors is an important contributor to the level of risk and may be captured through bbn the accidental chain of events can be modelled through fta hence such a framework together with the framework by vanem et al 2009 could be considered as basis for the development of the risk models tvedt 2014 presented a risk assessment framework m42 for allision scenarios between an offshore supply vessel and an offshore platform three scenarios were identified tvedt 2014 used eta to model the chain of events in the identified scenarios failures of mitigating barriers are modeled with fta the basic events in the ftas are assessed by bbns including human and organizational factors that influence the level of risk these factors are identified from different sources and include a wide range of considerations such as hmi usability training communication personal factors of the crew maintenance reliability and manning the model is not quantitative and is limited to an offshore supply vessel approaching an offshore platform similar methods are used as suggested by trucco et al 2008 and especially the operator model seems promising to transfer to a risk model for mass the model itself due to its focus on offshore platforms cannot be transferred to the case of mass however the models in the scenarios may need adaptation to account for mass in the future mazaheri et al 2016 developed a bbn m51 for the assessment of grounding probability of a marine traffic system such as a vessel vessel type or a certain waterway mazaheri et al 2016 based their model on incident and accident reports and earlier models this makes the model generally unsuitable in addition the model does not provide further guidance on how the factors in the bbn may be assessed with respect to their not available data or for other ship systems goerlandt et al 2012 goerlandt and kujala 2011 and hänninen and kujala 2010 m25 presented models to assess the risk associated with tanker collisions in a waterway hence it treats the ship parameters rather superficially and is only limitedly suitable to assess the risk level of the ship goerlandt et al 2012 presented the overall methodology for risk assessment using simulation including ship particulars route information departure time and speed following goerlandt and kujala 2011 and hänninen and kujala 2010 for the assessment of the collision frequency goerlandt and kujala 2011 assessed the encounter frequency of vessels in a specific waterway hänninen and kujala 2010 presented the model for assessing the causation probability the causation probability represents evasive maneuvers by the two vessels and is assessed through a bbn hänninen and kujala 2010 included several technical human environmental and organizational factors the approach may be further developed or used as guideline to assess the risk level of mass operating in waterways hassel 2017 assessed the allision risk m60 for offshore oil and gas platforms the bnn model focuses on both aspects related to the platform and the ship on collision course similar to m42 m60 addresses the allision risk from the perspective of the offshore platform hence the model may need to be adapted to assess the change of the allision risk level of offshore platforms by mass all aspects of communication c3 c4 and c8 are covered model 60 may be used as guideline how these aspects can be included in a bbn model for mass khaled and kawamura 2015 assessed the collision risk m46 in a harbor area they used the geometric model implemented in iwrap friis hansen 2008 to assess an encounter frequency and combine it with an adapted bbn to assess the causation probability the bbn includes among others environmental factors personal factors of crew members human error and technical reliability of navigational equipment and communication equipment khaled and kawamura 2015 included considerations that are relevant for operation of masss however they are covered only superficially since the model was made for risk assessment of waterways since the model is designed for harbor areas it may provide input for assessing the risk level of mass when approaching ports model 52 is the norwegian national ship risk model nilsen 2016 haugen et al 2016 the model was developed for the risk assessment and implementation of risk reduction measures in norwegian waterways the model does not consider different operational modes and communication between vessel operators only the detailed model for groundings is available hence these considerations might be included in a collision model since the model focuses on waterways and is based on historical data for incidents and accidents it is not suited to demonstrate safety compliance of mass the model and work around the model include different ship types and their risk levels mass may be included in the future in summary the literature provides some suggestions for the conduction of risk assessments for mass the stpa methods seems to be suitable tool for analyzing possible hazards and proposing risk reduction measures some of the analyzed models focus on specific waterways and locations the different foci result in various aspects that are included and highlighted in the models to demonstrate a sufficiently low risk level of an mass it is necessary to model its behavior and particulars in detail which may require risk modelling from different risk perspectives on the mass in some cases a quantitative assessment is necessary to show that the risk level has been addressed by suitable measures models that are used currently for the risk assessment of conventional ships may provide insight into how a model could be developed building risk models of mass may find a starting point in risk models for conventional ships however the risk influencing factors in the models and their quantification need to be elicited for the mass case areas that need special attention for example software and remote control and associated human operator considerations are rarely covered in depth different approaches are needed to include these considerations in risk models for mass 7 conclusion this article reviews current risk models for ship collisions and groundings which have been presented in the literature since 2005 the 64 analyzed models mainly aim at assessing the ship collision frequency grounding frequency or frequency of allisions in a certain waterway or geographical area most models use a geometrical modeling approach often in combination with other modeling techniques to determine the frequencies or probabilities of the accident models aiming at risk assessment of a waterway treat ships superficially with respect to relevant factors such as technical equipment and its reliability hence such models are not applicable to demonstrate the risk level of a ship nine criteria are used to assess the identified relevant risk models with respect to their applicability to mass operation a systems engineering approach was used to identify the criteria the criteria cover relevant aspects for the operation of mass component and subsystem redundancy different operational modes hmi communication among different involved actors technical reliability maintenance software reliability and manning these criteria cover a broad range of aspects since the current concepts for mass vary among each other which does not allow for a more detailed system evaluation ten models fulfill six or more criteria these were investigated more closely seven models that were closely investigated in this article are based on conventional ship operation the operation of mass will be different from conventional ship operation technical reliability software reliability and the situation awareness of the operators become even more important in mass the models developed for mass address most relevant issues however due to the lack of certainty on design and operational concepts these models are rather superficial no models can be defined without concrete operational concepts and clear system definitions which makes an in depth analysis and assessment of the reviewed models difficult the evaluation presented in this article shows that some of the current conventional ship risk models and the underlying frameworks could be used as a starting point for developing risk models for mass the structure and considerations included in the models should be further considered regarding risk modeling of mass the quantification of ship risk models traditionally is based on accident and incident data but such an approach is not yet applicable for risk models of mass hence expert assessments and test data need to be derived and used if a quantified risk assessment is attempted one issue that all the analyzed models have in common except for m57 wrobel et al 2016 and m64 wróbel et al 2018 is that they do not include the communication connection with a shore base this is one of the main requirements for mass that they can be remotely controlled and supervised even if mass have minimal crew on board part of the vessel will be highly automated and situation assessment requires a robust communication line between the vessel and competent personnel on shore seven of the ten models discussed in more detail have one aspect in common they use bbn for at least as part of the risk model only jensen 2015 and wróbel et al 2018 do not use a bbn hänninen 2014 highlighted the usability and usefulness of bbns for maritime safety management with the flexibility of the modeling method and the input from experts it is possible to build risk models for mass operation hence bbns should be considered part of a risk model for mass operation a systems engineering approach might benefit the development of such a risk model in identifying comprehensive system requirements a dedicated mass risk model should focus on the assessment of the control and software system and the effects of its failure current models do not consider this aspect dedicated methods for assessment of software failure and control systems need to be applied currently used modeling techniques in the ship risk models are not sufficient since software behaves deterministically chu et al 2009 methods that may be used could be among others stpa leveson et al 2012 or the functional resonance analysis method hollnagel 2012 which has been already employed in accident investigation of maritime accidents tian et al 2016 other aspects that need more attention in the future are the interactions between conventional and autonomous ships since mass will not replace all maritime vessels in the foreseeable future further investigation should include the effects of mass on traffic patterns the methods relating to the geometrical analysis of collision frequency might need to be adapted to new traffic patterns in addition permanent navigational aids along the coast and in waterways may need to be changed to facilitate navigation of mass current aids such as navigational lights and buoys assist the human navigators using radar or similar equipment with visual perception for verification this is also an area that needs to be further investigated and that may affect the risk related to mass financial support i b utne and c a thieme appreciate the support of the research council of norway

otto nielsens veg 10 trondheim 7491 norway marine autonomous surface ships mass are tested in public waters a requirement for mass to be operated is that they should be at least as safe as conventional ships hence this paper investigates how far the current ship risk models for ship ship collision ship structure collision and groundings are applicable for risk assessment of mass nine criteria derived from a systems engineering approach are used to assess relevant ship risk models these criteria aim at assessing relevant considerations for the operation of mass such as technical reliability software performance human machine interfaces operating and several aspects of communication from 64 assessed models published since 2005 ten fulfilled six or more of these criteria these models were investigated more closely none of them are suitable to be directly used for risk assessment of mass however they can be used as basis for developing relevant risk models for mass which especially need to consider the aspects of software and control algorithms and human machine interaction keywords marine autonomous surface ship autonomous vessel collision risk allision risk grounding risk 1 introduction marine autonomous surface ships mass are becoming increasingly interesting for the commercial maritime sector as an alternative to conventional ships several research projects have investigated mass concepts e g revolt dnv gl 2015 maritime unmanned navigation through intelligence in networks munin 2012 advanced autonomous waterborne applications 2016 norway announced the first field test area for mass which is shared with public marine traffic norwegian maritime authority 2016 the first autonomous cargo ship is supposed to be in operation by fall 2018 kongsberg maritime 2017 a mass may be low manned or unmanned rødseth and nordahl 2017 which creates challenges in operation the mass will influence risk in relation to several marine stakeholders the environment and the mass itself collisions and groundings contribute most to the risk level for conventional ships pedersen 2010 the mass will be equipped with collision avoidance systems and sensory equipment for safe operation moreover the mass should at least be as safe as conventional ships advanced autonomous waterborne applications 2016 nautilus federation 2018 pedersen 2010 to be acceptable for use in public ocean space risk assessments serve to demonstrate a certain level of risk and are an important tool for making relevant design decisions rausand 2011 wróbel et al 2017 assessed the effect of unmanned vessels and conclude that masss will reduce the collision frequency while the severity of consequences might increase due to the reduced recovery capability hence risk models integrating technical human and organizational factors are needed that reflect the operation of mass the danish maritime authority 2018 has suggested adapting the international regulations such that mass shall be developed following a goal and risk based regulatory approach autonomous underwater vehicles auv have been in the focus of risk research such as risk management frameworks brito et al 2012 thieme et al 2015a and risk assessments brito and griffiths 2016 brito et al 2010 griffiths and brito 2008 thieme and utne 2017 thieme et al 2015b for mass less research has been conducted rødseth and burmeister 2015b and rødseth and tjora 2014 analyzed and presented the risk based design methodology applied in the munin project munin 2012 which is based on the formal safety assessment fsa process of the international maritime organization imo 2002 the qualitative and quantitative analyses including considerations of risk of the munin project were summarized by kretschmann et al 2015a b the detailed analysis of the munin project was presented by jensen 2015 section 4 in the advanced autonomous waterborne applications 2016 white paper summarizes safety and security considerations and associated challenges for the development of mass wrobel et al 2016 presented a bayesian belief network bbn for assessing accidents for unmanned ships based on the mutual influence of different risk factors wróbel et al 2018 developed a safety control structure model of mass it is analyzed with the system theoretic process analysis stpa to identify possible scenarios where control structures may become inadequate both articles address the uncertainty in relation to mass their operation and risk which makes it difficult to develop a generic and comprehensive risk model for mass the present article reviews selected grounding and collision risk models to identify practices and modelling approaches that may be applicable for risk modelling of mass it attempts to assess whether current collision and grounding risk models or parts of these can capture the unique aspects of mass operation a risk model for mass operation needs to assess the level of risk for example the probability of ship collision the systems engineering process is used to identify criteria which reflect aspects that should be represented in a risk model for mass the purpose is to identify potential gaps and focus areas that need to be especially addressed by new risk models developed for mass further this article focuses on operation of mass i e during transit in the oceans and seas including vessel approaching ports or offshore installations vessels that are not in transit which carry out specific tasks and operations e g fishing vessels offshore vessels moored or in dynamic positioning mode research vessels military vessels and other special purpose vessels are excluded furthermore security aspects are disregarded i e the possibility of willful collision or grounding current international maritime legislation such as the united nations convention of the law of the seas unclos 1982 is not adapted to the advent of mass this aspect is disregarded in this article assuming that conventional vessels and mass are treated alike models for detailed consequence analysis as part of risk assessment are not considered only limited information on mass concepts is available to limit the scope of this article only risk models that were developed since 2005 are considered in the article the selected risk models assess the probability of ships colliding stranding and or grounding a recent literature review by lim et al 2018 on maritime risk models summarizes the model types modelling methods and research contributions lim et al 2018 identified future research directions in the maritime risk and security domain for conventional ships this current article is different from lim et al s 2018 because this current article assesses possible modelling approaches from current risk models for conventional ships to mass the next section presents the background and definitions this is followed by the methodology the criteria for the assessment of the risk models are identified in the section thereafter the results section presents the findings and identifies gaps in the risk models that need to be addressed in future risk models for mass the models and approaches that are relevant for mass are discussed in section 6 this is followed by concluding remarks and an outlook on further work 2 background risk models for ships are used to assess the risk arising from ship traffic during ship operation or for a marine area goerlandt and montewka 2015 reviewed the use of risk definitions and quantification of risk of published maritime risk models in many cases these models do not state the risk definition or risk measure a clear definition of the concept of risk and other related terms is necessary to clearly describe communicate and manage risk aven and zio 2014 in addition the international maritime organization imo 2002 defines risk for the framework of fsa as the combination of the frequency and the severity of the consequence moreover sn iso guide 73 2009 defines risk as the effect of uncertainty on objectives whereas the effect can be positive or negative considering mass such a risk definition might be more suitable due to the expected uncertainties regarding the technical solutions operation and environment 2 1 autonomy and marine autonomous surface ships autonomous systems may have different levels of autonomy loa autonomy is a system s ability to make independent decisions from a supervising agent and execute these decisions vagia et al 2016 for conventional marine vessels the supervising operators are the crew for mass only one or a few operators will take a supervising role and intervene when necessary this is described in more detail in section 2 2 the loa describes the degree of this ability to make independent decisions vagia et al 2016 typically applied loa scales are presented by sheridan and verplank 1978 or endsley and kaber 1999 comprehensive reviews are provided by insaurralde 2012 or vagia et al 2016 rødseth and nordahl 2017 and utne et al 2017 defined each specific scale for mass with four levels these scales define the decision authority and the tasks that the human operators and the autonomous system carry out implicitly affecting risk in this case the term tasks refers to information acquisition information analysis decision selection and action implementation parasuraman et al 2000 in the lowest loa i e manual control endsley and kaber 1999 vagia et al 2016 the human operator does everything and the autonomous system does not assist in intermediate loas the autonomous system and the operators cooperate endsley and kaber 1999 rødseth and nordahl 2017 utne et al 2017 in the highest loa full autonomy the human operator has no possibility to intervene with the system endsley and kaber 1999 rødseth and nordahl 2017 sheridan and verplank 1978 utne et al 2017 this is not likely for mass at least in the near future autonomy and automation are used often interchangeably although different aspects are included in the concepts vagia et al 2016 the term autonomy will be solely used in this article an autonomous system capable of changing the loa according to the circumstances is designed with adaptive autonomy sheridan 2011 2 2 operation of conventional versus autonomous ships no formal definition of a conventional ship exists the unclos 1982 does not define a ship or vessel danish maritime authority 2018 therefore information on common practices is used a ship or vessel has a crew for the engine department the bridge the deck department and stewards the crew level of a cargo ship ranges between ten and 21 people curley 2012 the master of a vessel has the responsibility for the vessel its safety personnel cargo and passengers the master has the aboard decision authority the master acts as a communication point between the shipping company crew and other actors norwegian shipowners association 2003 the bridge crew is responsible for navigation and control over the ship moreover unclos 1982 requires a lookout at all times according to the conditions and that communication via radio is maintained the bridge must be staffed according to weather and visibility conditions a voyage plan must be determined and approved by the master before the vessel sets sail norwegian shipowners association 2003 unclos 1982 the chief officer is responsible for the navigation and is second in command mates and able sea folk act as lookouts the deck crew handles the cargo and loads and offloads the vessel norwegian shipowners association 2003 the stewards are responsible for crew well being the engine department is responsible for supervision and preventive and corrective maintenance of the machinery curley 2012 the chief engineer is responsible for the engine department norwegian shipowners association 2003 rødseth and burmeister 2015a and advanced autonomous waterborne applications 2016 showed that there will be several technical solutions for mass the mass need to be designed for their purpose with different performances advantages and disadvantages three main concepts of operation of autonomous ships can be differentiated i mass with low manning bertram 2016 ii master slave supervision bertram 2016 and iii shore control center scc supervised masss munin 2012 rødseth and nordahl 2017 rødseth et al 2014 the main difference in these concepts is the location of the operators or supervisors since none of these concepts are fully autonomous current concepts rely on an operator with decision authority supervising the mass the operational concepts can only be described superficially since they depend on the size and purpose of the vessel advanced autonomous waterborne applications 2016 the three concepts mentioned above all have a control system of the mass that collects information on the environment analyses it makes decisions based on these analyses and acts accordingly the mass needs to be able to sense the environment through machine vision and sensor fusion for example advanced autonomous waterborne applications 2016 bertram 2016 the operators have a supervisory role during voyages and can take control of the mass when necessary e g if several obstacles are detected in dense traffic or during port approach the operators also handle necessary radio communications with other vessels or vessel traffic service vts the mass with low manning i are an intermediate solution during the transition period to autonomous vessels that are unmanned bertram 2016 kongsberg maritime 2017 the crew on board a vessel is then reduced in comparison to conventional shipping the crew can perform necessary maintenance and take control of the mass if necessary the mass will be mostly in autonomous mode and does not require operator input in the master slave supervision system ii one manned vessel supervises several unmanned vessels all vessels travel together and the crew of the manned vessel can take control of the unmanned vessels if necessary near ports pilots and tug boats might assist the vessels bertram 2016 maintenance of components is in this concept rather limited during the voyage and advanced monitoring systems are needed a scc supervised mass iii configuration munin 2012 rødseth and nordahl 2017 rødseth et al 2014 is not manned during voyage and is remotely supervised from a land based scc the scc communicates with the mass through satellites or through radio based systems when the mass is near the shore the munin project envisions that for entering ports a crew boards the vessel and takes manual control over the vessel rødseth et al 2014 the revolt concept envisions low aid needed through adapted port design and new docking technology tvete 2015 since mass that are supervised by a scc are mainly unmanned the opportunities for maintenance are limited preventive and corrective maintenance can only be executed during port time or dry docking rødseth and burmeister 2015a this demands a highly reliable system and proactive condition monitoring that identifies incipient failures bertram 2016 argued that conventional diesel engines might not be suited for unmanned shipping since they need frequent maintenance new concepts such as hydrogen or battery driven propulsion are needed bertram 2016 tvete 2015 3 method 3 1 selection of risk models this article considers only models developed since 2005 the mass concept has received increased attention in recent years due to technical availability and expected financial feasibility only models that assess the risk associated with collisions allisions or grounding are considered allisions are ship structure collisions hassel 2017 hassel et al 2017 the scopus 1 1 www scopus com accessed on nov 3 2017 database was searched for the keywords ship or vessel and collision model ship or vessel and allision and ship or vessel and grounding or stranding model the search was conducted on november 3 2017 additionally publications referenced in the literature were included if possible additional references were found in work by goerlandt and montewka 2015 one master thesis and one doctoral thesis were included that were not listed in scopus or by goerlandt and montewka 2015 jensen 2015 and hassel 2017 three publications that address mass are included these are jensen 2015 wrobel et al 2016 and wróbel et al 2018 models that do not give enough information on how the frequency or probability were assessed have been excluded in accordance with the scope models covering inland waterways rivers or arctic areas have been excluded such as those by almaz 2012 or zhang et al 2013 similarly valdez banda et al 2015 presented a model for risk assessment in ice operation which resembles a special operation johansson and molitor 2011 presented a risk assessment for the baltic sea reusing existing models and software goerlandt et al 2012 presented a holistic risk assessment based on previously defined risk models by hänninen and kujala 2010 and goerlandt and kujala 2011 these three models are assessed as one model in the analysis since they build upon each other 3 2 development of assessment criteria to identify suitable and relevant criteria for assessing the existing risk models a systems engineering approach is employed first the problem and the desired systems are described i e the mass operation this is the first phase of a systems engineering process blanchard 2008 in the second step system requirements are described and functional needs with respect to safety are identified typical questions answered in the requirement identification are as follows blanchard 2008 1 what is required from the system stated in functional terms 2 what specific functions must the system accomplish 3 what are the primary functions to be accomplished 4 what are secondary functions to be accomplished 5 what must be accomplished to completely alleviate the stated deficiency 6 why must these functions be accomplished 7 when must these functions be accomplished 8 where is this to be accomplished and for how long 9 how many times must these functions be accomplished not all of these questions can be answered in this article however they are used as guidelines for the identification of the needs and requirements for mass these give input to the identification of suitable assessment criteria 3 3 assessment procedure the identified relevant ship risk models are categorized according to their approach to risk assessment the approaches are generally discussed for their applicability and possible further use for mass the identified models are assessed against the criteria from table 2 in section 4 2 the models that fulfil most of the criteria are further analyzed in section 6 models that fulfill several criteria are assumed to reflect a high level of detailed modeling of the interaction between the risk relevant modelling aspects summarized in the criteria the suitability of the models and possible learnings from these are highlighted this does not imply that the models may be used as they are but they may be used as basis for developing mass specific risk models 4 evaluation criteria 4 1 functional requirements with respect to risk the main function of mass is to transport goods or people from one port to another this is the same main function as for conventional ships the transport needs to be safe cost efficient and reliable the main difference between mass and conventional ships is the reduced crew which may have implications for the design of the vessels safety related functions currently executed by the crew must be carried out by the mass and its subsystems the functions in relation to safety are situational awareness of the environment and the surroundings of the vessel which is the task of the lookout and the purpose of the navigational systems e g radar on a conventional vessel a more detailed functional analysis and description for autonomous ships can be found in the work by rødseth and nordahl 2017 table 1 summarizes the requirements for mass that follow from the description in the previous section the mass should identify obstacles and potential hazards and react appropriately in a timely manner r1 sensors computers and actuators need to execute these functions in a reliable manner and they need to be available during the voyage the opportunities for maintenance and repairs are limited the mass need to be reliable with respect to sensor systems machinery and the control system to achieve their mission goals r2 the software side and algorithms need to be robust and verification of their safe performance is desirable r3 due to the natural differences between software and hardware different methods for risk assessment of these are needed leveson 2011 current concepts for mass i to iii still rely on human operators to some degree partly on board the mass they supervise the mass adapt the mission plan or take over control if necessary concepts ii and iii require that reliable communication lines with sufficient transmission capacity exist between the mass and the operators such that safe operation is possible r4 there is need for suitable provisions for a crew since it might be necessary to board the ship for berthing munin 2012 rødseth and nordahl 2017 two more types of communication need to be considered reliable and adequate communication among the crew operators in the ssc or on board a low manned vessel in situations that require the human operators to intervene r5 and communication between mass operators and other ships or vts r6 both types of communication need to be unambiguous and goal oriented to ensure safe operation the mass should be easily accessible for the operators through the provided user interfaces r7 the operators need to be able to assess the present situation quickly to develop a good situation awareness and be able to reason about necessary actions hence human machine interfaces hmi need to be optimized for usability and accessibility in cases in which the operators take control of the mass the loa will change which is called adaptive autonomy r8 the system and operators must be able to adapt quickly to the new operational mode with a different loa 4 2 evaluation criteria based on the previously identified requirements cf table 1 the criteria for evaluating the risk models are derived the criteria reflect the needs of a mass i e what aspects a ship risk model should cover to be suitable for mass table 2 summarizes the identified criteria for risk model evaluation it is not possible to rank the importance of these criteria since each criterion covers important aspects of risk modelling for mass that need to be included in a risk model criterion 1 summarizes the main difference between mass and conventional ships mass operation will to a large degree depend on software functionality autonomous functions control algorithms and other software aspects that are failing influence risk mass operation may require a substantial amount of interaction between the mass and its operators during parts of the voyage therefore it is necessary to consider the hmi and the operators interaction with the hmi c2 communication is also an important aspect in the cooperation and interaction between actors the operators of one vessel mainly concepts i and ii need to communicate to detect and resolve hazardous situations c3 criterion 4 investigates remote communication with the shore base conventional vessels should receive substantial support from the shore organization norwegian shipowners association 2003 which requires robust communication lines with the scc the mass may be monitored from a scc concept iii which requires that remote connections are considered the mass operating with concepts i and ii might have less contact with the scc mass may be unmanned and it may not be possible to perform maintenance immediately when necessary this is especially true for long voyages hence the system reliability and maintenance c5 and backup solutions in case of failure of a sub system through functional redundancy c6 are important a risk model should consider functional redundancies that were introduced in the system to reflect the risk level accurately the mass will employ several sensor systems to create a holistic operational picture via for example sensor fusion criterion 7 aims at the assessment of the models with respect to different operational modes and loa such as piloted auto piloted manual control or autonomous voyage consideration of the operational mode is necessary since the operators interaction with the vessel and the performance of the vessel itself will change the vessel navigation will vary in these modes criterion 8 assesses whether the risk models consider communication between the vessel crew and other marine participants such as other ships or manned structures criterion 9 assesses whether the risk models include considerations of personnel e g different manning levels different roles on board the ship and operating the vessel this is closely connected to the operational mode and loa c1 and communication aspect between operators c4 the crew level c9 dependends on the operational concept and may not be relevant for complete unmanned systems however it is important for low manned or partially unmanned systems 5 results table 3 summarizes the 64 reviewed models with the following information accident type object of analysis model aim modeling methods model parameters and data sources with respect to the type of accident 14 models cover collision and grounding seven models focus on grounding or stranding seven models 28 models cover ship ship collision and nine models cover allision three models include both ship ship collision and allision the object of analysis refers to the target of the risk assessment these are general maritime transportation systems referring to any of the following systems certain ship types or specific waterways most reviewed models aim at risk assessment for a certain region or waterway 43 six models aim at a specific ship type in a waterway e g ferries in a harbor area m1 or specific oil tanker traffic areas m12 m25 and m47 models for specific vessels are presented for generic maritime transportation systems m7 m15 and m51 for general cargo ships m23 and m36 and autonomous vessels m45 m57 m64 the models addressing mass are described and discussed in more detail in section 5 most models aim to assess the risk level in a waterway and assess the effect of risk reducing measures such as adapted traffic schemes and patterns some of these consider the change of the risk level through obstructions or structures such as anchoring vessels m36 bridges and structures m4 m16 m46 and m62 offshore oil and gas platforms m38 m44 and m60 or wind parks m30 and m35 only one model aims at the risk assessment of an mass on a certain route assessing the potential encounter frequency and probability of collision m45 the most commonly used modeling techniques and assessment approaches used in the risk models are geometric models 35 models bbns 24 models and simulations 18 models less used methods include the analytical hierarchy process ahp one model bayesian theorem calculations three models fuzzy inference six models event tree analysis eta three models failure mode and effect analysis fmea one model fault tree analysis fta 7 models regression modeling one model and stpa for detailed description of these methods the reader is referred to the respective literature data sources refer to the input for modeling and quantification of the models most models use historical data 48 models expert judgment 31 models published data 30 models or a combination of these few models are not quantified due to their generic nature or the modelling approach m15 m57 and m64 historical data includes information obtained through automatic identification system ais data vts or other records of shipping information expert judgment refers to parameters or probabilities that have been assessed and elicited by domain experts in this case published data refer to data on human and technical reliability found in the literature and the accepted values for the aforementioned causation probability eleven models primarily use accident data to assess the risk level which is collected from accident and incident databases and reports such models are not yet directly applicable for mass since they will be operated differently and rely on different technical solutions only six models use discretized real time information to assess the current level of risk the next sections categorize the models similar to the groups in li et al 2012 who reviewed ship risk models the focus of the next sections is to generally describe the model types and assess their suitability for mass generally 5 1 modelling categories 5 1 1 models for assessing the risk in waterways collision and grounding risk models for waterways are often based on geometric models the probability of an accident p is derived through the multiplication of two parameters the probability to encounter a vessel that will result in a collision if no avoiding measures are taken p a and the causation probability p c which represents the probability that no evasive maneuver is taken fujii and shiobara 1971 macduff 1974 1 p p a p c the encounter probability is in most cases based on the geometrical traffic distribution in the fairway the overlap between different fairways is used to find p a for head on collisions for overtaking or crossing collisions similar considerations have been presented a summary of possible methods for calculating the encounter probability can be found for example in kristiansen 2005 or li et al 2012 the grounding frequency can be determined similarly for coastal areas or areas with shallow water the ship traffic density can be determined and multiplied with a causation probability pedersen 2010 this is based on the considerations of macduff 1974 and fujii et al 1974 one differentiates between powered groundings and drift groundings mazaheri et al 2014 the causation probability summarizes considerations of vessel maneuverability crew equipment etc pedersen 2010 the probability is often determined through bbn eta or fta or a combination of these these methods will not be explained further both the encounter probability and causation probability may be derived from historical data on the traffic distribution in an area and the available accident data models that fall in this category are m3 m5 m11 m16 m18 m26 m27 m30 m32 m34 m37 m41 m46 m48 m61 and m62 these models aim mostly at assessing the average risk in a waterway they enable analysts to suggest regulatory measures for reducing the level of risk hence these kind of models are not applicable to determine the level of risk of mass since mass are not yet an integral part of the maritime traffic in the future these types of models need to account for mass 5 1 2 causation probability models some publications present only a model for the causation probability once a vessel is on collision course these models employ mostly bbn eta and fta the models aim in many cases at one ship type a specific fleet or a specific ship some address specific factors such as fatigue m36 human operator performance m12 or operation in arctic areas m63 models that fall in this category are m7 m12 m15 m36 m38 m40 m42 m51 m52 m56 m58 m60 and m63 where m7 and m15 are generic frameworks for risk modelling of maritime transport systems these models may provide some basis for risk modelling of mass since they model certain risk aspects with a high level of detail however the focus of the models may not always be adequate 5 1 3 simulation approaches to determine the encounter probability and consequently the accident risk simulations may be used these models frequently use a causation probability which is derived through bbn eta and fta however not all models used for deriving the causation probability are presented by the literature the simulations use ais data and other ship traffic data to simulate the paths of ships and identify potential collision candidates simulations may also be used to assess the allision risk or the grounding risk the models are useful when areas with regular sea traffic shall be assessed such as harbor areas ferry or tanker traffic models that use simulations are m1 m6 m8 m13 m14 m19 m20 m22 m24 m25 m28 m29 m33 m35 m47 m49 m54 and m59 simulations in general may be useful to model the risk of mass operation especially for mass being employed in route traffic it seems to be a promising tool characteristics of the mass can be modeled and the behavior of the control software may be implemented particular traffic operating on the mass route may be assessed and critical situations identified 5 1 4 real time decision support several models and approaches have been developed to give real time decision support to ship navigators and vts operators these approaches use underlying risk models in combination with calculation of the nearest point of approach to identify possible collision candidates models in this category are m9 m10 m21 m23 m44 m50 m55 and m61 these models may provide information to operators however they are not suitable for direct risk assessment for mass such models do generally not model the ship in detail since the focus lies on the surrounding vessels 5 1 5 other risk assessment approaches hu et al 2007 m2 used a fuzzy logic approach to the risk assessment of waterways this may address uncertainties and probability ranges of scenarios however the model aims at specific waterways and hence their specific work has little relevance for mass fuzzy logic though may be used to address the uncertainties in risk assessment of mass zaman et al 2014 used a combination of fmea and fuzzy logic to address the risk assessment of the strait of malaga they identify hazards for the strait and assess the magnitude of risk contribution hence the knowledge gained from the model has few implications for mass however the method may support the design of mass nivolianitou et al 2016 presented a bbn for assessing the risk of ships passing an area the assessment is based on accidents statistics using characteristics of vessels that have been involved in accidents such an approach is not suitable for risk assessment of mass since it is reactive and based on the accident statistics which do not exist for mass wróbel et al 2018 m64 developed a stpa model to identify possible system hazards the use of stpa reveals where control through additional measures and functionalities is needed to prevent the manifestation of hazards and consequently accidents this model is further described in section 6 5 2 parameters in the assessed ship risk models this section provides an overview of parameters that have been used in the models this corresponds to the second to last column in table 3 this description forms the basis for the assessment of the models against the criteria outlined previously each model considers several parameters that influence the probability of an accident however the number of parameters that are considered varies from model to model some models only consider a few vessel and fairway parameters while others consider and describe in detail technical human environmental and organizational factors that are considered thus table 3 contains a summary of parameters that have been included in the different models to give a comprehensive and comparable overview of the models these parameters are used to assess the models against the identified criteria traffic flow relates to the distribution of ship traffic over identified shipping lanes the ship traffic is often gaussian distributed it contains information on the number of vessels passing a certain area their trajectories and speed some models consider seasonal daily and hourly variations of the traffic flow the traffic flow is often associated with the vessel traffic characteristics these are the parameters of the vessels such as ship type length width and draught fairway characteristics refers to the dimensions of the waterway in question in which the traffic is traveling these are the length width and depth of the waterway and the spatial distribution of these several models split the fairway into several smaller segments to linearize meandering waterways geometric models make use of most of these parameters to be concise environmental technical human and organizational factors that were similarly mentioned are presented in a summarized description in table 3 for example if human error was mentioned several times with respect to similar tasks e g lookout this is summarized as human error to avoid excessive repetition crew characteristics are used if several human and organizational factors were included e g training competence experience stress alcohol consumption tiredness fatigue etc with respect to environmental factors weather describes the atmospheric environment the sea state describes waves and currents with the associated directions visibility is mentioned as a separate factor although dependent on weather the reviewed models cover different levels of technical factors some models include failure of subsystems e g propulsion or navigational aid failure other models include very detailed failures e g radar failure table 3 attempts to reflect these differences 5 3 evaluation against the criteria table 4 shows the results of the model evaluation against the criteria four models had insufficient information to assess all criteria this is indicated in the table some models were assessed as partly fulfilling the criteria c1 c2 c5 c6 c7 and c8 this was the case in which models included considerations similar to the ones in the criteria however not enough information was presented to assure that these criteria are met criterion 1 is fulfilled by 21 models through failure of navigation aids however this is not a very detailed analysis of software systems one model m42 was assessed as partly fulfilling the criterion since technical reliability was mentioned as a factor however it was not clear if this referred also to hardware and software reliability to assess c2 the models were checked for human error and associated ergonomic considerations such as navigational aid failure 13 models fulfill criterion c2 and an additional 19 fulfill this criterion at least partly twenty four of the analyzed models fulfill c5 and include considerations for hardware reliability and maintenance for c5 one model m41 was assessed as partly meeting the criterion since only failure of the steering was mentioned c6 is addressed by six risk models three consider it partly if the description of the events in the risk models indicated it but did not explicitly model it for the models fulfilling it factors are included such as auxiliary systems regarding c7 14 models consider different operational modes most models consider different modes through the inclusion of pilotage or external assistance model m38 contains the autopilot as part of the considerations model m45 compares unmanned and conventional shipping and therefore includes different operational modes only six models fulfil c3 criterion 4 is fulfilled by 12 models ten models address c9 ten models fulfilled six or more criteria these are m7 trucco et al 2008 m24 goerlandt et al 2012 goerlandt and kujala 2011 hänninen and kujala 2010 m41 tvedt 2014 m44 jensen 2015 m45 khaled and kawamura 2015 m50 mazaheri et al 2016 m51 haugen et al 2016 nilsen 2016 m57 m58 hassel 2017 6 discussion of the most promising models wróbel et al 2018 m64 used stpa to identify possible causes and contributors of the different system functions to system hazards almost all criteria except for c4 which covers the interaction between operators are covered by wróbel et al 2018 the stpa method may be an important tool for the design and evaluation of mass stpa has also been used on for the assessment of dynamic positioning systems of ships to derive verification goals and identify hazards rokseth et al 2016 2017 wrobel et al 2016 m57 used a bbn to assess the risk level of mass with respect to several possible accidents collision grounding foundering fire or cargo related accidents the bbn is divided into three levels the first level represents the risk in relation to the aforementioned accidents the second level summarizes possible initiating events these are related to navigation engineering stability and buoyancy or miscellaneous the third level summarizes causes to the accidents five main groups are identified alerting control algorithms external information quality maintenance regime and sensors performance the groups and their possible inclusion are not further described or developed and the model is not quantified wrobel et al 2016 address several important issues with their model therefore it may form a suitable basis for further development however assessing several accident types in one model may be a major challenge since a variety of risk influencing factors may interact in different ways for different accidents jensen 2015 presented a risk assessment m44 for a prototype unmanned bulk carrier using eta and fta following the fsa process in addition to ship ship collisions foundering of the vessel is investigated the models are used to compare conventional with autonomous operation therefore the models have been specifically developed for autonomous ships communication between the members of the scc crew is not included and human factors are only considered for the manned case however human factors should be included in a revised version of the model for remote control the collision encounter probability is assessed with geometric models based on the international association of marine aids to navigation and lighthouse authorities iala waterways risk management program iwrap mark 2 this may be a good starting point to assess the possible encounters on a long voyage route however simulations to assess the possible encounters may be more suitable in areas where traffic patterns vary strongly during a day or for traffic on a specific route li et al 2012 overall the models in m45 outline well how a risk analysis may be structured using fta and eta the presented models include high level function failures of the equipment engine steering software and hardware for a real system these function failures need to be modeled in more detail to represent the ship and its particulars the models lack detail in terms of the control system components however these are essential parts of a mass and need to be considered trucco et al 2008 presented a general framework m7 for risk assessment of maritime transportation systems a bbn is used to model the interaction of human organizational and technical factors which influence the basic event probability of fault trees the fault trees are used to assess the probability of accidental events as a case study trucco et al 2008 assessed the collision probability of a high speed vessel they consider three elements leading to a collision human errors automation and mechanical failures and maneuvering errors the modelling framework developed by trucco et al 2008 seems appropriate as a starting point for the development of risk models for mass the interaction between different risk influencing factors is an important contributor to the level of risk and may be captured through bbn the accidental chain of events can be modelled through fta hence such a framework together with the framework by vanem et al 2009 could be considered as basis for the development of the risk models tvedt 2014 presented a risk assessment framework m42 for allision scenarios between an offshore supply vessel and an offshore platform three scenarios were identified tvedt 2014 used eta to model the chain of events in the identified scenarios failures of mitigating barriers are modeled with fta the basic events in the ftas are assessed by bbns including human and organizational factors that influence the level of risk these factors are identified from different sources and include a wide range of considerations such as hmi usability training communication personal factors of the crew maintenance reliability and manning the model is not quantitative and is limited to an offshore supply vessel approaching an offshore platform similar methods are used as suggested by trucco et al 2008 and especially the operator model seems promising to transfer to a risk model for mass the model itself due to its focus on offshore platforms cannot be transferred to the case of mass however the models in the scenarios may need adaptation to account for mass in the future mazaheri et al 2016 developed a bbn m51 for the assessment of grounding probability of a marine traffic system such as a vessel vessel type or a certain waterway mazaheri et al 2016 based their model on incident and accident reports and earlier models this makes the model generally unsuitable in addition the model does not provide further guidance on how the factors in the bbn may be assessed with respect to their not available data or for other ship systems goerlandt et al 2012 goerlandt and kujala 2011 and hänninen and kujala 2010 m25 presented models to assess the risk associated with tanker collisions in a waterway hence it treats the ship parameters rather superficially and is only limitedly suitable to assess the risk level of the ship goerlandt et al 2012 presented the overall methodology for risk assessment using simulation including ship particulars route information departure time and speed following goerlandt and kujala 2011 and hänninen and kujala 2010 for the assessment of the collision frequency goerlandt and kujala 2011 assessed the encounter frequency of vessels in a specific waterway hänninen and kujala 2010 presented the model for assessing the causation probability the causation probability represents evasive maneuvers by the two vessels and is assessed through a bbn hänninen and kujala 2010 included several technical human environmental and organizational factors the approach may be further developed or used as guideline to assess the risk level of mass operating in waterways hassel 2017 assessed the allision risk m60 for offshore oil and gas platforms the bnn model focuses on both aspects related to the platform and the ship on collision course similar to m42 m60 addresses the allision risk from the perspective of the offshore platform hence the model may need to be adapted to assess the change of the allision risk level of offshore platforms by mass all aspects of communication c3 c4 and c8 are covered model 60 may be used as guideline how these aspects can be included in a bbn model for mass khaled and kawamura 2015 assessed the collision risk m46 in a harbor area they used the geometric model implemented in iwrap friis hansen 2008 to assess an encounter frequency and combine it with an adapted bbn to assess the causation probability the bbn includes among others environmental factors personal factors of crew members human error and technical reliability of navigational equipment and communication equipment khaled and kawamura 2015 included considerations that are relevant for operation of masss however they are covered only superficially since the model was made for risk assessment of waterways since the model is designed for harbor areas it may provide input for assessing the risk level of mass when approaching ports model 52 is the norwegian national ship risk model nilsen 2016 haugen et al 2016 the model was developed for the risk assessment and implementation of risk reduction measures in norwegian waterways the model does not consider different operational modes and communication between vessel operators only the detailed model for groundings is available hence these considerations might be included in a collision model since the model focuses on waterways and is based on historical data for incidents and accidents it is not suited to demonstrate safety compliance of mass the model and work around the model include different ship types and their risk levels mass may be included in the future in summary the literature provides some suggestions for the conduction of risk assessments for mass the stpa methods seems to be suitable tool for analyzing possible hazards and proposing risk reduction measures some of the analyzed models focus on specific waterways and locations the different foci result in various aspects that are included and highlighted in the models to demonstrate a sufficiently low risk level of an mass it is necessary to model its behavior and particulars in detail which may require risk modelling from different risk perspectives on the mass in some cases a quantitative assessment is necessary to show that the risk level has been addressed by suitable measures models that are used currently for the risk assessment of conventional ships may provide insight into how a model could be developed building risk models of mass may find a starting point in risk models for conventional ships however the risk influencing factors in the models and their quantification need to be elicited for the mass case areas that need special attention for example software and remote control and associated human operator considerations are rarely covered in depth different approaches are needed to include these considerations in risk models for mass 7 conclusion this article reviews current risk models for ship collisions and groundings which have been presented in the literature since 2005 the 64 analyzed models mainly aim at assessing the ship collision frequency grounding frequency or frequency of allisions in a certain waterway or geographical area most models use a geometrical modeling approach often in combination with other modeling techniques to determine the frequencies or probabilities of the accident models aiming at risk assessment of a waterway treat ships superficially with respect to relevant factors such as technical equipment and its reliability hence such models are not applicable to demonstrate the risk level of a ship nine criteria are used to assess the identified relevant risk models with respect to their applicability to mass operation a systems engineering approach was used to identify the criteria the criteria cover relevant aspects for the operation of mass component and subsystem redundancy different operational modes hmi communication among different involved actors technical reliability maintenance software reliability and manning these criteria cover a broad range of aspects since the current concepts for mass vary among each other which does not allow for a more detailed system evaluation ten models fulfill six or more criteria these were investigated more closely seven models that were closely investigated in this article are based on conventional ship operation the operation of mass will be different from conventional ship operation technical reliability software reliability and the situation awareness of the operators become even more important in mass the models developed for mass address most relevant issues however due to the lack of certainty on design and operational concepts these models are rather superficial no models can be defined without concrete operational concepts and clear system definitions which makes an in depth analysis and assessment of the reviewed models difficult the evaluation presented in this article shows that some of the current conventional ship risk models and the underlying frameworks could be used as a starting point for developing risk models for mass the structure and considerations included in the models should be further considered regarding risk modeling of mass the quantification of ship risk models traditionally is based on accident and incident data but such an approach is not yet applicable for risk models of mass hence expert assessments and test data need to be derived and used if a quantified risk assessment is attempted one issue that all the analyzed models have in common except for m57 wrobel et al 2016 and m64 wróbel et al 2018 is that they do not include the communication connection with a shore base this is one of the main requirements for mass that they can be remotely controlled and supervised even if mass have minimal crew on board part of the vessel will be highly automated and situation assessment requires a robust communication line between the vessel and competent personnel on shore seven of the ten models discussed in more detail have one aspect in common they use bbn for at least as part of the risk model only jensen 2015 and wróbel et al 2018 do not use a bbn hänninen 2014 highlighted the usability and usefulness of bbns for maritime safety management with the flexibility of the modeling method and the input from experts it is possible to build risk models for mass operation hence bbns should be considered part of a risk model for mass operation a systems engineering approach might benefit the development of such a risk model in identifying comprehensive system requirements a dedicated mass risk model should focus on the assessment of the control and software system and the effects of its failure current models do not consider this aspect dedicated methods for assessment of software failure and control systems need to be applied currently used modeling techniques in the ship risk models are not sufficient since software behaves deterministically chu et al 2009 methods that may be used could be among others stpa leveson et al 2012 or the functional resonance analysis method hollnagel 2012 which has been already employed in accident investigation of maritime accidents tian et al 2016 other aspects that need more attention in the future are the interactions between conventional and autonomous ships since mass will not replace all maritime vessels in the foreseeable future further investigation should include the effects of mass on traffic patterns the methods relating to the geometrical analysis of collision frequency might need to be adapted to new traffic patterns in addition permanent navigational aids along the coast and in waterways may need to be changed to facilitate navigation of mass current aids such as navigational lights and buoys assist the human navigators using radar or similar equipment with visual perception for verification this is also an area that needs to be further investigated and that may affect the risk related to mass financial support i b utne and c a thieme appreciate the support of the research council of norway

23137,steel fenders are often used in bridge protections to absorb impact energy associated with a vessel collision however disadvantages such as susceptibility to corrosion have been evidenced in existing fenders to this end a novel fender structure composed of steel and ultra high performance fiber reinforced concrete uhpfrc is proposed where outer panels as stiff guards are made of uhpfrc that was demonstrated to possess high ductility and impact resistance and corrugated steel plates are designed as energy absorbing elements four steel uhpfrc specimens and one specimen composed of steel and reinforced concrete rc were tested through drop hammer impact systems it was found that the crashworthiness of uhpfrc panel was superior to that of rc panel relative resistances between the uhpfrc panel and the corrugated steel plate had a significant influence on impact performances of the composite fender to reasonably evaluate impact performances of the proposed fender finite element fe models were developed and validated by the impact tests an application study was performed using the validated fe modeling to investigate the applicability of the proposed fender in practice the proposed fender was demonstrated as being capable of effectively decreasing impact forces and responses of a bridge as well as vessel damage keywords vessel bridge collision low velocity impact test ultra high performance fiber reinforced concrete uhpfrc steel uhpfrc composite fender finite element modeling 1 introduction more and more vessel collision accidents with bridges have been reported in recent years around the world particularly in china only during january to august 2017 three bridges located in guangdong province were greatly damaged almost collapse due to vessel collisions fan et al 2017 in addition to the damage of bridge structures severe environmental pollution such as the spilling of oil and other chemicals were often caused due to the damage of vessel structures larsen 1993 one factor for the occurrence of these accidents is that rapid increases in vessels and bridges lead to more transits and more artificial obstacles in waterways therefore aashto 2009 pointed out that physical protection systems or called as protective structures should be highlighted as areas of future research much recent research has been devoted to investigating dynamic behaviors of bridge structures subjected to ship or barge collisions consolazio and cowan 2005 kantrales et al 2015 cowan et al 2015 sha and hao 2013 yuan and harik 2010 fan et al 2016a lu and zhang 2013 zhang et al 2016 particularly some analysis methods such as coupled vessel impact analysis cvia consolazio and cowan 2005 and shock spectrum analysis ssa cowan et al 2015 fan et al 2016a were developed to efficiently determine vessel impact induced responses of a bridge structure however relatively few studies focused on examining the anti collision performance of protective structures although physical protection systems have been applied in practice to protect bridge and vessel from serious damages in the past 30 years larsen 1993 aashto 2009 among of various protective structures larsen 1993 aashto 2009 dolphin and island protections have been more frequently used in the united states and canada due to their high resistances to withstand vessel impact loads fan 2012 fan et al 2015 however these protections may cause relatively heavy damage in an aberrant ship or barge and be expensive particularly for bridges located at deep water or poor geological areas in contrast bridge pier fenders are preferred in china fan et al 2015 jiang and chorzepa mi 2016 fang et al 2016 wang et al 2008 among them steel fender is one of the commonly used types in recently constructed bridges such as shanghai yangtze river bridge and jintang bridge fan 2012 because steel materials are capable of absorbing relatively high impact energy due to their large plastic deformability larsen 1993 aashto 2009 however aashto 2009 pointed out that steel fenders are susceptible to corrosion in saltwater environments and to fire even explosion due to metal to metal contact with steel hulled vessels carrying flammable cargo moreover fan et al 2015 indicated that the energy absorbing capacity of the conventional steel fender is greatly limited due to the low vulnerability of a face steel panel under a bulbous bow impact and the addition of reinforced concrete rc cover can improve the crashworthiness of steel fender compared to normal concrete nc ultra high performance fiber reinforced concrete uhpfrc developed in the mid 1990 s exhibits many excellent mechanical properties such as superior strength e g compressive strength over 150 mpa and tensile strength over 8 mpa and energy absorption capacity russell and graybeal 2013 afgc setra 2013 habel et al 2006 uhpfrc has been regarded as one of the promising civil engineering materials to resist severe loading conditions such as impact and shock loadings yoo and banthia 2017 on the other hand uhpfrc materials are extremely dense and compact due to the absence of porosity and capillary porosity in tiny non interconnected scale afgc setra 2013 these features offer them quite exceptional performance in term of durability compared to any other types of concrete when uhpfrc instead of nc is used in a bridge fender the crashworthiness and durability of the fender may be improved as well as the self weight of the fender may be reduced accordingly a new composite fender is proposed in this study by combining the promising material uhpfrc with the corrugated steel plates that are easily mass producible and have been demonstrated to possess high energy absorbing performance in ship structures hogström and ringsberg 2013 subsequently the new steel uhpfrc composite fender was experimentally and numerically studied the more common the uhpfrc is the more feasible and economical the proposed composite fender is in practical application thus the typical steel fibers with 2 volume that have often been used yoo and banthia 2017 zhang 2016 were adopted in the uhpfrc to investigate the applicability of the proposed composite fender four steel uhpfrc and one steel rc composite specimens were fabricated and tested through the drop hammer impact system at hunan university to explore the impact resistance of the proposed composite structure high resolution finite element fe models corresponding to the drop hammer impact tests were developed and validated the material parameters involved in the fe model were discussed in detail finally the validated fe modeling method was extended into simulating a practical bridge equipped with the proposed composite fender subjected to ship and barge collisions it was clearly observed that the proposed steel uhpfrc composite fender offers great potential for reducing impact force and response of a bridge structure as well as vessel damage in addition comparisons among the steel fender the steel nc composite fender and the steel uhpfrc composite fender were carried out and discussed 2 experimental procedures steel uhpfrc and steel rc composite structure specimens are described in this section drop hammer impact test setup and cases are given for the proposed composite fender structure 2 1 test specimens four steel uhpfrc composite structures were fabricated to investigate the impact behavior the overall configurations of the steel uhpfrc composite structures are illustrated in fig 1 generally the composite structure consists of the top and bottom uhpfrc panels the steel plate and the corrugated steel plate the presence of uhpfrc panel can help distribute the concentrated impact of a vessel over a larger area thereby resulting in the participant of more energy dissipated members while corrugated steel plates are designed to dissipate the impact energy and to reduce the impact force to an acceptable level for comparison one steel rc composite specimen was fabricated where the normal concrete instead of uhpfrc was used in the panels table 1 presents a total of five specimens in the drop hammer testing the thicknesses of the top and bottom panels are 45 mm and 40 mm respectively both the top and bottom steel plates attached to the panels are 4 mm thick two different thicknesses i e 1 mm and 2 mm were investigated for corrugated steel plates to address the influence of relative resistances between stiff guard and energy absorbing member steel bars with a diameter of 10 mm were embedded in the top and bottom panels to evaluate the influence of steel rebar ratio on impact resistances two different spacings 5 cm and 10 cm of reinforcing steel bars were investigated the layout of the reinforcing steel bar is illustrated in fig 1 a the corrugated plates were connected to the top and bottom steel plates with welding similar to the composite bridge deck in shao et al 2013 shear studs with a space of 150 mm welded in the top and bottom steel plates were employed to improve the connections between uhpfrc and steel plates as shown in fig 1 a cross section of the corrugated steel plate with dimensions in mm is given in fig 1 b the fabrications of the top and bottom panels are shown in fig 1 c and d respectively 2 2 materials and properties the mix proportions of uhpfrc and normal concrete used in the test are presented in tables 2 and 3 respectively the uhpfrc materials included 2 of hooked end steel fibers in volume specifically steel fibers were 13 mm in length and 0 2 mm in diameter as shown in fig 2 as mentioned above one typical type and volume of steel fibers were considered in this study further studies are worth pursuing to investigate the influences of fiber type and volume on the performance of the steel uhpfrc composite structure to determine the material properties multiple uhpfrc 100 100 100 mm and concrete 150 150 150 mm cubes were cast and cured at the same conditions of the uhpfrc and rc panels normal curing was placed on the rc panels by using regular water for 28 days the standard manufacturer recommended curing treatment which involved steam curing at 90 c and 95 percent relative humidity for 48 h starting 24 h after casting graybeal 2006 was applied to the uhpfrc panels and cubes according to the uniaxial testing shown in fig 3 a and b the compressive strengths of the uhpfrc and the normal concrete were measured and presented in tables 2 and 3 respectively similar to graybeal 2006 four point bending tests on beam specimens with a dimension of 100 100 400 mm was performed to determine the tensile strength of the uhpfrc as shown in fig 3 c e based on the measured data and the formulas in afgc setra 2013 the tensile strength was 8 1 mpa for the uhpfrc in this study q235 carbon steel widely used in china was selected to fabricate the top and bottom steel plates as shown in fig 1 as mentioned earlier very thin thicknesses 1 0 mm or 2 0 mm were arranged for the corrugated steel plates because the thicknesses of corrugated plates were too thin to be addressed by the q235 specification these plates were constructed from gb t 5213 2008 cold rolled low carbon steel sheets which are the most similar alternative to q235 carbon steel plate to determine the mechanical properties of steel plates quasi static uniaxial tension tests were performed in accordance with gb t 228 1 2010 2010 using sub sized flat specimens fig 4 and a sans cmt5105 electromechanical testing system fig 5 a to obtain the stress strain relationships a sans clip on extensometer was used to measure the elongation of the specimen similar to getter et al 2015 tests were paused to remove the extensometer when the measured strain approximated the maximum extensometer travel 0 18 mm mm then quasi static uniaxial tension tests were resumed until specimen failure according to the extrapolation method suggested by getter et al 2015 the relatively larger strain beyond 0 18 mm mm for each quasi static test was estimated based on the crosshead displacement of the sans machine specifically the measured strain displacement data for strains between 0 02 and 0 18 mm mm were used to fit a parabolic function the fitted function was then employed to predict all strains larger than 0 18 mm mm the similar testing was used to determine the mechanical properties of steel bars fig 4 b d show the specimens after testing fracture fig 5 b plots engineering stress strain curves obtained from the quasi static testing program the measured properties of two types of steel plates and steel bar are tabulated in tables 4 and 5 respectively 2 3 test setup a total of five impact scenarios in the drop hammer testing are given in table 1 primary parameters that were varied during testing included the material of the outer panel the thickness of corrugated steel plate and the shape of hammer tip for brevity each impact case is assigned an identification code e g uhpfrc 1 5 r the first word such as uhpfrc denotes the material of outer panel the first number means the thickness of corrugated plate and the second number represents the rebar spacing in centimeter as well as the last letter r or f denotes the shape of the hammer tip round and flat the setup for the drop hammer impact testing is schematically shown in fig 6 generally the drop hammer impact test setup included three main parts a specimen support system a drop hammer system and a measuring system the specimen support system consists of two steel support walls a 1 04 m long steel frame and eight steel i beams two steel support walls were connected by the 1 04 m long steel frame to form a whole group as a result the clear span of a specimen was also 1 04 m eight steel i beams were placed to fill the gap between the steel frame and the tested specimen finally a specimen steel uhpfrc or steel rc composite structures was anchored to the steel support walls through six bolts at each side as shown in fig 6 b and c in term of the impact system a high performance drop hammer testing machine at hunan university was used in this study as displayed in fig 6 b and c this drop hammer test device had been widely used and shown to be suitable for use in conducting impact testing liu et al 2017 to investigate the influence of hammer tip on impact induced responses two different hammer tips i e hemispherical and flat tips were considered there was a slight mass difference between these two hammer tips as a result the total mass 831 4 kg of drop hammer with a 100 mm radius hemispherical tip was slightly different from that 817 2 kg of drop hammer with a flat tip for each impact testing the drop hammer freely falling at a constant height of 1 5 m along the guide rails was used to impose the impact energy to the center of the top surface of the tested specimen a high frequency data acquisition system produced by ni company was employed to collect impact responses with a sampling frequency of 500 khz during drop hammer impact testing impact force data were measured by a load cell embedded in the drop hammer and vertical displacements of composite structures were recorded by displacement transducers as shown in fig 6 b a high speed camera with the frame per second fps of 3000 was arranged to visually record each impact test 3 test results and discussions results obtained from the drop hammer impact test program are described in the following section including failure mode impact force and structural displacement implications from these experimental data are also presented 3 1 failure mode and damage figs 7 and 8 present the failure modes of composite structure specimens subjected to various impact event scenarios see table 1 in the impact case uhpfrc 2 5 r a hemispherical pit with a diameter of 15 5 cm and a depth of 3 8 cm was formed in the uhpfrc panel and located at the hammer impact point while the overall damage or deformation of the corrugated plate was very small on the contrary large deformations occurred in the corrugated plate when its thickness was reduced from 2 mm to 1 mm i e uhpfrc 1 5 r only slight damage as opposed to the local heavy damage such as the hemispherical pit in the case uhpfrc 2 5 r was observed in the uhpfrc panel as shown in fig 8 this implies that the relative resistance between the outer panel and the inner energy absorbing member has a significant influence on the protective performance of a steel uhpfrc composite fender under impact loading similar to the impact case uhpfrc 1 5 r the overall damage deformation of the corrugated plate was relatively large when normal concrete was used instead of uhpfrc to construct the outer panel i e nc 1 5 r however the rc panel exhibited more severe damage than the uhpfrc panel under the same impact energy besides the hemispherical pit located at the impact point the main crack crossed through the rc panel in width and depth directions figs 7 and 8 this is attributed to the fact that the crashworthiness of the uhpfrc panel is considerably superior to the rc panel it is possible that a bridge pier fender suffers from several impacts with low to medium energy during its service life provided that normal concrete is used a relatively thick panel will be needed to achieve the expected crashworthiness as a result the weight of a fender is too heavy to be widely used in engineering practice the need is evident for utilizing uhpfrc panels in a composite fender structure compared to the impact case uhpfrc 1 5 r the rebar spacing in the top panel was increased from 5 cm to 10 cm in the uhpfrc 1 10 r the overall damage to the corrugated plate of the uhpfrc 1 10 r was almost the same as that of the case uhpfrc 1 5 r as shown in figs 7 and 8 also the outer panel exhibited similar extents of damage to that of the case uhpfrc 1 5 r the local damage tended to become severe because of the decrease in the rebar ratio accordingly it can be concluded that the rebar ratio has a weak effect on the crashworthiness of uhpfrc panel based on the test data of the cases uhpfrc 1 5 f and uhpfrc 1 5 r the influence of hammer tip on overall damage was not pronounced since the flat hammer tip was used instead of the hemispherical one the local damage in the outer panel of the uhpfrc 1 5 f was lighter than that in the uhpfrc 1 5 r 3 2 time history of impact force time histories of impact forces obtained from the drop hammer impact test program are shown in fig 9 for various impact scenarios the force time history in the case uhpfrc 2 5 r was apparently different from that of the case uhpfrc 1 5 r the use of a 1 mm thick corrugated plate led to a larger reduction in peak impact force e g from 388 9 kn to 261 7 kn the corresponding impact duration was increased to nearly two times that with 2 mm thick corrugated plates these mean that the relatively better buffer can be achieved by using a 1 mm thick corrugated plate for the given impact and the relative resistance between the outer panel and the corrugated plate is very crucial for reducing the impact force to attain an acceptable level in the proposed composite structure compared to the case uhpfrc 1 5 r the impact force was further reduced by 16 and the duration was slightly extended when the uhpfrc was replaced with the normal concrete as shown in fig 9 this is because the rc panel has the lower contact stiffness than the uhpfrc one however changing panel materials has a relatively limited effect on impact force in comparison with thinning the energy absorbing member corrugated plate moreover severe damage was observed in the outer rc panel therefore although the contact stiffness can be slightly reduced due to the use of rc panel its susceptibility to damage under a concentrated impact force will hamper applications in engineering practice similar to the preceding observations on structural damage the force time history in the case uhpfrc 1 10 r was almost identical to that of the case uhpfrc 1 5 r fig 9 only the peak force was slightly decreased with decreasing rebar ratio hence the influence of rebar ratio on impact force was not pronounced in contrast fig 9 a and e indicate that the shape of a hammer tip had an obvious influence on impact force particularly for peak force specifically the peak impact force increased when the flat tip was used to strike the specimen consolazio et al 2009 and fan and yuan 2014a evidenced that the impact force increases with the increase in the contact area apparently the contact area between the specimen and the hammer increased when the hemispherical tip was changed to the flat one 3 3 displacement results fig 9 f j presents mid span displacements of composite structures for various impact scenarios each displacement time history can be characterized by three different phases the loading phase the unloading phase and the free vibration phase take the experimental data observed from the case uhpfrc 1 5 r as the benchmark the overall maximum displacement decreased by 40 when the thickness of the corrugated plate increased from 1 mm to 2 mm while the maximum displacement increased by 23 when the panel materials were changed from uhpfrc to normal concrete similar to the preceding observations the rebar ratio in the outer panel was shown to weakly affect overall displacement distinct to the impact force results the hammer tip shape was shown to have no effect on the overall displacement accordingly the most sensitive factor influencing the overall deformation of a composite structure is the thickness of the corrugated plate followed by panel material and then hammer tip shape as well as the rebar ratio of the outer panel these findings will facilitate optimization of the steel uhpfrc composite fender in the future 4 fe modeling method and numerical investigations to further interpret the experimental data and conduct application studies high resolution finite element fe models were developed material e g uhpfrc and steel models and parameters used in the fe models were discussed in detail fe modeling technique for predicting the impact induced response of a steel uhpfrc composite structure was validated against the impact tests which provided a basis for simulating vessel collisions with bridge structures equipped with steel uhpfrc composite fenders 4 1 fe modeling two fe models with different fidelity were developed to simulate composite structures subjected to drop hammer impact loading fig 10 a illustrates the fe model with the slight simplification of minor details such as shear stud and weld seam specifically an ideal bond was assumed between the outer panel and the top or bottom steel plates through sharing common nodes corrugated plates were also connected to the top or bottom plates using sharing common nodes solid elements were used to model the uhpfrc and concrete as well as the drop hammer and steel plates and bars were modelled by belytschko tsay shell elements and beam elements respectively the contact between the drop hammer and the composite structure was defined via the keyword contact auto surface to surface lstc 2014 internal contacts after composite structures deformed were modelled by using contact single surface for comparison a high fidelity fe model shown in fig 10 b was developed to investigate the influence of minor details on numerical results beam elements were used to model shear studs and the contact instead of sharing common nodes was arranged between the top steel plate and the outer panel small holes for connecting the corrugated plate with the top or bottom steel plate were taken into account and welded connections between them were formed using thousands of individual constrained node sets except for the above particular treatments other definitions in the high fidelity fe model were identical to the simplified fe model fig 10 4 1 1 concrete and uhpfrc material models a smooth or continuous surface cap csc model was initially developed to simulate concrete used in roadside safety structures when involved in a collision with a motor vehicle lstc 2014 murray 2007 generally this model includes isotropic constitutive equations yield and hardening surface and damage formulation to simulate softening and modulus reduction lstc 2014 murray 2007 a smooth and continuous intersection was formulated between hardening cap and failure surface in the csc model the failure function of the csc model is based on three invariants and cap hardening parameter as follows lstc 2014 murray 2007 1 f j 1 j 2 j 3 κ j 2 ℜ 2 f f 2 f c where j 1 is the first invariant of the stress tensor j 2 and j 3 are the second and third invariants of the deviatoric stress tensor respectively κ is the cap hardening parameter which equals to the value of the pressure invariant at the intersection of the cap and shear surfaces ℜ is the rubin three invariant reduction factor f c is the hardening cap which is a two part function that is either unity or an ellipse and is related to cap aspect ratio r cap initial location x 0 maximum plastic volume compaction w and linear shape parameter d 1 as well as quadratic shape parameter d 2 these input parameters in the csc model can be estimated by fitting pressure volumetric strain curves measured in hydrostatic compression and uniaxial strain tests in eq 1 f f is the shear failure surface which can be written as 2 f f j 1 α λ exp β j 1 θ j 1 where α β λ and θ are the shear failure surface parameters which can be determined from fitting the failure surface to triaxial compression txc test data the strengths in torsion tor and triaxial extension txe can be estimated by the product functions q 1 f f and q 2 f f respectively the scaling functions q 1 and q 2 are expressed as 3 q 1 α 1 λ 1 exp β 1 j 1 θ 1 j 1 4 q 2 α 2 λ 2 exp β 2 j 1 θ 2 j 1 where α 1 2 β 1 2 λ 1 2 and θ 1 2 are the tor and txe yield surface parameters respectively which can be determined based on the tor and txe test data respectively besides the input parameters related to failure surface and cap hardening elastic constants and damage parameters should be determined beforehand generally a total of 45 input parameters need be provided for the use of the csc model for easy to use murray 2007 provided a set of standardized concrete material properties for use as default parameters only the unconfined compression strength grade the aggregate size and the units are required to generate default csc model parameters for normal concrete recently the csc model with default parameters has been demonstrated to be robust in the similar field of low velocity impact analysis liu et al 2017 fan and yuan 2014b hence the default parameters related to failure surfaces cap hardening and damage formulations which were generated from the tested uniaxial compressive strength of the normal concrete were used in this study for strain rate effects of normal concrete the formulas provided in ceb fib model code fib 2013 have been widely used and evidenced to be conservative guner and vecchio 2012 hence these formulas were employed to determine strain rate parameters in this study the dynamic increase factor dif c for concrete compression can be written as fib 2013 5 d i f c f c d f c ε ε c 0 0 014 for 30 10 6 s 1 ε 30 s 1 0 012 ε ε c 0 1 3 for 30 s 1 ε 3 10 2 s 1 where f c d is the dynamic uniaxial compressive strength f c is the uniaxial compressive strength ε is the strain rate ε c 0 30 10 6 s 1 for tension the dynamic increase factor dif t of normal concrete can be expressed by fib 2013 6 d i f t f t d f t ε ε t 0 0 018 for 1 10 6 s 1 ε 10 s 1 0 0 0 62 ε ε t 0 1 3 for 10 s 1 ε 3 10 2 s 1 where f t d is the dynamic uniaxial tensile strength f t is the static uniaxial tensile strength ε t 0 1 10 6 s 1 according to murray 2007 the dynamic increase factors dif c and dif t in compression and tension can be respectively expressed by 7 d i f c f c d f c 1 e ε η c f c 1 e ε η 0 c f c ε n c 8 d i f t f t d f t 1 e ε η t f t 1 e ε η 0 t f t ε n t where e is young s modulus η 0 c and η 0 t are the rate effect parameter for uniaxial compression and tension respectively n c and n t are the rate effect power for compression and tension respectively it is apparent that eqs 7 and 8 implemented in the csc model are different from the ceb prescribed formulas eqs 5 and 6 in form to apply the ceb prescribed formulas to account for strain rate effects the data points shown in fig 11 were generated using eqs 5 and 6 subsequently the input parameters e g n t and n c of the csc model were estimated by using the least square method to fit the data points shown in fig 11 a detailed procedure for the modification can be found in guo et al 2018 accordingly all input parameters in the csc model were determined and presented in table 6 for the normal concrete in addition to the normal concrete it is more important to determine the material model and parameters for the uhpfrc currently few studies placed an emphasis on investigating the constitutive model of uhpfrc for low velocity impact simulation considering the advantages of the csc model for low velocity impact simulations guo et al 2018 extended it to simulate uhpfrc materials based on experimental data the failure surface parameters in eqs 2 4 can be determined through fitting the typical states of stress obtained from physical experiments guo et al 2018 for example uniaxial compression and biaxial and triaxial tension as well as two stress states of triaxial compression were used to determine the parameters in eq 2 importantly uhpfrc materials have a particular strain hardening behavior in tension due to the presence of steel fibers for the uhpfrc used in this study zhang 2016 experimentally investigated the tensile behaviors e g strain hardening in detail hence the damage parameters can be determined by approximating the tensile behaviors reported in zhang 2016 fujikake et al 2005 and fujikake et al 2008 investigated the strain rate effects of uhpfrc through physical experiments and summarized the following equations 9 d i f c f c d f c ε ε s c 0 0055 log ε ε s c 0 951 for ε ε s c 1 for ε ε s c 10 d i f t f t d f t ε ε s t 0 0013 log ε ε s t 1 95 for ε ε s t 1 for ε ε s t where ε s c 1 2 10 5 s 1 and ε s t 1 0 10 6 s 1 similar to the above procedure of normal concrete the strain rate parameters e g n t and n c of the uhpfrc were estimated by fitting the data points fig 11 that were determined from eqs 9 and 10 more details on the determination of the uhpfrc parameters can be found in guo et al 2018 table 6 presents all input parameters for the uhpfrc used in the drop hammer impact tests the corresponding stress strain curves were obtained from single solid element simulations and presented in fig 12 a which were in agreement with the test results reported in zhang 2016 4 1 2 steel material model the material model mat piecewise linear plasticity mat 24 was used to simulate all steel plates in the proposed composite structure true stress strain curves need to be provided when the elasto plastic material model is combined with shell elements lstc 2014 hence based on the combined material relation suggested by villavicencio et al 2014 the engineering stress strain curves of the steel plates fig 5 were converted to the corresponding true stress strain curves as shown in fig 12 b similarly the elasto plastic material model mat 24 was also employed to simulate steel bars in this study but stress strain data obtained from the tensile tests of the steel bars fig 5 were directly used in defining the elasto plastic material model because necking behavior was omitted for beam elements like guo et al 2018 the strain rate effects of these steel materials were taken into account by the following equations 11 f s d f s 1 202 0 040 log 10 ε 1 0 where f s and f s d are the static and dynamic yield strengths of the steel materials respectively 4 2 validation of fe model for each impact scenario numerical results are presented in fig 9 along with corresponding experimental results overall two different fe models in fig 10 provided the similar predictions on the impact responses of the composite structures this implies that the influences of the minor details such as shear stud and welding seam are not pronounced also the force time histories and the mid span displacements obtained from numerical simulations are in good agreement with the experimental data except the peak impact force in the case uhpfrc 1 5 f as shown in fig 9 e the peak impact force obtained from fe simulation is far greater than the experimental result this is attributed to the fact that the contact condition assumed in fe simulation is different from the real condition in the impact testing specifically the contacting surfaces of both the top panel and the flat hammer tip were assumed to be perfectly horizontal however this assumption is unrealistic for experiments a tiny variation in the contact condition between the flat hammer and the top panel may dramatically change the peak impact force as shown in fig 9 e the numerically obtained peak force was very close to the test result when the drop hammer rotated only two degrees but it was observed from fig 9 j that the impact induced displacement was not sensitive to such changes on the contrary the peak impact force tended to be less sensitive to the tiny variation in the contact condition when the composite structure was subjected to the impact from a hemispherical hammer strain rate was shown to have an obvious effect on the impact induced responses particularly for mid span displacements of steel uhpfrc composite specimens generally the numerically obtained displacements with strain rate effects were less than those without strain rate effects for the sake of conservatism the strain rate effects were omitted in the fe simulation of steel uhpfrc composite fenders subjected to vessel collisions indeed it is worth mentioning that the strain rate effects of uhpfrc and steel materials and their influences should be further investigated experimentally in the future figs 7 and 8 present overall and local damages obtained from fe simulations along with the experimental observations generally the developed fe models were capable of producing reasonable predictions on overall damages of the composite structures these results further demonstrate the applicability of the developed fe modeling in simulating the proposed composite structure under impact loading local damages obtained from fe simulations are slightly different from experimental observations this is partially attributed to the fact that the damage mechanism of uhpfrc differs from that of normal concrete guo et al 2018 further efforts should be made to improve the csc model in theory for predicting damage characteristics of uhpfrc structures under impact loading more accurately 5 application and discussions of the composite fender the tongjin bridge which was being designed to cross the xiangjiang river in china was selected as an example to illustrate the application of steel uhpfrc composite structure as shown in fig 13 a the bridge owner prescribed that the bridge piers should withstand the collision of a 2000 deadweight dwt vessel as the agency of the bridge owner fan et al 2016b conducted a risk based analysis for the bridge based on aashto specification aashto 2009 and numerical simulations the investigation indicated that the auxiliary piers i e nos 38 and 41 had a relatively low safety margin compared to the main tower piers this result is consistent with the implications of some catastrophic accidents such as the collapses of the i 40 bridge over the arkansas river and the jiujiang bridge in china fan 2012 all these catastrophic accidents began with the failures of the off channel piers that were struck by an errant vessel for this reason the bridge owner required the investigators to design protective structures for the auxiliary piers accordingly the steel uhpfrc composite fender shown in fig 13 b were proposed by fan et al 2016b as the protection for the auxiliary piers the overall constitution of the fender system was the same as the previously investigated steel uhpfrc composite structure some specific details such as concave rear panels and d shape rubber were arranged in the fender system to reduce the peak impact force and to improve the economy to avoid flooding water and sinking after severe damage light foams like materials used in floating circles were employed to fill in the gap inside the composite fender but its energy absorbing capacity can be omitted in comparison with corrugated steel plates 5 1 fe modeling for vessel fender bridge collision to investigate the performance of the steel uhpfrc composite fender under vessel collisions high resolution fe models were developed and shown in fig 14 in the fe models the bridge structure including its superstructure and substructure was simulated to reasonably model its dynamic characteristics under impact loading for simplification linear elastic material models e g mat elastic in ls dyna were adopted to describe concrete and steel materials used in the bridge structure the main parameters regarding the bridge concrete and steel are presented in table 7 two different vessels shown in fig 14 were chosen to investigate the performance of the steel uhpfrc composite fender the first one was the 2000 dwt bulk carrier with a twin tail fin and bulbous bow that often sails in inland waterways in china similar to fan et al 2015 consolazio et al 2009 fan and yuan 2014a the ship fe model was divided into two zones a bow portion and a hull portion to keep a balance between accuracy and efficiency fine meshes were used to simulate the bow portion see fig 15 a and b while the hull portion was simplified and modelled using coarse meshes the elasto plastic model mat plastic kinematic was used for the steel in the bow portion and the hull steel material was defined by the rigid material model mat rigid similar to fan and yuan 2014a the verification on the ship fe model was performed based on the empirical formulas in aashto 2009 and china s bridge design codes ministry of communications of china 2015 the impact forces obtained using the numerical model were close to those calculated from the empirical formulas indicating the applicability of the ship fe model the second one was the jumbo hopper barge that was outlined in aashto 2009 according to the detailed structural drawings in consolazio et al 2014 the barge fe model was developed as illustrated in fig 15 c and d similarly the barge bow was finely modelled using shell elements to mimic the actual geometric shape the barge fe model was shown to be capable of providing close estimates of the impact force versus bow deformation curves to the results reported in consolazio et al 2014 when the same parameters were used detailed modeling of the bridge structure and these two vessels can be found in fan et al 2016b the previously validated fe modeling was extended to model the steel uhpfrc composite fender system as shown in fig 16 material properties of the uhpfrc were set to be the same as those in the drop hammer tests the average thickness of the outer uhpfrc panel was 8 cm the hrb400 steel bars were distributed in the uhpfrc panel with a space of 10 cm and the q235 carbon steels with a thickness of 8 mm were used to fabricate the straight and corrugated steel plates of the composite fender the material parameters recommended by china s design specification ministry of communications of china 2015 were adopted to simulate these steel materials and the strain rate effects with respect to the fender materials were omitted for conservation considerations solid elements combined with the material model mat mooney rivlin rubber fig 16 were used to model the d shape rubber the detailed material parameters of the composite fender are presented in table 7 table 8 presents the main collision scenarios that were investigated in this study head on collision and oblique collision with an angle of 20 were considered for the ship and the barge respectively collision scenarios with no fenders were simulated for comparison according to the method recommended by aashto 2009 the design impact speed of 3 21 knots was determined based on typical vessel transit speed the channel arrangement and overall length of the 2000 dwt ship which was agreed with the bridge owner for the economy 5 2 effectiveness of the proposed composite fender results e g impact force displacement and structural internal force obtained from numerical simulations are presented in figs 17 20 for various collision scenarios respectively the maximum values of the impact induced responses are summarized in fig 21 damages for the vessels and the fenders after the collisions are shown in fig 22 for the head on collision of the 2000 dwt ship the peak impact force decreased from 8 96 mn to 5 12 mn 43 drop in magnitude when the steel uhpfrc composite fender was placed to protect the auxiliary pier as shown in figs 17 and 21 strictly speaking the direct contact between the ship and the bridge did not occur because the contact forces between them were always zero see fig 17 the contact forces between the vessel and the fender were generally similar to those between the fender and the pier this result can be addressed based on newton s third theorem however an obvious difference between them can be observed at the beginning phase of a collision a sudden increase occurred in the contact force between the fender and the pier while a relatively low magnitude was presented in the contact force between the vessel and the fender this is because the steel uhpfrc composite structure was designed to float with water levels and there was a gap 0 5 m between the uhpfrc panel and the pier surface to begin with the collision the vessel pushed the floating fender forward before contacting with the bridge pier then the contact between the fender and the pier occurred suddenly hence a relatively large dynamic resistance was achieved due to the contributions from the stiffness and inertia force related to the fender and the pier in addition to the reduction in the impact force the presence of the composite fender would lead to obvious decreases in impact induced responses e g pier top displacement and pier bottom moment and vessel damage in the ship head on collision scenario see figs 17 21 and 22 similarly the peak impact force fig 18 decreased considerably when the bridge structure equipped with the fender was subjected to the head on collision of the barge compared to the ship head on collision the reductions in impact induced responses tended to decrease when the composite fender was used in the barge head on collision scenario as shown in figs 18 and 21 this is attributed to the fact that the decrease in average impact force was relatively small and the impact induced displacement and internal forces were primarily dependent upon the average impact force rather than the peak value for barge collisions for the oblique collision with an angle of 20 both the impact forces and corresponding responses in the transverse direction of the bridge were substantially smaller than those of the head on collision no matter whether the composite fender was equipped or not the impact induced responses of the longitudinal direction are usually relatively small except the pier top displacement this is because the longitudinal removability was arranged as opposed to the fixed constraint in the transverse direction although the reduction in the impact force was slight the pier top displacement descended obviously because of the presence of the composite fender as shown in figs 19 21 this is because impact induced displacement is dependent not only on peak impact force but also on input impulse and duration of impact force chopra 2007 typically the ratio of input impulse to impact duration called average impact force can be adopted to reflect their influences based on the data shown in figs 19 and 20 the decreases in average impact forces were observed to be consistent with those of the pier top displacements compared to other responses in oblique collisions the reduction in shear force was the smallest when the bridge structure was collided by the 2000 dwt ship this may be because the vibration frequency shown in the fender pier contact force fig 19 a is close to that of the shear force curve fig 19 d thus further studied should be conducted to optimize the composite fender subjected to an oblique collision all in all the proposed composite fender was demonstrated as being capable of effectively decreasing impact forces and responses as well as vessel damage and extending impact duration 5 3 comparisons of different fenders and discussions in addition to examining the effectiveness of the steel uhpfrc composite fender three different types of fenders including steel uhpfrc composite fender steel nc composite fender and steel fender were compared for further discussions the panel material was changed from uhpfrc to nc c30 in the steel nc composite fender whereas the concrete panel was removed from the steel fender all other definitions are the same as the steel uhpfrc composite fender for comparison purposes generally three different types of fenders yielded similar effectiveness regarding decreasing impact forces and responses for the given collisions with the design energy as shown in figs 17 23 sometimes e g barge head on collision the responses with the steel fenders were less than those of the composite fenders this is attributed to the fact that the steel fender possesses the lower resistances when the concrete panel is removed importantly the above experiments revealed that the composite fender could be optimized by adjusting the thickness of the inner steel plate accordingly for the barge head on collision figs 18 and 21 the same decreases in impact forces and responses as seen in the steel fender was achieved in the proposed composite fender when the inner steel plates were thinned from 8 mm to 4 mm thus although the uhpfrc panel is added the amount of steel used can be greatly reduced by 50 in the proposed fender more importantly although the steel fender was shown to be effective in the reduction of impact forces and responses aashto 2009 highlighted that steel fenders are susceptible to corrosion and to fire even explosion because of metal to metal contact with steel hulled vessels carrying flammable cargo it is apparent that these intrinsic disadvantages considerably limit the application of steel fender for each collision scenario the steel nc composite fender always exhibited much more damage than the steel uhpfrc composite fender see fig 23 this is consistent with the experimental observations e g figs 7 and 8 in this study particularly in a frequent oblique collision the damage of the nc panel was relatively severe whereas slight damage was observed in the steel uhpfrc composite fender this implies that cracks in the nc panel are evident under a frequent low energy collision or even environmental loads this is attributed to the fact that normal concrete has the low tensile strength and low crashworthiness since the fender is constantly subjected to oxygen and water i e moist and aggressive environment the durability might still be problematic for the use of nc panel particularly after a frequent collision or a low energy collision in addition to mechanical strengths uhpfrc materials have been experimentally demonstrated to have excellent durability batoz and behloul 2009 wang et al 2015 this is attributed to the fact that uhpfrc materials are extremely dense and compact due to the absence of porosity and capillary porosity in microscopic non interconnected scale moreover some experiments pointed out that because there is a non negligible quantity of non hydrated clinker in hardened uhpfrc the clinker can be hydrated in a humid environment and therefore offers the feature of self healing pimienta and chanvillard 2004 moreover much more damage implies that more difficulties might be placed for the repair of the steel nc composite fender after a collision overall some intrinsic limitations e g durability or low crashworthiness that are hardly overcome would block the applications of steel fenders and steel nc composite fenders the proposed steel uhpfrc composite fender can be an alternative solution for bridge protection because of the advantages such as high crashworthiness and high durability 6 conclusions a new steel uhpfrc composite fender was proposed in this study to overcome the limitations of the conventional steel fender such as the durability and the energy absorbing capacity low velocity impact behaviors of the composite fender structure were experimentally and numerically investigated the protective performances of the proposed composite fender were evaluated when it was applied to a practical bridge as the fender system based on the detailed experimental and numerical studies the following conclusions can be drawn 1 relative resistances stiffness between the uhpfrc panel stiff guard and the corrugated steel plate energy absorbing member played an important role in the protective performance of the composite fender under impact loading local damage on the uhpfrc panel became more severe with increasing the thickness of the corrugated plate impact forces were sensitive to the thickness of corrugated plate compared to panel material and rebar ratio this implies that the reduction in impact force can be effectively achieved by adjusting the thickness of the corrugated plate in the proposed fender 2 the drop hammer impact test showed that the panel made of normal concrete was more vulnerable to the concentrated impact force than the uhpfrc panel in addition to the crashworthiness uhpfrc materials possess higher durability than normal concrete and facilitate lightening structural self weight owing to these advantages uhpfrc materials are preferred for the outer panel of the composite fender structure 3 the influence of the rebar ratio of the uhpfrc panel on the impact induced responses and damage was not pronounced only local damage on the uhpfrc panel was slightly affected by rebar ratio the peak impact force was sensitive to the shape of the hammer tip because of the change of the contact area but not the displacement of the composite structure 4 two fe models with different fidelity were developed to predict the impact induced responses of the composite structures numerical results obtained from these two different fe models were in good agreement with the experimental data indicating the rationality of the developed fe modeling method it was found that minor details such as the shear stud and the weld seam had little effect on the numerical results 5 an application study was performed using the validated fe modeling to investigate the protective performance of the proposed fender the steel uhpfrc composite fender was demonstrated as being capable of effectively reducing impact forces and responses as well as vessel damage and extending impact duration the reductions in impact induced responses were smaller than that of the peak impact force for the barge head on collision this was because the average impact force had a greater influence on the impact induced responses than did the peak impact force in addition since the impact induced responses of the oblique collision were often relatively small the effectiveness of the composite fender decreased somewhat 6 comparisons among the steel fender the steel nc composite fender and the steel uhpfrc composite fender were performed by fe simulations three different types of fenders yielded similar effectiveness in terms of decreasing impact forces and responses in the case study however the steel nc composite fender always exhibited much more damage than the steel uhpfrc composite fender because normal concrete has low tensile strength whereas the steel fender has significant disadvantages such as durability that are highlighted by aashto these intrinsic limitations e g durability or low crashworthiness that are hardly overcome would block their applications the proposed steel uhpfrc composite fender can be an alternative solution for bridge protection because of its potentials in crashworthiness and durability the application study was performed only to demonstrate the potential of the proposed composite fender further

23137,steel fenders are often used in bridge protections to absorb impact energy associated with a vessel collision however disadvantages such as susceptibility to corrosion have been evidenced in existing fenders to this end a novel fender structure composed of steel and ultra high performance fiber reinforced concrete uhpfrc is proposed where outer panels as stiff guards are made of uhpfrc that was demonstrated to possess high ductility and impact resistance and corrugated steel plates are designed as energy absorbing elements four steel uhpfrc specimens and one specimen composed of steel and reinforced concrete rc were tested through drop hammer impact systems it was found that the crashworthiness of uhpfrc panel was superior to that of rc panel relative resistances between the uhpfrc panel and the corrugated steel plate had a significant influence on impact performances of the composite fender to reasonably evaluate impact performances of the proposed fender finite element fe models were developed and validated by the impact tests an application study was performed using the validated fe modeling to investigate the applicability of the proposed fender in practice the proposed fender was demonstrated as being capable of effectively decreasing impact forces and responses of a bridge as well as vessel damage keywords vessel bridge collision low velocity impact test ultra high performance fiber reinforced concrete uhpfrc steel uhpfrc composite fender finite element modeling 1 introduction more and more vessel collision accidents with bridges have been reported in recent years around the world particularly in china only during january to august 2017 three bridges located in guangdong province were greatly damaged almost collapse due to vessel collisions fan et al 2017 in addition to the damage of bridge structures severe environmental pollution such as the spilling of oil and other chemicals were often caused due to the damage of vessel structures larsen 1993 one factor for the occurrence of these accidents is that rapid increases in vessels and bridges lead to more transits and more artificial obstacles in waterways therefore aashto 2009 pointed out that physical protection systems or called as protective structures should be highlighted as areas of future research much recent research has been devoted to investigating dynamic behaviors of bridge structures subjected to ship or barge collisions consolazio and cowan 2005 kantrales et al 2015 cowan et al 2015 sha and hao 2013 yuan and harik 2010 fan et al 2016a lu and zhang 2013 zhang et al 2016 particularly some analysis methods such as coupled vessel impact analysis cvia consolazio and cowan 2005 and shock spectrum analysis ssa cowan et al 2015 fan et al 2016a were developed to efficiently determine vessel impact induced responses of a bridge structure however relatively few studies focused on examining the anti collision performance of protective structures although physical protection systems have been applied in practice to protect bridge and vessel from serious damages in the past 30 years larsen 1993 aashto 2009 among of various protective structures larsen 1993 aashto 2009 dolphin and island protections have been more frequently used in the united states and canada due to their high resistances to withstand vessel impact loads fan 2012 fan et al 2015 however these protections may cause relatively heavy damage in an aberrant ship or barge and be expensive particularly for bridges located at deep water or poor geological areas in contrast bridge pier fenders are preferred in china fan et al 2015 jiang and chorzepa mi 2016 fang et al 2016 wang et al 2008 among them steel fender is one of the commonly used types in recently constructed bridges such as shanghai yangtze river bridge and jintang bridge fan 2012 because steel materials are capable of absorbing relatively high impact energy due to their large plastic deformability larsen 1993 aashto 2009 however aashto 2009 pointed out that steel fenders are susceptible to corrosion in saltwater environments and to fire even explosion due to metal to metal contact with steel hulled vessels carrying flammable cargo moreover fan et al 2015 indicated that the energy absorbing capacity of the conventional steel fender is greatly limited due to the low vulnerability of a face steel panel under a bulbous bow impact and the addition of reinforced concrete rc cover can improve the crashworthiness of steel fender compared to normal concrete nc ultra high performance fiber reinforced concrete uhpfrc developed in the mid 1990 s exhibits many excellent mechanical properties such as superior strength e g compressive strength over 150 mpa and tensile strength over 8 mpa and energy absorption capacity russell and graybeal 2013 afgc setra 2013 habel et al 2006 uhpfrc has been regarded as one of the promising civil engineering materials to resist severe loading conditions such as impact and shock loadings yoo and banthia 2017 on the other hand uhpfrc materials are extremely dense and compact due to the absence of porosity and capillary porosity in tiny non interconnected scale afgc setra 2013 these features offer them quite exceptional performance in term of durability compared to any other types of concrete when uhpfrc instead of nc is used in a bridge fender the crashworthiness and durability of the fender may be improved as well as the self weight of the fender may be reduced accordingly a new composite fender is proposed in this study by combining the promising material uhpfrc with the corrugated steel plates that are easily mass producible and have been demonstrated to possess high energy absorbing performance in ship structures hogström and ringsberg 2013 subsequently the new steel uhpfrc composite fender was experimentally and numerically studied the more common the uhpfrc is the more feasible and economical the proposed composite fender is in practical application thus the typical steel fibers with 2 volume that have often been used yoo and banthia 2017 zhang 2016 were adopted in the uhpfrc to investigate the applicability of the proposed composite fender four steel uhpfrc and one steel rc composite specimens were fabricated and tested through the drop hammer impact system at hunan university to explore the impact resistance of the proposed composite structure high resolution finite element fe models corresponding to the drop hammer impact tests were developed and validated the material parameters involved in the fe model were discussed in detail finally the validated fe modeling method was extended into simulating a practical bridge equipped with the proposed composite fender subjected to ship and barge collisions it was clearly observed that the proposed steel uhpfrc composite fender offers great potential for reducing impact force and response of a bridge structure as well as vessel damage in addition comparisons among the steel fender the steel nc composite fender and the steel uhpfrc composite fender were carried out and discussed 2 experimental procedures steel uhpfrc and steel rc composite structure specimens are described in this section drop hammer impact test setup and cases are given for the proposed composite fender structure 2 1 test specimens four steel uhpfrc composite structures were fabricated to investigate the impact behavior the overall configurations of the steel uhpfrc composite structures are illustrated in fig 1 generally the composite structure consists of the top and bottom uhpfrc panels the steel plate and the corrugated steel plate the presence of uhpfrc panel can help distribute the concentrated impact of a vessel over a larger area thereby resulting in the participant of more energy dissipated members while corrugated steel plates are designed to dissipate the impact energy and to reduce the impact force to an acceptable level for comparison one steel rc composite specimen was fabricated where the normal concrete instead of uhpfrc was used in the panels table 1 presents a total of five specimens in the drop hammer testing the thicknesses of the top and bottom panels are 45 mm and 40 mm respectively both the top and bottom steel plates attached to the panels are 4 mm thick two different thicknesses i e 1 mm and 2 mm were investigated for corrugated steel plates to address the influence of relative resistances between stiff guard and energy absorbing member steel bars with a diameter of 10 mm were embedded in the top and bottom panels to evaluate the influence of steel rebar ratio on impact resistances two different spacings 5 cm and 10 cm of reinforcing steel bars were investigated the layout of the reinforcing steel bar is illustrated in fig 1 a the corrugated plates were connected to the top and bottom steel plates with welding similar to the composite bridge deck in shao et al 2013 shear studs with a space of 150 mm welded in the top and bottom steel plates were employed to improve the connections between uhpfrc and steel plates as shown in fig 1 a cross section of the corrugated steel plate with dimensions in mm is given in fig 1 b the fabrications of the top and bottom panels are shown in fig 1 c and d respectively 2 2 materials and properties the mix proportions of uhpfrc and normal concrete used in the test are presented in tables 2 and 3 respectively the uhpfrc materials included 2 of hooked end steel fibers in volume specifically steel fibers were 13 mm in length and 0 2 mm in diameter as shown in fig 2 as mentioned above one typical type and volume of steel fibers were considered in this study further studies are worth pursuing to investigate the influences of fiber type and volume on the performance of the steel uhpfrc composite structure to determine the material properties multiple uhpfrc 100 100 100 mm and concrete 150 150 150 mm cubes were cast and cured at the same conditions of the uhpfrc and rc panels normal curing was placed on the rc panels by using regular water for 28 days the standard manufacturer recommended curing treatment which involved steam curing at 90 c and 95 percent relative humidity for 48 h starting 24 h after casting graybeal 2006 was applied to the uhpfrc panels and cubes according to the uniaxial testing shown in fig 3 a and b the compressive strengths of the uhpfrc and the normal concrete were measured and presented in tables 2 and 3 respectively similar to graybeal 2006 four point bending tests on beam specimens with a dimension of 100 100 400 mm was performed to determine the tensile strength of the uhpfrc as shown in fig 3 c e based on the measured data and the formulas in afgc setra 2013 the tensile strength was 8 1 mpa for the uhpfrc in this study q235 carbon steel widely used in china was selected to fabricate the top and bottom steel plates as shown in fig 1 as mentioned earlier very thin thicknesses 1 0 mm or 2 0 mm were arranged for the corrugated steel plates because the thicknesses of corrugated plates were too thin to be addressed by the q235 specification these plates were constructed from gb t 5213 2008 cold rolled low carbon steel sheets which are the most similar alternative to q235 carbon steel plate to determine the mechanical properties of steel plates quasi static uniaxial tension tests were performed in accordance with gb t 228 1 2010 2010 using sub sized flat specimens fig 4 and a sans cmt5105 electromechanical testing system fig 5 a to obtain the stress strain relationships a sans clip on extensometer was used to measure the elongation of the specimen similar to getter et al 2015 tests were paused to remove the extensometer when the measured strain approximated the maximum extensometer travel 0 18 mm mm then quasi static uniaxial tension tests were resumed until specimen failure according to the extrapolation method suggested by getter et al 2015 the relatively larger strain beyond 0 18 mm mm for each quasi static test was estimated based on the crosshead displacement of the sans machine specifically the measured strain displacement data for strains between 0 02 and 0 18 mm mm were used to fit a parabolic function the fitted function was then employed to predict all strains larger than 0 18 mm mm the similar testing was used to determine the mechanical properties of steel bars fig 4 b d show the specimens after testing fracture fig 5 b plots engineering stress strain curves obtained from the quasi static testing program the measured properties of two types of steel plates and steel bar are tabulated in tables 4 and 5 respectively 2 3 test setup a total of five impact scenarios in the drop hammer testing are given in table 1 primary parameters that were varied during testing included the material of the outer panel the thickness of corrugated steel plate and the shape of hammer tip for brevity each impact case is assigned an identification code e g uhpfrc 1 5 r the first word such as uhpfrc denotes the material of outer panel the first number means the thickness of corrugated plate and the second number represents the rebar spacing in centimeter as well as the last letter r or f denotes the shape of the hammer tip round and flat the setup for the drop hammer impact testing is schematically shown in fig 6 generally the drop hammer impact test setup included three main parts a specimen support system a drop hammer system and a measuring system the specimen support system consists of two steel support walls a 1 04 m long steel frame and eight steel i beams two steel support walls were connected by the 1 04 m long steel frame to form a whole group as a result the clear span of a specimen was also 1 04 m eight steel i beams were placed to fill the gap between the steel frame and the tested specimen finally a specimen steel uhpfrc or steel rc composite structures was anchored to the steel support walls through six bolts at each side as shown in fig 6 b and c in term of the impact system a high performance drop hammer testing machine at hunan university was used in this study as displayed in fig 6 b and c this drop hammer test device had been widely used and shown to be suitable for use in conducting impact testing liu et al 2017 to investigate the influence of hammer tip on impact induced responses two different hammer tips i e hemispherical and flat tips were considered there was a slight mass difference between these two hammer tips as a result the total mass 831 4 kg of drop hammer with a 100 mm radius hemispherical tip was slightly different from that 817 2 kg of drop hammer with a flat tip for each impact testing the drop hammer freely falling at a constant height of 1 5 m along the guide rails was used to impose the impact energy to the center of the top surface of the tested specimen a high frequency data acquisition system produced by ni company was employed to collect impact responses with a sampling frequency of 500 khz during drop hammer impact testing impact force data were measured by a load cell embedded in the drop hammer and vertical displacements of composite structures were recorded by displacement transducers as shown in fig 6 b a high speed camera with the frame per second fps of 3000 was arranged to visually record each impact test 3 test results and discussions results obtained from the drop hammer impact test program are described in the following section including failure mode impact force and structural displacement implications from these experimental data are also presented 3 1 failure mode and damage figs 7 and 8 present the failure modes of composite structure specimens subjected to various impact event scenarios see table 1 in the impact case uhpfrc 2 5 r a hemispherical pit with a diameter of 15 5 cm and a depth of 3 8 cm was formed in the uhpfrc panel and located at the hammer impact point while the overall damage or deformation of the corrugated plate was very small on the contrary large deformations occurred in the corrugated plate when its thickness was reduced from 2 mm to 1 mm i e uhpfrc 1 5 r only slight damage as opposed to the local heavy damage such as the hemispherical pit in the case uhpfrc 2 5 r was observed in the uhpfrc panel as shown in fig 8 this implies that the relative resistance between the outer panel and the inner energy absorbing member has a significant influence on the protective performance of a steel uhpfrc composite fender under impact loading similar to the impact case uhpfrc 1 5 r the overall damage deformation of the corrugated plate was relatively large when normal concrete was used instead of uhpfrc to construct the outer panel i e nc 1 5 r however the rc panel exhibited more severe damage than the uhpfrc panel under the same impact energy besides the hemispherical pit located at the impact point the main crack crossed through the rc panel in width and depth directions figs 7 and 8 this is attributed to the fact that the crashworthiness of the uhpfrc panel is considerably superior to the rc panel it is possible that a bridge pier fender suffers from several impacts with low to medium energy during its service life provided that normal concrete is used a relatively thick panel will be needed to achieve the expected crashworthiness as a result the weight of a fender is too heavy to be widely used in engineering practice the need is evident for utilizing uhpfrc panels in a composite fender structure compared to the impact case uhpfrc 1 5 r the rebar spacing in the top panel was increased from 5 cm to 10 cm in the uhpfrc 1 10 r the overall damage to the corrugated plate of the uhpfrc 1 10 r was almost the same as that of the case uhpfrc 1 5 r as shown in figs 7 and 8 also the outer panel exhibited similar extents of damage to that of the case uhpfrc 1 5 r the local damage tended to become severe because of the decrease in the rebar ratio accordingly it can be concluded that the rebar ratio has a weak effect on the crashworthiness of uhpfrc panel based on the test data of the cases uhpfrc 1 5 f and uhpfrc 1 5 r the influence of hammer tip on overall damage was not pronounced since the flat hammer tip was used instead of the hemispherical one the local damage in the outer panel of the uhpfrc 1 5 f was lighter than that in the uhpfrc 1 5 r 3 2 time history of impact force time histories of impact forces obtained from the drop hammer impact test program are shown in fig 9 for various impact scenarios the force time history in the case uhpfrc 2 5 r was apparently different from that of the case uhpfrc 1 5 r the use of a 1 mm thick corrugated plate led to a larger reduction in peak impact force e g from 388 9 kn to 261 7 kn the corresponding impact duration was increased to nearly two times that with 2 mm thick corrugated plates these mean that the relatively better buffer can be achieved by using a 1 mm thick corrugated plate for the given impact and the relative resistance between the outer panel and the corrugated plate is very crucial for reducing the impact force to attain an acceptable level in the proposed composite structure compared to the case uhpfrc 1 5 r the impact force was further reduced by 16 and the duration was slightly extended when the uhpfrc was replaced with the normal concrete as shown in fig 9 this is because the rc panel has the lower contact stiffness than the uhpfrc one however changing panel materials has a relatively limited effect on impact force in comparison with thinning the energy absorbing member corrugated plate moreover severe damage was observed in the outer rc panel therefore although the contact stiffness can be slightly reduced due to the use of rc panel its susceptibility to damage under a concentrated impact force will hamper applications in engineering practice similar to the preceding observations on structural damage the force time history in the case uhpfrc 1 10 r was almost identical to that of the case uhpfrc 1 5 r fig 9 only the peak force was slightly decreased with decreasing rebar ratio hence the influence of rebar ratio on impact force was not pronounced in contrast fig 9 a and e indicate that the shape of a hammer tip had an obvious influence on impact force particularly for peak force specifically the peak impact force increased when the flat tip was used to strike the specimen consolazio et al 2009 and fan and yuan 2014a evidenced that the impact force increases with the increase in the contact area apparently the contact area between the specimen and the hammer increased when the hemispherical tip was changed to the flat one 3 3 displacement results fig 9 f j presents mid span displacements of composite structures for various impact scenarios each displacement time history can be characterized by three different phases the loading phase the unloading phase and the free vibration phase take the experimental data observed from the case uhpfrc 1 5 r as the benchmark the overall maximum displacement decreased by 40 when the thickness of the corrugated plate increased from 1 mm to 2 mm while the maximum displacement increased by 23 when the panel materials were changed from uhpfrc to normal concrete similar to the preceding observations the rebar ratio in the outer panel was shown to weakly affect overall displacement distinct to the impact force results the hammer tip shape was shown to have no effect on the overall displacement accordingly the most sensitive factor influencing the overall deformation of a composite structure is the thickness of the corrugated plate followed by panel material and then hammer tip shape as well as the rebar ratio of the outer panel these findings will facilitate optimization of the steel uhpfrc composite fender in the future 4 fe modeling method and numerical investigations to further interpret the experimental data and conduct application studies high resolution finite element fe models were developed material e g uhpfrc and steel models and parameters used in the fe models were discussed in detail fe modeling technique for predicting the impact induced response of a steel uhpfrc composite structure was validated against the impact tests which provided a basis for simulating vessel collisions with bridge structures equipped with steel uhpfrc composite fenders 4 1 fe modeling two fe models with different fidelity were developed to simulate composite structures subjected to drop hammer impact loading fig 10 a illustrates the fe model with the slight simplification of minor details such as shear stud and weld seam specifically an ideal bond was assumed between the outer panel and the top or bottom steel plates through sharing common nodes corrugated plates were also connected to the top or bottom plates using sharing common nodes solid elements were used to model the uhpfrc and concrete as well as the drop hammer and steel plates and bars were modelled by belytschko tsay shell elements and beam elements respectively the contact between the drop hammer and the composite structure was defined via the keyword contact auto surface to surface lstc 2014 internal contacts after composite structures deformed were modelled by using contact single surface for comparison a high fidelity fe model shown in fig 10 b was developed to investigate the influence of minor details on numerical results beam elements were used to model shear studs and the contact instead of sharing common nodes was arranged between the top steel plate and the outer panel small holes for connecting the corrugated plate with the top or bottom steel plate were taken into account and welded connections between them were formed using thousands of individual constrained node sets except for the above particular treatments other definitions in the high fidelity fe model were identical to the simplified fe model fig 10 4 1 1 concrete and uhpfrc material models a smooth or continuous surface cap csc model was initially developed to simulate concrete used in roadside safety structures when involved in a collision with a motor vehicle lstc 2014 murray 2007 generally this model includes isotropic constitutive equations yield and hardening surface and damage formulation to simulate softening and modulus reduction lstc 2014 murray 2007 a smooth and continuous intersection was formulated between hardening cap and failure surface in the csc model the failure function of the csc model is based on three invariants and cap hardening parameter as follows lstc 2014 murray 2007 1 f j 1 j 2 j 3 κ j 2 ℜ 2 f f 2 f c where j 1 is the first invariant of the stress tensor j 2 and j 3 are the second and third invariants of the deviatoric stress tensor respectively κ is the cap hardening parameter which equals to the value of the pressure invariant at the intersection of the cap and shear surfaces ℜ is the rubin three invariant reduction factor f c is the hardening cap which is a two part function that is either unity or an ellipse and is related to cap aspect ratio r cap initial location x 0 maximum plastic volume compaction w and linear shape parameter d 1 as well as quadratic shape parameter d 2 these input parameters in the csc model can be estimated by fitting pressure volumetric strain curves measured in hydrostatic compression and uniaxial strain tests in eq 1 f f is the shear failure surface which can be written as 2 f f j 1 α λ exp β j 1 θ j 1 where α β λ and θ are the shear failure surface parameters which can be determined from fitting the failure surface to triaxial compression txc test data the strengths in torsion tor and triaxial extension txe can be estimated by the product functions q 1 f f and q 2 f f respectively the scaling functions q 1 and q 2 are expressed as 3 q 1 α 1 λ 1 exp β 1 j 1 θ 1 j 1 4 q 2 α 2 λ 2 exp β 2 j 1 θ 2 j 1 where α 1 2 β 1 2 λ 1 2 and θ 1 2 are the tor and txe yield surface parameters respectively which can be determined based on the tor and txe test data respectively besides the input parameters related to failure surface and cap hardening elastic constants and damage parameters should be determined beforehand generally a total of 45 input parameters need be provided for the use of the csc model for easy to use murray 2007 provided a set of standardized concrete material properties for use as default parameters only the unconfined compression strength grade the aggregate size and the units are required to generate default csc model parameters for normal concrete recently the csc model with default parameters has been demonstrated to be robust in the similar field of low velocity impact analysis liu et al 2017 fan and yuan 2014b hence the default parameters related to failure surfaces cap hardening and damage formulations which were generated from the tested uniaxial compressive strength of the normal concrete were used in this study for strain rate effects of normal concrete the formulas provided in ceb fib model code fib 2013 have been widely used and evidenced to be conservative guner and vecchio 2012 hence these formulas were employed to determine strain rate parameters in this study the dynamic increase factor dif c for concrete compression can be written as fib 2013 5 d i f c f c d f c ε ε c 0 0 014 for 30 10 6 s 1 ε 30 s 1 0 012 ε ε c 0 1 3 for 30 s 1 ε 3 10 2 s 1 where f c d is the dynamic uniaxial compressive strength f c is the uniaxial compressive strength ε is the strain rate ε c 0 30 10 6 s 1 for tension the dynamic increase factor dif t of normal concrete can be expressed by fib 2013 6 d i f t f t d f t ε ε t 0 0 018 for 1 10 6 s 1 ε 10 s 1 0 0 0 62 ε ε t 0 1 3 for 10 s 1 ε 3 10 2 s 1 where f t d is the dynamic uniaxial tensile strength f t is the static uniaxial tensile strength ε t 0 1 10 6 s 1 according to murray 2007 the dynamic increase factors dif c and dif t in compression and tension can be respectively expressed by 7 d i f c f c d f c 1 e ε η c f c 1 e ε η 0 c f c ε n c 8 d i f t f t d f t 1 e ε η t f t 1 e ε η 0 t f t ε n t where e is young s modulus η 0 c and η 0 t are the rate effect parameter for uniaxial compression and tension respectively n c and n t are the rate effect power for compression and tension respectively it is apparent that eqs 7 and 8 implemented in the csc model are different from the ceb prescribed formulas eqs 5 and 6 in form to apply the ceb prescribed formulas to account for strain rate effects the data points shown in fig 11 were generated using eqs 5 and 6 subsequently the input parameters e g n t and n c of the csc model were estimated by using the least square method to fit the data points shown in fig 11 a detailed procedure for the modification can be found in guo et al 2018 accordingly all input parameters in the csc model were determined and presented in table 6 for the normal concrete in addition to the normal concrete it is more important to determine the material model and parameters for the uhpfrc currently few studies placed an emphasis on investigating the constitutive model of uhpfrc for low velocity impact simulation considering the advantages of the csc model for low velocity impact simulations guo et al 2018 extended it to simulate uhpfrc materials based on experimental data the failure surface parameters in eqs 2 4 can be determined through fitting the typical states of stress obtained from physical experiments guo et al 2018 for example uniaxial compression and biaxial and triaxial tension as well as two stress states of triaxial compression were used to determine the parameters in eq 2 importantly uhpfrc materials have a particular strain hardening behavior in tension due to the presence of steel fibers for the uhpfrc used in this study zhang 2016 experimentally investigated the tensile behaviors e g strain hardening in detail hence the damage parameters can be determined by approximating the tensile behaviors reported in zhang 2016 fujikake et al 2005 and fujikake et al 2008 investigated the strain rate effects of uhpfrc through physical experiments and summarized the following equations 9 d i f c f c d f c ε ε s c 0 0055 log ε ε s c 0 951 for ε ε s c 1 for ε ε s c 10 d i f t f t d f t ε ε s t 0 0013 log ε ε s t 1 95 for ε ε s t 1 for ε ε s t where ε s c 1 2 10 5 s 1 and ε s t 1 0 10 6 s 1 similar to the above procedure of normal concrete the strain rate parameters e g n t and n c of the uhpfrc were estimated by fitting the data points fig 11 that were determined from eqs 9 and 10 more details on the determination of the uhpfrc parameters can be found in guo et al 2018 table 6 presents all input parameters for the uhpfrc used in the drop hammer impact tests the corresponding stress strain curves were obtained from single solid element simulations and presented in fig 12 a which were in agreement with the test results reported in zhang 2016 4 1 2 steel material model the material model mat piecewise linear plasticity mat 24 was used to simulate all steel plates in the proposed composite structure true stress strain curves need to be provided when the elasto plastic material model is combined with shell elements lstc 2014 hence based on the combined material relation suggested by villavicencio et al 2014 the engineering stress strain curves of the steel plates fig 5 were converted to the corresponding true stress strain curves as shown in fig 12 b similarly the elasto plastic material model mat 24 was also employed to simulate steel bars in this study but stress strain data obtained from the tensile tests of the steel bars fig 5 were directly used in defining the elasto plastic material model because necking behavior was omitted for beam elements like guo et al 2018 the strain rate effects of these steel materials were taken into account by the following equations 11 f s d f s 1 202 0 040 log 10 ε 1 0 where f s and f s d are the static and dynamic yield strengths of the steel materials respectively 4 2 validation of fe model for each impact scenario numerical results are presented in fig 9 along with corresponding experimental results overall two different fe models in fig 10 provided the similar predictions on the impact responses of the composite structures this implies that the influences of the minor details such as shear stud and welding seam are not pronounced also the force time histories and the mid span displacements obtained from numerical simulations are in good agreement with the experimental data except the peak impact force in the case uhpfrc 1 5 f as shown in fig 9 e the peak impact force obtained from fe simulation is far greater than the experimental result this is attributed to the fact that the contact condition assumed in fe simulation is different from the real condition in the impact testing specifically the contacting surfaces of both the top panel and the flat hammer tip were assumed to be perfectly horizontal however this assumption is unrealistic for experiments a tiny variation in the contact condition between the flat hammer and the top panel may dramatically change the peak impact force as shown in fig 9 e the numerically obtained peak force was very close to the test result when the drop hammer rotated only two degrees but it was observed from fig 9 j that the impact induced displacement was not sensitive to such changes on the contrary the peak impact force tended to be less sensitive to the tiny variation in the contact condition when the composite structure was subjected to the impact from a hemispherical hammer strain rate was shown to have an obvious effect on the impact induced responses particularly for mid span displacements of steel uhpfrc composite specimens generally the numerically obtained displacements with strain rate effects were less than those without strain rate effects for the sake of conservatism the strain rate effects were omitted in the fe simulation of steel uhpfrc composite fenders subjected to vessel collisions indeed it is worth mentioning that the strain rate effects of uhpfrc and steel materials and their influences should be further investigated experimentally in the future figs 7 and 8 present overall and local damages obtained from fe simulations along with the experimental observations generally the developed fe models were capable of producing reasonable predictions on overall damages of the composite structures these results further demonstrate the applicability of the developed fe modeling in simulating the proposed composite structure under impact loading local damages obtained from fe simulations are slightly different from experimental observations this is partially attributed to the fact that the damage mechanism of uhpfrc differs from that of normal concrete guo et al 2018 further efforts should be made to improve the csc model in theory for predicting damage characteristics of uhpfrc structures under impact loading more accurately 5 application and discussions of the composite fender the tongjin bridge which was being designed to cross the xiangjiang river in china was selected as an example to illustrate the application of steel uhpfrc composite structure as shown in fig 13 a the bridge owner prescribed that the bridge piers should withstand the collision of a 2000 deadweight dwt vessel as the agency of the bridge owner fan et al 2016b conducted a risk based analysis for the bridge based on aashto specification aashto 2009 and numerical simulations the investigation indicated that the auxiliary piers i e nos 38 and 41 had a relatively low safety margin compared to the main tower piers this result is consistent with the implications of some catastrophic accidents such as the collapses of the i 40 bridge over the arkansas river and the jiujiang bridge in china fan 2012 all these catastrophic accidents began with the failures of the off channel piers that were struck by an errant vessel for this reason the bridge owner required the investigators to design protective structures for the auxiliary piers accordingly the steel uhpfrc composite fender shown in fig 13 b were proposed by fan et al 2016b as the protection for the auxiliary piers the overall constitution of the fender system was the same as the previously investigated steel uhpfrc composite structure some specific details such as concave rear panels and d shape rubber were arranged in the fender system to reduce the peak impact force and to improve the economy to avoid flooding water and sinking after severe damage light foams like materials used in floating circles were employed to fill in the gap inside the composite fender but its energy absorbing capacity can be omitted in comparison with corrugated steel plates 5 1 fe modeling for vessel fender bridge collision to investigate the performance of the steel uhpfrc composite fender under vessel collisions high resolution fe models were developed and shown in fig 14 in the fe models the bridge structure including its superstructure and substructure was simulated to reasonably model its dynamic characteristics under impact loading for simplification linear elastic material models e g mat elastic in ls dyna were adopted to describe concrete and steel materials used in the bridge structure the main parameters regarding the bridge concrete and steel are presented in table 7 two different vessels shown in fig 14 were chosen to investigate the performance of the steel uhpfrc composite fender the first one was the 2000 dwt bulk carrier with a twin tail fin and bulbous bow that often sails in inland waterways in china similar to fan et al 2015 consolazio et al 2009 fan and yuan 2014a the ship fe model was divided into two zones a bow portion and a hull portion to keep a balance between accuracy and efficiency fine meshes were used to simulate the bow portion see fig 15 a and b while the hull portion was simplified and modelled using coarse meshes the elasto plastic model mat plastic kinematic was used for the steel in the bow portion and the hull steel material was defined by the rigid material model mat rigid similar to fan and yuan 2014a the verification on the ship fe model was performed based on the empirical formulas in aashto 2009 and china s bridge design codes ministry of communications of china 2015 the impact forces obtained using the numerical model were close to those calculated from the empirical formulas indicating the applicability of the ship fe model the second one was the jumbo hopper barge that was outlined in aashto 2009 according to the detailed structural drawings in consolazio et al 2014 the barge fe model was developed as illustrated in fig 15 c and d similarly the barge bow was finely modelled using shell elements to mimic the actual geometric shape the barge fe model was shown to be capable of providing close estimates of the impact force versus bow deformation curves to the results reported in consolazio et al 2014 when the same parameters were used detailed modeling of the bridge structure and these two vessels can be found in fan et al 2016b the previously validated fe modeling was extended to model the steel uhpfrc composite fender system as shown in fig 16 material properties of the uhpfrc were set to be the same as those in the drop hammer tests the average thickness of the outer uhpfrc panel was 8 cm the hrb400 steel bars were distributed in the uhpfrc panel with a space of 10 cm and the q235 carbon steels with a thickness of 8 mm were used to fabricate the straight and corrugated steel plates of the composite fender the material parameters recommended by china s design specification ministry of communications of china 2015 were adopted to simulate these steel materials and the strain rate effects with respect to the fender materials were omitted for conservation considerations solid elements combined with the material model mat mooney rivlin rubber fig 16 were used to model the d shape rubber the detailed material parameters of the composite fender are presented in table 7 table 8 presents the main collision scenarios that were investigated in this study head on collision and oblique collision with an angle of 20 were considered for the ship and the barge respectively collision scenarios with no fenders were simulated for comparison according to the method recommended by aashto 2009 the design impact speed of 3 21 knots was determined based on typical vessel transit speed the channel arrangement and overall length of the 2000 dwt ship which was agreed with the bridge owner for the economy 5 2 effectiveness of the proposed composite fender results e g impact force displacement and structural internal force obtained from numerical simulations are presented in figs 17 20 for various collision scenarios respectively the maximum values of the impact induced responses are summarized in fig 21 damages for the vessels and the fenders after the collisions are shown in fig 22 for the head on collision of the 2000 dwt ship the peak impact force decreased from 8 96 mn to 5 12 mn 43 drop in magnitude when the steel uhpfrc composite fender was placed to protect the auxiliary pier as shown in figs 17 and 21 strictly speaking the direct contact between the ship and the bridge did not occur because the contact forces between them were always zero see fig 17 the contact forces between the vessel and the fender were generally similar to those between the fender and the pier this result can be addressed based on newton s third theorem however an obvious difference between them can be observed at the beginning phase of a collision a sudden increase occurred in the contact force between the fender and the pier while a relatively low magnitude was presented in the contact force between the vessel and the fender this is because the steel uhpfrc composite structure was designed to float with water levels and there was a gap 0 5 m between the uhpfrc panel and the pier surface to begin with the collision the vessel pushed the floating fender forward before contacting with the bridge pier then the contact between the fender and the pier occurred suddenly hence a relatively large dynamic resistance was achieved due to the contributions from the stiffness and inertia force related to the fender and the pier in addition to the reduction in the impact force the presence of the composite fender would lead to obvious decreases in impact induced responses e g pier top displacement and pier bottom moment and vessel damage in the ship head on collision scenario see figs 17 21 and 22 similarly the peak impact force fig 18 decreased considerably when the bridge structure equipped with the fender was subjected to the head on collision of the barge compared to the ship head on collision the reductions in impact induced responses tended to decrease when the composite fender was used in the barge head on collision scenario as shown in figs 18 and 21 this is attributed to the fact that the decrease in average impact force was relatively small and the impact induced displacement and internal forces were primarily dependent upon the average impact force rather than the peak value for barge collisions for the oblique collision with an angle of 20 both the impact forces and corresponding responses in the transverse direction of the bridge were substantially smaller than those of the head on collision no matter whether the composite fender was equipped or not the impact induced responses of the longitudinal direction are usually relatively small except the pier top displacement this is because the longitudinal removability was arranged as opposed to the fixed constraint in the transverse direction although the reduction in the impact force was slight the pier top displacement descended obviously because of the presence of the composite fender as shown in figs 19 21 this is because impact induced displacement is dependent not only on peak impact force but also on input impulse and duration of impact force chopra 2007 typically the ratio of input impulse to impact duration called average impact force can be adopted to reflect their influences based on the data shown in figs 19 and 20 the decreases in average impact forces were observed to be consistent with those of the pier top displacements compared to other responses in oblique collisions the reduction in shear force was the smallest when the bridge structure was collided by the 2000 dwt ship this may be because the vibration frequency shown in the fender pier contact force fig 19 a is close to that of the shear force curve fig 19 d thus further studied should be conducted to optimize the composite fender subjected to an oblique collision all in all the proposed composite fender was demonstrated as being capable of effectively decreasing impact forces and responses as well as vessel damage and extending impact duration 5 3 comparisons of different fenders and discussions in addition to examining the effectiveness of the steel uhpfrc composite fender three different types of fenders including steel uhpfrc composite fender steel nc composite fender and steel fender were compared for further discussions the panel material was changed from uhpfrc to nc c30 in the steel nc composite fender whereas the concrete panel was removed from the steel fender all other definitions are the same as the steel uhpfrc composite fender for comparison purposes generally three different types of fenders yielded similar effectiveness regarding decreasing impact forces and responses for the given collisions with the design energy as shown in figs 17 23 sometimes e g barge head on collision the responses with the steel fenders were less than those of the composite fenders this is attributed to the fact that the steel fender possesses the lower resistances when the concrete panel is removed importantly the above experiments revealed that the composite fender could be optimized by adjusting the thickness of the inner steel plate accordingly for the barge head on collision figs 18 and 21 the same decreases in impact forces and responses as seen in the steel fender was achieved in the proposed composite fender when the inner steel plates were thinned from 8 mm to 4 mm thus although the uhpfrc panel is added the amount of steel used can be greatly reduced by 50 in the proposed fender more importantly although the steel fender was shown to be effective in the reduction of impact forces and responses aashto 2009 highlighted that steel fenders are susceptible to corrosion and to fire even explosion because of metal to metal contact with steel hulled vessels carrying flammable cargo it is apparent that these intrinsic disadvantages considerably limit the application of steel fender for each collision scenario the steel nc composite fender always exhibited much more damage than the steel uhpfrc composite fender see fig 23 this is consistent with the experimental observations e g figs 7 and 8 in this study particularly in a frequent oblique collision the damage of the nc panel was relatively severe whereas slight damage was observed in the steel uhpfrc composite fender this implies that cracks in the nc panel are evident under a frequent low energy collision or even environmental loads this is attributed to the fact that normal concrete has the low tensile strength and low crashworthiness since the fender is constantly subjected to oxygen and water i e moist and aggressive environment the durability might still be problematic for the use of nc panel particularly after a frequent collision or a low energy collision in addition to mechanical strengths uhpfrc materials have been experimentally demonstrated to have excellent durability batoz and behloul 2009 wang et al 2015 this is attributed to the fact that uhpfrc materials are extremely dense and compact due to the absence of porosity and capillary porosity in microscopic non interconnected scale moreover some experiments pointed out that because there is a non negligible quantity of non hydrated clinker in hardened uhpfrc the clinker can be hydrated in a humid environment and therefore offers the feature of self healing pimienta and chanvillard 2004 moreover much more damage implies that more difficulties might be placed for the repair of the steel nc composite fender after a collision overall some intrinsic limitations e g durability or low crashworthiness that are hardly overcome would block the applications of steel fenders and steel nc composite fenders the proposed steel uhpfrc composite fender can be an alternative solution for bridge protection because of the advantages such as high crashworthiness and high durability 6 conclusions a new steel uhpfrc composite fender was proposed in this study to overcome the limitations of the conventional steel fender such as the durability and the energy absorbing capacity low velocity impact behaviors of the composite fender structure were experimentally and numerically investigated the protective performances of the proposed composite fender were evaluated when it was applied to a practical bridge as the fender system based on the detailed experimental and numerical studies the following conclusions can be drawn 1 relative resistances stiffness between the uhpfrc panel stiff guard and the corrugated steel plate energy absorbing member played an important role in the protective performance of the composite fender under impact loading local damage on the uhpfrc panel became more severe with increasing the thickness of the corrugated plate impact forces were sensitive to the thickness of corrugated plate compared to panel material and rebar ratio this implies that the reduction in impact force can be effectively achieved by adjusting the thickness of the corrugated plate in the proposed fender 2 the drop hammer impact test showed that the panel made of normal concrete was more vulnerable to the concentrated impact force than the uhpfrc panel in addition to the crashworthiness uhpfrc materials possess higher durability than normal concrete and facilitate lightening structural self weight owing to these advantages uhpfrc materials are preferred for the outer panel of the composite fender structure 3 the influence of the rebar ratio of the uhpfrc panel on the impact induced responses and damage was not pronounced only local damage on the uhpfrc panel was slightly affected by rebar ratio the peak impact force was sensitive to the shape of the hammer tip because of the change of the contact area but not the displacement of the composite structure 4 two fe models with different fidelity were developed to predict the impact induced responses of the composite structures numerical results obtained from these two different fe models were in good agreement with the experimental data indicating the rationality of the developed fe modeling method it was found that minor details such as the shear stud and the weld seam had little effect on the numerical results 5 an application study was performed using the validated fe modeling to investigate the protective performance of the proposed fender the steel uhpfrc composite fender was demonstrated as being capable of effectively reducing impact forces and responses as well as vessel damage and extending impact duration the reductions in impact induced responses were smaller than that of the peak impact force for the barge head on collision this was because the average impact force had a greater influence on the impact induced responses than did the peak impact force in addition since the impact induced responses of the oblique collision were often relatively small the effectiveness of the composite fender decreased somewhat 6 comparisons among the steel fender the steel nc composite fender and the steel uhpfrc composite fender were performed by fe simulations three different types of fenders yielded similar effectiveness in terms of decreasing impact forces and responses in the case study however the steel nc composite fender always exhibited much more damage than the steel uhpfrc composite fender because normal concrete has low tensile strength whereas the steel fender has significant disadvantages such as durability that are highlighted by aashto these intrinsic limitations e g durability or low crashworthiness that are hardly overcome would block their applications the proposed steel uhpfrc composite fender can be an alternative solution for bridge protection because of its potentials in crashworthiness and durability the application study was performed only to demonstrate the potential of the proposed composite fender further experimental and numerical investigations are deemed necessary in the future to optimize the configuration and to improve the protective performance of the proposed composite fender for practical

23138,fire in a sealed ship engine room is different from open fires while its suppression is critically important to the emergency rescue and structure safety for a ship this study focused on the vertical distribution of temperature rise during a sealed engine room fire a series of experiments were carried out to investigate fire behaviors in a reduced scale sealed ship engine room with a dimension of 3 m length 3 m width 3 5 m height the results suggested that there are vertical temperature gradients of smoke layer showing a little lower than those of open fires the experimental results demonstrated that the time to reach the maximum temperature is different for smoke layers at various heights while a lower height showed a relatively long delay time the vertical gradient of temperature rise was found increasing with pool diameter where the gradient of temperature rise of a 30 cm pool fire is about 9 times of that of a 10 cm pool fire furthermore an empirical model was developed to predict the vertical temperature rise distribution along the height at the time of the maximum temperature for sealed engine room fires keywords ship safety sealed engine room fire pool

introduction one of the most disastrous situations threatening passengers occupants in ships and related constructions is fire which comes with high risk and uncertainty kang et al 2017 salem 2016 su and wang 2013 in fire emergency circumstances of a ship to close the burning engine room is a final taken and efficient means to extinguish the fire especially when the ship is at sea without any help or support for this case ship engine room is completely closed and the fire will be eventually extinguished due to the lack of oxygen sealed engine room fire is a special type as it is isolated from the ambient environment smoke and combustion products released from fire sources cannot be exhausted outside and no fresh air is entrained into ship engine room as well as a result fire behaviors in a sealed engine room then is distinctly different from those of open fires zhang et al 2013a 2013b 2015 yuan et al 2014 tatem et al 1986 li et al 2011 yang et al 2013 temperature or temperature rise is one of the critical parameters regarding the fire characteristics which is essential to address the smoke movement and related suppression measures based on temperature the initiation development and extinguishment stages of sealed fires can be identified accordingly wang et al 2017 yao et al 2017 yoon et al 2010 if a sealed engine room fire cannot be suppressed directly by fire extinguishing system one of the alternative measures is to seal the engine room and wait for its self extinguishment pu 2009 after sealing the engine room fire can be suppressed when the oxygen concentration drops to a certain value after the fire is extinguished the right time to reopen the ship engine room is very important this is because the engine room is rich of fuel and also under high temperature conditions so re ignition even backdraft may occur after sudden fresh air entrance trouve and wang 2010 more importantly the influences of hot smoke on the engine room structure are worthy of being studied especially on accurately identifying or predicting the failure location of the engine room structure which is significant to the structural risk assessment or fire emergency rescue kim et al 2017 jin et al 2016 jin and jang 2015 therefore the temperature distribution of sealed engine room fires is a practically important research topic previous studies regarding the temperature rise in compartment fires especially for a building fire has been studied for several years representative models such as m q h method f p a method beyler method etc walton et al 2016 these models were developed based on the conservation of energy and mass for the gas phase inside the enclosure with openings or under well ventilation these models are typical zone models including one zone and two zone models the basic assumption of zone models is considered uniform for a one zone model or the upper layer of the two zone model these models can predict the average temperatures which reflect the heat accumulation in the enclosure nevertheless detailed temperature profiles are still a challenge of prediction as we conduct the thermo mechanical coupling analysis to assess the structural safety of ship engine room the knowledge of the detailed temperature profiles is compulsory in the aspect of experimental study hu et al conducted a series of fire experiments in a closed ship engine room and found that the temperature profile at the moment of self extinction follows the boltzmann distribution hu et al 2010 zhang et al have investigated experimentally the vertical temperature distribution induced by an elevated fire in a ceiling vented ship compartment and found that the temperature of the upper layer was much higher than that of the lower layer zhang 2014 li et al 2018 the stratification of the temperature was distinct including two regions of the hot upper layer and the cold lower layer according to the measured temperature additionally li and chen have conducted experiments in a horizontally vented ship enclosure smoke filled up the enclosure quickly after ignition and temperature seemed to increase gradually with height in most cases which was quite similar to some forced ventilation compartment fires li 2010 chen 2011 in numerical simulation studies some studies focused on sealed engine room fires were based on numerical modeling su et al 2012 wang et al 2013 salem 2013 bonte et al 2013 jia et al 1997 sekret et al 2013 the temperature distribution volume fractions of gas species and thickness of smoke layer were investigated numerically another challenge is that the zone modeling which divides the whole space into several vertical layers may be no longer applicable to sealed engine room fires yuan et al 2014 in addition some theoretical models have been developed regarding the prediction of temperatures in sealed engine rooms a five zone theoretical model tatem et al 1986 was developed to predict the temperature in a gas tight enclosure which was based on the assumption that the combustion products and evaporated fuel are fully mixed another way of simplification is to consider a unified temperature for smoke layers li et al 2011 yang et al 2013 computational fluid dynamics models zhang et al 2015 were also utilized to address the situation however there is still a gap between the prediction and experiments research efforts are especially needed from the experimental aspects based upon the above analysis previous studies have largely focused on the ship fires in ventilated or unsealed engine rooms leaving very few studies on fully sealed engine room fire the purpose of this study mainly focuses on the vertical distribution of temperature rise induced by fire in a sealed ship engine room there are three main sections the first section presents an introduction of a reduced scale experimental rig the second section focuses on experimental results and analysis including average mass loss rate average heat release rate and vertical temperature rise the third section conducts a dimensionless analysis of vertical temperature distribution at the time of maximum temperature and proposes a mathematical model 2 experimental methodology a bench scale ship engine room model was built to conduct a series of experiments as shown in fig 1 in this figure a transparent front wall was used only to show the inside items which does not mean that the wall of the testing engine room is transparent to facilitate the observation of fire burning behaviors in a sealed ship engine room during experimental tests several circular holes are set as experimental observation windows in the front and back walls which are made of quartz glass and can stand for a high temperature of 600 c this ship engine room model consists of four parts namely testing engine room temperature measurement system data collection system and weighing device the details of each part are introduced as follows 1 testing engine room previous experimental studies were much focused on a relatively smaller engine room model than the one used in this study for example zhang et al 2013a 2013b studied the characteristics of pool fire in two closed compartments while one is 3 m length 3 m width 1 95 m height and the other is 1 m length 1 m width 0 75 m height the dimension of the current testing engine room is 3 m length 3 m width 3 5 m height as shown in fig 1 the design of this engine room was following the chinese code cb t3368 2013 cb t3368 2013 2013 the wall was made of rockwool steel sandwich panel with a middle layer of 20 mm rockwool while the external and internal layers were 4 mm and 1 5 mm carbon steel panels respectively the internal lining was made by 25 mm alumina silica insulation board the floor was also made by the sandwich panel while its bottom middle and top layers were made of 1 5 mm carbon steel 20 mm rockwool and 4 mm carbon steel respectively a 1 5 mm anti slip panel was used at the top of the floor a quick open watertight door was used with good airtightness a rotating handle and water seal strips were used to ensure the door can be fully sealed to avoid leakage the designs of related insulation for the door were following cb t3368 2013 cb t3368 2013 2013 with a dimension of 1 6 m length 0 8 m width 0 04 m depth 2 temperature measurement system k type thermocouples were employed to record the temperature history at different heights which also represent the time varying temperature of the smoke layer the thermocouple tree on side a where each thermocouple is mounted with 30 cm depth into the ship engine room is located vertically along the centerline of a side wall here each thermocouple being inserted into the engine room with 30 cm depth is to avoid the effects of the anti buoyant jet behavior on the temperature measurement thirty measured spots are arranged vertically from 3 4 m to 0 5 m heights with an interval of 0 1 m which are labeled by t1 to t30 respectively the measuring temperature range of these thermocouples is about 600 c which is enough for the measurement of smoke temperature in this study their response time is 1 s namely with a measurement frequency of 1 hz 3 data collection system the computer with a special configuration software system installed can automatically record the data taken during the experiments including temperature history and mass loss the sampling frequency of the data collection system is also 1 hz the data collection includes the temperature measurement data of those 30 thermocouples mentioned above and the mass loss of fuel taken by the electronic balance 4 weighing device an electronic weighing device called es 5000 was utilized to record the total mass of liquid fuel and the container fuel pan in real time the maximum reading is 5 kg with an accuracy of 0 01 g the sampling frequency of this weighing device is 1 hz liquid pool fire is one of the most common types of ship fire as ships usually contain large amount liquid such as lubrication oil machine oil and fuel oil generally the liquid pool could happen due to the leakage accident from the vessel or pipe during transportation or storage the liquid pool can spread under the gravity or floor with slope and liquid pool with different depths can be formed under different scenarios it can be then ignited by high temperature contact or direct flame which can be classified as class b fire the commonly used oil for a ship would be fuel oil or hydraulic oil which is basically hydrocarbon n heptane as a commonly used hydrocarbon fuel is a stable burning source which has been largely used in previous fire experiments hu et al 2005 utiskul et al 2005 in this study to be consistent with previous studies n heptane was then used as well for the sake of simplicity the oil pool fires used in experiments were placed in the center of the engine room floor the depths of the oil pools with different diameters were all 10 cm the diameters of liquid fuel pan were 10 15 20 30 and 35 cm respectively except for 10 cm pool fire the initial amount of fuel in each test was sufficient to maintain combustion under fully sealed conditions the use of 10 cm pool fire was taken preliminarily to identify the type of extinguishment namely oxygen based or fuel based as stated above the main purpose of this study is to conduct related experiments to simulate the case of fire self extinguishing by sealing the ship engine room in experiments we can open or close the air inlet and outlet by adjusting the solenoid valve control the air inlet and outlet of the testing engine room are both closed simultaneously after ignition then both the outlet and inlet air fans were turned off as well during the whole experimental period meanwhile after the experiments completed the smoke exhaust is done by opening the outlet and launching the fan then we open the air inlet and the air inlet fan as the smoke temperature drops to about 100 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 average mass loss rate burning process is accompanied by chemical reactions which consume both fuel and oxygen for open fires it is usually considered that only the evaporated fuel is involved in the chemical reactions under the situation the burning rate of the liquid fuel is equal to its evaporation rate a higher burning rate represents more released heat from the fire source and the released heat during a unit time period is then defined as heat release rate in sealed compartment fires environmental conditions of combustion such as pressure air density and oxygen concentration change frequently along the burning process while the burning rate changes very complexly under low oxygen conditions not all evaporated fuel can be involved in the chemical reactions during the burning process so the burning rate of the fuel is less than mass loss rate this explains why the burning rate of fuel in sealed spaces is smaller than those in open spaces it is also known from the previous study tatem et al 1986 that the rising temperature can increase the evaporation rate of the liquid fuel eventually the dropping oxygen concentration will reduce the evaporation rate through its influence on the flame height and air entrainment rate the mass of liquid fuel was measured during the whole experimental period the fuel mass loss history in the time period from ignition to extinguishment is shown in fig 2 by plotting fuel mass versus the time for each test it is observed the mass shows a good linear relationship with the time the fitting lines were linearly obtained for each scenario with a goodness of fit of more than 0 9 as illustrated in fig 2 through linear regression analysis the absolute value of the slope from the fitting line is the average mass loss rate during the whole burning process it is easily seen that the average mass loss rate increases with a bigger diameter of a pool fire the average mass loss rate increases from 0 078 to 1 06 g s when pool diameter increases from 10 to 30 cm it needs to be noticed that the average mass loss rates are nearly the same for 30 and 35 cm pool fire the possible reason for this is as follows it can be seen from fig 2 d and e that the mass loss rate of 30 cm pool fire at the later stage in the red circle increases than that in the previous stage seen from the recorded experimental video it can be hypothesized that the temperature of the pool wall increases resulting in a relatively rapid heat transfer that the liquid fuel inside the pool then goes to boiling under this circumstance a part of the liquid fuel then splashes out of the pool resulting in ghost fire when they go through the evaporation process for the 35 cm pool fire the mass loss rate at the early stage is relatively larger than that of the 30 cm pool fire but in the later stage the splashed liquid fuel is relatively less as comparing to that of the 30 cm pool fire therefore with the combined effects the 30 cm and 35 cm pool fires show a similar average mass loss rate during the whole combustion stage as the average mass loss rate is dependent on combustion during early and late stages the similar average mass loss rate does not mean that the 30 and 35 cm pool fires show a similar transient burning rate further research should be carried out in the future it should be noticed that for the pool fires with over 15 cm diameter ghost fire can be observed at the later stage of combustion or when the burning approaches to extinguishment ghost fire is a special kind of fire phenomenon sugawa et al 1991 firstly found the ghost fire behavior in a poorly ventilated compartment fire test in which he concluded that ghost fire can occur in a poorly ventilated or sealed space that the oxygen concentration is much lower than the ambient level so at the later stage of fire burning due to the lack of oxygen the flame can detach completely from the fuel source the mechanism of ghosting is not yet fully understood fig 3 shows the ghost fire under 30 cm pool fire pan it is important to know that the ghost fire obviously has a significant impact on mass loss rate and spatial temperature distribution for example the mass loss rate with both 20 and 30 cm pool fire pans fluctuate obviously when approaching to the end some previous studies have also reported the same phenomenon for sealed engine room fires li et al 2010 furtherly the ghost fire also affects the mass loss rate and temperature distributions in the sealed engine room it can be known from fig 2 that the average mass loss rate for 10 15 20 30 and 35 cm diameter pools are about 0 01 0 008 0 018 0 015 and 0 011 kg m2 s respectively the average mass loss rate shows an increasing trend but the increase is not significant when the diameter rises from 10 to 35 cm the free burning pool fire is then showing different behaviors chen et al 2011 conducted an n heptane pool fire test in a large test hall 12 m cube hall the burning rates showed an increasing trend with pool diameter and for pool diameters of 10 14 1 and 20 cm the values are 0 012 0 015 and 0 017 kg m2 s respectively the burning rates of sealed fire show relatively smaller values averagely about 24 less when compared to those under the condition of free burning this is probably because of the burning in a sealed room is mainly dominated by oxygen supply but for free burning pool fire it is controlled by fuel supply 3 2 average heat release rate generally for a compartment fire heat release rate hrr in previous studies is usually used as a significant indicator to represent fire size it cannot be measured directly which is calculated based on oxygen consumption jin 2012 for open fires or compartment fires with an opening the oxygen level of released smoke from fire source can be directly measured to determine the hrr of a fire such as using iso 9705 full scale test platform or cone calorimeter shi and chew 2012 but for a sealed engine room it is very difficult to measure the oxygen level of released smoke from the fire source in a sealed compartment directly as a result there is no an instrument that can be used for direct measurement at present as for a sealed engine room fire the oxygen level in the engine room at the early stage of a fire is sufficient and the combustion is a fuel controlled burning with the development of combustion process the oxygen concentration in the engine room keeps decreasing as there is no fresh air supply subsequently it evolved into a limited combustion state and eventually leads to the occurrence of fire self extinguishment due to oxygen deficiency it is known that hrr is closely related to the real time oxygen concentration around the fire source so during the whole combustion process hrr for a sealed engine room fire is not constant but transient even does not has a relative steady combustion stage in this study in order to characterize the fire size of an engine room fire an average hrr in whole combustion period is employed to represent the fire size the average hrr is calculated by averaging the total released heat over the whole burning period as the total released heat is an integral of hrr over the whole burning process the average hrr is therefore proportional to the average mass loss rate of fuel 1 q χ m δ h where χ is the average combustion efficiency m is the average mass loss rate during the whole combustion stage g s and δh is the heat of combustion of fuel kj g which is 44 6 kj g for n heptane in this study ma 2015 generally combustion efficiency is defined as the ratio of the actual heat release from fuel combustion to the complete heat of combustion which is used to determine the completeness of burning it also means that the ratio of the heat released in a combustion reaction to the theoretically complete combustion heat for an open fire the concentrations of oxygen are assumed to keep the same all the time the combustion efficiency is herein considered as a constant under this circumstance however for a sealed engine room fire the burning process is much complicated as the oxygen concentration keeps decreasing along the time which results in heat accumulation burning products and repeated air entrainment the combustion efficiency is therefore different from that of open fires with the change of combustion efficiency the heat released and temperature distribution in the ship engine room are also changed accordingly in zhang s studies zhang et al 2013a the combustion efficiency of fuel combustion in a closed compartment with elevated fires was systematically investigated using two different methods including oxygen depletion method iso 19703 and the equation deduced from hrr by oxygen consumption method the experimental results showed that the combustion efficiency in a sealed compartment dropped gradually as the oxygen concentration decreases it also says that in the whole burning process the combustion efficiency is not a constant and changes along the time furthermore the average combustion efficiency in the whole process of combustion was also investigated it was obtained as approximately 0 742 for fire centrally located with 22 cm high in the engine room which is approximately the same as the situation of this study additionally in jin s work jin 2012 based on both numerical and experimental study on sealed compartment fires it was suggested an average combustion efficiency of 0 75 in sealed compartment fires in which the numerical results obey reasonably well with the experiments based upon the above analysis the average combustion efficiency was approximately 0 75 for a sealed ship engine room fire in this study the average hrr can be calculated based on the average mass loss rate measured in the above section which is listed in table 1 it is known that the average hrr increases with the pool diameter this is because for a bigger pool diameter the heat release increases with a bigger burning area for a fixed effective heat of combustion there is a linear relationship between the heat release rate and mass loss rate shi and chew 2013 the trend of hrr of the sealed pool fire is then similar to that of mass loss rate for a specific fuel roh et al 2008 also obtained a similar trend but relatively smaller values through a reduced scale test namely a sealed tunnel with a dimension of 0 4 m height 0 4 m width 10 m length the hrr increases from 2 23 to 10 95 kw when the pool size rises from 4 5 to 8 5 cm the difference is probably because of the volume of the space generally the reduced scale experiments are usually conducted based on the similarity principle in this study a 1 4 1 8 reduced scale model comparing to full scale model is used in accordance with dynamic similarity the froude number remains the same for various scaled models liu et al 2004 the heat release rate is proportional to the scale ratio to a power of 5 2 2 q l 5 2 in eq 2 l is the scale ratio which is 1 4 1 8 for this study from table 1 it is seen that the maximum hrr for all the tests is about 34 1 kw and the minimum hrr is 2 6 kw according to eq 2 the minimum hrr of 2 6 kw is corresponding to a fire of 470 7 kw in a maximum full scale test and the maximum hrr in our experiments also corresponds to a maximum full scale hrr of 34 1 kw 1 8 5 2 6155 kw with a sealed engine room of 24 m length 24 m width 28 m height of a large cargo ship such as container ships 3 3 vertical temperature rise for various diameter pool fires the temperature histories at different heights were recorded by thermocouples as shown in fig 4 it is easily seen that the temperature rise increases with a bigger pool this is because under a bigger pool the hrr of pool fire increases due to more released heat resulting in a higher temperature of smoke at different heights additionally the times reaching the maximum temperature are different under various pool fires the details are illustrated in the subgraphs of fig 4 it can be seen that the time to reach the maximum temperature is different for smoke layers at various heights and a lower height shows a relatively long delay time especially for those small pool fires as for a bigger pool fire this phenomenon becomes less obvious this is mainly because of the repeated air entrainment happens in the sealed engine room during the early stage of the experiment the engine room can be filled with hot smoke very quickly after the ignition along the burning process repeated air entrainment becomes much serious when more smoke is entrained the phenomenon is much serious for a bigger pool namely the fire with bigger size lessens the difference of the time to approach the maximum temperature at various heights however with a bigger pool the temperature gradient becomes greater under a bigger fire size fig 4 shows that the time to reach the maximum temperature decreases with a bigger pool it is known that the time of maximum temperatures occurred is close to the extinction time in addition it is observed from fig 4 that for the thermocouples positioned at different heights the times that they reach their maximum temperature are various to some extent increasing trend of smoke temperature for large pool fire is much straightforward this is much because of the smoke produced from the liquid fire source for the pool fire with a relatively bigger diameter more smoke can be produced which can spread over the whole sealed engine room during the test the temperature in the sealed engine room can increase rapidly because of the hot smoke this is also evidenced by fig 4 that the time to approach the maximum temperature drops from about 3813 s 670 s when the pool diameter rises from 10 to 35 cm there is little difference for the measured temperatures at ignition which is because of the measurement accuracy caused by the thermocouple itself the differences of initially measured temperatures at ignition for different thermocouples at various heights are within 1 c this kind of measurement accuracy is acceptable compared with the similar research activities dang et al 2015 to minimize its influence during data processing temperature rises were calculated by deducting the initially measured temperature ambient temperature at ignition from the measured temperature at a later stage the reason that a fixed ambient temperature was not used is that there is a variation of 1 c for the initially measured temperature the variations in the obtained temperature rises along the height at different time are shown in fig 5 the change of temperature rises at different heights is defined as the gradient of temperature rise it is seen that as the burning continues the gradient of temperature rise increases gradually for each scenario shown in fig 5 the curve ends at the maximum temperature showing the biggest temperature gradient it is also obtained that the gradient of vertical temperature rise increases with a bigger pool when the diameter of the pool pan increases from 10 to 30 cm the gradient of vertical temperature rise approaches the maximum however the situation for 35 cm pool fire is exceptional which is because of the decreased temperature gradient under a smaller average heat release rate the details can be seen in fig 6 the temperature rises at different heights at the time of maximum temperature for different diameter pool fires can also be obtained as shown in fig 6 it is observed that the temperature rise increases under a higher height for all the tests the temperature rises also show a very good linear relationship with the height the slope of the linear relationship refers to the gradient of the temperature rises along the height for a small pool fire the temperature rises along the height change smoothly the situation for a large pool fire is much different and that the temperature rise increases greatly along the height for a 30 cm pool fire its gradient of temperature rises is about 9 times of that of 10 cm pool fire the temperature gradient in the sealed room fire increases with a bigger pool fire namely fire size it can be seen from fig 6 that the temperature gradient increases when the pool size rises from 10 to 30 cm showing a maximum temperature gradient of about 30 c m poulsen and jomaas 2012 obtained a maximal temperature gradient of over 100 c m for the upper smoke layers under free burning pool fire in iso 9705 test room while wang et al wang et al 2011 ren et al 2018 observed a maximal temperature gradient of about 55 c m for free burning polypropylene sheets in iso 9705 test room it can be known that the smoke layer of a fully sealed fire shows a similar or even a little lower temperature gradient than those of open fires 4 non dimensional analysis of vertical temperature distribution at the time of maximum temperature as mentioned in the introduction the influence of the hot smoke released from the fire source on the engine room structure is worth being investigated especially for the potential failure location under the high temperature conditions this is significant to the structural risk assessment and fire rescue for the sealed engine room the worst scenario is that the internal temperature approaches the maximum which has the biggest impact on the related structure and components in the following parts a mathematical model is developed concerning this issue to benefit the engineering application 4 1 mathematical model following the similarity principle fire characteristics in the reduced scale model are consistent to those in the full scale model the non dimensional analysis is a good method to eliminate the influences of scales which is applicable to different scale tests therefore a non dimensional model will be developed to predict the vertical temperature rise distribution at the time of maximum temperature for sealed engine room fires theoretically the vertical temperature rise distribution δt h at time of the maximum temperature is determined by several factors such as the average heat release rate q ambient temperature t ambient air density ρ specific heat capacity of ambient air c p gravitational acceleration g vertical height h pool diameter d height of the sealed engine room h and the area of the sealed engine room s the temperature rise along the height can then be given by 3 δ t h f q t ρ c p g h d h s based on previous experimental and theoretical studies heskestad 1975 non dimensional hrr can be expressed by 4 q q ρ c p t g d 5 2 as the heat release rate cannot be directly measured for a sealed engine room fire its average hrr is defined as 5 q q ρ c p t g d 5 2 to simplify eq 3 the dimensionless analysis is conducted the variables including ρ t c p g and d are selected as fundamental variables of eq 3 before performing the dimensionless analysis it should be noticed that in this study all experiments have been carried out only under the condition of constant geometric parameters of the ship engine room with an internal size of 3 m length 3 m width 3 5 m height thus in this study it means that h is not independent on s as shown in eq 3 so during the following dimensionless analysis we have to choose one under the objective of investigating the vertical temperature rise we choose to keep h in the following analysis rather than s certainly the related experiments will be taken in our future work when the related test rig with various internal areas is available kurioka et al 2003 obtained a correlation between the maximum smoke temperature rise and transient heat release rate based on fire tests in various scaled tunnel models in this study a relationship between the vertical temperature rise at the time of maximum temperature and average heat release rate is proposed with two considerations a the transient hrr is very difficult to be measured directly because of the sealed test engine room and b as shown in fig 2 the transient mass loss rate be linear to heat release rate shi and chew 2013 is very close to the average mass loss rate as there is no much variation during almost the whole burning period under these conditions eq 3 can be normalized 6 δ t h t f q h d h d non dimensional temperature rise can be defined as 7 δ t h max δ t max h t q substituting eq 7 into eq 6 it can be obtained that 8 δ t h max f 1 h d h d because d is selected as the characteristic length in this work as also seen in eq 4 variables of h d and h d are independent to obtain the non dimensional temperature rise at different heights and ensure variables h d and h d are independent the following equivalent operation is performed on eq 8 9 f 1 h d h d f 2 h h d h combining with eqs 6 and 9 the non dimensional temperature rise at different heights is given by 10 δ t h max f 2 h h d h in this study a density of 1 2 kg m3 and specific heat capacity of 1 004 kj kg k were selected for ambient air black et al 2007 baskut et al 2010 the temperatures of ambient air are about 14 21 c as seen in table 1 fig 7 presents the relationship between non dimensional temperature rise and height it is known from this figure that the non dimensional temperature rise shows a good linear relationship with non dimensional height the gradient of non dimensional temperature rise increases with a bigger pool which is consistent with the results shown in fig 6 however it needs to be noticed that there are two smoke regions with high and low temperature respectively for each test by a vertical diving line with a non dimensional height of about 0 3 as the diameter of pool increases the non dimensionless vertical temperature rise is more linearly correlated with the dimensionless height for pool fires with different diameters those intercepts from the regression are different to address the influences of d h on slope k and intercepts b the following linear relationship is assumed 11 δ t h m a x k h h b based on the regression between d h and k as shown in fig 8 it can be seen that k shows a good linear relationship with d h with a coefficient of determination of 0 9042 which is given by 12 k 5 289 d h 0 116 similarly the intercept b gives a good linear relationship with d h with the goodness of fit of 0 9735 as shown in fig 9 which can be expressed by 13 b 6 822 d h 0 01 combining eqs 11 13 the non dimensional temperature rise can be predicted by 14 δ t h max 5 289 d h 0 116 h h 6 822 d h 0 01 5 discussion the vertical distribution profile of the temperature in a sealed ship engine room was investigated in this study which is certainly different from those open fires in the literature from the experimental results during the early stage smoke quickly fills the whole engine room after the ignition after that the repeated air entrainment happens in the sealed engine room and smoke temperature eventually forms a top down vertical distribution in the space after the self extinction of fire the temperature gradient in the vertical direction is slightly smaller than that in a compartment with opening s as the air inlet and outlet are closed the fresh air outside is prevented from entering the engine room which directly affects the fire combustion process in the sealed engine room after a period of combustion after ignition the fire development is mainly dominated by the oxygen concentration in the engine room as for the fire behaviors such as temperature the application of traditional zone fire model is still available it can be roughly considered that the smoke layer is divided into the top high temperature layer and the bottom low temperature layer however from the view of the thermal stress safety of ship engine room structure this temperature gradient cannot be ignored because different temperature rises can cause local structural stress differences for ship engine room it should be noted that the experimental study in this paper mainly considers the case of fire source centrally located at the bottom of ship engine room the other cases of fire sources located with different heights or different horizontal positions such as the corner fire or wall fire were not covered in this study obviously the results of these cases would be different to that in this study due to limited experimental conditions the geometric shape variation is not considered in this paper namely a parameter of s h 2 with a constant of 0 734 it should be noted that this parameter is correlated to the functional form of vertical temperature distribution the model developed in this study is not applicable to the engine room with a largely changed s h 2 in comparison with it in this article the future work will focus on the related experimental investigations under the available experimental rig 6 conclusions and future work sealed ship engine room fire is conducted both experimentally and non dimensionally based on a bench scale engine room with a dimension of 3 m length 3 m width 3 5 m height the main purpose of this work has been focused on the vertical distribution of temperature induced by fire in a sealed ship engine room some conclusions can be addressed 1 it is known from experiments that the burning time decreases for pool fire with a small diameter and the time to approach the maximum temperature is near the experiment end the time to reach a maximum temperature at different heights is different with a lower height the time to approach the maximum temperature rise is longer with a more obvious air entrainment and thermal buoyancy the vertical temperature rise also shows a good relationship with height the gradient of temperature rise increases with pool diameter that the gradient of temperature rise for a 30 cm pool fire is about 9 times of that of a 10 cm pool fire 2 for sealed engine room fires experimental results demonstrated that the smoke temperature along the height is not identical showing an obvious gradient along the height the smoke layer of a fully sealed fire shows a similar or even a little lower temperature gradient than that of open fires the gradient of temperature rise of a 30 cm pool fire is about 9 times of that of a 10 cm pool fire meanwhile the experimental results demonstrate that the time to reach the maximum temperature is different for smoke layers at various heights while a lower height shows a relatively long delay time 3 the average heat release rates of pool fires with different diameters in this study are within 2 6 34 1 kw which is corresponding to 470 7 6155 kw fires in the full scale ship engine room of 24 m length 24 m width 28 m height a non dimensional model was developed to predict the vertical temperature rise at the time of maximum temperature for pool fires in a sealed engine room δ t h max 5 289 d h 0 116 h h 6 822 d h 0 01 it needs to be noted that due to the limited experimental conditions the geometric shape parameter s h 2 is not included in the mathematical model of vertical temperature distribution developed in this paper the future work should be made to build more experimental platforms with different geometric shapes and conduct relevant experimental

23138,fire in a sealed ship engine room is different from open fires while its suppression is critically important to the emergency rescue and structure safety for a ship this study focused on the vertical distribution of temperature rise during a sealed engine room fire a series of experiments were carried out to investigate fire behaviors in a reduced scale sealed ship engine room with a dimension of 3 m length 3 m width 3 5 m height the results suggested that there are vertical temperature gradients of smoke layer showing a little lower than those of open fires the experimental results demonstrated that the time to reach the maximum temperature is different for smoke layers at various heights while a lower height showed a relatively long delay time the vertical gradient of temperature rise was found increasing with pool diameter where the gradient of temperature rise of a 30 cm pool fire is about 9 times of that of a 10 cm pool fire furthermore an empirical model was

introduction one of the most disastrous situations threatening passengers occupants in ships and related constructions is fire which comes with high risk and uncertainty kang et al 2017 salem 2016 su and wang 2013 in fire emergency circumstances of a ship to close the burning engine room is a final taken and efficient means to extinguish the fire especially when the ship is at sea without any help or support for this case ship engine room is completely closed and the fire will be eventually extinguished due to the lack of oxygen sealed engine room fire is a special type as it is isolated from the ambient environment smoke and combustion products released from fire sources cannot be exhausted outside and no fresh air is entrained into ship engine room as well as a result fire behaviors in a sealed engine room then is distinctly different from those of open fires zhang et al 2013a 2013b 2015 yuan et al 2014 tatem et al 1986 li et al 2011 yang et al 2013 temperature or temperature rise is one of the critical parameters regarding the fire characteristics which is essential to address the smoke movement and related suppression measures based on temperature the initiation development and extinguishment stages of sealed fires can be identified accordingly wang et al 2017 yao et al 2017 yoon et al 2010 if a sealed engine room fire cannot be suppressed directly by fire extinguishing system one of the alternative measures is to seal the engine room and wait for its self extinguishment pu 2009 after sealing the engine room fire can be suppressed when the oxygen concentration drops to a certain value after the fire is extinguished the right time to reopen the ship engine room is very important this is because the engine room is rich of fuel and also under high temperature conditions so re ignition even backdraft may occur after sudden fresh air entrance trouve and wang 2010 more importantly the influences of hot smoke on the engine room structure are worthy of being studied especially on accurately identifying or predicting the failure location of the engine room structure which is significant to the structural risk assessment or fire emergency rescue kim et al 2017 jin et al 2016 jin and jang 2015 therefore the temperature distribution of sealed engine room fires is a practically important research topic previous studies regarding the temperature rise in compartment fires especially for a building fire has been studied for several years representative models such as m q h method f p a method beyler method etc walton et al 2016 these models were developed based on the conservation of energy and mass for the gas phase inside the enclosure with openings or under well ventilation these models are typical zone models including one zone and two zone models the basic assumption of zone models is considered uniform for a one zone model or the upper layer of the two zone model these models can predict the average temperatures which reflect the heat accumulation in the enclosure nevertheless detailed temperature profiles are still a challenge of prediction as we conduct the thermo mechanical coupling analysis to assess the structural safety of ship engine room the knowledge of the detailed temperature profiles is compulsory in the aspect of experimental study hu et al conducted a series of fire experiments in a closed ship engine room and found that the temperature profile at the moment of self extinction follows the boltzmann distribution hu et al 2010 zhang et al have investigated experimentally the vertical temperature distribution induced by an elevated fire in a ceiling vented ship compartment and found that the temperature of the upper layer was much higher than that of the lower layer zhang 2014 li et al 2018 the stratification of the temperature was distinct including two regions of the hot upper layer and the cold lower layer according to the measured temperature additionally li and chen have conducted experiments in a horizontally vented ship enclosure smoke filled up the enclosure quickly after ignition and temperature seemed to increase gradually with height in most cases which was quite similar to some forced ventilation compartment fires li 2010 chen 2011 in numerical simulation studies some studies focused on sealed engine room fires were based on numerical modeling su et al 2012 wang et al 2013 salem 2013 bonte et al 2013 jia et al 1997 sekret et al 2013 the temperature distribution volume fractions of gas species and thickness of smoke layer were investigated numerically another challenge is that the zone modeling which divides the whole space into several vertical layers may be no longer applicable to sealed engine room fires yuan et al 2014 in addition some theoretical models have been developed regarding the prediction of temperatures in sealed engine rooms a five zone theoretical model tatem et al 1986 was developed to predict the temperature in a gas tight enclosure which was based on the assumption that the combustion products and evaporated fuel are fully mixed another way of simplification is to consider a unified temperature for smoke layers li et al 2011 yang et al 2013 computational fluid dynamics models zhang et al 2015 were also utilized to address the situation however there is still a gap between the prediction and experiments research efforts are especially needed from the experimental aspects based upon the above analysis previous studies have largely focused on the ship fires in ventilated or unsealed engine rooms leaving very few studies on fully sealed engine room fire the purpose of this study mainly focuses on the vertical distribution of temperature rise induced by fire in a sealed ship engine room there are three main sections the first section presents an introduction of a reduced scale experimental rig the second section focuses on experimental results and analysis including average mass loss rate average heat release rate and vertical temperature rise the third section conducts a dimensionless analysis of vertical temperature distribution at the time of maximum temperature and proposes a mathematical model 2 experimental methodology a bench scale ship engine room model was built to conduct a series of experiments as shown in fig 1 in this figure a transparent front wall was used only to show the inside items which does not mean that the wall of the testing engine room is transparent to facilitate the observation of fire burning behaviors in a sealed ship engine room during experimental tests several circular holes are set as experimental observation windows in the front and back walls which are made of quartz glass and can stand for a high temperature of 600 c this ship engine room model consists of four parts namely testing engine room temperature measurement system data collection system and weighing device the details of each part are introduced as follows 1 testing engine room previous experimental studies were much focused on a relatively smaller engine room model than the one used in this study for example zhang et al 2013a 2013b studied the characteristics of pool fire in two closed compartments while one is 3 m length 3 m width 1 95 m height and the other is 1 m length 1 m width 0 75 m height the dimension of the current testing engine room is 3 m length 3 m width 3 5 m height as shown in fig 1 the design of this engine room was following the chinese code cb t3368 2013 cb t3368 2013 2013 the wall was made of rockwool steel sandwich panel with a middle layer of 20 mm rockwool while the external and internal layers were 4 mm and 1 5 mm carbon steel panels respectively the internal lining was made by 25 mm alumina silica insulation board the floor was also made by the sandwich panel while its bottom middle and top layers were made of 1 5 mm carbon steel 20 mm rockwool and 4 mm carbon steel respectively a 1 5 mm anti slip panel was used at the top of the floor a quick open watertight door was used with good airtightness a rotating handle and water seal strips were used to ensure the door can be fully sealed to avoid leakage the designs of related insulation for the door were following cb t3368 2013 cb t3368 2013 2013 with a dimension of 1 6 m length 0 8 m width 0 04 m depth 2 temperature measurement system k type thermocouples were employed to record the temperature history at different heights which also represent the time varying temperature of the smoke layer the thermocouple tree on side a where each thermocouple is mounted with 30 cm depth into the ship engine room is located vertically along the centerline of a side wall here each thermocouple being inserted into the engine room with 30 cm depth is to avoid the effects of the anti buoyant jet behavior on the temperature measurement thirty measured spots are arranged vertically from 3 4 m to 0 5 m heights with an interval of 0 1 m which are labeled by t1 to t30 respectively the measuring temperature range of these thermocouples is about 600 c which is enough for the measurement of smoke temperature in this study their response time is 1 s namely with a measurement frequency of 1 hz 3 data collection system the computer with a special configuration software system installed can automatically record the data taken during the experiments including temperature history and mass loss the sampling frequency of the data collection system is also 1 hz the data collection includes the temperature measurement data of those 30 thermocouples mentioned above and the mass loss of fuel taken by the electronic balance 4 weighing device an electronic weighing device called es 5000 was utilized to record the total mass of liquid fuel and the container fuel pan in real time the maximum reading is 5 kg with an accuracy of 0 01 g the sampling frequency of this weighing device is 1 hz liquid pool fire is one of the most common types of ship fire as ships usually contain large amount liquid such as lubrication oil machine oil and fuel oil generally the liquid pool could happen due to the leakage accident from the vessel or pipe during transportation or storage the liquid pool can spread under the gravity or floor with slope and liquid pool with different depths can be formed under different scenarios it can be then ignited by high temperature contact or direct flame which can be classified as class b fire the commonly used oil for a ship would be fuel oil or hydraulic oil which is basically hydrocarbon n heptane as a commonly used hydrocarbon fuel is a stable burning source which has been largely used in previous fire experiments hu et al 2005 utiskul et al 2005 in this study to be consistent with previous studies n heptane was then used as well for the sake of simplicity the oil pool fires used in experiments were placed in the center of the engine room floor the depths of the oil pools with different diameters were all 10 cm the diameters of liquid fuel pan were 10 15 20 30 and 35 cm respectively except for 10 cm pool fire the initial amount of fuel in each test was sufficient to maintain combustion under fully sealed conditions the use of 10 cm pool fire was taken preliminarily to identify the type of extinguishment namely oxygen based or fuel based as stated above the main purpose of this study is to conduct related experiments to simulate the case of fire self extinguishing by sealing the ship engine room in experiments we can open or close the air inlet and outlet by adjusting the solenoid valve control the air inlet and outlet of the testing engine room are both closed simultaneously after ignition then both the outlet and inlet air fans were turned off as well during the whole experimental period meanwhile after the experiments completed the smoke exhaust is done by opening the outlet and launching the fan then we open the air inlet and the air inlet fan as the smoke temperature drops to about 100 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 average mass loss rate burning process is accompanied by chemical reactions which consume both fuel and oxygen for open fires it is usually considered that only the evaporated fuel is involved in the chemical reactions under the situation the burning rate of the liquid fuel is equal to its evaporation rate a higher burning rate represents more released heat from the fire source and the released heat during a unit time period is then defined as heat release rate in sealed compartment fires environmental conditions of combustion such as pressure air density and oxygen concentration change frequently along the burning process while the burning rate changes very complexly under low oxygen conditions not all evaporated fuel can be involved in the chemical reactions during the burning process so the burning rate of the fuel is less than mass loss rate this explains why the burning rate of fuel in sealed spaces is smaller than those in open spaces it is also known from the previous study tatem et al 1986 that the rising temperature can increase the evaporation rate of the liquid fuel eventually the dropping oxygen concentration will reduce the evaporation rate through its influence on the flame height and air entrainment rate the mass of liquid fuel was measured during the whole experimental period the fuel mass loss history in the time period from ignition to extinguishment is shown in fig 2 by plotting fuel mass versus the time for each test it is observed the mass shows a good linear relationship with the time the fitting lines were linearly obtained for each scenario with a goodness of fit of more than 0 9 as illustrated in fig 2 through linear regression analysis the absolute value of the slope from the fitting line is the average mass loss rate during the whole burning process it is easily seen that the average mass loss rate increases with a bigger diameter of a pool fire the average mass loss rate increases from 0 078 to 1 06 g s when pool diameter increases from 10 to 30 cm it needs to be noticed that the average mass loss rates are nearly the same for 30 and 35 cm pool fire the possible reason for this is as follows it can be seen from fig 2 d and e that the mass loss rate of 30 cm pool fire at the later stage in the red circle increases than that in the previous stage seen from the recorded experimental video it can be hypothesized that the temperature of the pool wall increases resulting in a relatively rapid heat transfer that the liquid fuel inside the pool then goes to boiling under this circumstance a part of the liquid fuel then splashes out of the pool resulting in ghost fire when they go through the evaporation process for the 35 cm pool fire the mass loss rate at the early stage is relatively larger than that of the 30 cm pool fire but in the later stage the splashed liquid fuel is relatively less as comparing to that of the 30 cm pool fire therefore with the combined effects the 30 cm and 35 cm pool fires show a similar average mass loss rate during the whole combustion stage as the average mass loss rate is dependent on combustion during early and late stages the similar average mass loss rate does not mean that the 30 and 35 cm pool fires show a similar transient burning rate further research should be carried out in the future it should be noticed that for the pool fires with over 15 cm diameter ghost fire can be observed at the later stage of combustion or when the burning approaches to extinguishment ghost fire is a special kind of fire phenomenon sugawa et al 1991 firstly found the ghost fire behavior in a poorly ventilated compartment fire test in which he concluded that ghost fire can occur in a poorly ventilated or sealed space that the oxygen concentration is much lower than the ambient level so at the later stage of fire burning due to the lack of oxygen the flame can detach completely from the fuel source the mechanism of ghosting is not yet fully understood fig 3 shows the ghost fire under 30 cm pool fire pan it is important to know that the ghost fire obviously has a significant impact on mass loss rate and spatial temperature distribution for example the mass loss rate with both 20 and 30 cm pool fire pans fluctuate obviously when approaching to the end some previous studies have also reported the same phenomenon for sealed engine room fires li et al 2010 furtherly the ghost fire also affects the mass loss rate and temperature distributions in the sealed engine room it can be known from fig 2 that the average mass loss rate for 10 15 20 30 and 35 cm diameter pools are about 0 01 0 008 0 018 0 015 and 0 011 kg m2 s respectively the average mass loss rate shows an increasing trend but the increase is not significant when the diameter rises from 10 to 35 cm the free burning pool fire is then showing different behaviors chen et al 2011 conducted an n heptane pool fire test in a large test hall 12 m cube hall the burning rates showed an increasing trend with pool diameter and for pool diameters of 10 14 1 and 20 cm the values are 0 012 0 015 and 0 017 kg m2 s respectively the burning rates of sealed fire show relatively smaller values averagely about 24 less when compared to those under the condition of free burning this is probably because of the burning in a sealed room is mainly dominated by oxygen supply but for free burning pool fire it is controlled by fuel supply 3 2 average heat release rate generally for a compartment fire heat release rate hrr in previous studies is usually used as a significant indicator to represent fire size it cannot be measured directly which is calculated based on oxygen consumption jin 2012 for open fires or compartment fires with an opening the oxygen level of released smoke from fire source can be directly measured to determine the hrr of a fire such as using iso 9705 full scale test platform or cone calorimeter shi and chew 2012 but for a sealed engine room it is very difficult to measure the oxygen level of released smoke from the fire source in a sealed compartment directly as a result there is no an instrument that can be used for direct measurement at present as for a sealed engine room fire the oxygen level in the engine room at the early stage of a fire is sufficient and the combustion is a fuel controlled burning with the development of combustion process the oxygen concentration in the engine room keeps decreasing as there is no fresh air supply subsequently it evolved into a limited combustion state and eventually leads to the occurrence of fire self extinguishment due to oxygen deficiency it is known that hrr is closely related to the real time oxygen concentration around the fire source so during the whole combustion process hrr for a sealed engine room fire is not constant but transient even does not has a relative steady combustion stage in this study in order to characterize the fire size of an engine room fire an average hrr in whole combustion period is employed to represent the fire size the average hrr is calculated by averaging the total released heat over the whole burning period as the total released heat is an integral of hrr over the whole burning process the average hrr is therefore proportional to the average mass loss rate of fuel 1 q χ m δ h where χ is the average combustion efficiency m is the average mass loss rate during the whole combustion stage g s and δh is the heat of combustion of fuel kj g which is 44 6 kj g for n heptane in this study ma 2015 generally combustion efficiency is defined as the ratio of the actual heat release from fuel combustion to the complete heat of combustion which is used to determine the completeness of burning it also means that the ratio of the heat released in a combustion reaction to the theoretically complete combustion heat for an open fire the concentrations of oxygen are assumed to keep the same all the time the combustion efficiency is herein considered as a constant under this circumstance however for a sealed engine room fire the burning process is much complicated as the oxygen concentration keeps decreasing along the time which results in heat accumulation burning products and repeated air entrainment the combustion efficiency is therefore different from that of open fires with the change of combustion efficiency the heat released and temperature distribution in the ship engine room are also changed accordingly in zhang s studies zhang et al 2013a the combustion efficiency of fuel combustion in a closed compartment with elevated fires was systematically investigated using two different methods including oxygen depletion method iso 19703 and the equation deduced from hrr by oxygen consumption method the experimental results showed that the combustion efficiency in a sealed compartment dropped gradually as the oxygen concentration decreases it also says that in the whole burning process the combustion efficiency is not a constant and changes along the time furthermore the average combustion efficiency in the whole process of combustion was also investigated it was obtained as approximately 0 742 for fire centrally located with 22 cm high in the engine room which is approximately the same as the situation of this study additionally in jin s work jin 2012 based on both numerical and experimental study on sealed compartment fires it was suggested an average combustion efficiency of 0 75 in sealed compartment fires in which the numerical results obey reasonably well with the experiments based upon the above analysis the average combustion efficiency was approximately 0 75 for a sealed ship engine room fire in this study the average hrr can be calculated based on the average mass loss rate measured in the above section which is listed in table 1 it is known that the average hrr increases with the pool diameter this is because for a bigger pool diameter the heat release increases with a bigger burning area for a fixed effective heat of combustion there is a linear relationship between the heat release rate and mass loss rate shi and chew 2013 the trend of hrr of the sealed pool fire is then similar to that of mass loss rate for a specific fuel roh et al 2008 also obtained a similar trend but relatively smaller values through a reduced scale test namely a sealed tunnel with a dimension of 0 4 m height 0 4 m width 10 m length the hrr increases from 2 23 to 10 95 kw when the pool size rises from 4 5 to 8 5 cm the difference is probably because of the volume of the space generally the reduced scale experiments are usually conducted based on the similarity principle in this study a 1 4 1 8 reduced scale model comparing to full scale model is used in accordance with dynamic similarity the froude number remains the same for various scaled models liu et al 2004 the heat release rate is proportional to the scale ratio to a power of 5 2 2 q l 5 2 in eq 2 l is the scale ratio which is 1 4 1 8 for this study from table 1 it is seen that the maximum hrr for all the tests is about 34 1 kw and the minimum hrr is 2 6 kw according to eq 2 the minimum hrr of 2 6 kw is corresponding to a fire of 470 7 kw in a maximum full scale test and the maximum hrr in our experiments also corresponds to a maximum full scale hrr of 34 1 kw 1 8 5 2 6155 kw with a sealed engine room of 24 m length 24 m width 28 m height of a large cargo ship such as container ships 3 3 vertical temperature rise for various diameter pool fires the temperature histories at different heights were recorded by thermocouples as shown in fig 4 it is easily seen that the temperature rise increases with a bigger pool this is because under a bigger pool the hrr of pool fire increases due to more released heat resulting in a higher temperature of smoke at different heights additionally the times reaching the maximum temperature are different under various pool fires the details are illustrated in the subgraphs of fig 4 it can be seen that the time to reach the maximum temperature is different for smoke layers at various heights and a lower height shows a relatively long delay time especially for those small pool fires as for a bigger pool fire this phenomenon becomes less obvious this is mainly because of the repeated air entrainment happens in the sealed engine room during the early stage of the experiment the engine room can be filled with hot smoke very quickly after the ignition along the burning process repeated air entrainment becomes much serious when more smoke is entrained the phenomenon is much serious for a bigger pool namely the fire with bigger size lessens the difference of the time to approach the maximum temperature at various heights however with a bigger pool the temperature gradient becomes greater under a bigger fire size fig 4 shows that the time to reach the maximum temperature decreases with a bigger pool it is known that the time of maximum temperatures occurred is close to the extinction time in addition it is observed from fig 4 that for the thermocouples positioned at different heights the times that they reach their maximum temperature are various to some extent increasing trend of smoke temperature for large pool fire is much straightforward this is much because of the smoke produced from the liquid fire source for the pool fire with a relatively bigger diameter more smoke can be produced which can spread over the whole sealed engine room during the test the temperature in the sealed engine room can increase rapidly because of the hot smoke this is also evidenced by fig 4 that the time to approach the maximum temperature drops from about 3813 s 670 s when the pool diameter rises from 10 to 35 cm there is little difference for the measured temperatures at ignition which is because of the measurement accuracy caused by the thermocouple itself the differences of initially measured temperatures at ignition for different thermocouples at various heights are within 1 c this kind of measurement accuracy is acceptable compared with the similar research activities dang et al 2015 to minimize its influence during data processing temperature rises were calculated by deducting the initially measured temperature ambient temperature at ignition from the measured temperature at a later stage the reason that a fixed ambient temperature was not used is that there is a variation of 1 c for the initially measured temperature the variations in the obtained temperature rises along the height at different time are shown in fig 5 the change of temperature rises at different heights is defined as the gradient of temperature rise it is seen that as the burning continues the gradient of temperature rise increases gradually for each scenario shown in fig 5 the curve ends at the maximum temperature showing the biggest temperature gradient it is also obtained that the gradient of vertical temperature rise increases with a bigger pool when the diameter of the pool pan increases from 10 to 30 cm the gradient of vertical temperature rise approaches the maximum however the situation for 35 cm pool fire is exceptional which is because of the decreased temperature gradient under a smaller average heat release rate the details can be seen in fig 6 the temperature rises at different heights at the time of maximum temperature for different diameter pool fires can also be obtained as shown in fig 6 it is observed that the temperature rise increases under a higher height for all the tests the temperature rises also show a very good linear relationship with the height the slope of the linear relationship refers to the gradient of the temperature rises along the height for a small pool fire the temperature rises along the height change smoothly the situation for a large pool fire is much different and that the temperature rise increases greatly along the height for a 30 cm pool fire its gradient of temperature rises is about 9 times of that of 10 cm pool fire the temperature gradient in the sealed room fire increases with a bigger pool fire namely fire size it can be seen from fig 6 that the temperature gradient increases when the pool size rises from 10 to 30 cm showing a maximum temperature gradient of about 30 c m poulsen and jomaas 2012 obtained a maximal temperature gradient of over 100 c m for the upper smoke layers under free burning pool fire in iso 9705 test room while wang et al wang et al 2011 ren et al 2018 observed a maximal temperature gradient of about 55 c m for free burning polypropylene sheets in iso 9705 test room it can be known that the smoke layer of a fully sealed fire shows a similar or even a little lower temperature gradient than those of open fires 4 non dimensional analysis of vertical temperature distribution at the time of maximum temperature as mentioned in the introduction the influence of the hot smoke released from the fire source on the engine room structure is worth being investigated especially for the potential failure location under the high temperature conditions this is significant to the structural risk assessment and fire rescue for the sealed engine room the worst scenario is that the internal temperature approaches the maximum which has the biggest impact on the related structure and components in the following parts a mathematical model is developed concerning this issue to benefit the engineering application 4 1 mathematical model following the similarity principle fire characteristics in the reduced scale model are consistent to those in the full scale model the non dimensional analysis is a good method to eliminate the influences of scales which is applicable to different scale tests therefore a non dimensional model will be developed to predict the vertical temperature rise distribution at the time of maximum temperature for sealed engine room fires theoretically the vertical temperature rise distribution δt h at time of the maximum temperature is determined by several factors such as the average heat release rate q ambient temperature t ambient air density ρ specific heat capacity of ambient air c p gravitational acceleration g vertical height h pool diameter d height of the sealed engine room h and the area of the sealed engine room s the temperature rise along the height can then be given by 3 δ t h f q t ρ c p g h d h s based on previous experimental and theoretical studies heskestad 1975 non dimensional hrr can be expressed by 4 q q ρ c p t g d 5 2 as the heat release rate cannot be directly measured for a sealed engine room fire its average hrr is defined as 5 q q ρ c p t g d 5 2 to simplify eq 3 the dimensionless analysis is conducted the variables including ρ t c p g and d are selected as fundamental variables of eq 3 before performing the dimensionless analysis it should be noticed that in this study all experiments have been carried out only under the condition of constant geometric parameters of the ship engine room with an internal size of 3 m length 3 m width 3 5 m height thus in this study it means that h is not independent on s as shown in eq 3 so during the following dimensionless analysis we have to choose one under the objective of investigating the vertical temperature rise we choose to keep h in the following analysis rather than s certainly the related experiments will be taken in our future work when the related test rig with various internal areas is available kurioka et al 2003 obtained a correlation between the maximum smoke temperature rise and transient heat release rate based on fire tests in various scaled tunnel models in this study a relationship between the vertical temperature rise at the time of maximum temperature and average heat release rate is proposed with two considerations a the transient hrr is very difficult to be measured directly because of the sealed test engine room and b as shown in fig 2 the transient mass loss rate be linear to heat release rate shi and chew 2013 is very close to the average mass loss rate as there is no much variation during almost the whole burning period under these conditions eq 3 can be normalized 6 δ t h t f q h d h d non dimensional temperature rise can be defined as 7 δ t h max δ t max h t q substituting eq 7 into eq 6 it can be obtained that 8 δ t h max f 1 h d h d because d is selected as the characteristic length in this work as also seen in eq 4 variables of h d and h d are independent to obtain the non dimensional temperature rise at different heights and ensure variables h d and h d are independent the following equivalent operation is performed on eq 8 9 f 1 h d h d f 2 h h d h combining with eqs 6 and 9 the non dimensional temperature rise at different heights is given by 10 δ t h max f 2 h h d h in this study a density of 1 2 kg m3 and specific heat capacity of 1 004 kj kg k were selected for ambient air black et al 2007 baskut et al 2010 the temperatures of ambient air are about 14 21 c as seen in table 1 fig 7 presents the relationship between non dimensional temperature rise and height it is known from this figure that the non dimensional temperature rise shows a good linear relationship with non dimensional height the gradient of non dimensional temperature rise increases with a bigger pool which is consistent with the results shown in fig 6 however it needs to be noticed that there are two smoke regions with high and low temperature respectively for each test by a vertical diving line with a non dimensional height of about 0 3 as the diameter of pool increases the non dimensionless vertical temperature rise is more linearly correlated with the dimensionless height for pool fires with different diameters those intercepts from the regression are different to address the influences of d h on slope k and intercepts b the following linear relationship is assumed 11 δ t h m a x k h h b based on the regression between d h and k as shown in fig 8 it can be seen that k shows a good linear relationship with d h with a coefficient of determination of 0 9042 which is given by 12 k 5 289 d h 0 116 similarly the intercept b gives a good linear relationship with d h with the goodness of fit of 0 9735 as shown in fig 9 which can be expressed by 13 b 6 822 d h 0 01 combining eqs 11 13 the non dimensional temperature rise can be predicted by 14 δ t h max 5 289 d h 0 116 h h 6 822 d h 0 01 5 discussion the vertical distribution profile of the temperature in a sealed ship engine room was investigated in this study which is certainly different from those open fires in the literature from the experimental results during the early stage smoke quickly fills the whole engine room after the ignition after that the repeated air entrainment happens in the sealed engine room and smoke temperature eventually forms a top down vertical distribution in the space after the self extinction of fire the temperature gradient in the vertical direction is slightly smaller than that in a compartment with opening s as the air inlet and outlet are closed the fresh air outside is prevented from entering the engine room which directly affects the fire combustion process in the sealed engine room after a period of combustion after ignition the fire development is mainly dominated by the oxygen concentration in the engine room as for the fire behaviors such as temperature the application of traditional zone fire model is still available it can be roughly considered that the smoke layer is divided into the top high temperature layer and the bottom low temperature layer however from the view of the thermal stress safety of ship engine room structure this temperature gradient cannot be ignored because different temperature rises can cause local structural stress differences for ship engine room it should be noted that the experimental study in this paper mainly considers the case of fire source centrally located at the bottom of ship engine room the other cases of fire sources located with different heights or different horizontal positions such as the corner fire or wall fire were not covered in this study obviously the results of these cases would be different to that in this study due to limited experimental conditions the geometric shape variation is not considered in this paper namely a parameter of s h 2 with a constant of 0 734 it should be noted that this parameter is correlated to the functional form of vertical temperature distribution the model developed in this study is not applicable to the engine room with a largely changed s h 2 in comparison with it in this article the future work will focus on the related experimental investigations under the available experimental rig 6 conclusions and future work sealed ship engine room fire is conducted both experimentally and non dimensionally based on a bench scale engine room with a dimension of 3 m length 3 m width 3 5 m height the main purpose of this work has been focused on the vertical distribution of temperature induced by fire in a sealed ship engine room some conclusions can be addressed 1 it is known from experiments that the burning time decreases for pool fire with a small diameter and the time to approach the maximum temperature is near the experiment end the time to reach a maximum temperature at different heights is different with a lower height the time to approach the maximum temperature rise is longer with a more obvious air entrainment and thermal buoyancy the vertical temperature rise also shows a good relationship with height the gradient of temperature rise increases with pool diameter that the gradient of temperature rise for a 30 cm pool fire is about 9 times of that of a 10 cm pool fire 2 for sealed engine room fires experimental results demonstrated that the smoke temperature along the height is not identical showing an obvious gradient along the height the smoke layer of a fully sealed fire shows a similar or even a little lower temperature gradient than that of open fires the gradient of temperature rise of a 30 cm pool fire is about 9 times of that of a 10 cm pool fire meanwhile the experimental results demonstrate that the time to reach the maximum temperature is different for smoke layers at various heights while a lower height shows a relatively long delay time 3 the average heat release rates of pool fires with different diameters in this study are within 2 6 34 1 kw which is corresponding to 470 7 6155 kw fires in the full scale ship engine room of 24 m length 24 m width 28 m height a non dimensional model was developed to predict the vertical temperature rise at the time of maximum temperature for pool fires in a sealed engine room δ t h max 5 289 d h 0 116 h h 6 822 d h 0 01 it needs to be noted that due to the limited experimental conditions the geometric shape parameter s h 2 is not included in the mathematical model of vertical temperature distribution developed in this paper the future work should be made to build more experimental platforms with different geometric shapes and conduct relevant experimental studies acknowledgment the authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers and the editor in chief for their constructive suggestions for improving this paper this work was financially supported

23139,during the recent years indonesian government rapidly increase the electrification program which is mainly using coal energy however some areas are still need any supports of electricity as an archipelagic state indonesia is surrounded by seas which is potential for developing the wave energy three areas were selected for examining the wave energy potential i e meulaboh in sumatera south kuta in bali and manokwari in papua which is the representative of the region in west middle and east of indonesia respectively ocean wave characteristics were analyzed for each monsoon from 2012 to 2017 based on ocean wave forecasting using sverdrup munk and bretschneider method the electrical power calculations were done by using floating oscillating water column formulas based on our analysis the average of highest significant wave heights and periods in 3 sites happen in the west monsoon and the lowest average of significant wave heights and periods mostly happen in the east monsoon thus among the three locations that were examined south kuta bali is the best location to develop wave energy keywords wave energy marine renewable energy oscillating water column indonesia 1 introduction in the last decades the world has faced energy crisis issues the problem of energy in indonesia is the availability of fossil energy that continues to decline alifdini et al 2016 2017 however indonesia as one of developing countries in asia struggle to make an energy sustainability for the citizens sukarno et al 2015 as a result the electrification process in indonesia has been accelerating in the past two decades ramdani and setiani 2017 the electrical capacity of indonesia in the form of renewable energy are solar wind and biomass energy plan to increase the use of renewable energy including hydropower is 19 and 23 in 2019 and 2025 respectively iea 2015 hydropower consists of 10 of the total electrical generation capacity in 2013 there is only a little growth from this energy source in the last decade therefore indonesia plans to develop several mini hydropower plants adding 2 gw capacity in 2019 the government strongly supports investment in these plants particularly in remote areas to increase the electrification rate iea 2015 one of hydropower plant that can be developed is ocean based hydropower plant since 70 of indonesian region consist of ocean area there are some kind of ocean based hydropower one of them is harnessing energy from ocean waves the developments of ocean wave energy in indonesia are quite promising because some areas in indonesia are directly facing indian ocean and pacific ocean that have great wave energy among of some devices that have been developed for wave energy conversion is oscillating water column owc this device is a wave energy conversion that the most extensively studied in the recent years şentürk and özdamar 2011 oscillating water column owc is a device that transforms the mechanical energy of the waves into electrical power the waves enter to the chamber to compress and decompress the air around still water level swl so that an oscillate airflow will be created this airflow is passed through a power take off pto system which consists of a turbine and an induction generator that transforms this motion into electrical power garrido et al 2015 there are some kinds of oscillating water column owc that have been developed one of them is floating owc that can absorb power from the waves bull and johnson 2013 floating owc s are increasingly attractive due to their ability to benefit from more energetic wave energy bailey et al 2016 floating owc was demonstrated in 1 4 scale device off the irish coast based on the japanese bent backward duct buoy concept it has been in the water since december 2006 other than that oceanlinx have tested three devices and have tested two different turbines the dennis auld and the hydro air there are several other floating owcs e g embley energy s machine and the mighty whale despite not tested yet embley energy s machine is a simple robust machine while the mighty whale was deployed in japan but was not considered a success minns 2012 in addition floating owc devices have been studied and developed with the self rectifying wells turbine gomes et al 2011 that is floating independently konispoliatis and mavrakos 2016 the concept of floating owc can be described as follows it consists of a relatively long vertical tube open at both ends and attached to a floater this concept has been considered since the early pioneers of wave energy conversion falcão and henriques 2016 firdaus et al 2011 identified some of potential locations in indonesia to develop wave energy in addition zikra et al 2016 also studied some areas in indonesia that are potential to be developed for wave energy based on the characteristics of wave climates they considered the potential areas based on temporal variation in significant wave height using era interim reanalysis data from ecmwf european center for medium range weather forecasts for 35 years in the period from 1980 to 2014 some locations that are potential are in the western of sumatra island southern of java bali nusa tenggara island and northern of papua island in this study 3 locations were examined to represent the western part middle part and eastern part of indonesia they were meulaboh south kuta and manokwari representing western middle and eastern part of indonesia respectively meulaboh is a coastal region located in the western part of sumatra island that facing the indian ocean marlian et al 2015 the usage of electricity in meulaboh is still need to be developed since meulaboh is located in the outer region of indonesia on the other hand south kuta is one of the most popular beach in bali island which is located in the southern part of bali island purwanto 2011 this location is very easy to access and becomes the popular area for tourism because of the high tourism activity the demand of electricity is also high manokwari is the capital city of west papua province which has seven districts those districts are north manokwari east manokwari west manokwari south manokwari sidey tanah rubuh and masni runtuboi et al 2015 the district that has a wave energy potential is north manokwari because this location directly face the pacific ocean the electricity uses in papua island is still need to be developed with renewable energy because there is a limitation in access to develop conventional energy in papua island due to the extreme morphology and topography beside demand factors as mentioned above another important factor was also required for choosing sites for wave energy developments i e water depth dasgomes et al 2018 sugianto et al 2017 wave energy converters are mostly planned installed for depths less than 100 m and closer to the shore they will experience a decrease in the available wave energy that can be captured depending on the slope and roughness of the sea floor sundar et al 2010 where the water is deep 40 m depth near shore and offshore devices will necessarily be of the moored type thorpe 1992 thorpe 1999 based on lpi bathimetry map in the scale of 1 50 000 meulaboh has water depth ranging from 0 to 60 m south kuta bali waters has the depth from 0 to 200 m big 2018 and manokwari has waters depth from 0 to 400 m hatta 2014 in general meulaboh south kuta and manokwari waters are suitable for developing wave energy other than that floating owc has been tested successfully in gokasho bay japan with the most predominant significant wave height and period are 0 5 m and 6 s respectively moreover there are also some waves with significant wave height over 4 0 m in other words it is proven that the test site is generally relatively calm but in severe weather the wave height rises very much washio et al 2001 on the other hand the percentage of time for which the significant wave height is lower than 0 5 m calm sea condition is an ideal floating device would be easily accessible martinelli et al 2013 based on research of utami 2010 and saragih 2017 the western ocean of aceh to north sumatra including the meulaboh area southern ocean of bali to ntb and northern ocean of papua have a mean significant wave heights from 0 3 to 1 3 m 0 4 to 1 5 m and 0 4 to 1 25 m respectively the percentage of significant wave height lower than 3 m is 95 in all locations because of that these locations are quite possible to implement floating owc to harness electricity from waves 2 materials and methods 2 1 research locations wave energy resources were examined in three locations they were meulaboh south kuta and manokwari with the following coordinates from 4 11 24 39 n to 4 10 51 06 n and 95 56 41 59 e to 96 0 24 74 e from 8 51 53 79 s to 8 52 46 07 s and 115 7 30 99 e to 115 9 12 02 e and from 0 4 47 76 s to 0 14 48 88 s and 132 47 7 14 e to 132 32 4 04 e for meulaboh south kuta and manokwari respectively 2 2 wave forecasting in this study ocean waves were forecasted from wind data wind data were obtained from geophysical climatological and meteorological agency of indonesia from 2012 to 2017 the wave forecasting was done using sverdrup munk bret schneider s smb method cerc 1984 the wave height and period were determined based on the wave fetch conditions there are several criteria for determining wave characteristics based on fetch condition 2 2 1 fetch limited in the fetch limited conditions the wave heights and periods are determined by equations 1 3 1 g h u

duration td based on the wave period t 2 2 2 fully developed sea if t1 3 is considered as 0 95 tm then the value of wave height and period can be determined by equations 4 6 4 g h m o u a 2 2 433 10 1

value of hmo and tp in limited circumstances the wind fetch moves above the water surface resulting a stable wave 2 2 3 duration limited the determination of the wave types that is used for waves forecasting is the boundary condition the boundary conditions are included duration t and fetch f if the measurement duration is less than the maximum duration and the effective fetch is smaller than the maximum fetch the waveform will be categorized as non fully developed sea if these conditions are not met the wave will be categorized as fully developed sea herterich and hasselmann 2006 the condition of limited wind duration if 7 tmeasurement tmax if the condition in eq 7 are met the wave growth will be limited by time or is called as duration limited whereas if the condition does not met the wave will be tested by using a fetch delimiter in equation 8 8 feff fmax the wave formation is limited by fetch formed or fetch limited fetch limited and duration limited including in the condition of non fully developed seas whereas if the condition does not like that the wave is included in the condition of fully developed seas wave height and periods determination for limited

o μ 3 results and discussion 3 1 wave condition forecasting of sea waves heights and periods were conducted using wind data at three locations fig 4 presents joint probability distributions of h t in meulaboh waters south kuta and manokwari in meulaboh fig 4a the wave height ranging from 0 72 m to 5 33 m with periods from 4 46 s to 5 68 s the dominance of waves that happen is in the height of 1 134 m with periods 5 6 s 17 62 then about 17 33 in the height of 0 84 m with period 4 6 s hence the value of significant wave height average in meulaboh is about 1 50 m with a significant wave period average is about 5 96 s in south kuta fig 4b significant wave height ranging from 0 39 m to 5 75 m with periods 3 29 s 10 21 s the most dominant of sea wave in this location is 1 91 m with period of 6 86 s 12 99 2 11 m with period 7 09 s 11 75 and 1 697 m with period 6 59 s 11 24 the average of significant wave height and period are 2 03 m and 6 91 s in manokwari fig 4c the significant wave height ranging from 0 53 m to 5 85 m and significant wave periods from 3 29 s to 9 90 s the most dominant of sea wave in this location is 0 72 m with period of 4 47 s 16 47 followed by 1 29 m with period of 6 12 s 15 34 the average of significant wave heights and periods are 1 72 m and 6 55 s from fig 4 it is also can be seen that there are 2 types of waves identified in meulaboh and south kuta while in manokwari there is only 1 type of wave in meulaboh the first type is characterized by the period ranging from 3 s to 8 s with the wave height ranging from 0 8 m to 5 6 m the second type which is less dominant than the first has the period ranging from 7 s to 10 s with the height ranging from 1 8 m to 5 6 m in the south kuta the difference between the first and the second type is quite significant especially in the period the first type has very short period ranging only from 1 s to 2 s with the wave height ranging from 0 5 m to 4 5 m the second type which becomes the most dominant wave type in south kuta has the period ranging from 3 s to 10 1 s with the wave height ranging from 0 3 m to 5 9 m the first type has more advantages for developing the wave energy since it has much shorter period than the second one with relatively has almost the same wave height however the first type only rarely occurs in the south kuta in manokwari the wave type is characterized by the period ranging from 3 s to 10 s with the height ranging from 0 5 m to 5 9 m from these three locations it can be concluded that south kuta bali has the highest significant wave height and period among other locations the result of the present study is different with utami 2010 which stated that the western ocean of aceh to north sumatra including the meulaboh area have a mean significant wave height from 0 3 m to 1 3 m moreover southern ocean of bali to ntb have a mean significant wave height from 0 4 m to 1 5 m in the northern ocean of papua the average of wave height is from 0 4 m to 1 25 m in addition the frequencies of wave height over 3 m in all locations that were identified aceh to north sumatra southern ocean of bali to ntb and northern ocean of papua are between 0 and 5 our results show that mean of significant wave height in meulaboh is 1 5 m in bali is 2 028 m and in manokwari is 1 72 m this means that the significant wave height in in the present study are 20 52 8 and 47 higher than that in utami 2010 for meulaboh south kuta and manokwari respectively these may be caused by the different areal size of our study and utami 2010 the study area of utami 2010 was not specifically at one location but cover large area in this study ocean waves were forecasted only at the specific points the probability of occurrence of wave heights and periods in three locations are also considered for wave energy development based on the previous research washio et al 2001 floating owc tested in gokasho bay japan has the most predominant significant wave height and wave period about 0 5 m and 6 s respectively but there are some waves with significant wave height over 4 0 m in meulaboh there are about 39 27 with significant wave height above 0 5 m and periods above 6 s in addition there are some significant wave height over 4 0 m about 0 86 in south kuta the significant wave height above 0 5 m and period of 6 s about 87 398 with wave height over 4 0 m about 1 49 in manokwari there are about 71 05 significant wave height over 0 5 m and significant wave periods over 6 s on the other hands there is 1 01 of significant wave height over 4 m then twidell and weir 2006 said that waves with long period t 8 s and height h 4 m have energy fluxes commonly averaging between 50 and 70 kw per m width of oncoming wave which makes them of considerable interest for power generation in this research there are about 0 86 1 42 and 1 01 of significant wave height above 4 m with 8 m periods in the location of meulaboh south kuta and manokwari respectively in addition martinelli et al 2013 said that the percentage of time of the significant wave height that lower than 0 5 m calm sea condition is an ideal condition for floating device would be easily accessible based on this research there is no significant wave height in meulaboh below 0 5 m in contrast there is still significant waves height with the value below 0 5 m in bali about 0 016 and 0 11 in manokwari thus south kuta has the great potential of wave energy developments from other locations 3 2 floating oscillating water column parameters there are several parameters that were identified of floating owc if this device will be implemented in those three locations planning they are wave force floating structure force optimal damping power incompressible air and power per second that can be produced tables 1 3 in this research the total area of owc is 76 18 m2 in addition there are four seasons in these locations the separation are based on monsoon in indonesia they are west monsoon december february transition 1 march may east monsoon june august and transition 2 september november monsoon has a strong relation to the wind because of that wind can impact the wave condition in those locations umesha et al 2015 the strongest wind in indonesia mostly happen in west monsoon and the lowest wind in east monsoon sasaki 2017 commonly in those seasons indonesia has the highest and lowest wave height the first parameter that we consider is wave force wave force in floating owc is related to the lower part of owc wave force handled the hydromechanics of large floating bodies in the sea in this case the wave force was identified in the slender cylinders journée and massie 2001 the value of wave force in owc can be determined by using froude krylov formulation in the equation of linear wave journée and massie 2001 techet 2005 in the equation of froude krylov some aspects that impact the value of wave force are density of sea water the area of owc piston width chamber height wave height and wave period in this case the piston width design that is used about 3 m with chamber height is 1 5 m based on this research result the highest value of wave force is in manokwari which happen in the transition 2 season with value of 1 950 549 94 n whereas the lowest wave force is in meulaboh in east monsoon with value of 1 868 025 76 n in meulaboh table 1 the value of wave force is very fluctuate where the value of wave force will increase from west monsoon to transition 1 season from east monsoon to transition 2 season and from transition 2 season to west monsoon in contrast the value of wave force will decrease from transition 1 season to the east monsoon in south kuta table 2 the values of wave force are also very fluctuate where the value of wave force will increase from west monsoon to transition 1 and from east monsoon to transition 2 season whereas for the changing of others seasons in this location the values of wave force are decrease in manokwari table 3 the values of wave force are tend to increase from west monsoon to transition 2 season but the value of wave force is decrease from transition 2 season to the west monsoon the fluctuation of wave force value is also influenced by the differences of wave heights and periods at those locations the wave force values may vary between locations and seasons the second parameter is floating structure force this force is the buoyant force of the building structure that is affected by the force of gravity this force is mostly influenced by the parameters in the upper part of owc they are mass damping radiation damping optimum power take off damping and owc water plane stiffness other than that floating structure force is also influenced by the value of cylinder diameter and wave force the value of cylinder diameter used is 0 9 m the relation between the wave force and the floating structure force is both forces work to create floating bodies in the sea wave force works more in the lower part of the owc while the floating wave force works at the upper part in this study the highest floating structure force value is in manokwari which happen in transition 2 season with the value of 216 727 77 n whereas the lowest floating structure force is in meulaboh in the east season with value of 207 558 42 n if the value of the floating structure force is compared with the wave force value generally the greater wave force value the greater floating structure force value will be generated the third parameter that was also consider is optimal damping interestingly based on the research of stappenbelt and cooper 2010 the optimal damping is independent of the wave force fs and floating structure force fo but optimal damping is influenced by wave periods the ratio of specific heats of air cp cv atmospheric pressure p and the owc water surface area a other than that parameters q and r which represented as a function of wave frequency ratio to the incompressible system of natural frequency also influence the value of optimal damping in this research cp cv value is 1 40 which is related to the temperature of 30 c general average of sea surface temperature of indonesian seas where the atmospheric pressure is 105 pa the greater optimal damping value so the greater power value that can be obtained in all locations the highest optimal damping of owc happen in the west moonson based on those locations south kuta bali has the highest optimal damping of owc that is about 3801 86 10 9 this is because mostly the wave reached the highest height and long periods in this time so the converter can generate a lot of electricity on the other hand the lowest optimal damping happen in meulaboh when transition 2 season with value of 243 88 10 9 the lowest optimal dampings are varies in all locations the lowest optimal damping happen in the transition 2 transition 1 and east monsoon respectively this condition is also impacted by the topography and others natural process the fourth parameter is the average of power incompressible air in owc the limiting case of incompressible air for a floating owc was made by setting r 0 μ so the power incompressible air in owc can be obtained mostly the value of incompressible air power in transition 2 season is higher than in other seasons except in manokwari on east monsoon the highest value of this parameter is in meulaboh which is about 334 45 j s whereas the lowest power incompressible air is in west monsoon because in this season owc works more efficient than in other seasons moreover the power per second that can be obtained is also calculated based on the calculation of the power of owc per second the highest power from each location is in west monsoon i e 0 53 j s in south kuta bali and the lowest power is in transition 2 season i e 0 15 j s in meulaboh in conclusion based on all analysis above south kuta bali seems more potential for wave energy development compared to other locations 3 3 power output prediction in this study the power calculations were separated based on location and season using floating owc the results of power calculations are presented in tables 4 6 in meulaboh table 4 the highest power that can be generated is in west monsoon with the average of power about 11 99 mw the lowest power is in transition 2 season with the average power about 4 67 mw in south kuta table 5 the highest power output is in west monsoon with average power of 16 83 mw whereas the lowest power output is in transition 1 season with average of 9 77 mw in manokwari table 6 the highest power output is in west monsoon with average of 12 32 mw and the lowest power is in east monsoon with average of 7 29 mw therefore from those location south kuta bali has the highest power which happen in the west monsoon otherwise meulaboh has the lowest power in transition 2 season moreover fig 5 is also presented the prediction of electrical power that can be generated in the 3 locations from this figures there are several trends of electrical power generated in meulaboh fig 5a the highest power energy that can be generated is in the west monsoon meanwhile the lowest electrical energy can be obtained in transition 2 seasons the trend from the graphic shows the value of power energy will be smaller as the season progresses to transition 1 east monsoon to transition 2 electrical energy can be obtained larger in the order of the opposite seasons in south kuta fig 5b the highest power energy can be generated in the west monsoon meanwhile the lowest electrical energy can be obtained in east monsoon season power energy which is obtained in the south kuta forming a pattern where energy will decrease as the season leads to transition 1 to east monsoon and energy will increase as it enters from transition 2 to west monsoon season therefore the largest power energy that can be obtained is when west monsoon in manokwari the highest power energy is in the west monsoon and the lowest power is in the transition 2 based on fig 5c there is a pattern of power that can be obtained from season to season in manokwari it is known that the more towards to the transition 1 season until the transition 2 season the power energy obtained is getting smaller the value of power energy will increase again during the transition 2 season to west monsoon based on these patterns the electrical power in south kuta is more stable than other locations 4 conclusion this study focus on the calculation of wave energy potential that can be generated from ocean wave energy in three different locations in indonesia they are meulaboh south kuta and manokwari south kuta has the highest and more stable wave energy that can be generated followed by manokwari and meulaboh those results are influenced by the characteristics of wave height and periods wind and also seasons the optimum of average of significant wave height and period is in south kuta about 2 03 m and 6 91 s whereas the lowest significant wave height and period is in meulaboh about 1 50 m and 5 98 s on the other hand from the analysis of probability of wave occurrence in three locations more than 50 of wave in south kuta is suitable for developing wave energy moreover based on the analysis of wave power prediction the patterns of wave power in south kuta is the most stable in conclusion build the floating owc in south kuta bali was more reliable than in other locations acknowledgements we would like thank to oceanography department diponegoro university center for coastal rehabilitation and disaster

23139,during the recent years indonesian government rapidly increase the electrification program which is mainly using coal energy however some areas are still need any supports of electricity as an archipelagic state indonesia is surrounded by seas which is potential for developing the wave energy three areas were selected for examining the wave energy potential i e meulaboh in sumatera south kuta in bali and manokwari in papua which is the representative of the region in west middle and east of indonesia respectively ocean wave characteristics were analyzed for each monsoon from 2012 to 2017 based on ocean wave forecasting using sverdrup munk and bretschneider method the electrical power calculations were done by using floating oscillating water column formulas based on our analysis the average of highest significant wave heights and periods in 3 sites happen in the west monsoon and the lowest average of significant wave heights and periods mostly happen in the east monsoon thus among the three locations that were examined south kuta bali is the best location to develop wave energy keywords wave energy marine renewable energy oscillating water column indonesia 1 introduction in the last decades the world has faced energy crisis issues the problem of energy in indonesia is the availability of fossil energy that continues to decline alifdini et al 2016 2017 however indonesia as one of developing countries in asia struggle to make an energy sustainability for the citizens sukarno et al 2015 as a result the electrification process in indonesia has been accelerating in the past two decades ramdani and setiani 2017 the electrical capacity of indonesia in the form of renewable energy are solar wind and biomass energy plan to increase the use of renewable energy including hydropower is 19 and 23 in 2019 and 2025 respectively iea 2015 hydropower consists of 10 of the total electrical generation capacity in 2013 there is only a little growth from this energy source in the last decade therefore indonesia plans to develop several mini hydropower plants adding 2 gw capacity in 2019 the government strongly supports investment in these plants particularly in remote areas to increase the electrification rate iea 2015 one of hydropower plant that can be developed is ocean based hydropower plant since 70 of indonesian region consist of ocean area there are some kind of ocean based hydropower one of them is harnessing energy from ocean waves the developments of ocean wave energy in indonesia are quite promising because some areas in indonesia are directly facing indian ocean and pacific ocean that have great wave energy among of some devices that have been developed for wave energy conversion is oscillating water column owc this device is a wave energy conversion that the most extensively studied in the recent years şentürk and özdamar 2011 oscillating water column owc is a device that transforms the mechanical energy of the waves into electrical power the waves enter to the chamber to compress and decompress the air around still water level swl so that an oscillate airflow will be created this airflow is passed through a power take off pto system which consists of a turbine and an induction generator that transforms this motion into electrical power garrido et al 2015 there are some kinds of oscillating water column owc that have been developed one of them is floating owc that can absorb power from the waves bull and johnson 2013 floating owc s are increasingly attractive due to their ability to benefit from more energetic wave energy bailey et al 2016 floating owc was demonstrated in 1 4 scale device off the irish coast based on the japanese bent backward duct buoy concept it has been in the water since december 2006 other than that oceanlinx have tested three devices and have tested two different turbines the dennis auld and the hydro air there are several other floating owcs e g embley energy s machine and the mighty whale despite not tested yet embley energy s machine is a simple robust machine while the mighty whale was deployed in japan but was not considered a success minns 2012 in addition floating owc devices have been studied and developed with the self rectifying wells turbine gomes et al 2011 that is floating independently konispoliatis and mavrakos 2016 the concept of floating owc can be described as follows it consists of a relatively long vertical tube open at both ends and attached to a floater this concept has been considered since the early pioneers of wave energy conversion falcão and henriques 2016 firdaus et al 2011 identified some of potential locations in indonesia to develop wave energy in addition zikra et al 2016 also studied some areas in indonesia that are potential to be developed for wave energy based on the characteristics of wave climates they considered the potential areas based on temporal variation in significant wave height using era interim reanalysis data from ecmwf european center for medium range weather forecasts for 35 years in the period from 1980 to 2014 some locations that are potential are in the western of sumatra island southern of java bali nusa tenggara island and northern of papua island in this study 3 locations were examined to represent the western part middle part and eastern part of indonesia they were meulaboh south kuta and manokwari representing western middle and eastern part of indonesia respectively meulaboh is a coastal region located in the western part of sumatra island that facing the indian ocean marlian et al 2015 the usage of electricity in meulaboh is still need to be developed since meulaboh is located in the outer region of indonesia on the other hand south kuta is one of the most popular beach in bali island which is located in the southern part of bali island purwanto 2011 this location is very easy to access and becomes the popular area for tourism because of the high tourism activity the demand of electricity is also high manokwari is the capital city of west papua province which has seven districts those districts are north manokwari east manokwari west manokwari south manokwari sidey tanah rubuh and masni runtuboi et al 2015 the district that has a wave energy potential is north manokwari because this location directly face the pacific ocean the electricity uses in papua island is still need to be developed with renewable energy because there is a limitation in access to develop conventional energy in papua island due to the extreme morphology and topography beside demand factors as mentioned above another important factor was also required for choosing sites for wave energy developments i e water depth dasgomes et al 2018 sugianto et al 2017 wave energy converters are mostly planned installed for depths less than 100 m and closer to the shore they will experience a decrease in the available wave energy that can be captured depending on the slope and roughness of the sea floor sundar et al 2010 where the water is deep 40 m depth near shore and offshore devices will necessarily be of the moored type thorpe 1992 thorpe 1999 based on lpi bathimetry map in the scale of 1 50 000 meulaboh has water depth ranging from 0 to 60 m south kuta bali waters has the depth from 0 to 200 m big 2018 and manokwari has waters depth from 0 to 400 m hatta 2014 in general meulaboh south kuta and manokwari waters are suitable for developing wave energy other than that floating owc has been tested successfully in gokasho bay japan with the most predominant significant wave height and period are 0 5 m and 6 s respectively moreover there are also some waves with significant wave height over 4 0 m in other words it is proven that the test site is generally relatively calm but in severe weather the wave height rises very much washio et al 2001 on the other hand the percentage of time for which the significant wave height is lower than 0 5 m calm sea condition is an ideal floating device would be easily accessible martinelli et al 2013 based on research of utami 2010 and saragih 2017 the western ocean of aceh to north sumatra including the meulaboh area southern ocean of bali to ntb and northern ocean of papua have a mean significant wave heights from 0 3 to 1 3 m 0 4 to 1 5 m and 0 4 to 1 25 m respectively the percentage of significant wave height lower than 3 m is 95 in all locations because of that these locations are quite possible to implement floating owc to harness electricity from waves 2 materials and methods 2 1 research locations wave energy resources were examined in three locations they were meulaboh south kuta and manokwari with the following coordinates from 4 11 24 39 n to 4 10 51 06 n and 95 56 41 59 e to 96 0 24 74 e from 8 51 53 79 s to 8 52 46 07 s and 115 7 30 99 e to 115 9 12 02 e and from 0 4 47 76 s to 0 14 48 88 s and 132 47 7 14 e to 132 32 4 04 e for meulaboh south kuta and manokwari respectively 2 2 wave forecasting in this study ocean waves were forecasted from wind data wind data were obtained from geophysical climatological and meteorological agency of indonesia from 2012 to 2017 the wave forecasting was done using sverdrup munk bret schneider s smb method cerc 1984 the wave height and period were determined based on the wave fetch conditions there are several criteria for determining wave characteristics based on fetch condition 2 2 1 fetch limited in the fetch limited conditions the wave heights and periods are determined by equations 1 3 1 g h u

o μ 3 results and discussion 3 1 wave condition forecasting of sea waves heights and periods were conducted using wind data at three locations fig 4 presents joint probability distributions of h t in meulaboh waters south kuta and manokwari in meulaboh fig 4a the wave height ranging from 0 72 m to 5 33 m with periods from 4 46 s to 5 68 s the dominance of waves that happen is in the height of 1 134 m with periods 5 6 s 17 62 then about 17 33 in the height of 0 84 m with period 4 6 s hence the value of significant wave height average in meulaboh is about 1 50 m with a significant wave period average is about 5 96 s in south kuta fig 4b significant wave height ranging from 0 39 m to 5 75 m with periods 3 29 s 10 21 s the most dominant of sea wave in this location is 1 91 m with period of 6 86 s 12 99 2 11 m with period 7 09 s 11 75 and 1 697 m with period 6 59 s 11 24 the average of significant wave height and period are 2 03 m and 6 91 s in manokwari fig 4c the significant wave height ranging from 0 53 m to 5 85 m and significant wave periods from 3 29 s to 9 90 s the most dominant of sea wave in this location is 0 72 m with period of 4 47 s 16 47 followed by 1 29 m with period of 6 12 s 15 34 the average of significant wave heights and periods are 1 72 m and 6 55 s from fig 4 it is also can be seen that there are 2 types of waves identified in meulaboh and south kuta while in manokwari there is only 1 type of wave in meulaboh the first type is characterized by the period ranging from 3 s to 8 s with the wave height ranging from 0 8 m to 5 6 m the second type which is less dominant than the first has the period ranging from 7 s to 10 s with the height ranging from 1 8 m to 5 6 m in the south kuta the difference between the first and the second type is quite significant especially in the period the first type has very short period ranging only from 1 s to 2 s with the wave height ranging from 0 5 m to 4 5 m the second type which becomes the most dominant wave type in south kuta has the period ranging from 3 s to 10 1 s with the wave height ranging from 0 3 m to 5 9 m the first type has more advantages for developing the wave energy since it has much shorter period than the second one with relatively has almost the same wave height however the first type only rarely occurs in the south kuta in manokwari the wave type is characterized by the period ranging from 3 s to 10 s with the height ranging from 0 5 m to 5 9 m from these three locations it can be concluded that south kuta bali has the highest significant wave height and period among other locations the result of the present study is different with utami 2010 which stated that the western ocean of aceh to north sumatra including the meulaboh area have a mean significant wave height from 0 3 m to 1 3 m moreover southern ocean of bali to ntb have a mean significant wave height from 0 4 m to 1 5 m in the northern ocean of papua the average of wave height is from 0 4 m to 1 25 m in addition the frequencies of wave height over 3 m in all locations that were identified aceh to north sumatra southern ocean of bali to ntb and northern ocean of papua are between 0 and 5 our results show that mean of significant wave height in meulaboh is 1 5 m in bali is 2 028 m and in manokwari is 1 72 m this means that the significant wave height in in the present study are 20 52 8 and 47 higher than that in utami 2010 for meulaboh south kuta and manokwari respectively these may be caused by the different areal size of our study and utami 2010 the study area of utami 2010 was not specifically at one location but cover large area in this study ocean waves were forecasted only at the specific points the probability of occurrence of wave heights and periods in three locations are also considered for wave energy development based on the previous research washio et al 2001 floating owc tested in gokasho bay japan has the most predominant significant wave height and wave period about 0 5 m and 6 s respectively but there are some waves with significant wave height over 4 0 m in meulaboh there are about 39 27 with significant wave height above 0 5 m and periods above 6 s in addition there are some significant wave height over 4 0 m about 0 86 in south kuta the significant wave height above 0 5 m and period of 6 s about 87 398 with wave height over 4 0 m about 1 49 in manokwari there are about 71 05 significant wave height over 0 5 m and significant wave periods over 6 s on the other hands there is 1 01 of significant wave height over 4 m then twidell and weir 2006 said that waves with long period t 8 s and height h 4 m have energy fluxes commonly averaging between 50 and 70 kw per m width of oncoming wave which makes them of considerable interest for power generation in this research there are about 0 86 1 42 and 1 01 of significant wave height above 4 m with 8 m periods in the location of meulaboh south kuta and manokwari respectively in addition martinelli et al 2013 said that the percentage of time of the significant wave height that lower than 0 5 m calm sea condition is an ideal condition for floating device would be easily accessible based on this research there is no significant wave height in meulaboh below 0 5 m in contrast there is still significant waves height with the value below 0 5 m in bali about 0 016 and 0 11 in manokwari thus south kuta has the great potential of wave energy developments from other locations 3 2 floating oscillating water column parameters there are several parameters that were identified of floating owc if this device will be implemented in those three locations planning they are wave force floating structure force optimal damping power incompressible air and power per second that can be produced tables 1 3 in this research the total area of owc is 76 18 m2 in addition there are four seasons in these locations the separation are based on monsoon in indonesia they are west monsoon december february transition 1 march may east monsoon june august and transition 2 september november monsoon has a strong relation to the wind because of that wind can impact the wave condition in those locations umesha et al 2015 the strongest wind in indonesia mostly happen in west monsoon and the lowest wind in east monsoon sasaki 2017 commonly in those seasons indonesia has the highest and lowest wave height the first parameter that we consider is wave force wave force in floating owc is related to the lower part of owc wave force handled the hydromechanics of large floating bodies in the sea in this case the wave force was identified in the slender cylinders journée and massie 2001 the value of wave force in owc can be determined by using froude krylov formulation in the equation of linear wave journée and massie 2001 techet 2005 in the equation of froude krylov some aspects that impact the value of wave force are density of sea water the area of owc piston width chamber height wave height and wave period in this case the piston width design that is used about 3 m with chamber height is 1 5 m based on this research result the highest value of wave force is in manokwari which happen in the transition 2 season with value of 1 950 549 94 n whereas the lowest wave force is in meulaboh in east monsoon with value of 1 868 025 76 n in meulaboh table 1 the value of wave force is very fluctuate where the value of wave force will increase from west monsoon to transition 1 season from east monsoon to transition 2 season and from transition 2 season to west monsoon in contrast the value of wave force will decrease from transition 1 season to the east monsoon in south kuta table 2 the values of wave force are also very fluctuate where the value of wave force will increase from west monsoon to transition 1 and from east monsoon to transition 2 season whereas for the changing of others seasons in this location the values of wave force are decrease in manokwari table 3 the values of wave force are tend to increase from west monsoon to transition 2 season but the value of wave force is decrease from transition 2 season to the west monsoon the fluctuation of wave force value is also influenced by the differences of wave heights and periods at those locations the wave force values may vary between locations and seasons the second parameter is floating structure force this force is the buoyant force of the building structure that is affected by the force of gravity this force is mostly influenced by the parameters in the upper part of owc they are mass damping radiation damping optimum power take off damping and owc water plane stiffness other than that floating structure force is also influenced by the value of cylinder diameter and wave force the value of cylinder diameter used is 0 9 m the relation between the wave force and the floating structure force is both forces work to create floating bodies in the sea wave force works more in the lower part of the owc while the floating wave force works at the upper part in this study the highest floating structure force value is in manokwari which happen in transition 2 season with the value of 216 727 77 n whereas the lowest floating structure force is in meulaboh in the east season with value of 207 558 42 n if the value of the floating structure force is compared with the wave force value generally the greater wave force value the greater floating structure force value will be generated the third parameter that was also consider is optimal damping interestingly based on the research of stappenbelt and cooper 2010 the optimal damping is independent of the wave force fs and floating structure force fo but optimal damping is influenced by wave periods the ratio of specific heats of air cp cv atmospheric pressure p and the owc water surface area a other than that parameters q and r which represented as a function of wave frequency ratio to the incompressible system of natural frequency also influence the value of optimal damping in this research cp cv value is 1 40 which is related to the temperature of 30 c general average of sea surface temperature of indonesian seas where the atmospheric pressure is 105 pa the greater optimal damping value so the greater power value that can be obtained in all locations the highest optimal damping of owc happen in the west moonson based on those locations south kuta bali has the highest optimal damping of owc that is about 3801 86 10 9 this is because mostly the wave reached the highest height and long periods in this time so the converter can generate a lot of electricity on the other hand the lowest optimal damping happen in meulaboh when transition 2 season with value of 243 88 10 9 the lowest optimal dampings are varies in all locations the lowest optimal damping happen in the transition 2 transition 1 and east monsoon respectively this condition is also impacted by the topography and others natural process the fourth parameter is the average of power incompressible air in owc the limiting case of incompressible air for a floating owc was made by setting r 0 μ so the power incompressible air in owc can be obtained mostly the value of incompressible air power in transition 2 season is higher than in other seasons except in manokwari on east monsoon the highest value of this parameter is in meulaboh which is about 334 45 j s whereas the lowest power incompressible air is in west monsoon because in this season owc works more efficient than in other seasons moreover the power per second that can be obtained is also calculated based on the calculation of the power of owc per second the highest power from each location is in west monsoon i e 0 53 j s in south kuta bali and the lowest power is in transition 2 season i e 0 15 j s in meulaboh in conclusion based on all analysis above south kuta bali seems more potential for wave energy development compared to other locations 3 3 power output prediction in this study the power calculations were separated based on location and season using floating owc the results of power calculations are presented in tables 4 6 in meulaboh table 4 the highest power that can be generated is in west monsoon with the average of power about 11 99 mw the lowest power is in transition 2 season with the average power about 4 67 mw in south kuta table 5 the highest power output is in west monsoon with average power of 16 83 mw whereas the lowest power output is in transition 1 season with average of 9 77 mw in manokwari table 6 the highest power output is in west monsoon with average of 12 32 mw and the lowest power is in east monsoon with average of 7 29 mw therefore from those location south kuta bali has the highest power which happen in the west monsoon otherwise meulaboh has the lowest power in transition 2 season moreover fig 5 is also presented the prediction of electrical power that can be generated in the 3 locations from this figures there are several trends of electrical power generated in meulaboh fig 5a the highest power energy that can be generated is in the west monsoon meanwhile the lowest electrical energy can be obtained in transition 2 seasons the trend from the graphic shows the value of power energy will be smaller as the season progresses to transition 1 east monsoon to transition 2 electrical energy can be obtained larger in the order of the opposite seasons in south kuta fig 5b the highest power energy can be generated in the west monsoon meanwhile the lowest electrical energy can be obtained in east monsoon season power energy which is obtained in the south kuta forming a pattern where energy will decrease as the season leads to transition 1 to east monsoon and energy will increase as it enters from transition 2 to west monsoon season therefore the largest power energy that can be obtained is when west monsoon in manokwari the highest power energy is in the west monsoon and the lowest power is in the transition 2 based on fig 5c there is a pattern of power that can be obtained from season to season in manokwari it is known that the more towards to the transition 1 season until the transition 2 season the power energy obtained is getting smaller the value of power energy will increase again during the transition 2 season to west monsoon based on these patterns the electrical power in south kuta is more stable than other locations 4 conclusion this study focus on the calculation of wave energy potential that can be generated from ocean wave energy in three different locations in indonesia they are meulaboh south kuta and manokwari south kuta has the highest and more stable wave energy that can be generated followed by manokwari and meulaboh those results are influenced by the characteristics of wave height and periods wind and also seasons the optimum of average of significant wave height and period is in south kuta about 2 03 m and 6 91 s whereas the lowest significant wave height and period is in meulaboh about 1 50 m and 5 98 s on the other hand from the analysis of probability of wave occurrence in three locations more than 50 of wave in south kuta is suitable for developing wave energy moreover based on the analysis of wave power prediction the patterns of wave power in south kuta is the most stable in conclusion build the floating owc in south kuta bali was more reliable than in other locations acknowledgements we would like thank to oceanography department diponegoro university center for coastal rehabilitation and disaster
