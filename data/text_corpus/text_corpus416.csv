2080,hydrological impact assessments are increasingly performed at fine spatial and temporal resolutions in order to resolve local scale changes under a future climate apart from the uncertainty represented by different climate models emission scenarios and post processing methods the local scale internal variability of the climate can be a major source of uncertainty for hydrological projections to assess the latter at the catchment scale this paper presents a methodology which is particularly suitable for spatially distributed hydrological models an ensemble of daily precipitation and daily mean temperature realizations on a high resolution grid is simulated from stochastic weather generators wgs trained on historical data and equipped with climate change information obtained from a regional climate model based on the resulting simulated daily runoff data the significance of changes in the runoff regime is assessed using a statistical hypothesis test and the variability contributed by the two input variables is quantified using the analysis of variance anova as a proof of concept simulations on a 1 km grid over a period of 19 years are carried out for nine catchments in central norway significant changes in runoff regimes are found indicating that the trends introduced in the wgs are not overwhelmed by the local scale internal variability variability in the runoff simulations varies substantially throughout the year it is highest in periods with potential snowmelt and lowest during winter temperature is the dominant source of variability in the colder months november march due to its influence on rainfall and snowmelt high variability in may june is contributed comparably by both temperature and precipitation in summer and early autumn the runoff variability is precipitation dominated the results are in line with findings in the literature where the runoff variability is driven by the large scale internal climate variability this indicates that ignoring the local scale internal variability may yield an underestimation of the overall variability in runoff projections and projected changes keywords local scale internal variability uncertainty gridded weather generator spatially distributed hbv model anova climate change impact data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in order to develop adaptation strategies relevant for e g agriculture civil water use hydropower production and reservoir operation information on hydrological changes at regional to local scales under a changing climate can be required at natural catchments or catchments that are subject to extensive human interventions barros et al 2014 hanssen bauer et al 2017b abhishek and kinouchi 2021 abhishek et al 2021 in northern europe the projected warming rate is amongst the highest in the world collins et al 2013 which combined with the projected changes in precipitation is expected to considerably impact evaporation rainfall and snow leading to significant changes in future runoff regime floods and droughts von storch et al 2015 in norway large variations in topography climate and land cover are commonly characterized within a catchment where hydrological processes can be highly sensitive to small scale climate variability beldring et al 2003 for an accurate quantification of the local scale changes hydrological impact assessments have optimally been performed at fine spatial and temporal scales e g wong et al 2011 hanssen bauer et al 2017a progress in high resolution gridded observational data products such as the senorge dataset lussana et al 2019 presents new opportunities for hydrologists to carry out reliable impact assessments at required fine scales however climate projections at equivalent scales are currently not widely available future climate information derives from coupled atmosphere ocean general circulation models gcms that are too coarse regional climate models rcms typically at a spatial resolution of 10 15 km e g jacob et al 2014 provide valuable information on mesoscale changes over a region with new advances in convection permitting climate modeling lind et al 2020 prein et al 2020 to bridge the scale gap and remove systematic biases in climate model outputs various post processing methods have been performed in hydrological impact studies maraun and widmann 2018 it has been found that the uncertainty in hydrological model projections is primarily caused by the uncertainty in future climatic forcing e g wilby and harris 2006 dobler et al 2012 bosshard et al 2013 addor et al 2014 wang et al 2020 in a multi model framework uncertain climatic forcing is represented by using projections from different climate models and or under different emission scenarios post processed with different methods and often assessed against the uncertainties arising from different hydrological models and or parameter sets or furthermore different analysis methods e g flood frequency analysis lawrence 2020 meresa et al 2021 less intensively explored is the effect of the internal variability of the climate partly because of the limited number of model runs available for any particular gcm or rcm peel et al 2015 the natural internal variability of the climate stems from its intrinsic chaotic nature and cannot be reduced with our increasing knowledge in climate science yip et al 2011 ghil and lucarini 2020 it thus determines a lower limit of our uncertainties associated with the climate system gelfan et al 2015 and potentially represents a major source of uncertainty in hydrological projections various methods have been suggested to account for the large scale internal variability of the climate in hydrological impact studies seiller and anctil 2014 found that the uncertainty arising from a five member gcm rcm ensemble is larger than the uncertainties contributed by different lumped hydrological models peel et al 2015 proposed to approximate the within gcm uncertainty using stochastic replicates of available projections where they found the within gcm uncertainty is amplified from mean annual precipitation to the simulated mean annual runoff and reservoir yield gelfan et al 2015 simulated a 45 member initial condition ensemble of a gcm and found higher uncertainty in streamflow simulations for flood periods and in catchment with stronger nonlinearity of runoff generation mechanisms one common issue with these studies is that the climate projections are bias corrected and downscaled using model output statistics mos methods such as simple mean adjustment and empirical quantile mapping which are problematic for capturing spatial and temporal variability at the finer hydrological modeling scale maraun and widmann 2018 to better represent the local scale internal variability of the climate stochastic ensembles are commonly generated using statistical methods lafaysse et al 2014 empirically downscaled gcm daily outputs to 100 possible realizations of local scale surface variables using k nearest neighbors k nn resampling they found the sign of change in future annual discharge is uncertain mainly as a result of the internal variability and the small scale internal variability accounts for 15 25 of the total uncertainty in projections given the uncertainties from gcm and downscaling method gao et al 2020 generated 1000 replicates of bias corrected downscaled gcm rainfall series using a stochastic daily rainfall model their results highlight the dominant effect of the precipitation internal variability in projections of future extreme flows in fatichi et al 2014 hourly precipitation and temperature data were generated using a multi site weather generator wg approach they found that internal climate variability overwhelms climate change signals in streamflow mean frequency and seasonality however these methods have limited strength to represent the internal variability of a changing climate in a colder region on a high resolution grid because 1 temporal sequence was not considered in the resampling procedure lafaysse et al 2014 2 only the rainfall variability was represented in gao et al 2020 whereas in regions with seasonal snow cover the variability of temperature is not negligible dobler et al 2012 gelfan et al 2015 and 3 climate change information derived from climate model outputs was added assuming piece wise stationarity in each future period fatichi et al 2014 whereas a changing climate could preferably be described as a continuously evolving space time process in this paper we present a methodology for exploring the hydrological uncertainty simulated when local scale internal variability is represented on a high resolution grid specifically we employ the wg methods developed for daily mean temperature yuan et al 2019 and daily precipitation yuan et al 2021 to simulate an ensemble of gridded time series a generator for each variable is trained on a high resolution observational data product for norway where the fine scale spatial and temporal marginal variations and the spatio temporal dependences are described using parametric statistical models the climate change signals obtained from an rcm are added to equivalent components of the generator including the trend the ensemble of temperature and precipitation data is then used to simulate daily runoff series with a spatially distributed hydrological model which has been used to perform hydrological impact assessments for the governmental report climate in norway 2100 hanssen bauer et al 2017a issued by the norwegian centre for climate service nccs based on the simulated runoff we first perform a statistical hypothesis test to assess whether there are significant changes in runoff regime given the trends in the wgs and the simulated variability in the input data assessing the significance of regime change is a common task in many studies some found that climate change signals in river streamflow are largely masked by internal climate variability e g lafaysse et al 2014 fatichi et al 2014 while others found robust expected changes in runoff cycle despite projection uncertainty e g finger et al 2012 addor et al 2014 our assessment can contribute to this ongoing discussion next we quantify the variability contributions of the two input variables variability in simulations arising from various sources are often estimated using analysis of variance anova techniques some use a time series based approach called the quasi ergodic anova hingray and saïd 2014 lafaysse et al 2014 vidal et al 2016 hingray et al 2019 which assumes among other things that the uncertainty from the internal climate variability is constant or roughly constant across projection lead times here we adopt the traditional anova approach as it requires fewer assumptions this approach has seen applications in climate projections yip et al 2011 and hydrological impact studies finger et al 2012 bosshard et al 2013 addor et al 2014 lawrence 2020 meresa et al 2021 quantifying sources of variability related to input variables is supposed to help focus attention on the process tractable components of the total variability in a case study we consider nine different catchments in central norway the catchments have different runoff regimes climatic types and areas varying between 144 km 2 and 3084 km 2 the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area methods for generating climate input data simulating daily runoff data and analysis of the simulated runoff data are given in section 3 the results are presented in section 4 followed by a discussion in section 5 the paper then concludes with a brief summary in section 6 2 study area the study area is located in trøndelag in central norway a region with large climatic variation and abundant hydropower resources as shown in fig 1 it covers the entire trøndelag and a small part of neighboring sweden we focus on nine catchments in this region shaded in gray in fig 1 with sizes ranging from 144 to 3084 km 2 and median elevations varying between 295 and 734 m a s l see table 1 they are natural catchments i e direct human interventions have negligible impacts on the catchment hydrology most of these catchments have daily discharge time series available for decades long period maintained and archived in the station network at the norwegian water resources and energy directorate referring to the nordic runoff regime map presented by gottschalk et al 1979 there is a gradual change of the regime as we move from east to west the catchments gaulfoss aamot and trangen a b and e have the mountain type regime with dominant high flows in spring due to snowmelt and dominant low flows in winter due to snow accumulation located in a transition zone between the mountain type and the inland type regime the four catchments veravatn dillfoss hoeggaas and kjeldstad f i tend to have a second or third highest runoff occurring in autumn in addition to the snowmelt high flows the catchments krinsvatn and oeyungen c and d have the baltic type regime and usually experience a summer low flow in addition to the lowest winter flows according to the köppen geiger climate classification presented by kottek et al 2006 krinsvatn and oeyungen have a maritime climate while the other catchments have a humid continental climate 3 methods and data 3 1 climate input data and hydrological model simulation 3 1 1 generating gridded daily mean temperature and daily precipitation high resolution gridded climate input data required for hydrological simulations are stochastically simulated using weather generator wg approaches proposed for daily mean temperature yuan et al 2019 and daily precipitation yuan et al 2021 the wgs are trained on a 1 km gridded observational data product senorge 2018 version 18 12 provided by the norwegian meteorological institute lussana et al 2019 and combined with climate change information obtained from an rcm in the euro cordex 11 ensemble jacob et al 2014 operating at a 12 km spatial resolution the rcm combines the cosmo model in climate mode cclm steger and bucchignani 2020 with boundary conditions from the mpi earth system model giorgetta et al 2013 as shown in fig 1 our study area comprises 695 rcm grid cells rectangular like polygons and 109 514 senorge grid cells within the polygons not shown the rcm outputs are simulated with different types of forcing before and after the year 2005 i e recorded and projected emissions respectively we thus take only the historical run to avoid possible inconsistency in the model behavior due to the shift in the forcing both senorge and rcm data are available from 1957 we train the wg for each variable and catchment using the senorge data from 1957 to 1986 and derive climate change information on the rcm grid by comparing the rcm data from the two time periods 1957 1986 and 1987 2005 simulations of each variable are then performed for the period 1987 2005 for each catchment the wgs employed here comprise marginal models with parameters varying smoothly across grid cells and over time and models describing spatial and temporal dependences for realistic simulations of daily temperature and precipitation fields specifically the wg for temperature uses a gaussian distribution with a mean and a variance component and a stationary and separable spatio temporal model for residuals yuan et al 2019 we independently sample 10 realizations of spatial residuals and 10 realizations of temporal residuals to sufficiently account for the randomness in the model and by adding the rcm simulated changes in the mean while keeping the variance unchanged we obtain 100 realizations of temperature simulations in c the wg for precipitation uses a discrete continuous distribution with precipitation occurrence described by a probit regression model amount on wet days by a gamma distribution and a single non stationary gaussian random field driving the spatio temporal correlations in both the occurrences and the amounts yuan et al 2021 the rcm simulated changes in the probability of occurrence the amount on wet days and the temporal correlation in the underlying spatial random field are used to update the corresponding model components of the wg from the single random field model we sample 10 realizations which are then transformed into 10 realizations of precipitation data in mm day 1 in table 1 we list the annual mean temperature and the annual precipitation averaged over the simulation period 1987 2005 for each catchment the two larger mountain catchments gaulfoss and trangen have a relatively colder and dryer climate while the two smaller coastal catchments krinsvatn and oeyungen are considerably warmer and wetter 3 1 2 simulating daily runoff with a distributed hbv model for hydrological simulations we consider the spatially distributed hbv model developed by beldring et al 2003 for norway the hbv hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning model has undergone decades of developments and applications in nordic countries and over the world bergström 1976 sælthun 1996 seibert and bergström 2022 the model version employed in this study has a 1 km spatial resolution and is run with a daily time step it has an interception routine a snow routine where snowmelt is calculated based on a simple degree day method a soil moisture routine where the potential evapotranspiration is estimated using a temperature index method e g sælthun 1996 xu and singh 2001 and a dynamical part where runoff is generated from an upper zone and a lower zone two land use classes forests and open lands and two soil types wetlands and others are used to specify the parameters of the processes above and beneath the ground surface beldring et al 2003 we calibrate and validate the model based on the senorge data the nonlinear parameter estimation method pest doherty et al 1994 lawrence et al 2009 is used to find an optimal set of parameters separately for individual catchments where model simulated discharge is compared with the observed discharge using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 and relative volume bias yapo et al 1996 as performance measures initial spin up periods of six months are used to adjust the model before the calibration and validation procedures are started the calibration period 1988 2002 shows a mean nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 80 with a mean volume bias of 0 7 while the validation period 2003 2018 yields a mean nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 74 with a mean volume bias of 7 we then run the model for all possible combinations of the 100 simulated temperature realizations and the 10 simulated precipitation realizations this yields 1000 time series of simulated daily runoff for each catchment over the period 1987 2005 i e time series of daily discharge averaged over the catchment area in mm day 1 as an example fig 2 shows the simulated mean annual runoff cycles over the period 1987 2005 on average the runoff is highest in the two smaller coastal catchments krinsvatn and oeyungen followed by the smallest catchment kjeldstad consistent with the simulated precipitation amounts cf table 1 in general low flows in january march are followed by high flows in april june with a peak simulated in may the flows then become more stable or have a mild increase in autumn and decline again in november december krinsvatn and oeyungen have a summer low flow preceding an autumn high flow as is characteristic for the baltic type regime the internal variability of the input results in considerable variability in the simulated runoff particularly in the catchments with the highest runoff and in the snowmelt season in addition there appears to be a pattern of clustering between july and october in some catchments this will be investigated further in section 3 2 3 3 2 analysis of simulated runoff data in the following we focus on the annual cycle of runoff that is how runoff volumes vary throughout the year we follow for example finger et al 2012 and addor et al 2014 and describe the annual cycle of a year by monthly values which are computed as the average over the simulated daily values in the respective months alternatively it can be estimated by m day moving averages e g bosshard et al 2013 to avoid separation of the data by month the mean annual cycle refers to the average annual cycle over a period of years represented by multi year mean monthly values e g fig 2 while the change in the mean annual cycle refers to the difference in the mean monthly values between two periods here we divide the simulations for the period 1987 2005 into two non overlapping periods 1987 1995 and 1997 2005 we consider the mean annual cycle for each period as well as changes between the two periods the corresponding runoff statistics in mm day 1 are computed for each of the 1000 simulations and the following analyses are performed separately for each catchment 3 2 1 testing changes in the mean annual runoff cycle to assess the significance of changes in the mean annual runoff cycle we perform a statistical hypothesis test for each calendar month denote by x the mean monthly runoff in a given month and by d the simulated change between the two time periods specifically 1 d x 1997 2005 x 1987 1995 for each month we have n 1000 independent realizations of the simulated change d 1 d n we assume the simulated change d follows a normal distribution with mean μ d and standard deviation σ d then the mean value d follows a normal distribution with mean μ d and standard deviation σ d n formally 2 d 1 n i 1 n d i n μ d σ d n the objective is now to test the null hypothesis h 0 μ d 0 versus the alternative h a μ d 0 denote by s d the sample standard deviation 3 s d 1 n i 1 n d i d 2 we use the test statistic of the one sample t test t d s d n which is approximately standard normal for large n we reject h 0 at the 5 level if t 1 96 or t 1 96 alternatively it is common in the literature to use the signal to noise ratio s n for assessing the significance of change signal the signal s is usually the ensemble mean however it varies somewhat how the noise n is defined for example n has been calculated based on the standard deviation of a multi member ensemble from a different climate model e g zhuan et al 2018 gu et al 2019 the observed discharge records addor et al 2014 the interannual variability of the sample averaged future projections finger et al 2012 and based on the control scenario ensemble generated for each climate model fatichi et al 2014 moreover the significance has been assessed at different levels using our notation we can write s n d c s d where c is a constant the constant c has been set to e g 1 65 2 or 1 hawkins and sutton 2009 zhuan et al 2018 gu et al 2019 3 2 2 quantifying variability due to climate inputs using anova variability in the runoff simulations is analyzed using analysis of variance anova the anova method has been applied to quantify different sources of variability in future climate projections e g yip et al 2011 hydrological projections of the runoff cycle e g finger et al 2012 bosshard et al 2013 addor et al 2014 extreme flows e g gao et al 2020 and flood hazards e g lawrence 2020 meresa et al 2021 here anova is applied to quantify sources of variability related to temperature and precipitation input data in the runoff simulations for a given month denote by x i j a response driven by temperature simulation i 1 100 and precipitation simulation j 1 10 the anova model equation for x i j is given by 4 x i j μ τ i η j ɛ i j with i 1 100 τ i 0 j 1 10 η j 0 and the error terms ɛ i j are assumed independent and identically distributed the overall mean response is given by μ τ i is the effect of the i th temperature simulation and η j is the effect of the j th precipitation simulation both given as the deviation from the overall mean the total variability in x i j and variability due to various factors can be quantified by sums of squares an approach adopted by e g finger et al 2012 bosshard et al 2013 addor et al 2014 and gao et al 2020 here we follow yip et al 2011 and define all sources of variability in terms of variance 5 vt 1 100 i 1 100 x i x 2 6 vp 1 10 j 1 10 x j x 2 7 ve 1 1000 j 1 10 i 1 100 x i j x i x j x 2 8 vtotal 1 1000 j 1 10 i 1 100 x i j x 2 vt vp ve where e g x i denotes the average over the index j x i 1 10 j 1 10 x i j that is the total variability is given by the sample variance vtotal it decomposes into variability due to temperature simulations vt precipitation simulations vp and an unexplained part ve we apply the anova framework to three types of responses related to the mean annual runoff cycle 1 for each month the mean monthly runoff for 1987 1995 and 1997 2005 respectively where the sample variance is considered a measure of natural variability in the corresponding period 2 for each month the monthly runoff for each year to study the interannual variation of the variability throughout the entire simulation period and 3 for each month the change in the mean monthly runoff between 1987 1995 and 1997 2005 variance decomposition results will be presented in unit mm day 1 2 i e the square of the runoff statistics unit 3 2 3 assessing model assumptions using bootstrap to assess the model assumptions of the procedures described above we additionally apply a bootstrap procedure similar to that employed by addor et al 2014 to assess natural variability based on observed discharge records specifically we perform the following 1 for our set of n 1000 simulations randomly select a sample of size about 10 of the total number of n n 1 2 pairs 2 compute the difference within each selected pair and then for each month compute the sample standard deviation based on the difference values these two steps are repeated 100 times to account for sampling variability and we subsequently take the 95 bootstrap confidence interval based on the results denote by d k x 1 k x 2 k for k 1 m the differences computed in step 2 for the m randomly selected pairs x 1 k x 2 k k 1 m of step 1 the sample variance of the differences is given by 9 v d 1 m k 1 m d k d 2 1 m k 1 m x 1 k x 1 2 x 2 k x 2 2 2 x 1 k x 1 x 2 k x 2 2 vtotal where the approximation in the last step holds when m is large and the realizations in the sample are independent the bootstrap results can thus be used to investigate possible correlations in the data specifically if the 95 bootstrap confidence interval lies below 2 vtotal the realizations in the sample may be positively correlated causing e g systematic clustering in the runoff simulations we perform this assessment for both the mean monthly runoff and the change in the mean monthly runoff 4 results 4 1 changes in the mean annual runoff cycle the average simulated changes in the mean annual runoff cycle from 1987 1995 to 1997 2005 are listed in table 2 annotated with conclusions from t tests testing the significance of the changes the null hypothesis of no change is generally rejected except for six instances scattered among different months and catchments january in gaulfoss november in krinsvatn and oeyungen september in trangen august and september in hoeggaas in addition the pattern of changes is similar across the catchments there is generally less runoff from october to april in the more recent time period with the largest decline mostly occurring in april while the largest increases are simulated in may or june followed by smaller increases of runoff in july september furthermore fig 3 shows that in the catchment krinsvatn despite the interannual variation the sample averaged monthly runoff seems to have underlying trends across the simulation period that generally reflects the change values shown in table 2 similar correspondence is found in the other catchments results not shown which means in general the changes are driven by an evolving process rather than by randomness to better understand the changes in the mean runoff for each month we look at the corresponding changes in the hydroclimatological variables shown in fig 4 for two representative catchments gaulfoss has a continental climate mountain type runoff regime and is the largest catchment 3084 km 2 whereas krinsvatn has a maritime climate baltic type regime and is much smaller in size 206 km 2 for the temperature generator the rcm indicates a negative trend over the simulation period yuan et al 2019 and therefore on average a lower temperature is obtained in all months for the period 1997 2005 compared to 1987 1995 see fig 4a and c precipitation changes are less consistent between the months and catchments fig 4b and d because the long term trends as well as the seasonal variations in the probability of occurrence and amount on wet days are adjusted by the rcm simulated changes which again vary slightly between the catchments yuan et al 2021 in the catchment gaulfoss the reduced runoff from october to april is associated with the decreasing rainfall and snowmelt fig 4b where the largest runoff decline in april is mostly driven by the snowmelt as temperature rises above zero degree in may june runoff increases mainly with snowmelt changes of which exhibit a wide spread from july to september the effect of snowmelt diminishes and runoff tends to vary more closely with rainfall a similar pattern can be found in the catchment krinsvatn while the key difference is that krinsvatn has a warmer climate temperature rises above zero during april fig 4c which triggers an earlier snowmelt than gaulfoss causing a larger amount of snowmelt in may with relatively less snowpack left in june and therefore the largest increase of runoff is in may fig 4d we found that the runoff changes in the other catchments are similarly related to the changes in rainfall and snowmelt not shown effects of warming on snowmelt flood timing and intensity as well as rainfall governed changes in autumn discharge are widely discussed based on projections over a longer lead time in the future e g seiller and anctil 2014 lafaysse et al 2014 4 2 sources of variability in simulated runoff anova results on the variability in the simulated mean annual runoff cycle for the periods 1987 1995 and 1997 2005 are shown in fig 5 for the two catchments gaulfoss and krinsvatn overall the total variability varies substantially between calendar months it is highest around the snowmelt season in spring followed by autumn and summer and lowest in february that is the physical mechanisms of snowmelt and rainfall high flows are more sensitive to climate variability than the more inertial low flow generation mechanisms gelfan et al 2015 the highest mean runoff in may june cf fig 2 is associated mainly with snowmelt the amount of which is highly uncertain due to uncertainty in temperature changes in that month as well as changes in snowpack volume which has been adjusted by the temperature and precipitation from previous months until the onset of snowmelt therefore the runoff variability in may june has comparably large contributions from both temperature and precipitation as well as other unexplained variability sources of variability follow a clear seasonal pattern variability in temperature is a major source of overall variability in runoff during snowmelt season and in early spring late autumn when temperatures above or below freezing cause precipitation to fall as rain or snow respectively the former echos the findings of dobler et al 2012 that the spread of temperature projections by different gcms leads to uncertain projections of winter and spring runoff during summer and early autumn rainfall becomes the primary source of runoff and variability in runoff is thus tightly linked to that in precipitation the unexplained variability is generally low compared to the other two factors as fig 5 shows there are substantial changes in the total variability between the two time periods in gaulfoss represented by a large increase in may due to the temperature simulations and a smaller increase in june contributed mostly by the precipitation simulations by contrast the seasonal pattern in krinsvatn seems more consistent across the two time periods except for increases in june and september in both catchments the low variability in february march further decreases the results shown here and found in the other catchments not shown suggest that natural variability and the underlying sources may vary somewhat between the two time periods to better understand the changes in the variability over the two time periods interannual variation of the variability in the annual runoff cycle at krinsvatn is shown in fig 6 for most months the total variability varies across the years without showing an apparent trend which is in line with the results shown in fig 5 however the increasing trend in june and september as well as the decreasing trend in february and march seem to have good correspondence with the changes found in fig 5 in addition trends in the individual sources of variability match the changes shown in fig 5 for instance the increasing dominance of temperature in april and the increased variability due to both temperature and precipitation in june a distinct feature shown in fig 6 is that the variability in the simulations can be very high in october for individual years although the variability in the decadal mean runoff in october is much lower than that for may cf fig 5 this is because the average variability is higher in may in the other baltic type catchment oeyungen and the catchments with a transition type runoff regime the simulated runoff variability in august october fluctuates substantially between the years it can be as high as the variability in april but always lower than variability in the snowmelt high flow season results not shown variability in the simulated changes in the mean annual runoff cycle from 1987 1995 to 1997 2005 are shown in fig 7 for the two catchments gaulfoss and krinsvatn the patterns in variability correspond well with the patterns shown in fig 4 note that the total variability in the simulated changes roughly corresponds to the sum of the total variability over the two time periods cf fig 5 this indicates that there is a low correlation between the mean runoff values of the two time periods and stresses that ignoring the local scale internal variability has a compound effect when projected changes are considered rather than projected values 4 3 assessment of model assumptions fig 8 shows the results of the bootstrap procedure described in section 3 2 3 to assess model assumptions of independent simulations of runoff the results show that the sample standard deviation vtotal of the anova procedure given in eq 8 and the standard deviation estimate v d based on a set of pairwise differences given in eq 9 possess identical seasonal patterns furthermore the ratio between the two measures is generally close to 2 the expected value for independent simulations specifically the 95 bootstrap confidence interval for v d includes 2 vtotal in all months for gaulfoss see fig 8a and b for krinsvatn the confidence interval is slightly lower than the expected value in july september and october for the period 1987 1995 fig 8d and august and september for 1997 2005 fig 8e we found that except for the catchment trangen e the confidence interval is slightly below the expected value in individual months typically between july and october not shown which coincides with the months exhibiting a pattern of clustering in fig 2 as indicated by the anova results the mean runoff of these months probably cluster around the 10 precipitation simulations this coincides with the results of fig 5 that the total variability in the mean monthly runoff during this time of the year is largely dominated by the variability in the precipitation simulations the bootstrap procedure was additionally applied to the sample of changes in the mean monthly runoff as shown in fig 8c and f there does not seem to be significant correlations apart from august in krinsvatn we found that in four of the nine catchments a e f and i no month tends to have correlated changes whereas for the other catchments positive correlations may be found typically between august and october not shown the effects of correlations in the mean monthly runoff across different simulations are thus somewhat mitigated by considering change in runoff rather than runoff itself 5 discussion 5 1 parametrization of hydrological processes in the hbv model the simple structure of the parameter parsimonious hbv model is an advantage in the sense that parameters are more clearly identified and the problem of parameter equifinality is reduced perrin et al 2001 abebe et al 2010 poulin et al 2011 however there are some limitations with simple models if atmospheric processes such as wind speed radiation and humidity under climate change has a strong impact on some processes it may be leading to model parameters not being valid under non stationary conditions beldring et al 2008 poulin et al 2011 as an example the temperature index approach used for estimating potential evapotranspiration may exaggerate the increase in evaporation in the future beldring et al 2008 a similar argument could be used for snowmelt since the main atmospheric processes determining this process are radiation wind speed and humidity dingman 2015 whereas the hbv model uses a temperature index approach in this case as well hydrological models with physically based equations could potentially have the possibility to identify changes in the significance of different processes but on the other hand the lack of ability to identify correct parameter values for the equations describing the hydrological processes limits this possibility in particular for sub surface processes like soil moisture and groundwater 5 2 significance testing the results of the significance tests indicated significant changes in mean monthly runoff from 1987 1995 to 1997 2005 for most months and catchments the changes additionally show a similar seasonal patterns across the different catchments these are not unexpected since the climate change information is derived from only one rcm which in particular predicts a negative trend in temperature over the study period furthermore the subsequent hydrological simulations do not introduce additional uncertainty as they are performed using a single optimized set of parameters however such detectable and consistent changes may not be common and are not expected when different rcms hydrological parameters models or catchments with more heterogeneity are involved in a case study besides given the large sample size here a small change may likely have statistical significance yet whether such a change has practical significance should be considered in context a discussion we consider beyond the scope of the current paper 5 3 the anova framework in this study the simulated variability is measured by the sample variance applications seeking a variability measure in the same unit as the variable of interest may find a decomposition of the total standard deviation more appropriate e g addor et al 2014 lafaysse et al 2014 in this case an equation of the standard deviations may be derived from eq 8 using e g a scaling method as proposed in appendix b of hawkins and sutton 2011 the full model chain for assessing hydrological impacts of climate change includes multiple components each associated with its own sources of uncertainty commonly some components have fewer levels than the other e g there may be two post processing methods applied to outputs from eight climate models raising a concern of uneven representation of different sources in the total uncertainty to address this bosshard et al 2013 propose a subsampling method where components with many levels are downsized to match the size of the component with fewest levels and iteratively apply anova on each subset of the full sample this provides technical benefits when sample sizes are restricted e g less than 10 bosshard et al 2013 here there are relatively small computational costs associated with each additional precipitation or temperature sample compared to the costs of increasing the sample size of other components of the full model chain specifically the number of simulations for temperature and precipitation differing by a factor of 10 was chosen so that each of the stochastic parts in the weather generator is equally represented in the current setup interactions between temperature and precipitation cannot be separated from other unexplained variability since only one simulation of runoff is obtained for each combination of the inputs throughout the study we found that the unexplained variability is significantly smaller than that directly linked to precipitation and temperature nonetheless interactions between different factors can be important bosshard et al 2013 meresa et al 2021 and in order to quantify these interactions the current framework has to be expanded one option would be to produce multiple runoff simulations for each combination of inputs using equally suitable parameter sets in the hydrological model e g lawrence 2020 meresa et al 2021 accordingly the anova model eq 4 would be extended to include both the main effects and an interaction between temperature and precipitation as a result the sample variance would be decomposed into four parts where the unexplained part in eq 8 would be replaced by variability due to the interaction between temperature and precipitation and the variability due to the hydrological model parameters the anova framework applied here is a fixed effect model in the sense that the effects of individual climate variable simulations are treated as if they were fixed instead of being randomly drawn from a population distribution consequently the analysis is a finite population inference through a variance decomposition of an existing sample however theoretically the weather generators provide an opportunity of generating more realizations if needed which corresponds to a superpopulation of effects therefore when there is a need to consider the uncertainty of having a different set of inputs realizations methods of superpopulation inferences gelman 2005 are more suitable see also northrop and chandler 2014 for an application to climate projections the current analysis is performed for the annual runoff cycle while other statistics such as extreme runoff indicators or other hydrological fluxes and states e g actual evapotranspiration soil moisture deficits could be analyzed in a similar manner while the application here is focused on climate change impacts on regional hydrology the methods provide a general approach to uncertainty investigation for various time horizons other promising applications include seasonal to decadal water resources prediction on the basis of weather and climate predictions the computationally efficient downscaling methods of temperature and precipitation are particularly useful where large ensembles are required in order to achieve prediction skill and a reliable quantification of sources of variability 6 conclusions this paper carries out a study to simulate and analyze uncertainties in hydrological impact studies that arise from the local scale internal variability of the climate to represent that at the catchment scale we simulate multiple sets of gridded daily precipitation and mean temperature data at 1 km resolution using a weather generator wg approach the wg uses local information from a high resolution observational data product and climate change information from an rcm a large set of daily runoff series are then generated based on the temperature and precipitation simulations using a spatially distributed hydrological model the analysis is focused on the annual runoff cycle of nine catchments in central norway with different runoff regimes climatic types and areas ranging from 144 to 3084 km 2 significance tests are applied to assess changes in the mean monthly runoff from 1987 1995 to 1997 2005 and sources of variability in the runoff simulations are quantified using analysis of variance anova where the total variability is decomposed into contributions from the two input variables as well as an unexplained component model assumptions of independence are assessed using a bootstrap procedure the change signal in the mean annual runoff cycle is found to be generally significant indicating that the trends imposed on the wg are not overwhelmed by the simulated internal variability variability in the runoff simulations is highest in high flow periods in the snowmelt season between april and june and in autumn for some catchments while the simulated runoff variability in autumn varies substantially between the years the average level of variability is lower than the snowmelt season temperature is the main source of variability in the colder months november march both temperature and precipitation contribute to the variability in the snowmelt season and variability in july october is largely due to that in precipitation the analysis assumes that the individual simulations are independent even if they may share either a precipitation input or a temperature input an assessment of this assumption reveals that the simulations are largely independent with some simulations showing a low degree of correlation between august and october when the variability in runoff is largely dominated by that in precipitation only a reliable estimation of the changes in annual runoff cycle and the associated uncertainties can be applied for climate adaptation measures in water management for example hydropower companies will need to adapt planning to a changed seasonal pattern of runoff volumes under a changing climate in norway reservoir operation commonly needs to adjust the water levels properly before the snowmelt in order to avoid the spring flood and also meet requirements for environmental low flow and many other water use purposes during summer a delayed more concentrated snowmelt that is accompanied by an increased level of variability as simulated for some catchments in our case study may pose challenges such as accommodating to a prolonged low flow period in early spring and dealing with an increased difficulty in adjusting the water levels such that both the spring flood and possible deficits in summer could be avoided this study considers variability in runoff simulations caused by the local scale internal variability in temperature and precipitation the results are in line with findings where the large scale internal climate variability is represented by a multi member gcm ensemble gelfan et al 2015 or a gcm rcm chain seiller and anctil 2014 this indicates that ignoring the local scale internal variability may yield an underestimation of the overall variability in projections and projected changes which may further affect the adaptation strategies not only for the changes in future water resources but also for water

2080,hydrological impact assessments are increasingly performed at fine spatial and temporal resolutions in order to resolve local scale changes under a future climate apart from the uncertainty represented by different climate models emission scenarios and post processing methods the local scale internal variability of the climate can be a major source of uncertainty for hydrological projections to assess the latter at the catchment scale this paper presents a methodology which is particularly suitable for spatially distributed hydrological models an ensemble of daily precipitation and daily mean temperature realizations on a high resolution grid is simulated from stochastic weather generators wgs trained on historical data and equipped with climate change information obtained from a regional climate model based on the resulting simulated daily runoff data the significance of changes in the runoff regime is assessed using a statistical hypothesis test and the variability contributed by the two input variables is quantified using the analysis of variance anova as a proof of concept simulations on a 1 km grid over a period of 19 years are carried out for nine catchments in central norway significant changes in runoff regimes are found indicating that the trends introduced in the wgs are not overwhelmed by the local scale internal variability variability in the runoff simulations varies substantially throughout the year it is highest in periods with potential snowmelt and lowest during winter temperature is the dominant source of variability in the colder months november march due to its influence on rainfall and snowmelt high variability in may june is contributed comparably by both temperature and precipitation in summer and early autumn the runoff variability is precipitation dominated the results are in line with findings in the literature where the runoff variability is driven by the large scale internal climate variability this indicates that ignoring the local scale internal variability may yield an underestimation of the overall variability in runoff projections and projected changes keywords local scale

to develop adaptation strategies relevant for e g agriculture civil water use hydropower production and reservoir operation information on hydrological changes at regional to local scales under a changing climate can be required at natural catchments or catchments that are subject to extensive human interventions barros et al 2014 hanssen bauer et al 2017b abhishek and kinouchi 2021 abhishek et al 2021 in northern europe the projected warming rate is amongst the highest in the world collins et al 2013 which combined with the projected changes in precipitation is expected to considerably impact evaporation rainfall and snow leading to significant changes in future runoff regime floods and droughts von storch et al 2015 in norway large variations in topography climate and land cover are commonly characterized within a catchment where hydrological processes can be highly sensitive to small scale climate variability beldring et al 2003 for an accurate quantification of the local scale changes hydrological impact assessments have optimally been performed at fine spatial and temporal scales e g wong et al 2011 hanssen bauer et al 2017a progress in high resolution gridded observational data products such as the senorge dataset lussana et al 2019 presents new opportunities for hydrologists to carry out reliable impact assessments at required fine scales however climate projections at equivalent scales are currently not widely available future climate information derives from coupled atmosphere ocean general circulation models gcms that are too coarse regional climate models rcms typically at a spatial resolution of 10 15 km e g jacob et al 2014 provide valuable information on mesoscale changes over a region with new advances in convection permitting climate modeling lind et al 2020 prein et al 2020 to bridge the scale gap and remove systematic biases in climate model outputs various post processing methods have been performed in hydrological impact studies maraun and widmann 2018 it has been found that the uncertainty in hydrological model projections is primarily caused by the uncertainty in future climatic forcing e g wilby and harris 2006 dobler et al 2012 bosshard et al 2013 addor et al 2014 wang et al 2020 in a multi model framework uncertain climatic forcing is represented by using projections from different climate models and or under different emission scenarios post processed with different methods and often assessed against the uncertainties arising from different hydrological models and or parameter sets or furthermore different analysis methods e g flood frequency analysis lawrence 2020 meresa et al 2021 less intensively explored is the effect of the internal variability of the climate partly because of the limited number of model runs available for any particular gcm or rcm peel et al 2015 the natural internal variability of the climate stems from its intrinsic chaotic nature and cannot be reduced with our increasing knowledge in climate science yip et al 2011 ghil and lucarini 2020 it thus determines a lower limit of our uncertainties associated with the climate system gelfan et al 2015 and potentially represents a major source of uncertainty in hydrological projections various methods have been suggested to account for the large scale internal variability of the climate in hydrological impact studies seiller and anctil 2014 found that the uncertainty arising from a five member gcm rcm ensemble is larger than the uncertainties contributed by different lumped hydrological models peel et al 2015 proposed to approximate the within gcm uncertainty using stochastic replicates of available projections where they found the within gcm uncertainty is amplified from mean annual precipitation to the simulated mean annual runoff and reservoir yield gelfan et al 2015 simulated a 45 member initial condition ensemble of a gcm and found higher uncertainty in streamflow simulations for flood periods and in catchment with stronger nonlinearity of runoff generation mechanisms one common issue with these studies is that the climate projections are bias corrected and downscaled using model output statistics mos methods such as simple mean adjustment and empirical quantile mapping which are problematic for capturing spatial and temporal variability at the finer hydrological modeling scale maraun and widmann 2018 to better represent the local scale internal variability of the climate stochastic ensembles are commonly generated using statistical methods lafaysse et al 2014 empirically downscaled gcm daily outputs to 100 possible realizations of local scale surface variables using k nearest neighbors k nn resampling they found the sign of change in future annual discharge is uncertain mainly as a result of the internal variability and the small scale internal variability accounts for 15 25 of the total uncertainty in projections given the uncertainties from gcm and downscaling method gao et al 2020 generated 1000 replicates of bias corrected downscaled gcm rainfall series using a stochastic daily rainfall model their results highlight the dominant effect of the precipitation internal variability in projections of future extreme flows in fatichi et al 2014 hourly precipitation and temperature data were generated using a multi site weather generator wg approach they found that internal climate variability overwhelms climate change signals in streamflow mean frequency and seasonality however these methods have limited strength to represent the internal variability of a changing climate in a colder region on a high resolution grid because 1 temporal sequence was not considered in the resampling procedure lafaysse et al 2014 2 only the rainfall variability was represented in gao et al 2020 whereas in regions with seasonal snow cover the variability of temperature is not negligible dobler et al 2012 gelfan et al 2015 and 3 climate change information derived from climate model outputs was added assuming piece wise stationarity in each future period fatichi et al 2014 whereas a changing climate could preferably be described as a continuously evolving space time process in this paper we present a methodology for exploring the hydrological uncertainty simulated when local scale internal variability is represented on a high resolution grid specifically we employ the wg methods developed for daily mean temperature yuan et al 2019 and daily precipitation yuan et al 2021 to simulate an ensemble of gridded time series a generator for each variable is trained on a high resolution observational data product for norway where the fine scale spatial and temporal marginal variations and the spatio temporal dependences are described using parametric statistical models the climate change signals obtained from an rcm are added to equivalent components of the generator including the trend the ensemble of temperature and precipitation data is then used to simulate daily runoff series with a spatially distributed hydrological model which has been used to perform hydrological impact assessments for the governmental report climate in norway 2100 hanssen bauer et al 2017a issued by the norwegian centre for climate service nccs based on the simulated runoff we first perform a statistical hypothesis test to assess whether there are significant changes in runoff regime given the trends in the wgs and the simulated variability in the input data assessing the significance of regime change is a common task in many studies some found that climate change signals in river streamflow are largely masked by internal climate variability e g lafaysse et al 2014 fatichi et al 2014 while others found robust expected changes in runoff cycle despite projection uncertainty e g finger et al 2012 addor et al 2014 our assessment can contribute to this ongoing discussion next we quantify the variability contributions of the two input variables variability in simulations arising from various sources are often estimated using analysis of variance anova techniques some use a time series based approach called the quasi ergodic anova hingray and saïd 2014 lafaysse et al 2014 vidal et al 2016 hingray et al 2019 which assumes among other things that the uncertainty from the internal climate variability is constant or roughly constant across projection lead times here we adopt the traditional anova approach as it requires fewer assumptions this approach has seen applications in climate projections yip et al 2011 and hydrological impact studies finger et al 2012 bosshard et al 2013 addor et al 2014 lawrence 2020 meresa et al 2021 quantifying sources of variability related to input variables is supposed to help focus attention on the process tractable components of the total variability in a case study we consider nine different catchments in central norway the catchments have different runoff regimes climatic types and areas varying between 144 km 2 and 3084 km 2 the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area methods for generating climate input data simulating daily runoff data and analysis of the simulated runoff data are given in section 3 the results are presented in section 4 followed by a discussion in section 5 the paper then concludes with a brief summary in section 6 2 study area the study area is located in trøndelag in central norway a region with large climatic variation and abundant hydropower resources as shown in fig 1 it covers the entire trøndelag and a small part of neighboring sweden we focus on nine catchments in this region shaded in gray in fig 1 with sizes ranging from 144 to 3084 km 2 and median elevations varying between 295 and 734 m a s l see table 1 they are natural catchments i e direct human interventions have negligible impacts on the catchment hydrology most of these catchments have daily discharge time series available for decades long period maintained and archived in the station network at the norwegian water resources and energy directorate referring to the nordic runoff regime map presented by gottschalk et al 1979 there is a gradual change of the regime as we move from east to west the catchments gaulfoss aamot and trangen a b and e have the mountain type regime with dominant high flows in spring due to snowmelt and dominant low flows in winter due to snow accumulation located in a transition zone between the mountain type and the inland type regime the four catchments veravatn dillfoss hoeggaas and kjeldstad f i tend to have a second or third highest runoff occurring in autumn in addition to the snowmelt high flows the catchments krinsvatn and oeyungen c and d have the baltic type regime and usually experience a summer low flow in addition to the lowest winter flows according to the köppen geiger climate classification presented by kottek et al 2006 krinsvatn and oeyungen have a maritime climate while the other catchments have a humid continental climate 3 methods and data 3 1 climate input data and hydrological model simulation 3 1 1 generating gridded daily mean temperature and daily precipitation high resolution gridded climate input data required for hydrological simulations are stochastically simulated using weather generator wg approaches proposed for daily mean temperature yuan et al 2019 and daily precipitation yuan et al 2021 the wgs are trained on a 1 km gridded observational data product senorge 2018 version 18 12 provided by the norwegian meteorological institute lussana et al 2019 and combined with climate change information obtained from an rcm in the euro cordex 11 ensemble jacob et al 2014 operating at a 12 km spatial resolution the rcm combines the cosmo model in climate mode cclm steger and bucchignani 2020 with boundary conditions from the mpi earth system model giorgetta et al 2013 as shown in fig 1 our study area comprises 695 rcm grid cells rectangular like polygons and 109 514 senorge grid cells within the polygons not shown the rcm outputs are simulated with different types of forcing before and after the year 2005 i e recorded and projected emissions respectively we thus take only the historical run to avoid possible inconsistency in the model behavior due to the shift in the forcing both senorge and rcm data are available from 1957 we train the wg for each variable and catchment using the senorge data from 1957 to 1986 and derive climate change information on the rcm grid by comparing the rcm data from the two time periods 1957 1986 and 1987 2005 simulations of each variable are then performed for the period 1987 2005 for each catchment the wgs employed here comprise marginal models with parameters varying smoothly across grid cells and over time and models describing spatial and temporal dependences for realistic simulations of daily temperature and precipitation fields specifically the wg for temperature uses a gaussian distribution with a mean and a variance component and a stationary and separable spatio temporal model for residuals yuan et al 2019 we independently sample 10 realizations of spatial residuals and 10 realizations of temporal residuals to sufficiently account for the randomness in the model and by adding the rcm simulated changes in the mean while keeping the variance unchanged we obtain 100 realizations of temperature simulations in c the wg for precipitation uses a discrete continuous distribution with precipitation occurrence described by a probit regression model amount on wet days by a gamma distribution and a single non stationary gaussian random field driving the spatio temporal correlations in both the occurrences and the amounts yuan et al 2021 the rcm simulated changes in the probability of occurrence the amount on wet days and the temporal correlation in the underlying spatial random field are used to update the corresponding model components of the wg from the single random field model we sample 10 realizations which are then transformed into 10 realizations of precipitation data in mm day 1 in table 1 we list the annual mean temperature and the annual precipitation averaged over the simulation period 1987 2005 for each catchment the two larger mountain catchments gaulfoss and trangen have a relatively colder and dryer climate while the two smaller coastal catchments krinsvatn and oeyungen are considerably warmer and wetter 3 1 2 simulating daily runoff with a distributed hbv model for hydrological simulations we consider the spatially distributed hbv model developed by beldring et al 2003 for norway the hbv hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning model has undergone decades of developments and applications in nordic countries and over the world bergström 1976 sælthun 1996 seibert and bergström 2022 the model version employed in this study has a 1 km spatial resolution and is run with a daily time step it has an interception routine a snow routine where snowmelt is calculated based on a simple degree day method a soil moisture routine where the potential evapotranspiration is estimated using a temperature index method e g sælthun 1996 xu and singh 2001 and a dynamical part where runoff is generated from an upper zone and a lower zone two land use classes forests and open lands and two soil types wetlands and others are used to specify the parameters of the processes above and beneath the ground surface beldring et al 2003 we calibrate and validate the model based on the senorge data the nonlinear parameter estimation method pest doherty et al 1994 lawrence et al 2009 is used to find an optimal set of parameters separately for individual catchments where model simulated discharge is compared with the observed discharge using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 and relative volume bias yapo et al 1996 as performance measures initial spin up periods of six months are used to adjust the model before the calibration and validation procedures are started the calibration period 1988 2002 shows a mean nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 80 with a mean volume bias of 0 7 while the validation period 2003 2018 yields a mean nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 74 with a mean volume bias of 7 we then run the model for all possible combinations of the 100 simulated temperature realizations and the 10 simulated precipitation realizations this yields 1000 time series of simulated daily runoff for each catchment over the period 1987 2005 i e time series of daily discharge averaged over the catchment area in mm day 1 as an example fig 2 shows the simulated mean annual runoff cycles over the period 1987 2005 on average the runoff is highest in the two smaller coastal catchments krinsvatn and oeyungen followed by the smallest catchment kjeldstad consistent with the simulated precipitation amounts cf table 1 in general low flows in january march are followed by high flows in april june with a peak simulated in may the flows then become more stable or have a mild increase in autumn and decline again in november december krinsvatn and oeyungen have a summer low flow preceding an autumn high flow as is characteristic for the baltic type regime the internal variability of the input results in considerable variability in the simulated runoff particularly in the catchments with the highest runoff and in the snowmelt season in addition there appears to be a pattern of clustering between july and october in some catchments this will be investigated further in section 3 2 3 3 2 analysis of simulated runoff data in the following we focus on the annual cycle of runoff that is how runoff volumes vary throughout the year we follow for example finger et al 2012 and addor et al 2014 and describe the annual cycle of a year by monthly values which are computed as the average over the simulated daily values in the respective months alternatively it can be estimated by m day moving averages e g bosshard et al 2013 to avoid separation of the data by month the mean annual cycle refers to the average annual cycle over a period of years represented by multi year mean monthly values e g fig 2 while the change in the mean annual cycle refers to the difference in the mean monthly values between two periods here we divide the simulations for the period 1987 2005 into two non overlapping periods 1987 1995 and 1997 2005 we consider the mean annual cycle for each period as well as changes between the two periods the corresponding runoff statistics in mm day 1 are computed for each of the 1000 simulations and the following analyses are performed separately for each catchment 3 2 1 testing changes in the mean annual runoff cycle to assess the significance of changes in the mean annual runoff cycle we perform a statistical hypothesis test for each calendar month denote by x the mean monthly runoff in a given month and by d the simulated change between the two time periods specifically 1 d x 1997 2005 x 1987 1995 for each month we have n 1000 independent realizations of the simulated change d 1 d n we assume the simulated change d follows a normal distribution with mean μ d and standard deviation σ d then the mean value d follows a normal distribution with mean μ d and standard deviation σ d n formally 2 d 1 n i 1 n d i n μ d σ d n the objective is now to test the null hypothesis h 0 μ d 0 versus the alternative h a μ d 0 denote by s d the sample standard deviation 3 s d 1 n i 1 n d i d 2 we use the test statistic of the one sample t test t d s d n which is approximately standard normal for large n we reject h 0 at the 5 level if t 1 96 or t 1 96 alternatively it is common in the literature to use the signal to noise ratio s n for assessing the significance of change signal the signal s is usually the ensemble mean however it varies somewhat how the noise n is defined for example n has been calculated based on the standard deviation of a multi member ensemble from a different climate model e g zhuan et al 2018 gu et al 2019 the observed discharge records addor et al 2014 the interannual variability of the sample averaged future projections finger et al 2012 and based on the control scenario ensemble generated for each climate model fatichi et al 2014 moreover the significance has been assessed at different levels using our notation we can write s n d c s d where c is a constant the constant c has been set to e g 1 65 2 or 1 hawkins and sutton 2009 zhuan et al 2018 gu et al 2019 3 2 2 quantifying variability due to climate inputs using anova variability in the runoff simulations is analyzed using analysis of variance anova the anova method has been applied to quantify different sources of variability in future climate projections e g yip et al 2011 hydrological projections of the runoff cycle e g finger et al 2012 bosshard et al 2013 addor et al 2014 extreme flows e g gao et al 2020 and flood hazards e g lawrence 2020 meresa et al 2021 here anova is applied to quantify sources of variability related to temperature and precipitation input data in the runoff simulations for a given month denote by x i j a response driven by temperature simulation i 1 100 and precipitation simulation j 1 10 the anova model equation for x i j is given by 4 x i j μ τ i η j ɛ i j with i 1 100 τ i 0 j 1 10 η j 0 and the error terms ɛ i j are assumed independent and identically distributed the overall mean response is given by μ τ i is the effect of the i th temperature simulation and η j is the effect of the j th precipitation simulation both given as the deviation from the overall mean the total variability in x i j and variability due to various factors can be quantified by sums of squares an approach adopted by e g finger et al 2012 bosshard et al 2013 addor et al 2014 and gao et al 2020 here we follow yip et al 2011 and define all sources of variability in terms of variance 5 vt 1 100 i 1 100 x i x 2 6 vp 1 10 j 1 10 x j x 2 7 ve 1 1000 j 1 10 i 1 100 x i j x i x j x 2 8 vtotal 1 1000 j 1 10 i 1 100 x i j x 2 vt vp ve where e g x i denotes the average over the index j x i 1 10 j 1 10 x i j that is the total variability is given by the sample variance vtotal it decomposes into variability due to temperature simulations vt precipitation simulations vp and an unexplained part ve we apply the anova framework to three types of responses related to the mean annual runoff cycle 1 for each month the mean monthly runoff for 1987 1995 and 1997 2005 respectively where the sample variance is considered a measure of natural variability in the corresponding period 2 for each month the monthly runoff for each year to study the interannual variation of the variability throughout the entire simulation period and 3 for each month the change in the mean monthly runoff between 1987 1995 and 1997 2005 variance decomposition results will be presented in unit mm day 1 2 i e the square of the runoff statistics unit 3 2 3 assessing model assumptions using bootstrap to assess the model assumptions of the procedures described above we additionally apply a bootstrap procedure similar to that employed by addor et al 2014 to assess natural variability based on observed discharge records specifically we perform the following 1 for our set of n 1000 simulations randomly select a sample of size about 10 of the total number of n n 1 2 pairs 2 compute the difference within each selected pair and then for each month compute the sample standard deviation based on the difference values these two steps are repeated 100 times to account for sampling variability and we subsequently take the 95 bootstrap confidence interval based on the results denote by d k x 1 k x 2 k for k 1 m the differences computed in step 2 for the m randomly selected pairs x 1 k x 2 k k 1 m of step 1 the sample variance of the differences is given by 9 v d 1 m k 1 m d k d 2 1 m k 1 m x 1 k x 1 2 x 2 k x 2 2 2 x 1 k x 1 x 2 k x 2 2 vtotal where the approximation in the last step holds when m is large and the realizations in the sample are independent the bootstrap results can thus be used to investigate possible correlations in the data specifically if the 95 bootstrap confidence interval lies below 2 vtotal the realizations in the sample may be positively correlated causing e g systematic clustering in the runoff simulations we perform this assessment for both the mean monthly runoff and the change in the mean monthly runoff 4 results 4 1 changes in the mean annual runoff cycle the average simulated changes in the mean annual runoff cycle from 1987 1995 to 1997 2005 are listed in table 2 annotated with conclusions from t tests testing the significance of the changes the null hypothesis of no change is generally rejected except for six instances scattered among different months and catchments january in gaulfoss november in krinsvatn and oeyungen september in trangen august and september in hoeggaas in addition the pattern of changes is similar across the catchments there is generally less runoff from october to april in the more recent time period with the largest decline mostly occurring in april while the largest increases are simulated in may or june followed by smaller increases of runoff in july september furthermore fig 3 shows that in the catchment krinsvatn despite the interannual variation the sample averaged monthly runoff seems to have underlying trends across the simulation period that generally reflects the change values shown in table 2 similar correspondence is found in the other catchments results not shown which means in general the changes are driven by an evolving process rather than by randomness to better understand the changes in the mean runoff for each month we look at the corresponding changes in the hydroclimatological variables shown in fig 4 for two representative catchments gaulfoss has a continental climate mountain type runoff regime and is the largest catchment 3084 km 2 whereas krinsvatn has a maritime climate baltic type regime and is much smaller in size 206 km 2 for the temperature generator the rcm indicates a negative trend over the simulation period yuan et al 2019 and therefore on average a lower temperature is obtained in all months for the period 1997 2005 compared to 1987 1995 see fig 4a and c precipitation changes are less consistent between the months and catchments fig 4b and d because the long term trends as well as the seasonal variations in the probability of occurrence and amount on wet days are adjusted by the rcm simulated changes which again vary slightly between the catchments yuan et al 2021 in the catchment gaulfoss the reduced runoff from october to april is associated with the decreasing rainfall and snowmelt fig 4b where the largest runoff decline in april is mostly driven by the snowmelt as temperature rises above zero degree in may june runoff increases mainly with snowmelt changes of which exhibit a wide spread from july to september the effect of snowmelt diminishes and runoff tends to vary more closely with rainfall a similar pattern can be found in the catchment krinsvatn while the key difference is that krinsvatn has a warmer climate temperature rises above zero during april fig 4c which triggers an earlier snowmelt than gaulfoss causing a larger amount of snowmelt in may with relatively less snowpack left in june and therefore the largest increase of runoff is in may fig 4d we found that the runoff changes in the other catchments are similarly related to the changes in rainfall and snowmelt not shown effects of warming on snowmelt flood timing and intensity as well as rainfall governed changes in autumn discharge are widely discussed based on projections over a longer lead time in the future e g seiller and anctil 2014 lafaysse et al 2014 4 2 sources of variability in simulated runoff anova results on the variability in the simulated mean annual runoff cycle for the periods 1987 1995 and 1997 2005 are shown in fig 5 for the two catchments gaulfoss and krinsvatn overall the total variability varies substantially between calendar months it is highest around the snowmelt season in spring followed by autumn and summer and lowest in february that is the physical mechanisms of snowmelt and rainfall high flows are more sensitive to climate variability than the more inertial low flow generation mechanisms gelfan et al 2015 the highest mean runoff in may june cf fig 2 is associated mainly with snowmelt the amount of which is highly uncertain due to uncertainty in temperature changes in that month as well as changes in snowpack volume which has been adjusted by the temperature and precipitation from previous months until the onset of snowmelt therefore the runoff variability in may june has comparably large contributions from both temperature and precipitation as well as other unexplained variability sources of variability follow a clear seasonal pattern variability in temperature is a major source of overall variability in runoff during snowmelt season and in early spring late autumn when temperatures above or below freezing cause precipitation to fall as rain or snow respectively the former echos the findings of dobler et al 2012 that the spread of temperature projections by different gcms leads to uncertain projections of winter and spring runoff during summer and early autumn rainfall becomes the primary source of runoff and variability in runoff is thus tightly linked to that in precipitation the unexplained variability is generally low compared to the other two factors as fig 5 shows there are substantial changes in the total variability between the two time periods in gaulfoss represented by a large increase in may due to the temperature simulations and a smaller increase in june contributed mostly by the precipitation simulations by contrast the seasonal pattern in krinsvatn seems more consistent across the two time periods except for increases in june and september in both catchments the low variability in february march further decreases the results shown here and found in the other catchments not shown suggest that natural variability and the underlying sources may vary somewhat between the two time periods to better understand the changes in the variability over the two time periods interannual variation of the variability in the annual runoff cycle at krinsvatn is shown in fig 6 for most months the total variability varies across the years without showing an apparent trend which is in line with the results shown in fig 5 however the increasing trend in june and september as well as the decreasing trend in february and march seem to have good correspondence with the changes found in fig 5 in addition trends in the individual sources of variability match the changes shown in fig 5 for instance the increasing dominance of temperature in april and the increased variability due to both temperature and precipitation in june a distinct feature shown in fig 6 is that the variability in the simulations can be very high in october for individual years although the variability in the decadal mean runoff in october is much lower than that for may cf fig 5 this is because the average variability is higher in may in the other baltic type catchment oeyungen and the catchments with a transition type runoff regime the simulated runoff variability in august october fluctuates substantially between the years it can be as high as the variability in april but always lower than variability in the snowmelt high flow season results not shown variability in the simulated changes in the mean annual runoff cycle from 1987 1995 to 1997 2005 are shown in fig 7 for the two catchments gaulfoss and krinsvatn the patterns in variability correspond well with the patterns shown in fig 4 note that the total variability in the simulated changes roughly corresponds to the sum of the total variability over the two time periods cf fig 5 this indicates that there is a low correlation between the mean runoff values of the two time periods and stresses that ignoring the local scale internal variability has a compound effect when projected changes are considered rather than projected values 4 3 assessment of model assumptions fig 8 shows the results of the bootstrap procedure described in section 3 2 3 to assess model assumptions of independent simulations of runoff the results show that the sample standard deviation vtotal of the anova procedure given in eq 8 and the standard deviation estimate v d based on a set of pairwise differences given in eq 9 possess identical seasonal patterns furthermore the ratio between the two measures is generally close to 2 the expected value for independent simulations specifically the 95 bootstrap confidence interval for v d includes 2 vtotal in all months for gaulfoss see fig 8a and b for krinsvatn the confidence interval is slightly lower than the expected value in july september and october for the period 1987 1995 fig 8d and august and september for 1997 2005 fig 8e we found that except for the catchment trangen e the confidence interval is slightly below the expected value in individual months typically between july and october not shown which coincides with the months exhibiting a pattern of clustering in fig 2 as indicated by the anova results the mean runoff of these months probably cluster around the 10 precipitation simulations this coincides with the results of fig 5 that the total variability in the mean monthly runoff during this time of the year is largely dominated by the variability in the precipitation simulations the bootstrap procedure was additionally applied to the sample of changes in the mean monthly runoff as shown in fig 8c and f there does not seem to be significant correlations apart from august in krinsvatn we found that in four of the nine catchments a e f and i no month tends to have correlated changes whereas for the other catchments positive correlations may be found typically between august and october not shown the effects of correlations in the mean monthly runoff across different simulations are thus somewhat mitigated by considering change in runoff rather than runoff itself 5 discussion 5 1 parametrization of hydrological processes in the hbv model the simple structure of the parameter parsimonious hbv model is an advantage in the sense that parameters are more clearly identified and the problem of parameter equifinality is reduced perrin et al 2001 abebe et al 2010 poulin et al 2011 however there are some limitations with simple models if atmospheric processes such as wind speed radiation and humidity under climate change has a strong impact on some processes it may be leading to model parameters not being valid under non stationary conditions beldring et al 2008 poulin et al 2011 as an example the temperature index approach used for estimating potential evapotranspiration may exaggerate the increase in evaporation in the future beldring et al 2008 a similar argument could be used for snowmelt since the main atmospheric processes determining this process are radiation wind speed and humidity dingman 2015 whereas the hbv model uses a temperature index approach in this case as well hydrological models with physically based equations could potentially have the possibility to identify changes in the significance of different processes but on the other hand the lack of ability to identify correct parameter values for the equations describing the hydrological processes limits this possibility in particular for sub surface processes like soil moisture and groundwater 5 2 significance testing the results of the significance tests indicated significant changes in mean monthly runoff from 1987 1995 to 1997 2005 for most months and catchments the changes additionally show a similar seasonal patterns across the different catchments these are not unexpected since the climate change information is derived from only one rcm which in particular predicts a negative trend in temperature over the study period furthermore the subsequent hydrological simulations do not introduce additional uncertainty as they are performed using a single optimized set of parameters however such detectable and consistent changes may not be common and are not expected when different rcms hydrological parameters models or catchments with more heterogeneity are involved in a case study besides given the large sample size here a small change may likely have statistical significance yet whether such a change has practical significance should be considered in context a discussion we consider beyond the scope of the current paper 5 3 the anova framework in this study the simulated variability is measured by the sample variance applications seeking a variability measure in the same unit as the variable of interest may find a decomposition of the total standard deviation more appropriate e g addor et al 2014 lafaysse et al 2014 in this case an equation of the standard deviations may be derived from eq 8 using e g a scaling method as proposed in appendix b of hawkins and sutton 2011 the full model chain for assessing hydrological impacts of climate change includes multiple components each associated with its own sources of uncertainty commonly some components have fewer levels than the other e g there may be two post processing methods applied to outputs from eight climate models raising a concern of uneven representation of different sources in the total uncertainty to address this bosshard et al 2013 propose a subsampling method where components with many levels are downsized to match the size of the component with fewest levels and iteratively apply anova on each subset of the full sample this provides technical benefits when sample sizes are restricted e g less than 10 bosshard et al 2013 here there are relatively small computational costs associated with each additional precipitation or temperature sample compared to the costs of increasing the sample size of other components of the full model chain specifically the number of simulations for temperature and precipitation differing by a factor of 10 was chosen so that each of the stochastic parts in the weather generator is equally represented in the current setup interactions between temperature and precipitation cannot be separated from other unexplained variability since only one simulation of runoff is obtained for each combination of the inputs throughout the study we found that the unexplained variability is significantly smaller than that directly linked to precipitation and temperature nonetheless interactions between different factors can be important bosshard et al 2013 meresa et al 2021 and in order to quantify these interactions the current framework has to be expanded one option would be to produce multiple runoff simulations for each combination of inputs using equally suitable parameter sets in the hydrological model e g lawrence 2020 meresa et al 2021 accordingly the anova model eq 4 would be extended to include both the main effects and an interaction between temperature and precipitation as a result the sample variance would be decomposed into four parts where the unexplained part in eq 8 would be replaced by variability due to the interaction between temperature and precipitation and the variability due to the hydrological model parameters the anova framework applied here is a fixed effect model in the sense that the effects of individual climate variable simulations are treated as if they were fixed instead of being randomly drawn from a population distribution consequently the analysis is a finite population inference through a variance decomposition of an existing sample however theoretically the weather generators provide an opportunity of generating more realizations if needed which corresponds to a superpopulation of effects therefore when there is a need to consider the uncertainty of having a different set of inputs realizations methods of superpopulation inferences gelman 2005 are more suitable see also northrop and chandler 2014 for an application to climate projections the current analysis is performed for the annual runoff cycle while other statistics such as extreme runoff indicators or other hydrological fluxes and states e g actual evapotranspiration soil moisture deficits could be analyzed in a similar manner while the application here is focused on climate change impacts on regional hydrology the methods provide a general approach to uncertainty investigation for various time horizons other promising applications include seasonal to decadal water resources prediction on the basis of weather and climate predictions the computationally efficient downscaling methods of temperature and precipitation are particularly useful where large ensembles are required in order to achieve prediction skill and a reliable quantification of sources of variability 6 conclusions this paper carries out a study to simulate and analyze uncertainties in hydrological impact studies that arise from the local scale internal variability of the climate to represent that at the catchment scale we simulate multiple sets of gridded daily precipitation and mean temperature data at 1 km resolution using a weather generator wg approach the wg uses local information from a high resolution observational data product and climate change information from an rcm a large set of daily runoff series are then generated based on the temperature and precipitation simulations using a spatially distributed hydrological model the analysis is focused on the annual runoff cycle of nine catchments in central norway with different runoff regimes climatic types and areas ranging from 144 to 3084 km 2 significance tests are applied to assess changes in the mean monthly runoff from 1987 1995 to 1997 2005 and sources of variability in the runoff simulations are quantified using analysis of variance anova where the total variability is decomposed into contributions from the two input variables as well as an unexplained component model assumptions of independence are assessed using a bootstrap procedure the change signal in the mean annual runoff cycle is found to be generally significant indicating that the trends imposed on the wg are not overwhelmed by the simulated internal variability variability in the runoff simulations is highest in high flow periods in the snowmelt season between april and june and in autumn for some catchments while the simulated runoff variability in autumn varies substantially between the years the average level of variability is lower than the snowmelt season temperature is the main source of variability in the colder months november march both temperature and precipitation contribute to the variability in the snowmelt season and variability in july october is largely due to that in precipitation the analysis assumes that the individual simulations are independent even if they may share either a precipitation input or a temperature input an assessment of this assumption reveals that the simulations are largely independent with some simulations showing a low degree of correlation between august and october when the variability in runoff is largely dominated by that in precipitation only a reliable estimation of the changes in annual runoff cycle and the associated uncertainties can be applied for climate adaptation measures in water management for example hydropower companies will need to adapt planning to a changed seasonal pattern of runoff volumes under a changing climate in norway reservoir operation commonly needs to adjust the water levels properly before the snowmelt in order to avoid the spring flood and also meet requirements for environmental low flow and many other water use purposes during summer a delayed more concentrated snowmelt that is accompanied by an increased level of variability as simulated for some catchments in our case study may pose challenges such as accommodating to a prolonged low flow period in early spring and dealing with an increased difficulty in adjusting the water levels such that both the spring flood and possible deficits in summer could be avoided this study considers variability in runoff simulations caused by the local scale internal variability in temperature and precipitation the results are in line with findings where the large scale internal climate variability is represented by a multi member gcm ensemble gelfan et al 2015 or a gcm rcm chain seiller and anctil 2014 this indicates that ignoring the local scale internal variability may yield an underestimation of the overall variability in projections and projected changes which may further affect the adaptation strategies not only for the changes in future water resources but also for water

2081,the loss of nitrogen on sloping land causes a decline in land productivity and non point source pollution research on nitrogen loss typically occurs on land with a uniform slope however irregular slopes are the most widely distributed types of slope in nature ignoring the effects of irregular slopes may cause misestimations of nitrogen loss on sloped land in this study a mathematical model was established to describe the process of ammonia nitrogen transfer from the surface soil to runoff under different slope shapes and rainfall intensities the slopes were generalized as parts of circles a slope curvature parameter was proposed to describe topographic and hydraulic differences the model was evaluated using nine slope degrees concave slopes of middle down 10 20 30 and 40 cm uniform slope and convex slopes of middle up 10 20 30 and 40 cm and three rainfall intensities 0 125 0 083 and 0 042 cm min 1 runoff rates were fitted using the established runoff model based on horton s infiltration equation the ammonia nitrogen transfer from the soil layer to runoff was built based on the diffusion model the governing equations of the models were solved numerically the study found that the mean runoff rates of concave slopes were significantly lower than those of convex slopes under rainfall intensities of 0 083 and 0 042 cm min 1 at a rainfall intensity of 0 042 cm min 1 the mean ammonia nitrogen loss rates of concave slopes decreased by 21 70 to 34 17 compared to the uniform slope while the loss rates of convex slopes increased by 18 49 to 58 97 p 0 05 similar trends were observed at rainfall intensities of 0 083 and 0 125 cm min 1 overall the runoff rates ammonia nitrogen concentration and ammonia nitrogen loss rate tended to decrease with an increasing slope curvature parameter the simulated results for the runoff rate and ammonia nitrogen transport process were consistent with the observed data with r2 values ranging from 0 80 to 0 98 for the runoff rate and 0 64 to 0 95 for the ammonia nitrogen concentration further correlation analyses were performed to determine the relationships among the slope curvature rainfall intensity hydraulic and nutrient transport parameters the results showed that these parameters can be described as a combined linear function of the slope curvature parameter and rainfall intensity moreover the sensitivity of the model to various parameters showed that the slope shape and curvature had an important impact on nitrogen transport this model can be used to improve the theoretical basis for developing nitrogen loss control methods keywords slope shape slope curvature ammonia nitrogen transport mathematical model data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction nitrogen is considered one of the most complex and biologically crucial elements aryal et al 2022 among all of the existing natural nitrogen compounds ammonia nitrogen in the soil can be quickly absorbed by plants owing to its high solubility which makes it highly applicable to farmland as a nitrogen fertilizer however ammonia nitrogen is easily transported by surface runoff caused by intense rainfall leading to inefficient nitrogen fertilizer application and a waste of energy additionally nitrogen transported by surface runoff also causes severe environmental problems including water body eutrophication land degradation and ecological deterioration ostad ali askari et al 2016 therefore an accurate model for predicting nitrogen transport from the soil to surface runoff is of great importance for ecological protection the nitrogen loss process is affected by many factors such as the soil type jing et al 2022 ostad ali askari 2022a antecedent soil moisture ouyang et al 2017 rainfall intensity ostad ali askari 2022b tao et al 2017 wu et al 2018 slope gradient li and wang 2016 talebmorad and ostad ali askari 2022 xing et al 2019 yang et al 2016c slope length xing et al 2016 slope roughness heathwaite et al 1998 and soil vegetation coverage bai et al 2022 garcía díaz et al 2017 palis et al 1990 rabiei et al 2022 among others however most of these studies have focused on nitrogen loss on a uniform straight slope generally most slopes in nature form from irregular slopes including concave slopes convex slopes and a combination of concave and convex slopes ignoring the effects of irregular slopes may cause miscalculations of nutrient loss hence it is imperative to investigate the impact of irregular slopes on nutrient loss and develop a predictive model for nutrient transport from the soil layer to runoff on such slopes an irregular slope is always treated as a changing gradient slope along the slope length which consists of many types of slopes including straight concave convex and s shaped slopes among these types convex and concave slopes have the simplest shapes which may be an effective means of revealing the influence of slope shape on nutrient transport slope runoff is influenced by slope shape sensoy and kara 2014 found that a uniform slope produced more runoff than concave and convex slopes a concave slope generates the least runoff however previous studies found that runoff from a convex slope was either greater young and mutchler 1969a or smaller young and mutchler 1969b than that of concave and uniform slopes several theories have been proposed to explain the effects of irregular slopes on runoff for example convexity decreases slope infiltrability while concavity increases slope infiltrability philip 1991 thompson et al 2010 wang and chen 2021 which directly influences the runoff amount noroozpour et al 2013 proved that the runoff of a convex slope always had a longer travel time than that of a straight slope whereas there were no consistent conclusions when considering concave slopes these conflicting results highlight the need for additional research to determine the impact of irregular slopes on runoff moreover the existing studies only compare the differences in runoff processes between different slope shapes and the impact of slope curvatures on the runoff process remains unclear nutrient loss is also affected by slope shape slope shape and curvature affect the flow pattern of runoff on the slope thereby affecting the nutrient transport pattern after runoff generation the flow direction of the runoff changes continuously on an irregular slope particularly at the turning point between the upper and lower slopes of an irregular slope it changes the gravity component along the slope surface which has a significant impact on the surface runoff resulting in a sharp change in the flow pattern and kinetic energy of slope runoff thus affecting nutrient transport from the soil layer to surface runoff to the best of our knowledge few studies have attempted to investigate the impact of the slope shape on nutrient loss most studies have focused on the effects of slope length and gradient by reviewing these studies some rules can be obtained for a deeper understanding of the effects of slope shape palis et al 1997 found that the total nitrogen loss per unit area increased with increasing slope length which is similar to the results of xing et al 2016 and an et al 2019 wu et al 2018 evaluated the effects of rainfall intensity and slope gradient on dissolved and adsorbed nitrogen loss their results indicated that there was no overall increasing or decreasing trend in nitrogen with an increased slope gradient however yang et al 2015 found that the runoff potassium concentration increased with an increase in the slope gradient ao et al 2021 reported that the average amount of ammonia nitrogen and phosphate loss along irregular slopes increased by 24 0 58 6 when compared to that of a uniform slope given the limited research on this subject and its significant implications it is crucial to investigate the impact of slope shape and curvature on nutrient transport from soil to runoff during rainfall events nutrient transport from the soil layer to the runoff layer is a complex process owing to its complicated mass exchange during rainfall many conceptual models have been developed over the past few decades shi et al 2011 by realizing that only a small layer is involved during a nutrient transport event researcher have proposed a complete effective depth of interaction edi which assumes that the nutrients in the edi are mixed completely and instantaneously wallach et al 1989 yang et al 2016b a simple power equation is used to simulate the nutrient loss subsequently this model was modified by adding a coefficient to describe incomplete mixing under high infiltration capacity conditions ahuja and lehman 1983 yang et al 2016c these two types of models are widely used owing to relatively few parameters however a shortcoming of this model is also evident the driving force for nutrient transport is not clear in this model subsequent models of diffusion wallach et al 1988 and convective dispersion ahuja 1990 were developed by assuming that solute transfer from the soil layer is driven by a concentration gradient or raindrop dispersion these two types of models have clearer physical meanings than the mixing depth models mentioned above runoff processes are also coupled in these models by solving the kinematic wave based model and governing equation which may better describe the influence of slope shape on the coupled runoff nutrient transport process comparing these two models the convective dispersion model separates the system into three layers the runoff exchange and deep soil layers in addition to transport of the nutrients in the exchange layer to the runoff layer by raindrop dispersion there is another process in which the source and sink are supplied from the deep soil layer by molecular diffusion however this process is usually gentle and can be ignored in field experiments which indicates that these two types of models have a similar form of expression therefore considering these shortcomings and advantages the diffusion model was selected for this study previous studies have examined the impact of rainfall characteristics tao et al 2017 soil properties vetrimurugan et al 2017 and slope gradient xing et al 2019 on the convective mass transfer coefficient however for complex hillslope topography there is a need to establish a diffusion model and validate how to quantify the impact of slope shape and curvature on model parameters a parameter describing the slope curvature should be proposed to establish a model that simulates the slope shape effect previous studies have used power evans 1980 sabzevari and noroozpour 2014 circular agnese et al 2007 and sine thompson et al 2010 functions to describe the shape of an irregular slope which provides a good foundation for this study given the existing knowledge gaps and available approaches the objective of this study is to 1 investigate the impact of slope shape and curvature on runoff and associated nitrogen loss 2 develop a mathematical model that characterizes nitrogen transport from soil to surface runoff by proposing a characteristic parameter that reflects hydraulic differences on an irregular slope and 3 validate the model s applicability across different slope shapes curvatures and rainfall intensities this study aims to reveal the behavior and extent of the impact of slope shape and curvature on solute transfer from soil to surface runoff and aid in the prediction and control of non point pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was carried out at the helingeer experimental base at the inner mongolia academy of water sciences n40 12 e111 41 which is located in the southern part of hohhot inner mongolia china helingeer county has a semi arid continental monsoon climate in the middle temperate zone fig 1 the average annual temperature is approximately 6 2 the average annual precipitation is 392 8 mm and the maximum precipitation per day is 99 1 mm the experimental site is a transitional zone between the inner mongolia plateau and loess plateau the overall terrain is high in the east low in the west high in the south and low in the north the southeastern area is part of manhan mountain the mountainous area accounts for 20 4 of the total area of helingeer whereas the central and southern parts belong to the loess hilly area accounting for 57 3 of the total area of helingeer corn is the most widely planted crop accounting for 54 4 of the total farmland area 2 2 experimental setup the experiment was conducted on a man made slope with an angle of 15 the slope was either dug or piled up to realize the different slope curvature targets in this experiment we set nine slope curvatures including concave middle down 10 20 30 and 40 cm of the uniform slope and uniform and convex slopes middle up 10 20 30 and 40 cm of the uniform slope then five points of the slope including the top middle top middle middle bottom and bottom were measured the results showed that the concave and convex slopes could be generalized as part of a circle with different radii fig 2a the slope had a width of 5 m and a length of 10 m to expedite the experiment the slope was divided into four experimental slopes with a width of 0 8 m in the center of the plot using five pvc boards additionally two testing slopes with a width of 0 9 m were included on both sides of the plot to evaluate uniformity and intensity of rainfall all pvc boards were installed 40 cm underground and 20 cm above the ground to avoid raindrop splash and lateral flow of the infiltration water the soil of the slope was composed of backfill soil with a local top 20 cm tillage soil layer at the bottom of the slope a triangular aluminum sheet directed the runoff and sediment to the collector the simulated rainfall was designed by the china agricultural university the simulated system was composed of a reservoir centrifugal pump pressure gauge pe and pvc tubes and a switch and sprinkler nozzle xing et al 2016 the pressure gauge shows the water discharge which aids in determining the rainfall intensity a side sprinkler was used to simulate rainfall as shown in fig 1 each side of the plot had three groups of nozzles where each group had three nozzles the sprinkler nozzle used in the experiment had a full aperture range of 0 360 the nozzles in the middle groups had an aperture of 180 while those on both sides had an aperture of 90 by adjusting the switches of these nozzles three rainfall intensities were generated 0 125 0 083 and 0 042 cm min 1 corresponding to return periods of 7 6 3 5 and 1 0 years at the experimental site the height of the rainfall was set to 3 4 m and the average raindrop radius was 3 0 mm according to the revised newton formula raindrops reached their final velocity and had an average kinetic energy of 13 4 j m 2 2 3 experimental procedure soil samples were collected from three points in each plot middle top and bottom to measure soil bulk density using the cutting ring method and particle size distribution was determined using a malvern laser particle size analyzer the soil was classified as kastanozem with a sandy texture 84 23 sand 10 84 silt 4 93 clay soil ph was measured in a 1 2 5 soil water suspension using a ph probe while soil total nitrogen tn was measured using the semi micro kjeldahl method the initial and saturated water content were measured using the drying method and the solute absorption coefficient was measured using the isothermal adsorption test specific data can be found in table 1 to prevent soil erosion the plot was covered with plastic film additionally 40 rainfall gauges were placed on the four central experimental slopes spaced 0 8 m 1 m apart to determine rainfall intensity and uniformity after 15 min of simulated rainfall the weight of water at each gauge was recorded the simulated rainfall intensity calibration would not stop until the error between the measured and set rainfall intensities was 5 the results showed that the rainfall uniformity of the simulated rainfall was more than 80 7 which could satisfy requirements for man made rainfall to fit the actual nitrogen loss situation at the farmland urea was applied to the plots as a nitrogen fertilizer at an application rate of 4 g m 2 consistent with the average local application rate of corn fields the calculated urea amount was first mixed with 4 l of water and then sprinkled uniformly across the entire plot next the plot was pre wetted by employing a rainfall intensity of 0 033 cm min 1 until reaching generation of initial runoff to ensure a nearly consistent antecedent soil moisture the fertilizer was then moved downstream to the deep soil layer which may be in accordance with actual nutrient loss conditions one hour before the simulated rainfall soil samples were collected at three points to measure the antecedent soil moisture and nutrient concentrations after the beginning of the rainfall the initial runoff time was recorded mixed samples of runoff and sediment were collected for 1 min samples were collected every five minutes after the start of the rainfall simulation except when the initial runoff time exceeded 5 or 10 min the sample volumes were measured and allowed to stand until the sediment settled then 100 ml of the supernatant was taken and stored at 0 4 c in a plastic bottle the runoff volume was measured by the water level in a calibrated bucket ammonia nitrogen concentration was determined using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer in the chemical analysis laboratory all treatments were replicated three times after the experiment the top 20 cm were removed and backfilled with a local tillage soil layer the plot was then wetted by simulated rainfall with a rainfall intensity of 0 033 cm min 1 until it reached a stable settlement the procedure mentioned above was repeated for different rainfall intensities or slope curvatures 2 4 theoretical analysis 2 4 1 solution for the runoff process the kinematic wave equation and manning formula have been widely used to describe water flow over slopes during rainfall events the mass conservation equation can be expressed as follows 1 q x t x h x t t r e t a n d 2 q x t j x 1 2 n h x t m where q x t is the unit discharge cm2 min 1 h x t is the runoff depth cm x is the distance cm along the overland flow plane t is rainfall time min re r i is the excess rainfall

flow regimes m 5 3 for turbulent flow m 2 for transition flow and m 3 for laminar flow which was set to 2 in this simulation and j x is the overland slope cm cm 1 in this experiment the irregular slope was set to be a part of a circle which allows for easy calculations under polar coordinates fig 2b and c if we select point x on the slope we can draw a line tangential to the circle the angle between the tangent line and the horizontal line is γ x here γ x is equal to θ 2 θ x on a concave slope and equal to θ 1 θ x on a convex slope if the slope and circle parameters are determined θ 1 and θ 2 are constants then the hydraulic gradient at any point on the irregular slope can be expressed as follows 3 j c x tan θ 2 θ x 0 θ 2 θ 1 j v x tan θ 1 θ x 0 θ 2 θ 1 where jc x is the hydraulic gradient of the concave slope and jv x is the hydraulic gradient of the convex slope table 2 lists some of the specific data by approximating the overland flow process the unit discharge can be expressed as follows 4 q x t q t x q t θ x r where q t is the runoff rate cm min 1 θ x is the central angle shown in fig 2b and c and r is the radius of the convex and concave slopes cm based on eqs 2

hydraulic differences of different slope curvatures the slope curvature parameter αi of an irregular slope and αu of a uniform slope can be expressed as follows 11 α i r 1 2 0 θ 2 θ 1 θ x j x 1 2 d θ

stage and will slightly distinguish between different rainfall intensities therefore horton s infiltration model was adopted in this experiment 12 i t i f r i f exp k t t p a n d 13 r e t r i f r i f

were inversely solved using the least squares method 2 4 2 solution for the nutrient loss process the soil water and nutrient system on sloping land can be divided into two layers during rainfall events a runoff layer and exchange layer nutrients can be transferred from the soil to surface runoff via the exchange layer the rate of this transfer depends primarily on the concentration gradient between these two layers nutrients may also be transported into the deep soil with infiltrating water in this study soil water and nutrients in the exchange layer were assumed to be uniformly mixed therefore two mass conservation equations for the runoff and exchange layers are presented below 15 h c r t q c r x k e c e c r i c r a n d 16 ρ s k d θ s d e c e t k e c e c r i c r c e assuming that

where h is the runoff depth cm ce is the solute concentration in the exchange layer mg l 1 cr is the solute concentration in the runoff layer mg l 1 ρs is the soil bulk density g cm 3 ks is the solute

relatively short period of the raising stage of the water depth h is represented by 19 h n r i f θ l r 1 2 j l 1 4 where jl is the hydraulic gradient at slope distance x l and θl is the slope gradient at slope distance x l the initial condition of the solute concentration in the exchange layer is as follows 20 c ep c 0 θ i ρ s k s θ s ρ s k s where cep is the solute concentration in the exchange layer at t tp c0 is the initial solute concentration of the surface soil solution mg l 1 and θi is the initial soil volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 it was difficult to determine the initial solute concentration in the runoff layer previous studies have suggested that the initial solute concentration could be set to cep which is equivalent to the solute concentration in the mixing layer yang et al 2016c however many studies have shown that the solute concentration in the mixing layer is often higher than that in the runoff some researchers suggest that the solute concentration of the initial runoff time should be zero because an impermeable layer is placed between the water and soil layers gao et al 2004 however this may not be accurate in the field experiment because solute could be transferred to the surface soil solution throughout the rainfall time which indicates that the solute concentration could not be zero at the initial runoff time furthermore if the water flow depth increases linearly and the infiltration can be neglected i 0 the initial solute concentration will be k e r c ep which may better match the practical situation therefore the initial solute concentration in runoff can be expressed as follows 21 c rp k e r c ep where crp is the solute concentration in the runoff at t tp the combination of eqs 17 21 can be solved numerically using the runge kutta method with the measured values parameters de and ke can be inversely solved using the least squares method the solute loss rate in the runoff can be expressed as follows 22 n l 10 c r q t where nl is the solute loss rate in the runoff mg m 2 min 1 2 5 data analysis multivariate nonlinear regression analyses were performed to estimate the parameters of the proposed runoff model and

generation and stabilization time runoff generation time is an important factor that reflects soil water content and determines the volume of water that runs off the soil surface engel et al 2009 table 3 showed that there was no significant difference in the runoff generation time for different slope curvatures under the same rainfall intensity runoff generation time was mainly determined by the antecedent soil moisture and rainfall intensity slope gradient had little effect on runoff generation time fang et al 2015 jiang et al 2014 the pre wet treatment in this study created a nearly consistent surface soil water content resulting in little difference among different slope curvatures runoff stabilization time can be used to describe the speed at which a stable state is reached in this research the runoff rate was first fitted with the horton s infiltration model and the time point reaching 95 of the maximum runoff rate 0 95 r if was defined as the runoff stabilization time this is because after the runoff stabilization time the rate of runoff increase tended to slow down and eventually became zero the runoff stabilization time of concave slopes is significantly longer than that of convex slopes under rainfall intensity of 0 125 cm min 1 the average runoff stabilization time of convex slopes was 7 68 min which is 5 47 min earlier than that of concave slopes similar trends were observed under rainfall intensities of 0 042 and 0 083 cm min 1 overall the runoff stabilization time increases with an increase in the concave degree and decreases with an increase in the convex degree table 3 this indicates a more rapid runoff process for convex slopes compared to concave slopes on concave slopes the smaller slope gradient on the lower part of the slope allows for more infiltration which can slow down the flow velocity and delay the runoff stabilization time rahma et al 2013 sensoy and kara 2014 the runoff generation time and the runoff stabilization time are both affected by the rainfall intensity with greater rainfall intensity resulting in smaller runoff generation and runoff stabilization time 3 1 2 runoff rate fig 3 shows the runoff generation processes for different slope shapes and curvatures under three rainfall intensities the runoff rate increased sharply after the generation of runoff it then tended to stabilize gradually over time this was mainly due to the rapid decrease in the soil infiltration capacity at the beginning of the rainfall as time progressed the infiltration rate stabilized the runoff processes were influenced by rainfall intensity and slope curvature in general the runoff rates exhibited a decreasing trend with increasing concavity and an increasing trend with increasing convexity when the rainfall intensity was held constant fig 3 the runoff rate increased most rapidly under v3 at rainfall intensities of 0 083 and 0 125 cm min 1 this could be due to the fact that the differences among slope curvature parameters become smaller when changing from v1 to v4 which indicates that the hydraulic differences between convex slopes become smaller additionally the pre wet treatment may not have resulted in a fully uniform and consistent water content among all treatments which may have led to an inconsistent order of the runoff generation time runoff stabilization time and increasing speed with respect to slope curvature the mean runoff rates of convex slopes were found to be significantly higher than those of concave slopes under rainfall intensities of 0 083 and 0 125 cm min 1 as indicated in table 3 specifically when compared to treatment u at 0 042 cm min 1 the mean runoff rates of treatments v2 and v4 increased by 17 16 and 18 16 respectively on the other hand the mean runoff rates of treatments c1 c2 c3 and c4 decreased by 12 75 15 93 13 25 and 14 47 respectively when compared to treatment u at 0 083 cm min 1 however there was no significant difference among all treatments under a rainfall intensity of 0 125 cm min 1 suggesting that the effects of slope curvature on runoff generation amount may be reduced at relatively higher rainfall intensities these results were consistent with previous research jiang et al 2014 poesen 1987 ribolzi et al 2011 this is possibly because the slope shape has a two fold effect on the runoff generation owing to the same projected slope length in the horizontal direction a larger curvature may result in the same rainfall reception amount and a larger rainfall infiltration area which may decrease with an increasing slope curvature however the runoff generation amount was also affected by the flow velocity the average flow velocity increases with an increase in the slope convex degree and has an opposite trend on a concave slope d souza and morgan 1976 this decreases the residence time on a convex slope and increases it on a concave slope these two effects could decrease the runoff generation process on a concave slope however these two effects have opposite effects on the convex slope illustrating that the accelerating flow production effect dominates the runoff generation process slope shape and curvature strongly influence the capacity of slope systems to slow retain and store overland flow thompson et al 2010 concave slopes usually have a greater infiltration capacity than uniform and convex slopes chen et al 2022 ning et al 2019 runoff also increased with an increase in the rainfall intensity runoff with larger rainfall intensities increased more quickly than that with smaller rainfall intensities fig 3 the average stable infiltration rates of 0 125 0 083 and 0 042 cm min 1 were 0 033 0 032 and 0 016 cm min 1 respectively showing a decreasing trend with an increase in the rainfall intensity under higher rainfall intensities the slope generates runoff more easily which indicates that excess rainfall may occur furthermore the larger runoff induced by a higher rainfall intensity may also concentrate on the rill which would increase the runoff depth and water pressure leading to a larger stable infiltration rate when rainfall intensities were 0 083 and 0 125 cm min 1 the mean runoff rates ranged between 2 70 3 38 and 5 43 6 20 l min 1 respectively which increased by 72 90 100 18 and 216 19 280 06 respectively compared to the 0 042 cm min 1 rainfall intensity thus runoff rates were jointly influenced by rainfall intensity and slope curvature with rainfall intensity having a greater impact on runoff rates 3 1 3 simulated and observed runoff rate soil infiltration was considered a function of rainfall time variation in our model to corroborate our infiltration parameters runoff data were applied to the established runoff model based on horton s infiltration model eq 14 the curve fitting results of the runoff model are presented in table 2 and fig 3 the r2 rmse and sse values ranged from 0 80 to 0 98 cm min 1 0 0014 to 0 013 cm min 1 and 2 3 10 5 to 1 5 10 3 cm2 min 2 respectively the established runoff model based on horton s infiltration equation can accurately describe runoff processes initially this model underestimated the runoff rate compared to the measured value the runoff rate exhibits a rapid increase followed by a stabilization phase where the stabilized value holds more significance than the increasing runoff rates and even small errors in the stabilized value can significantly reduce the simulation accuracy moreover the initial runoff was collected at the time when most of the slope generated runoff was observed which we referred to as tp in eqs 12 and 13 however the collection time may be larger than the actual runoff time which can lead to poor runoff rate simulations during low flows based on the physical meaning of horton s model model parameter if mainly determines the final infiltration rate while k mainly determines the decreasing speed of infiltration a larger k indicates a shorter time to reach the final infiltration rate thus a faster runoff generation process table 3 generally parameter if of the concave slope was larger than that of the uniform slope followed by the convex slope showing an increasing trend with an increase in the slope curvature characteristic parameter α however parameter k decreased with an increase in the characteristic parameter α this may be explained as follows when the slope tends to reach the ponding time the runoff converges to form a continuous flow which indicates that the runoff in the downward slope accounts for a large proportion of the total runoff leading to a dominant influence on the infiltration process under concave slope conditions the runoff re infiltrated on the lower part of the slope which may have decreased the runoff amount in contrast the upper part of the convex slope generated negligible runoff for re infiltration the lower part had a larger slope gradient which decreased the opportunity for infiltration thus increasing the runoff rate rainfall intensity can also influence model parameters if and k the results showed that if and k increased with increasing rainfall intensity based on the patterns of if and k changing with rainfall intensity and parameter α the following relationships can be concluded 26 i f 0 0031 α 0 215 r 0 085 n 27 r 2 0 75 a n d 27 k 0 0926 α 3 037 r 2 855 n 27 r 2 0 65 3 2 effects of slope shape and rainfall intensity on transport of ammonia nitrogen 3 2 1 ammonia nitrogen concentration and loss rate the changes in the ammonia nitrogen concentration decreased significantly during the first 10 min in all experimental treatments fig 4 a c generally the ammonia nitrogen concentration of convex slopes was higher than that of a uniform slope followed by concave slopes under the same rainfall intensities the initial ammonia nitrogen concentration of the convex slopes was higher than that of the concave slopes nutrient concentrations were mainly influenced by runoff volume and dissolved nutrient content convex slopes have a larger runoff volume than uniform and concave slopes at the same time under the same rainfall intensity however this difference is negligible the nutrient quality transferred into the runoff was mainly influenced by the dynamic hydraulic parameters previous studies have demonstrated that convex slopes have a higher average flow velocity d souza and morgan 1976 which may aggravate the disturbance of flow therefore nutrient elements are more likely to enter the surface runoff flow and are carried by the runoff yang et al 2016c at the initial stage the nutrient concentration was mainly influenced by the initial runoff time a longer initial runoff time implies more water to dilute the ammonia nitrogen in the surface soil layer as described previously the initial runoff time of the convex slopes was smaller than that of the uniform and concave slopes leading to a larger initial nutrient concentration in the convex slopes the ammonia nitrogen concentration of the convex slopes also decreased more slowly than that of the concave slopes the transfer of nutrients into the runoff is affected by both the nutrient carrying capacity and nutrient release limits during the initial stage soil water and dissolved nitrogen in the soil are carried into the runoff along with soil particles eroded by splash erosion this suggests that the transfer of ammonia into the runoff is limited by the power of raindrops to disperse nutrients gao et al 2004 however during the later stages the ammonia concentration is influenced by nutrient release ability it is generally observed that the runoff from convex slopes has greater carrying and disturbing abilities than that from uniform and concave slopes peng et al 2015 this implies that the runoff from convex slopes has more ammonia nitrogen supply from the soil layer to reach a balance between runoff and soil layers leading to a slower decrease in the speed of convex slopes the ammonia nitrogen loss rate initially increased followed by a gradual decrease over time fig 4d f convex slopes had a higher ammonia nitrogen loss rate than uniform slopes followed by concave slopes rainfall intensity and slope curvature significantly affected the mean ammonia nitrogen loss rate table 3 at a rainfall intensity of 0 042 cm min 1 the mean ammonia nitrogen loss rates of c4 c3 and c2 decreased by 34 17 26 50 and 21 70 respectively while those of v1 v2 and v4 increased by 18 49 50 10 and 58 97 respectively compared to u p 0 05 similar trends were observed at rainfall intensities of 0 083 cm min 1 and 0 125 cm min 1 the mean ammonia nitrogen loss rates in runoff significantly decreased with an increase in slope curvature parameter α except for treatment v4 at 0 125 cm min 1 table 3 the ammonia nitrogen loss rate was determined by the product of runoff rate and nitrogen concentration fig 3 and table 3 indicated that there were only slight variations in runoff rate among different slope shape and curvature treatments under identical rainfall intensity therefore the relative values of loss rate among different treatments mainly depended on the nitrogen concentration the ammonia nitrogen concentration of v4 was smaller than that of the convex groups which could be due to the relatively longer runoff generation time of v4 among the convex groups a longer runoff generation time would decrease the ammonia nitrogen concentration in the soil solution indicating a lower concentration in runoff 3 2 2 simulated and observed ammonia nitrogen transport processes the parameters of the proposed model include soil related soil hydraulic related and nutrient transfer related parameters some parameters such as the soil bulk density initial soil water content and saturated soil water content were determined directly table 1 some parameters were calculated using an ideal hypothesis for simplicity the initial nutrient concentration in the exchange layer was calculated using eq 20 without considering nutrient leaching tao et al 2017 however some parameters could not be measured or calculated the mass transfer coefficient and effective depth were obtained by fitting the ammonia concentration data for the runoff with the proposed model the r2 values ranged from 0 64 to 0 95 the rmse values ranged from 0 24 to 0 75 mg l 1 the sse values ranged from 0 52 to 4 26 mg2 l 2 table 5 this indicates that the proposed model accurately describes the solute transport processes from the soil to the runoff on irregular slopes the results presented in fig 4a c demonstrate that the proposed model may overestimate the ammonia concentration during the initial runoff stage but underestimate it during the later nutrient transport stage for certain treatments after the start of the simulated rainfall the nutrients in the surface profile began to be carried into the deep soil layer when ponded water occurred nutrients began to be transported into the runoff through diffusion effects the nutrient concentration at the moment the ponded water formed was difficult to measure directly therefore the initial soil solution concentration was calculated using eq 20 without considering the nutrient leaching processes the assigned initial soil solution concentration may be larger than the exact concentration which may cause an over prediction of the initial concentration moreover all samples were collected during a period of 1 min in this experiment indicating that the nutrient concentration may be smaller than the accurate concentration owing to the relatively higher concentration at the beginning of the experiment however the proposed model did not consider the supply of nutrients from the deep soil layer leading to a lack of a nonlinear source sink term in this model which may cause a relatively fast decrease in the nutrient concentration this indicates that the proposed model may underestimate the mass transfer coefficient in the later stage resulting in an underestimation of the nutrient concentration heilig et al 2001 fig 4d f indicate that the proposed model tends to underestimate the ammonia nitrogen loss rate during the initial runoff stage particularly at rainfall intensities of 0 042 and 0 083 cm min 1 due to the underestimation of runoff rates however on the later stage the change of ammonia nitrogen loss rate follows a similar trend as the nitrogen concentration since there is little difference between the simulated and measured stable runoff rate among all treatments as listed in table 5 the convective mass transfer coefficient ke ranged from 0 0045 to 0 0186 cm min 1 the value of ke increased with an increasing rainfall intensity and decreased with an increasing slope curvature parameter α in our proposed model changing ke significantly changed the initial nutrient concentration maximum nutrient loss rate nutrient concentration decreasing and nutrient loss rate changing patterns a smaller ke indicates a smaller initial nutrient concentration and maximum nutrient loss rate and slower changing trend for both nutrient concentration and loss rate the initial nutrient concentration and maximum nutrient loss rate of the convex slopes was larger than that of the concave slopes owing to the shorter time to runoff the value of ke was also influenced by the runoff hydraulic parameters shao et al 2021 walter et al 2007 furthermore a smaller slope curvature parameter α would lead to more disturbance to the runoff thereby increasing the diffusion effects which would increase the nutrient supply from the soil layer the convective mass transfer coefficient ke was also affected by rainfall intensity based on table 5 ke increased with an increase in the rainfall intensity which is consistent with other studies shao et al 2022 tao et al 2017 the depth of the exchange layer de was also influenced by the slope curvature and rainfall intensity table 5 in our experiment the depth of the exchange layer generally decreased with an increase of the slope curvature parameter α for example the de value of c4 and v4 was 0 44 and 0 65 cm under 0 125 cm min 1 respectively based on mathematical derivation irregular slopes can be treated as uniform slopes when considering runoff and erosion by analyzing the slope characteristics convex slopes have a smaller α which can determine a corresponding value on a specific larger slope gradient this is the offset in concave slopes previous studies have concluded that the depth of the exchange layer increases with the slope gradient shao et al 2021 xing et al 2019 yang et al 2016a which is similar to our study however the results indicate that the differences may appear to be larger than those when treated with a regular slope this may have been caused by the same manning coefficient input in the simulation process therefore curvature may scale up these effects which should be explored further the depth of the exchange layer li et al 2017 tao et al 2017 or the mixing layer yang et al 2016a increases as the rainfall intensity increases which is similar to this finding based on the pattern of changes in ke and de with the rainfall intensity and parameter α the following relationships could be obtained 28 k e 0 0014 α 0 134 r 0 042 n 27 r 2 0 95 a n d 29 d e 0 092 α 3 173 r 2 972 n 27 r 2 0 64 overall by combining eqs 14 17 21 and 25 28 a convective mass transfer model was established to predict the ammonia nitrogen transport processes on irregular slopes as shown in fig 5 the model fit the experimental data well indicating that the proposed model can be used to predict the transport of ammonia nitrogen to runoff processes under different slope shapes and curvatures we also note that the simulated runoff rate and ammonia nitrogen loss rate may be smaller than the measured values during the early stages of the runoff processes the underestimation of runoff rate ultimately impacts the simulation results of parameters this will decrease if and k but increase ke and de for ammonia nitrogen concentration the underestimation of runoff rate has little influence on the simulated results of ammonia nitrogen concentration because changing ke and de can change both the initial concentration and decreasing speed which could best fit the measured value by least squares method however the underestimation of runoff rate can significantly affect the ammonia nitrogen loss rate in the early stage resulting in an overall underestimation 3 3 sensitivity analysis to evaluate the applicability of the proposed model the parameters were changed individually to verify the sensitivity of each parameter parameters ke and de were varied independently changing the rainfall intensity and slope curvature parameter would certainly change if k ke and de specific parameter values are listed in table 6 fig 6 shows variations in the model results for ammonia nitrogen transport with runoff by changing the individual parameters a smaller ke indicates a smaller initial concentration and a smaller maximum loss rate it also suggests a slower rate of change for both nutrient concentration and loss rate over time fig 6a and e this is consistent with our understanding of the chemical transport processes which is similar to the results of tao et al 2017 and shao et al 2021 unlike the response of the model to ke the depth of the exchange layer de strongly influences the maximum nutrient loss rate and decreasing speed of the ammonia nitrogen concentration and ammonia nitrogen loss rate but has no effect on the initial ammonia nitrogen concentration and increasing speed of ammonia nitrogen loss rate fig 6b and f the decreasing speeds of ammonia nitrogen concentration and loss rate significantly slow when de increases from 0 05 to 4 75 cm which is consistent with the results of yang et al 2015 changing the rainfall intensity and slope curvature parameters would influence the initial concentration maximum loss rate decreasing speed of concentration and changing trend of loss rate a larger slope curvature parameter led to a decrease in the initial concentration and maximum loss rate as well as a decrease in the changing speed of both concentration and loss rate fig 6c and g this may have been caused by the relatively smaller convective mass transfer coefficient of the slope with a larger curvature parameter this is in contrast to the trend of the rainfall intensity i e the initial concentration maximum loss rate and changing speed of both concentration and loss rate will increase with an increase in the rainfall intensity fig 6d and h which is consistent with our conceptual understanding of transport processes 3 4 limits and applicability of the model nutrient loss from slope land is a complex process that involves multiple pathways including runoff associated nutrient loss sediment associated nutrient loss and nutrient accumulation and transformation in soil while the model developed in this study focuses only on the transport of ammonia nitrogen from soil to surface runoff which may limit its applicability it may still be useful in specific situations where the concentration of nutrients in runoff is of greater concern for example nutrient in runoff can lead to severe environmental problems such as water body eutrophication land degradation and ecological deterioration in situations where the groundwater level is low there may be less concern about groundwater pollution from nutrient in runoff additionally the accumulation and transformation of nutrients in soil may benefit plant growth as plant roots can absorb nutrients carried by infiltration water it is worth noting that the nutrient transport from soil to runoff and nutrient accumulation and transformation in soil are two separate processes with relatively little interaction as shown in previous studies an et al 2019 ao et al 2020 gao et al 2004 tao et al 2017 walter et al 2007 moreover it should be noted that this experiment was conducted on bare slopes and future research may investigate the combined influence of land use cover and slope shapes and curvatures on nutrient loss in runoff overall the model developed in this study provides a foundation for understanding the complex nutrient loss processes on irregular slope land and may have practical applications in managing nutrient runoff in some specific situations from the perspective of model application this model assumed that the slope could be generalized as part of a circle which indicates that it could not be applied to other curves such as hyperbolic and parabolic curves however the means of managing irregular slopes to simulate solute transport can be helpful to future research the accuracy of the model was only tested at the experimental site with only one uniform slope gradient and soil type the performance of the model under different slope gradients and soil types must be further evaluated beyond these shortcomings the model could be convenient for estimating the amount of ammonia nitrogen transport from the soil layer to the runoff on an irregular slope the following conditions were set 1 the slope curvatures changed from c4 to v4 2 rainfall intensities ranged from 0 042 to 0 250 cm min 1 with a runoff time of 60 min fig 7 shows the change in the ammonia nitrogen loss per unit area with rainfall intensity and slope curvature the results showed that ammonia nitrogen loss decreased with an increase in the slope curvature parameter and increased with an increase in the rainfall intensity the error between the uniform slope and irregular slope e can be expressed as follows 30 e n i n u n u where ni is the ammonia nitrogen loss per unit area on irregular slope mg m 2 nu is the ammonia nitrogen loss per unit area on uniform slope mg m 2 the error ranged from 70 0 to 20 7 under a rainfall intensity of 0 042 cm min 1 this difference decreased with an increase in the rainfall intensity ranging from 21 6 to 4 6 under a rainfall intensity of 0 250 cm min 1 this phenomenon indicates that ignoring the slope shape effects would cause a relatively large imprecise estimation particularly under a small rainfall intensity these results provide guidance for nitrogen loss control methods 4 conclusions a mathematical model was developed to investigate solute transport from soil solution to overland flow under irregular slopes by introducing a slope curvature parameter α which reflects the topographic and hydraulic differences nine slope curvatures were examined concave slopes of middle down 10 20 30 and 40 cm uniform slope and convex slopes of middle up 10 20 30 and 40 cm as well as three rainfall intensities 0 042 0 083 and 0 125 cm min 1 the study found that overall the runoff rate ammonia nitrogen concentration and ammonia nitrogen loss rate increased with an increase in slope curvature under convex slopes and decreased under concave slopes the proposed mathematical model successfully described the runoff rate and ammonia nitrogen concentration with high r2 values indicating its effectiveness in predicting nutrient loss in runoff under different slope curvatures and rainfall intensities the relationships among parameters obtained from the model could provide a useful method for predicting nutrient loss in runoff the study highlights the importance of incorporating slope curvature into modeling nutrient transport and runoff processes on irregular slopes however the study was conducted with only one soil type and slope gradient and further testing is needed to evaluate its

2081,the loss of nitrogen on sloping land causes a decline in land productivity and non point source pollution research on nitrogen loss typically occurs on land with a uniform slope however irregular slopes are the most widely distributed types of slope in nature ignoring the effects of irregular slopes may cause misestimations of nitrogen loss on sloped land in this study a mathematical model was established to describe the process of ammonia nitrogen transfer from the surface soil to runoff under different slope shapes and rainfall intensities the slopes were generalized as parts of circles a slope curvature parameter was proposed to describe topographic and hydraulic differences the model was evaluated using nine slope degrees concave slopes of middle down 10 20 30 and 40 cm uniform slope and convex slopes of middle up 10 20 30 and 40 cm and three rainfall intensities 0 125 0 083 and 0 042 cm min 1 runoff rates were fitted using the established runoff model based on horton s infiltration equation the ammonia nitrogen transfer from the soil layer to runoff was built based on the diffusion model the governing equations of the models were solved numerically the study found that the mean runoff rates of concave slopes were significantly lower than those of convex slopes under rainfall intensities of 0 083 and 0 042 cm min 1 at a rainfall intensity of 0 042 cm min 1 the mean ammonia nitrogen loss rates of concave slopes decreased by 21 70 to 34 17 compared to the uniform slope while the loss rates of convex slopes increased by 18 49 to 58 97 p 0 05 similar trends were observed at rainfall intensities of 0 083 and 0 125 cm min 1 overall the runoff rates ammonia nitrogen concentration and ammonia nitrogen loss rate tended to decrease with an increasing slope curvature parameter the simulated results for the runoff rate and ammonia nitrogen transport process were consistent with the observed data with r2 values ranging from 0 80 to 0 98 for the runoff rate and 0 64 to 0 95 for the ammonia nitrogen concentration further correlation analyses were performed to determine the relationships among the slope curvature rainfall intensity hydraulic and nutrient transport parameters the results showed that these parameters can be described as a combined linear function of the slope curvature parameter and rainfall intensity moreover the sensitivity of the model to various parameters showed that the slope shape and curvature had an important impact on nitrogen transport this model can be used to improve the theoretical basis for developing nitrogen loss control methods keywords slope shape slope curvature ammonia nitrogen transport mathematical model data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction nitrogen is considered one of the most complex and biologically crucial elements aryal et al 2022 among all of the existing natural nitrogen compounds ammonia nitrogen in the soil can be quickly absorbed by plants owing to its high solubility which makes it highly applicable to farmland as a nitrogen fertilizer however ammonia nitrogen is easily transported by surface runoff caused by intense rainfall leading to inefficient nitrogen fertilizer application and a waste of energy additionally nitrogen transported by surface runoff also causes severe environmental problems including water body eutrophication land degradation and ecological deterioration ostad ali askari et al 2016 therefore an accurate model for predicting nitrogen transport from the soil to surface runoff is of great importance for ecological protection the nitrogen loss process is affected by many factors such as the soil type jing et al 2022 ostad ali askari 2022a antecedent soil moisture ouyang et al 2017 rainfall intensity ostad ali askari 2022b tao et al 2017 wu et al 2018 slope gradient li and wang 2016 talebmorad and ostad ali askari 2022 xing et al 2019 yang et al 2016c slope length xing et al 2016 slope roughness heathwaite et al 1998 and soil vegetation coverage bai et al 2022 garcía díaz et al 2017 palis et al 1990 rabiei et al 2022 among others however most of these studies have focused on nitrogen loss on a uniform straight slope generally most slopes in nature form from irregular slopes including concave slopes convex slopes and a combination of concave and convex slopes ignoring the effects of irregular slopes may cause miscalculations of nutrient loss hence it is imperative to investigate the impact of irregular slopes on nutrient loss and develop a predictive model for nutrient transport from the soil layer to runoff on such slopes an irregular slope is always treated as a changing gradient slope along the slope length which consists of many types of slopes including straight concave convex and s shaped slopes among these types convex and concave slopes have the simplest shapes which may be an effective means of revealing the influence of slope shape on nutrient transport slope runoff is influenced by slope shape sensoy and kara 2014 found that a uniform slope produced more runoff than concave and convex slopes a concave slope generates the least runoff however previous studies found that runoff from a convex slope was either greater young and mutchler 1969a or smaller young and mutchler 1969b than that of concave and uniform slopes several theories have been proposed to explain the effects of irregular slopes on runoff for example convexity decreases slope infiltrability while concavity increases slope infiltrability philip 1991 thompson et al 2010 wang and chen 2021 which directly influences the runoff amount noroozpour et al 2013 proved that the runoff of a convex slope always had a longer travel time than that of a straight slope whereas there were no consistent conclusions when considering concave slopes these conflicting results highlight the need for additional research to determine the impact of irregular slopes on runoff moreover the existing studies only compare the differences in runoff processes between different slope shapes and the impact of slope curvatures on the runoff process remains unclear nutrient loss is also affected by slope shape slope shape and curvature affect the flow pattern of runoff on the slope thereby affecting the nutrient transport pattern after runoff generation the flow direction of the runoff changes continuously on an irregular slope particularly at the turning point between the upper and lower slopes of an irregular slope it changes the gravity component along the slope surface which has a significant impact on the surface runoff resulting in a sharp change in the flow pattern and kinetic energy of slope runoff thus affecting nutrient transport from the soil layer to surface runoff to the best of our knowledge few studies have attempted to investigate the impact of the slope shape on nutrient loss most studies have focused on the effects of slope length and gradient by reviewing these studies some rules can be obtained for a deeper understanding of the effects of slope shape palis et al 1997 found that the total nitrogen loss per unit area increased with increasing slope length which is similar to the results of xing et al 2016 and an et al 2019 wu et al 2018 evaluated the effects of rainfall intensity and slope gradient on dissolved and adsorbed nitrogen loss their results indicated that there was no overall increasing or decreasing trend in nitrogen with an increased slope gradient however yang et al 2015 found that the runoff potassium concentration increased with an increase in the slope gradient ao et al 2021 reported that the average amount of ammonia nitrogen and phosphate loss along irregular slopes increased by 24 0 58 6 when compared to that of a uniform slope given the limited research on this subject and its significant implications it is crucial to investigate the impact of slope shape and curvature on nutrient transport from soil to runoff during rainfall events nutrient transport from the soil layer to the runoff layer is a complex process owing to its complicated mass exchange during rainfall many conceptual models have been developed over the past few decades shi et al 2011 by realizing that only a small layer is involved during a nutrient transport event researcher have proposed a complete effective depth of interaction edi which assumes that the nutrients in the edi are mixed completely and instantaneously wallach et al 1989 yang et al 2016b a simple power equation is used to simulate the nutrient loss subsequently this model was modified by adding a coefficient to describe incomplete mixing under high infiltration capacity conditions ahuja and lehman 1983 yang et al 2016c these two types of models are widely used owing to relatively few parameters however a shortcoming of this model is also evident the driving force for nutrient transport is not clear in this model subsequent models of diffusion wallach et al 1988 and convective dispersion ahuja 1990 were developed by assuming that solute transfer from the soil layer is driven by a concentration gradient or raindrop dispersion these two types of models have clearer physical meanings than the mixing depth models mentioned above runoff processes are also coupled in these models by solving the kinematic wave based model and governing equation which may better describe the influence of slope shape on the coupled runoff nutrient transport process comparing these two models the convective dispersion model separates the system into three layers the runoff exchange and deep soil layers in addition to transport of the nutrients in the exchange layer to the runoff layer by raindrop dispersion there is another process in which the source and sink are supplied from the deep soil layer by molecular diffusion however this process is usually gentle and can be ignored in field experiments which indicates that these two types of models have a similar form of expression therefore considering these shortcomings and advantages the diffusion model was selected for this study previous studies have examined the impact of rainfall characteristics tao et al 2017 soil properties vetrimurugan et al 2017 and slope gradient xing et al 2019 on the convective mass transfer coefficient however for complex hillslope topography there is a need to establish a diffusion model and validate how to quantify the impact of slope shape and curvature on model parameters a parameter describing the slope curvature should be proposed to establish a model that simulates the slope shape effect previous studies have used power evans 1980 sabzevari and noroozpour 2014 circular agnese et al 2007 and sine thompson et al 2010 functions to describe the shape of an irregular slope which provides a good foundation for this study given the existing knowledge gaps and available approaches the objective of this study is to 1 investigate the impact of slope shape and curvature on runoff and associated nitrogen loss 2 develop a mathematical model that characterizes nitrogen transport from soil to surface runoff by proposing a characteristic parameter that reflects hydraulic differences on an irregular slope and 3 validate the model s applicability across different slope shapes curvatures and rainfall intensities this study aims to reveal the behavior and extent of the impact of slope shape and curvature on solute transfer from soil to surface runoff and aid in the prediction and control of non point pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was carried out at the helingeer experimental base at the inner mongolia academy of water sciences n40 12 e111 41 which is located in the southern part of hohhot inner mongolia china helingeer county has a semi arid continental monsoon climate in the middle temperate zone fig 1 the average annual temperature is approximately 6 2 the average annual precipitation is 392 8 mm and the maximum precipitation per day is 99 1 mm the experimental site is a transitional zone between the inner mongolia plateau and loess plateau the overall terrain is high in the east low in the west high in the south and low in the north the southeastern area is part of manhan mountain the mountainous area accounts for 20 4 of the total area of helingeer whereas the central and southern parts belong to the loess hilly area accounting for 57 3 of the total area of helingeer corn is the most widely planted crop accounting for 54 4 of the total farmland area 2 2 experimental setup the experiment was conducted on a man made slope with an angle of 15 the slope was either dug or piled up to realize the different slope curvature targets in this experiment we set nine slope curvatures including concave middle down 10 20 30 and 40 cm of the uniform slope and uniform and convex slopes middle up 10 20 30 and 40 cm of the uniform slope then five points of the slope including the top middle top middle middle bottom and bottom were measured the results showed that the concave and convex slopes could be generalized as part of a circle with different radii fig 2a the slope had a width of 5 m and a length of 10 m to expedite the experiment the slope was divided into four experimental slopes with a width of 0 8 m in the center of the plot using five pvc boards additionally two testing slopes with a width of 0 9 m were included on both sides of the plot to evaluate uniformity and intensity of rainfall all pvc boards were installed 40 cm underground and 20 cm above the ground to avoid raindrop splash and lateral flow of the infiltration water the soil of the slope was composed of backfill soil with a local top 20 cm tillage soil layer at the bottom of the slope a triangular aluminum sheet directed the runoff and sediment to the collector the simulated rainfall was designed by the china agricultural university the simulated system was composed of a reservoir centrifugal pump pressure gauge pe and pvc tubes and a switch and sprinkler nozzle xing et al 2016 the pressure gauge shows the water discharge which aids in determining the rainfall intensity a side sprinkler was used to simulate rainfall as shown in fig 1 each side of the plot had three groups of nozzles where each group had three nozzles the sprinkler nozzle used in the experiment had a full aperture range of 0 360 the nozzles in the middle groups had an aperture of 180 while those on both sides had an aperture of 90 by adjusting the switches of these nozzles three rainfall intensities were generated 0 125 0 083 and 0 042 cm min 1 corresponding to return periods of 7 6 3 5 and 1 0 years at the experimental site the height of the rainfall was set to 3 4 m and the average raindrop radius was 3 0 mm according to the revised newton formula raindrops reached their final velocity and had an average kinetic energy of 13 4 j m 2 2 3 experimental procedure soil samples were collected from three points in each plot middle top and bottom to measure soil bulk density using the cutting ring method and particle size distribution was determined using a malvern laser particle size analyzer the soil was classified as kastanozem with a sandy texture 84 23 sand 10 84 silt 4 93 clay soil ph was measured in a 1 2 5 soil water suspension using a ph probe while soil total nitrogen tn was measured using the semi micro kjeldahl method the initial and saturated water content were measured using the drying method and the solute absorption coefficient was measured using the isothermal adsorption test specific data can be found in table 1 to prevent soil erosion the plot was covered with plastic film additionally 40 rainfall gauges were placed on the four central experimental slopes spaced 0 8 m 1 m apart to determine rainfall intensity and uniformity after 15 min of simulated rainfall the weight of water at each gauge was recorded the simulated rainfall intensity calibration would not stop until the error between the measured and set rainfall intensities was 5 the results showed that the rainfall uniformity of the simulated rainfall was more than 80 7 which could satisfy requirements for man made rainfall to fit the actual nitrogen loss situation at the farmland urea was applied to the plots as a nitrogen fertilizer at an application rate of 4 g m 2 consistent with the average local application rate of corn fields the calculated urea amount was first mixed with 4 l of water and then sprinkled uniformly across the entire plot next the plot was pre wetted by employing a rainfall intensity of 0 033 cm min 1 until reaching generation of initial runoff to ensure a nearly consistent antecedent soil moisture the fertilizer was then moved downstream to the deep soil layer which may be in accordance with actual nutrient loss conditions one hour before the simulated rainfall soil samples were collected at three points to measure the antecedent soil moisture and nutrient concentrations after the beginning of the rainfall the initial runoff time was recorded mixed samples of runoff and sediment were collected for 1 min samples were collected every five minutes after the start of the rainfall simulation except when the initial runoff time exceeded 5 or 10 min the sample volumes were measured and allowed to stand until the sediment settled then 100 ml of the supernatant was taken and stored at 0 4 c in a plastic bottle the runoff volume was measured by the water level in a calibrated bucket ammonia nitrogen concentration was determined using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer in the chemical analysis laboratory all treatments were replicated three times after the experiment the top 20 cm were removed and backfilled with a local tillage soil layer the plot was then wetted by simulated rainfall with a rainfall intensity of 0 033 cm min 1 until it reached a stable settlement the procedure mentioned above was repeated for different rainfall intensities or slope curvatures 2 4 theoretical analysis 2 4 1 solution for the runoff process the kinematic wave equation and manning formula have been widely used to describe water flow over slopes during rainfall events the mass conservation equation can be expressed as follows 1 q x t x h x t t r e t a n d 2 q x t j x 1 2 n h x t m where q x t is the unit discharge cm2 min 1 h x t is the runoff depth cm x is the distance cm along the overland flow plane t is rainfall time min re r i is the excess rainfall cm min 1 where r and i are the rainfall intensity cm min 1 and infiltration rate cm min 1 respectively n is manning s roughness coefficient and is set to 2 0 10 4 m is a parameter representing the flow regimes m 5 3 for turbulent flow m 2 for transition flow and m 3 for laminar flow which was set to 2 in this simulation and j x is the overland slope cm cm 1 in this experiment the irregular slope was set to be a part of a circle which allows for easy calculations under polar coordinates fig 2b and c if we select point x on the slope we can draw a line tangential to the circle the angle between the tangent line and the horizontal line is γ x here γ x is equal to θ 2 θ x on a concave slope and equal to θ 1 θ x on a convex slope if the slope and circle parameters are determined θ 1 and θ 2 are constants then the hydraulic gradient at any point on the irregular slope can be expressed as follows 3 j c x tan θ 2 θ x 0 θ 2 θ 1 j v x tan θ 1 θ x 0 θ 2 θ 1 where jc x is the hydraulic gradient of the concave slope and jv x is the hydraulic gradient of the convex slope table 2 lists some of the specific data by approximating the overland flow process the unit discharge can be expressed as follows 4 q x t q t x q t θ x r where q t is the runoff rate cm min 1 θ x is the central angle shown in fig 2b and c and r is the radius of the convex and concave slopes cm based on eqs 2 and 4 the depth of the overland flow h x t can be expressed as follows 5 h x t nq t θ x r j x 1 2 1 2 then by differentiating eq 5 with respect to t we obtained the change rate of the flow depth with time 6 h x t t 1 2 n θ x r j x 1 2 1 2 q t 1 2 dq t dt substituting eq 6 into eq 1 provides the following 7 r e t q t 1 2 n θ x r j x 1 2 1 2 q t 1 2 dq t dt integrating both sides of eq 7 with respect to x we obtained the following 8 r e t r θ 2 θ 1 q t r θ 2 θ 1 n r 1 2 2 q t 1 2 dq t dt 0 θ 2 θ 1 θ x j x 1 2 r d θ x then dq t dt could be expressed as follows 9 dq t dt 2 r e t θ 2 θ 1 q t θ 2 θ 1 q t 1 2 n r 1 2 0 θ 2 θ 1 θ x j x 1 2 d θ x for simplification we defined q 1 t q t 1 2 such that eq 9 can then be simplified as follows 10 d q 1 t dt r e t θ 2 θ 1 q 1 2 t θ 2 θ 1 n r 1 2 0 θ 2 θ 1 θ x j x 1 2 d θ x by separating variable x a parameter α related only to the distance along the overland flow plane could be proposed which could be used to distinguish the topographic and hydraulic differences of different slope curvatures the slope curvature parameter αi of an irregular slope and αu of a uniform slope can be expressed as follows 11 α i r 1 2 0 θ 2 θ 1 θ x j x 1 2 d θ x θ 2 θ 1 α u 2 l 1 2 3 j x 1 4 generally the rainfall excess is assumed to be constant during a constant rainfall intensity however this may significantly increase the speed of reaching the stable stage and will slightly distinguish between different rainfall intensities therefore horton s infiltration model was adopted in this experiment 12 i t i f r i f exp k t t p a n d 13 r e t r i f r i f exp k t t p where i t is the infiltration rate of the slope cm min 1 r is the rainfall intensity cm min 1 if is the final infiltration rate cm min 1 tp is the ponding time min and k is the coefficient that determines the rate of decrease in the infiltration rate during the rainfall experiment then combining eqs 10 11 and 13 the d q 1 t dt can be expressed as follows 14 d q 1 t dt r i f r i f exp k t t p q 1 2 t α n 1 2 the initial condition of eq 14 was q 1 t p 0 then the differential equation was numerically discretized using the runge kutta method with the measured values parameters if and k were inversely solved using the least squares method 2 4 2 solution for the nutrient loss process the soil water and nutrient system on sloping land can be divided into two layers during rainfall events a runoff layer and exchange layer nutrients can be transferred from the soil to surface runoff via the exchange layer the rate of this transfer depends primarily on the concentration gradient between these two layers nutrients may also be transported into the deep soil with infiltrating water in this study soil water and nutrients in the exchange layer were assumed to be uniformly mixed therefore two mass conservation equations for the runoff and exchange layers are presented below 15 h c r t q c r x k e c e c r i c r a n d 16 ρ s k d θ s d e c e t k e c e c r i c r c e assuming that the nutrient concentration of the water flow was distributed uniformly throughout the slope we obtained the following 17 dhc dt k e c e c r i c r a n d 18 ρ s k d θ s d e c e t k e c e c r i c r c e where h is the runoff depth cm ce is the solute concentration in the exchange layer mg l 1 cr is the solute concentration in the runoff layer mg l 1 ρs is the soil bulk density g cm 3 ks is the solute

increases from the zero point without considering changes in the solute concentration along the slope distance dhc dt will always be zero during the numerical solution process considering the relatively short period of the raising stage of the water depth h is represented by 19 h n r i f θ l r 1 2 j l 1 4 where jl is the hydraulic gradient at slope distance x l and θl is the slope gradient at slope distance x l the initial condition of the solute concentration in the exchange layer is as follows 20 c ep c 0 θ i ρ s k s θ s ρ s k s where cep is the solute concentration in the exchange layer at t tp c0 is the initial solute concentration of the surface soil solution mg l 1 and θi is the initial soil volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 it was difficult to determine the initial solute concentration in the runoff layer previous studies have suggested that the initial solute concentration could be set to cep which is equivalent to the solute concentration in the mixing layer yang et al 2016c however many studies have shown that the solute concentration in the mixing layer is often higher than that in the runoff some researchers suggest that the solute concentration of the initial runoff time should be zero because an impermeable layer is placed between the water and soil layers gao et al 2004 however this may not be accurate in the field experiment because solute could be transferred to the surface soil solution throughout the rainfall time which indicates that the solute concentration could not be zero at the initial runoff time furthermore if the water flow depth increases linearly and the infiltration can be neglected i 0 the initial solute concentration will be k e r c ep which may better match the practical situation therefore the initial solute concentration in runoff can be expressed as follows 21 c rp k e r c ep where crp is the solute concentration in the runoff at t tp the combination of eqs 17 21 can be solved numerically using the runge kutta method with the measured values parameters de and ke can be inversely solved using the least squares method the solute loss rate in the runoff can be expressed as follows 22 n l 10 c r q t where nl is the solute loss rate in the runoff mg m 2 min 1 2 5 data analysis multivariate nonlinear regression analyses were performed to estimate the parameters of the proposed runoff model and nutrient transport model for each simulated rainfall using matlab 2012 analysis of variance anova was used to compare the differences among treatments for all analyses p 0 05 was considered statistically significant the correlation coefficient r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient sse and root mean square error rmse were used to quantify the agreement between the simulated results and

predicted value p the mean value of the observed data and n is the number of measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of slope shape and rainfall intensity on runoff process 3 1 1 runoff generation and stabilization time runoff generation time is an important factor that reflects soil water content and determines the volume of water that runs off the soil surface engel et al 2009 table 3 showed that there was no significant difference in the runoff generation time for different slope curvatures under the same rainfall intensity runoff generation time was mainly determined by the antecedent soil moisture and rainfall intensity slope gradient had little effect on runoff generation time fang et al 2015 jiang et al 2014 the pre wet treatment in this study created a nearly consistent surface soil water content resulting in little difference among different slope curvatures runoff stabilization time can be used to describe the speed at which a stable state is reached in this research the runoff rate was first fitted with the horton s infiltration model and the time point reaching 95 of the maximum runoff rate 0 95 r if was defined as the runoff stabilization time this is because after the runoff stabilization time the rate of runoff increase tended to slow down and eventually became zero the runoff stabilization time of concave slopes is significantly longer than that of convex slopes under rainfall intensity of 0 125 cm min 1 the average runoff stabilization time of convex slopes was 7 68 min which is 5 47 min earlier than that of concave slopes similar trends were observed under rainfall intensities of 0 042 and 0 083 cm min 1 overall the runoff stabilization time increases with an increase in the concave degree and decreases with an increase in the convex degree table 3 this indicates a more rapid runoff process for convex slopes compared to concave slopes on concave slopes the smaller slope gradient on the lower part of the slope allows for more infiltration which can slow down the flow velocity and delay the runoff stabilization time rahma et al 2013 sensoy and kara 2014 the runoff generation time and the runoff stabilization time are both affected by the rainfall intensity with greater rainfall intensity resulting in smaller runoff generation and runoff stabilization time 3 1 2 runoff rate fig 3 shows the runoff generation processes for different slope shapes and curvatures under three rainfall intensities the runoff rate increased sharply after the generation of runoff it then tended to stabilize gradually over time this was mainly due to the rapid decrease in the soil infiltration capacity at the beginning of the rainfall as time progressed the infiltration rate stabilized the runoff processes were influenced by rainfall intensity and slope curvature in general the runoff rates exhibited a decreasing trend with increasing concavity and an increasing trend with increasing convexity when the rainfall intensity was held constant fig 3 the runoff rate increased most rapidly under v3 at rainfall intensities of 0 083 and 0 125 cm min 1 this could be due to the fact that the differences among slope curvature parameters become smaller when changing from v1 to v4 which indicates that the hydraulic differences between convex slopes become smaller additionally the pre wet treatment may not have resulted in a fully uniform and consistent water content among all treatments which may have led to an inconsistent order of the runoff generation time runoff stabilization time and increasing speed with respect to slope curvature the mean runoff rates of convex slopes were found to be significantly higher than those of concave slopes under rainfall intensities of 0 083 and 0 125 cm min 1 as indicated in table 3 specifically when compared to treatment u at 0 042 cm min 1 the mean runoff rates of treatments v2 and v4 increased by 17 16 and 18 16 respectively on the other hand the mean runoff rates of treatments c1 c2 c3 and c4 decreased by 12 75 15 93 13 25 and 14 47 respectively when compared to treatment u at 0 083 cm min 1 however there was no significant difference among all treatments under a rainfall intensity of 0 125 cm min 1 suggesting that the effects of slope curvature on runoff generation amount may be reduced at relatively higher rainfall intensities these results were consistent with previous research jiang et al 2014 poesen 1987 ribolzi et al 2011 this is possibly because the slope shape has a two fold effect on the runoff generation owing to the same projected slope length in the horizontal direction a larger curvature may result in the same rainfall reception amount and a larger rainfall infiltration area which may decrease with an increasing slope curvature however the runoff generation amount was also affected by the flow velocity the average flow velocity increases with an increase in the slope convex degree and has an opposite trend on a concave slope d souza and morgan 1976 this decreases the residence time on a convex slope and increases it on a concave slope these two effects could decrease the runoff generation process on a concave slope however these two effects have opposite effects on the convex slope illustrating that the accelerating flow production effect dominates the runoff generation process slope shape and curvature strongly influence the capacity of slope systems to slow retain and store overland flow thompson et al 2010 concave slopes usually have a greater infiltration capacity than uniform and convex slopes chen et al 2022 ning et al 2019 runoff also increased with an increase in the rainfall intensity runoff with larger rainfall intensities increased more quickly than that with smaller rainfall intensities fig 3 the average stable infiltration rates of 0 125 0 083 and 0 042 cm min 1 were 0 033 0 032 and 0 016 cm min 1 respectively showing a decreasing trend with an increase in the rainfall intensity under higher rainfall intensities the slope generates runoff more easily which indicates that excess rainfall may occur furthermore the larger runoff induced by a higher rainfall intensity may also concentrate on the rill which would increase the runoff depth and water pressure leading to a larger stable infiltration rate when rainfall intensities were 0 083 and 0 125 cm min 1 the mean runoff rates ranged between 2 70 3 38 and 5 43 6 20 l min 1 respectively which increased by 72 90 100 18 and 216 19 280 06 respectively compared to the 0 042 cm min 1 rainfall intensity thus runoff rates were jointly influenced by rainfall intensity and slope curvature with rainfall intensity having a greater impact on runoff rates 3 1 3 simulated and observed runoff rate soil infiltration was considered a function of rainfall time variation in our model to corroborate our infiltration parameters runoff data were applied to the established runoff model based on horton s infiltration model eq 14 the curve fitting results of the runoff model are presented in table 2 and fig 3 the r2 rmse and sse values ranged from 0 80 to 0 98 cm min 1 0 0014 to 0 013 cm min 1 and 2 3 10 5 to 1 5 10 3 cm2 min 2 respectively the established runoff model based on horton s infiltration equation can accurately describe runoff processes initially this model underestimated the runoff rate compared to the measured value the runoff rate exhibits a rapid increase followed by a stabilization phase where the stabilized value holds more significance than the increasing runoff rates and even small errors in the stabilized value can significantly reduce the simulation accuracy moreover the initial runoff was collected at the time when most of the slope generated runoff was observed which we referred to as tp in eqs 12 and 13 however the collection time may be larger than the actual runoff time which can lead to poor runoff rate simulations during low flows based on the physical meaning of horton s model model parameter if mainly determines the final infiltration rate while k mainly determines the decreasing speed of infiltration a larger k indicates a shorter time to reach the final infiltration rate thus a faster runoff generation process table 3 generally parameter if of the concave slope was larger than that of the uniform slope followed by the convex slope showing an increasing trend with an increase in the slope curvature characteristic parameter α however parameter k decreased with an increase in the characteristic parameter α this may be explained as follows when the slope tends to reach the ponding time the runoff converges to form a continuous flow which indicates that the runoff in the downward slope accounts for a large proportion of the total runoff leading to a dominant influence on the infiltration process under concave slope conditions the runoff re infiltrated on the lower part of the slope which may have decreased the runoff amount in contrast the upper part of the convex slope generated negligible runoff for re infiltration the lower part had a larger slope gradient which decreased the opportunity for infiltration thus increasing the runoff rate rainfall intensity can also influence model parameters if and k the results showed that if and k increased with increasing rainfall intensity based on the patterns of if and k changing with rainfall intensity and parameter α the following relationships can be concluded 26 i f 0 0031 α 0 215 r 0 085 n 27 r 2 0 75 a n d 27 k 0 0926 α 3 037 r 2 855 n 27 r 2 0 65 3 2 effects of slope shape and rainfall intensity on transport of ammonia nitrogen 3 2 1 ammonia nitrogen concentration and loss rate the changes in the ammonia nitrogen concentration decreased significantly during the first 10 min in all experimental treatments fig 4 a c generally the ammonia nitrogen concentration of convex slopes was higher than that of a uniform slope followed by concave slopes under the same rainfall intensities the initial ammonia nitrogen concentration of the convex slopes was higher than that of the concave slopes nutrient concentrations were mainly influenced by runoff volume and dissolved nutrient content convex slopes have a larger runoff volume than uniform and concave slopes at the same time under the same rainfall intensity however this difference is negligible the nutrient quality transferred into the runoff was mainly influenced by the dynamic hydraulic parameters previous studies have demonstrated that convex slopes have a higher average flow velocity d souza and morgan 1976 which may aggravate the disturbance of flow therefore nutrient elements are more likely to enter the surface runoff flow and are carried by the runoff yang et al 2016c at the initial stage the nutrient concentration was mainly influenced by the initial runoff time a longer initial runoff time implies more water to dilute the ammonia nitrogen in the surface soil layer as described previously the initial runoff time of the convex slopes was smaller than that of the uniform and concave slopes leading to a larger initial nutrient concentration in the convex slopes the ammonia nitrogen concentration of the convex slopes also decreased more slowly than that of the concave slopes the transfer of nutrients into the runoff is affected by both the nutrient carrying capacity and nutrient release limits during the initial stage soil water and dissolved nitrogen in the soil are carried into the runoff along with soil particles eroded by splash erosion this suggests that the transfer of ammonia into the runoff is limited by the power of raindrops to disperse nutrients gao et al 2004 however during the later stages the ammonia concentration is influenced by nutrient release ability it is generally observed that the runoff from convex slopes has greater carrying and disturbing abilities than that from uniform and concave slopes peng et al 2015 this implies that the runoff from convex slopes has more ammonia nitrogen supply from the soil layer to reach a balance between runoff and soil layers leading to a slower decrease in the speed of convex slopes the ammonia nitrogen loss rate initially increased followed by a gradual decrease over time fig 4d f convex slopes had a higher ammonia nitrogen loss rate than uniform slopes followed by concave slopes rainfall intensity and slope curvature significantly affected the mean ammonia nitrogen loss rate table 3 at a rainfall intensity of 0 042 cm min 1 the mean ammonia nitrogen loss rates of c4 c3 and c2 decreased by 34 17 26 50 and 21 70 respectively while those of v1 v2 and v4 increased by 18 49 50 10 and 58 97 respectively compared to u p 0 05 similar trends were observed at rainfall intensities of 0 083 cm min 1 and 0 125 cm min 1 the mean ammonia nitrogen loss rates in runoff significantly decreased with an increase in slope curvature parameter α except for treatment v4 at 0 125 cm min 1 table 3 the ammonia nitrogen loss rate was determined by the product of runoff rate and nitrogen concentration fig 3 and table 3 indicated that there were only slight variations in runoff rate among different slope shape and curvature treatments under identical rainfall intensity therefore the relative values of loss rate among different treatments mainly depended on the nitrogen concentration the ammonia nitrogen concentration of v4 was smaller than that of the convex groups which could be due to the relatively longer runoff generation time of v4 among the convex groups a longer runoff generation time would decrease the ammonia nitrogen concentration in the soil solution indicating a lower concentration in runoff 3 2 2 simulated and observed ammonia nitrogen transport processes the parameters of the proposed model include soil related soil hydraulic related and nutrient transfer related parameters some parameters such as the soil bulk density initial soil water content and saturated soil water content were determined directly table 1 some parameters were calculated using an ideal hypothesis for simplicity the initial nutrient concentration in the exchange layer was calculated using eq 20 without considering nutrient leaching tao et al 2017 however some parameters could not be measured or calculated the mass transfer coefficient and effective depth were obtained by fitting the ammonia concentration data for the runoff with the proposed model the r2 values ranged from 0 64 to 0 95 the rmse values ranged from 0 24 to 0 75 mg l 1 the sse values ranged from 0 52 to 4 26 mg2 l 2 table 5 this indicates that the proposed model accurately describes the solute transport processes from the soil to the runoff on irregular slopes the results presented in fig 4a c demonstrate that the proposed model may overestimate the ammonia concentration during the initial runoff stage but underestimate it during the later nutrient transport stage for certain treatments after the start of the simulated rainfall the nutrients in the surface profile began to be carried into the deep soil layer when ponded water occurred nutrients began to be transported into the runoff through diffusion effects the nutrient concentration at the moment the ponded water formed was difficult to measure directly therefore the initial soil solution concentration was calculated using eq 20 without considering the nutrient leaching processes the assigned initial soil solution concentration may be larger than the exact concentration which may cause an over prediction of the initial concentration moreover all samples were collected during a period of 1 min in this experiment indicating that the nutrient concentration may be smaller than the accurate concentration owing to the relatively higher concentration at the beginning of the experiment however the proposed model did not consider the supply of nutrients from the deep soil layer leading to a lack of a nonlinear source sink term in this model which may cause a relatively fast decrease in the nutrient concentration this indicates that the proposed model may underestimate the mass transfer coefficient in the later stage resulting in an underestimation of the nutrient concentration heilig et al 2001 fig 4d f indicate that the proposed model tends to underestimate the ammonia nitrogen loss rate during the initial runoff stage particularly at rainfall intensities of 0 042 and 0 083 cm min 1 due to the underestimation of runoff rates however on the later stage the change of ammonia nitrogen loss rate follows a similar trend as the nitrogen concentration since there is little difference between the simulated and measured stable runoff rate among all treatments as listed in table 5 the convective mass transfer coefficient ke ranged from 0 0045 to 0 0186 cm min 1 the value of ke increased with an increasing rainfall intensity and decreased with an increasing slope curvature parameter α in our proposed model changing ke significantly changed the initial nutrient concentration maximum nutrient loss rate nutrient concentration decreasing and nutrient loss rate changing patterns a smaller ke indicates a smaller initial nutrient concentration and maximum nutrient loss rate and slower changing trend for both nutrient concentration and loss rate the initial nutrient concentration and maximum nutrient loss rate of the convex slopes was larger than that of the concave slopes owing to the shorter time to runoff the value of ke was also influenced by the runoff hydraulic parameters shao et al 2021 walter et al 2007 furthermore a smaller slope curvature parameter α would lead to more disturbance to the runoff thereby increasing the diffusion effects which would increase the nutrient supply from the soil layer the convective mass transfer coefficient ke was also affected by rainfall intensity based on table 5 ke increased with an increase in the rainfall intensity which is consistent with other studies shao et al 2022 tao et al 2017 the depth of the exchange layer de was also influenced by the slope curvature and rainfall intensity table 5 in our experiment the depth of the exchange layer generally decreased with an increase of the slope curvature parameter α for example the de value of c4 and v4 was 0 44 and 0 65 cm under 0 125 cm min 1 respectively based on mathematical derivation irregular slopes can be treated as uniform slopes when considering runoff and erosion by analyzing the slope characteristics convex slopes have a smaller α which can determine a corresponding value on a specific larger slope gradient this is the offset in concave slopes previous studies have concluded that the depth of the exchange layer increases with the slope gradient shao et al 2021 xing et al 2019 yang et al 2016a which is similar to our study however the results indicate that the differences may appear to be larger than those when treated with a regular slope this may have been caused by the same manning coefficient input in the simulation process therefore curvature may scale up these effects which should be explored further the depth of the exchange layer li et al 2017 tao et al 2017 or the mixing layer yang et al 2016a increases as the rainfall intensity increases which is similar to this finding based on the pattern of changes in ke and de with the rainfall intensity and parameter α the following relationships could be obtained 28 k e 0 0014 α 0 134 r 0 042 n 27 r 2 0 95 a n d 29 d e 0 092 α 3 173 r 2 972 n 27 r 2 0 64 overall by combining eqs 14 17 21 and 25 28 a convective mass transfer model was established to predict the ammonia nitrogen transport processes on irregular slopes as shown in fig 5 the model fit the experimental data well indicating that the proposed model can be used to predict the transport of ammonia nitrogen to runoff processes under different slope shapes and curvatures we also note that the simulated runoff rate and ammonia nitrogen loss rate may be smaller than the measured values during the early stages of the runoff processes the underestimation of runoff rate ultimately impacts the simulation results of parameters this will decrease if and k but increase ke and de for ammonia nitrogen concentration the underestimation of runoff rate has little influence on the simulated results of ammonia nitrogen concentration because changing ke and de can change both the initial concentration and decreasing speed which could best fit the measured value by least squares method however the underestimation of runoff rate can significantly affect the ammonia nitrogen loss rate in the early stage resulting in an overall underestimation 3 3 sensitivity analysis to evaluate the applicability of the proposed model the parameters were changed individually to verify the sensitivity of each parameter parameters ke and de were varied independently changing the rainfall intensity and slope curvature parameter would certainly change if k ke and de specific parameter values are listed in table 6 fig 6 shows variations in the model results for ammonia nitrogen transport with runoff by changing the individual parameters a smaller ke indicates a smaller initial concentration and a smaller maximum loss rate it also suggests a slower rate of change for both nutrient concentration and loss rate over time fig 6a and e this is consistent with our understanding of the chemical transport processes which is similar to the results of tao et al 2017 and shao et al 2021 unlike the response of the model to ke the depth of the exchange layer de strongly influences the maximum nutrient loss rate and decreasing speed of the ammonia nitrogen concentration and ammonia nitrogen loss rate but has no effect on the initial ammonia nitrogen concentration and increasing speed of ammonia nitrogen loss rate fig 6b and f the decreasing speeds of ammonia nitrogen concentration and loss rate significantly slow when de increases from 0 05 to 4 75 cm which is consistent with the results of yang et al 2015 changing the rainfall intensity and slope curvature parameters would influence the initial concentration maximum loss rate decreasing speed of concentration and changing trend of loss rate a larger slope curvature parameter led to a decrease in the initial concentration and maximum loss rate as well as a decrease in the changing speed of both concentration and loss rate fig 6c and g this may have been caused by the relatively smaller convective mass transfer coefficient of the slope with a larger curvature parameter this is in contrast to the trend of the rainfall intensity i e the initial concentration maximum loss rate and changing speed of both concentration and loss rate will increase with an increase in the rainfall intensity fig 6d and h which is consistent with our conceptual understanding of transport processes 3 4 limits and applicability of the model nutrient loss from slope land is a complex process that involves multiple pathways including runoff associated nutrient loss sediment associated nutrient loss and nutrient accumulation and transformation in soil while the model developed in this study focuses only on the transport of ammonia nitrogen from soil to surface runoff which may limit its applicability it may still be useful in specific situations where the concentration of nutrients in runoff is of greater concern for example nutrient in runoff can lead to severe environmental problems such as water body eutrophication land degradation and ecological deterioration in situations where the groundwater level is low there may be less concern about groundwater pollution from nutrient in runoff additionally the accumulation and transformation of nutrients in soil may benefit plant growth as plant roots can absorb nutrients carried by infiltration water it is worth noting that the nutrient transport from soil to runoff and nutrient accumulation and transformation in soil are two separate processes with relatively little interaction as shown in previous studies an et al 2019 ao et al 2020 gao et al 2004 tao et al 2017 walter et al 2007 moreover it should be noted that this experiment was conducted on bare slopes and future research may investigate the combined influence of land use cover and slope shapes and curvatures on nutrient loss in runoff overall the model developed in this study provides a foundation for understanding the complex nutrient loss processes on irregular slope land and may have practical applications in managing nutrient runoff in some specific situations from the perspective of model application this model assumed that the slope could be generalized as part of a circle which indicates that it could not be applied to other curves such as hyperbolic and parabolic curves however the means of managing irregular slopes to simulate solute transport can be helpful to future research the accuracy of the model was only tested at the experimental site with only one uniform slope gradient and soil type the performance of the model under different slope gradients and soil types must be further evaluated beyond these shortcomings the model could be convenient for estimating the amount of ammonia nitrogen transport from the soil layer to the runoff on an irregular slope the following conditions were set 1 the slope curvatures changed from c4 to v4 2 rainfall intensities ranged from 0 042 to 0 250 cm min 1 with a runoff time of 60 min fig 7 shows the change in the ammonia nitrogen loss per unit area with rainfall intensity and slope curvature the results showed that ammonia nitrogen loss decreased with an increase in the slope curvature parameter and increased with an increase in the rainfall intensity the error between the uniform slope and irregular slope e can be expressed as follows 30 e n i n u n u where ni is the ammonia nitrogen loss per unit area on irregular slope mg m 2 nu is the ammonia nitrogen loss per unit area on uniform slope mg m 2 the error ranged from 70 0 to 20 7 under a rainfall intensity of 0 042 cm min 1 this difference decreased with an increase in the rainfall intensity ranging from 21 6 to 4 6 under a rainfall intensity of 0 250 cm min 1 this phenomenon indicates that ignoring the slope shape effects would cause a relatively large imprecise estimation particularly under a small rainfall intensity these results provide guidance for nitrogen loss control methods 4 conclusions a mathematical model was developed to investigate solute transport from soil solution to overland flow under irregular slopes by introducing a slope curvature parameter α which reflects the topographic and hydraulic differences nine slope curvatures were examined concave slopes of middle down 10 20 30 and 40 cm uniform slope and convex slopes of middle up 10 20 30 and 40 cm as well as three rainfall intensities 0 042 0 083 and 0 125 cm min 1 the study found that overall the runoff rate ammonia nitrogen concentration and ammonia nitrogen loss rate increased with an increase in slope curvature under convex slopes and decreased under concave slopes the proposed mathematical model successfully described the runoff rate and ammonia nitrogen concentration with high r2 values indicating its effectiveness in predicting nutrient loss in runoff under different slope curvatures and rainfall intensities the relationships among parameters obtained from the model could provide a useful method for predicting nutrient loss in runoff the study highlights the importance of incorporating slope curvature into modeling nutrient transport and runoff processes on irregular slopes however the study was conducted with only one soil type and slope gradient and further testing is needed to evaluate its

2082,the source region of the yellow river basin syrb is an alpine region sensitive to climate changes as global climate change intensifies it is essential to explore the future hydrological regime alteration and its ecological effects on the basin to provide evidence for water resources management and ecological restoration in the area this study offers a framework for assessing the future multi dimensional hydrological regime alteration and its ecological effects selected from global climate models gcms that performed well in the sixth coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 the vic model was forced by the gcms after downscaling and bias correction then the hydrological regime alteration and potential ecological effects in the region under ssp126 ssp245 ssp585 future scenarios were systematically assessed by the iha rva system and the contribution of different uncertainty sources was quantified through the two way anova the results indicated that 1 the temperature and precipitation will increase in the future under all scenarios while the runoff tends to show a downward trend by 2015 2100 the flow under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios may vary from 44 7 to 13 0 48 7 to 2 43 53 7 to 4 0 respectively when compared to the reference period 1961 1990 2 moderate alterations with rva 33 will be observed in the hydrological regime in the basin under ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios and low alterations with rva 26 7 under the ssp126 scenario the spring discharge of the basin will decrease significantly and the annual extreme flow is projected to decrease but the frequency of drought and flood events will tend to increase 3 there are multiple sources of uncertainty in predicting the future hydrological regime in the syrb the uncertainty due to the climate model is the dominant factor followed by the interaction between emission scenarios and the climate model and the average contribution to uncertainty of them is 69 5 and 20 8 respectively the uncertainty of emission scenarios is mainly reflected in winter flow while the climate model mainly affects the summer flow and annual maximum flow and the uncertainty of interaction between them varies in different periods keywords climate change hydrological regime alteration ecosystem uncertainty the yellow river basin data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction against the backdrop of global warming great changes have taken place in the hydrological regime of rivers lópez ballesteros et al 2020 tonkin et al 2018 especially in alpine regions ernakovich et al 2014 and hotaling et al 2017 pointed out that the three poles of the earth and alpine regions are more sensitive to global warming and global climate change is already having a major impact on polar and alpine ecosystems the hydrological regime is an important part of the integrity of an aquatic ecosystem to a certain extent the hydrological regime of a river determines the biological composition community structure and ecological function of its aquatic ecosystem horne et al 2019 rolls et al 2018 therefore changes in the hydrological regime can not only directly affect the ecosystem but also act indirectly on the ecosystem by changing the environment larsen et al 2021 at the same time the river ecosystem is very sensitive to changes in hydrological regimes so the alteration of the hydrological regime is regarded as the main driving factor of changes in a river s ecological process zeiringer et al 2018 moreover the influence of climate change on hydrological processes is becoming more significant attracting the attention of scholars at home and abroad gao et al 2020b john et al 2021 many researchers have showed that changes in a river s hydrological regime caused by climate change and human activities have a lot of adverse effects on its ecosystem polvi et al 2020 ramachandra et al 2020 for example lázaro et al 2020 investigated the rainfall patterns water retention and water level of the paraguay river over decades and the results indicated that the paraguay wetlands are losing water and experiencing more severe dry seasons than in the past these changes may lead to the loss of biological diversity and ecosystem services which are intrinsically linked to the hydrological regime of rivers liu et al 2020 quantified the impact of climate change on streamflow alterations and found that the hydrological regimes of rivers at all levels would be severely affected by future climate change with fish and macrophytes responding most strongly langhammer and bernsteinová 2020 conducted a comparative analysis of the historical and future hydrological regime of the mid latitude montane basins to assess short term medium term and long term eco hydrological risks with the results revealing that gradual reduction of river sections and aging of riparian habitats will jeopardize species renewal of these ecosystems in recent years climate change caused by the increase in greenhouse gas emissions is recognized globally gampe et al 2021 shen et al 2018 according to the sixth assessment report of the ipcc the global surface temperature has increased by 1 09 c in the last 20 years compared with the 1850 1900 average masson delmotte et al 2021 zhongming et al 2022 in the future the global climate will continue to warm and the probability of extreme events will also be greatly increased malede et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 amid climate change the projection of river hydrological regimes and their ecological effects has also become a keen area of research interest hydrological regimes are generally characterized by specific hydrological indicators and the qualitative or quantitative description of the indicators is an important part of research on ecohydrological processes cervi et al 2018 poff et al 1997 took the lead in using five kinds of indexes magnitude duration occurrence time frequency and change rate to comprehensively explain changes in hydrological regimes with the deepening of the research more than 170 hydrological indicators have been identified to assess hydrological changes and their ecological effects monk et al 2007 olden and poff 2003 among the most widely used index is the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha proposed by richter et al 1996 it has 32 parameters and has become an important basis for the study of ecohydrological processes in order to further quantitatively evaluate the degree of hydrological change and set the range of environmental flow in the natural state richter et al 1997 proposed the range of variability approach rva built on the iha since then researchers have factored in the complex requirements of setting environmental flow targets developing environmental flow assessment systems based on five different types of environmental flow components and 34 parameters environmental flow components efcs mathews and richter 2007 richter et al 1998 revisions by the american nature conservation association resulted in the original 32 iha parameters changing to 33 this increased the number of zero flow days and the base flow index and integrated the original number of rise flow days and the number of fall flow days into the number of reversals gao et al 2009 at present iha rva and efcs have integrated a set of open source software system iha software which is collectively known as the iha system conservancy 2007 based on the iha system a large number of studies have been carried out to evaluate the evolution of river hydrological regimes wang et al 2017 predicted the impact of future climate change on the hydrological regimes of four major rivers in three continents based on the fifth coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 and found that climate change would significantly affect the overall flow regime of the upper yellow river especially under the high emission scenarios song et al 2020 assessed the hydrological regime changes in china based on the iha rva system and the results showed that the hydrological regimes of chinese rivers were moderately changed due to reservoir impoundment which had a significant impact on the ecological environment wang et al 2018 applied the hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning model hbv in combination with three gcms under three representative emission pathways rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 and predicted that climate change would significantly influence the hydrological regime of the upper yellow river basin based on 32 iha indicators these previous studies have mainly focused on hydrological changes caused by human activities and their ecological effects such as dam reservoir construction water transfer and water diversion projects gunawardana et al 2021 huang et al 2019 singh et al 2022 zhou et al 2020b little effort however has been reported for the hydrological changes and ecological effects caused by climate change in addition the climate models have simulation uncertainties due to differences in their internal structures which cannot be ignored in the prediction of hydrological regimes but there are relatively few studies in this area kusangaya et al 2018 the source region of the yellow river basin syrb is an important water conservation area and it is also the lifeline of the economic and social development of the yellow river basin the syrb is located in an alpine area and very sensitive to climate change its unique geographical location and fragile ecological environment mean it is affected more by climate change and less disturbed by human activities xu et al 2021 therefore it is crucial to assess the alteration of the hydrological regime and its ecological effects on the syrb under climate changes in the future a set of global climate models simulating future climate changes was provided by the coupled model intercomparison project cmip which was carried out by the world climate research program wcrp and several well known organizations meehl et al 2020 cmip6 adds many new models based on the cmip5 and establishes a new composite scenario ssp rcp based on the shared socio economic path ssps it includes five basic paths the sustainable development path ssp1 intermediate path ssp2 regional competitive path ssp3 unbalanced path ssp4 and traditional fossil fuel based path ssp5 these five paths combine seven emission scenarios rcp1 9 rcp2 6 rcp3 4 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 rcp7 0 rcp8 5 into 35 combination scenarios séférian et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 based on this the objectives of this study are 1 to propose a comprehensive assessment and uncertainty quantification framework for the eco hydrological regime of the river under future climate change 2 to reveal the evolution of eco hydrological regimes alteration in the syrb in the next century under climate change 3 to quantitatively analyze the impact of multi source uncertainty on the projection of eco hydrological regimes 2 study area and data description 2 1 study area the syrb is situated in the northeast of the qinghai xizang plateau at 95 50 to 103 28 e 32 12 to 36 48 n the elevation of the basin is 2706 6248 m and the area is mainly a semi humid and semi arid continental monsoon climate the basin is obviously affected by the southwest monsoon the annual precipitation is 250 750 mm and the seasonal distribution is very uneven the precipitation in july september can account for 70 90 of the year s total and the annual evaporation is 800 1200 mm the basin covers 12 2 104 km2 and its outlet is the tangnaihai hydrological section the annual average runoff 1950 2020 is 2 04 1011 m3 which accounts for a third of the annual runoff in the yellow river basin so is an important water producing and conservation area for the basin bao et al 2019 the water network in the source area has many tributaries as well as snow cover glaciers grasslands and lakes the area also has a large area of permafrost and seasonally frozen soil omer et al 2020 the alpine geomorphological landscape and special climate environment of the area give it a unique hydrological regime this regime is the most important source of water resources in the upper reaches of the yellow river and directly affects the safety of water in the middle and lower reaches of the waterway wang et al 2020b in addition the region is home to national key ecological function areas such as the sanjiangyuan grassland meadow wetland ecological function area and the zoige grassland wetland ecological function area they contribute to a water conservation system that is extremely important for the country as a whole the water system of the syrb is shown in fig 1 2 2 data the historical meteorological data used in this paper is the cn05 1 grid data set derived from the china meteorological center it consists of the precipitation average temperature maximum temperature minimum temperature from 1961 to 2018 on a daily scale with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 the data have good applicability in portraying the climate characteristics in china guan et al 2020 the historical runoff data is the daily runoff of tangnaihai station during 1961 2018 which was obtained from the hydrological yearbook and the future meteorological data over 1961 2100 was obtained from the five gcms provided by cmip6 https pcmdi llnl gov cmip6 which was evaluated and selected from 19 gcms in our previous studies wang et al 2021 the attributes of five gcms is shown in table 1 in this study three scenarios were chosen ssp1 rcp2 6 ssp126 ssp2 rcp4 5 ssp245 and ssp5 rcp8 5 ssp585 the radiative forcing of the ssp126 ssp245 spp585 scenarios are 2 6 w m2 4 5 w m2 8 5 w m2 which were subjective to the low middle high radiation emission scenarios and social vulnerability respectively the vegetation data adopted in this study were collected from the global 1 km vegetation database of the university of maryland https glad umd edu dataset and the soil use and texture types data were collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa https www noaa gov infrastructure law infrastructure law climate data and services soil moisture and snowpack pilot program 3 methodology in this research a framework for assessing future hydrological regime alteration and its ecological effects was proposed fig 2 the main body of the framework included 1 evaluation of the performance of gcms from cmip6 the gcms with better performance were downscaled and deviation corrected 2 simulation and prediction of future meteorological and hydrological characteristics 3 assessment of hydrological alteration and quantifying the uncertainty of it under different emission scenarios 3 1 data downscaling and bias correction due to the inconsistent resolution of gcms provided by cmip6 the resolution of gcms was unified in this study to 0 5 0 5 by a bilinear interpolation method zhou et al 2017 the climatic element is an important driving variable of hydrological simulation although it simulated by gcms makes up for the shortage of meteorological stations in the alpine mountains however there are great deviation between the simulation and the observed data because of the different prediction process such as the total amount and frequency of precipitation output by the gcms so it is necessary to process the simulated data by deviation correction method horvat 2021 the daily basis correction dbc method is a distribution based bias correction method that is widely used to correct the systematic deviation of output data from gcms yin et al 2021 the local intensity scaling loci method is a deviation correction method based on mean value which can correct the precipitation probability and average precipitation of gcms at the same time yin et al 2020 using the observed data from 1961 to 1990 the study combined the loci and dbc methods to correct the frequency and magnitude of daily precipitation series of five gcms under the ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios during 2015 2100 3 2 runoff stimulating in this research the future runoff was simulated and predicted by the variable infiltration capacity vic model which is a large scale land surface model based on spatial distribution gridding it simulates the process of energy and water transfer between the atmosphere vegetation and soil based on the characteristics of area gridding and it has been widely used in various aspects such as runoff simulation and explores the influence of climate change on water resources nijssen et al 1997 the confluence model adopted in vic model is the grid confluence model which is mainly used to calculate the process of the runoff in each grid reaching the outlet section of the basin through the concentration of the over land flow and the river network seven parameters need to be calibrated according to the observed runoff data in the vic model the parameter b describes the shape of the soil water storage capacity curve dsmax is the maximum velocity of baseflow ds is the fraction of dsmax where non linear baseflow begins ws is the fraction of maximum soil moisture where non linear baseflow occurs and d1 d2 d3 is the thickness of first second and the third soil moisture layer respectively liang et al 1996 according to previous research jin et al 2020 the historical runoff of tangnaihai station changed suddenly in 1990 which means the runoff before 1990 was less affected by human activities therefore 1961 1990 was chosen as the baseline period 1961 as the preheating period 1961 1981 as the calibration period and 1982 1990 as the verification period the parameters were calibrated by the sce ua optimization algorithm combined with the observed meteorological data shu et al 2021 the nash efficiency coefficient ns and relative error re were selected to appraise the applicability of the climate model the formulas are as follows 1 n s q i o q o 2 q i s q i o 2 q i o q o 2 2 re q s q o q o 100 where q i s and q i o are the simulated and observed daily runoff and q s q o are the long series mean value of simulated and observed runoff respectively a perfect simulation would be the one with a centered re equal to 0 and both ns to 1 based on the vic model and confluence model the basin was divided into 74 grids with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 the precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature data of five gcms on a daily scale under three scenarios were inserted into each grid by the bilinear interpolation method which was used as meteorological driving data of the vic model then the vic model was forced by meteorological data vegetation soil data and optimized parameters and the evaporation and runoff in the basin were calculated according to the grid order finally the results were connected to the confluence model and the daily runoff process under different scenarios in the future at the tangnaihai station was simulated 3 3 evaluation of ecological flow regime in this study the indicators of hydrological alteration iha method was adopted to evaluate the change in the river s hydrological regime the hydrological regime and its ecological effects were assessed from five dimensions magnitude of monthly water conditions magnitude and duration of annual extreme water conditions timing of annual extreme water conditions frequency and duration of high and low pulses and the rate and frequency of water condition changes yang et al 2017 the index of zero flow days was not considered in this research because there was no outage in the syrb during the historical period the following 32 hydrological change indexes were selected in this paper table 2 for the sudden change of hydrological conditions at the tangnaihai station in 1990 the iha index under the ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios in the near future 2040 2059 middle future 2060 2079 and the far future period 2080 2099 was calculated with 1961 1990 as the baseline period among the 32 hydrological indexes the absolute change analysis was applied on the date of the maximum and minimum flow the duration and frequency of high and low pulse flow the relative change analysis was used for the other indexes in order to quantify the change degree of hydrological indexes in the relative reference period and then determine the restoration goal of river management according to the rva method created by richter et al 1998 75 and 25 of the occurrence frequency of each index before interference were taken as the variation ranges to meet the ecological needs of rivers the relative change rates and future hydrological regime alteration of the above 45 combinations 5 models 3 scenarios 3 periods were comprehensively analyzed the method for calculating the change degree of the rva is as follows 3 d i n i n io n io 100 where d i is the hydrological alteration degree of the i th index n i is the number of the observation years of i th index actually falling within the threshold n io is the number of the observation years of i th index expected to fall within the threshold among them the hydrological alteration degree is low at 0 33 more than 33 but not more than 67 in medium alteration and more than 67 in high alteration richter et al 1997 3 4 uncertainty evaluation method although hydrological projection based on the land air coupling is a hot research topic at present there are many uncertainties in predicting future hydrological regimes through the coupling of the global climate models and hydrological models the simulation uncertainty sources of the water circulation system model are mostly the model input data model structures model parameters and methods used to calibrate data shu et al 2021 bayesian model averaging bma is a method to obtain reliable composite forecast result by weighting the forecast values of different models it can be used not only for model combination but also for calculating the uncertainty of individual models and model combinations lotfirad et al 2022 shu et al 2022 therefore the bayesian model averaging bma method was applied to account for uncertainty in projecting the future precipitation temperature and streamflow the analysis of variance anova method two factors was used to account for the uncertainty contribution of climate models and emission scenarios aryal et al 2019 the total sum of squares sst was calculated by 4 sst s s ssp s s gcm s s ssp g c m where s s ssp s s gcm and s s ssp g c m is the partitioned squares of the emission scenario climate model and interaction between them respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 future climate change 4 1 1 downscaling and deviation corrected of gcms the main driving factors affecting the hydrological regime of rivers are precipitation and temperature based on the observed data of precipitation maximum and minimum temperature the original product data of gcms and the corrected gcms data the standard deviation std mean value mean percentage of relative deviation re root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient cor of the data series were selected to assess the metrological simulation ability of gcms on the basin table 3 the simulation ability of precipitation and temperature of the basin in the corrected gcms has been significantly improved for precipitation the percentage of relative deviation between the original gcms products the corrected series and the observed precipitation series are 106 and 1 08 respectively the original gcm products greatly overestimated the annual average precipitation and daily precipitation in the syrb for the maximum and the minimum temperature the raw data of gcms underestimated the historical temperature which is more obvious in the simulation of the maximum temperature after deviation correction the gcms offered good performance in simulating the temperature variation characteristics of the basin and the deviation of annual average maximum and minimum temperature between simulation and observation is close to 0 the correlation has also been significantly improved the spatial characteristics of precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures in the historical period simulated by the downscaling gcms and the observed data of syrb was presented in fig 3 the results indicated that the performance of downscaling gcms to reproduce the climatic variation characteristics of the syrb is good for precipitation the downscaling gcms cannot only simulate the spatial distribution characteristics of syrb precipitation decreasing gradually from southeast to northwest fig 3 b but also the relative deviation percentage of simulated precipitation relative to observation ranges from 1 53 to 0 29 which is very close to the observed precipitation for temperature the spatial deviation of the maximum and minimum temperature between observation and downscaling gcms in syrb is only 0 01 c to 0 05 c therefore the meteorological data simulated by gcms after deviation correction could be applied to predict the future climate change of the basin ding et al 2022 and wang et al 2022a projected precipitation changes in the yellow river basin based on cmip6 and found that gcms from cmip6 had good performances in simulating precipitation in the basin which was consistent with our results 4 2 projection and uncertainty of future climate change the changes in annual average precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature projected by bayesian average models with respect to the baseline 1961 1990 under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios are presented in fig 4 the precipitation and temperature in the syrb will increase in the future compared with the baseline period the maximum temperature will increase at 1 3 c 10a 3 3 c 10a and 6 7 c 10a respectively under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios during 2015 2100 fig 4a moreover the maximum temperature tends to increase between 0 9 c and 3 8 c 1 5 c and 4 3 c 2 6 c and5 6 c in 2015 2100 under low medium and high emission scenarios the minimum temperature is going to increase at the rate of 1 2 c 10a 3 0 c 10a and 6 4 c 10a respectively under the ssp126 ssp245 ssp585 scenarios fig 4b and will increase for all three scenarios with a range of warming between 0 7 c and 3 8 c 1 4 c and 4 4 c 2 4 c and 5 5 c according to the clausius clapeyron relation liu et al 2019 the temperature rise will lead to an increase of evaporation which in turn will accelerate the process of the water cycle therefore an increasing trend was also detected in the precipitation of the syrb fig 4c with the rate of 0 7 mm 10a 0 8 mm 10a and 0 18 mm 10a under ssp126 ssp245 ssp585 respectively besides that it was projected to increase with an extent between 14 4 and18 4 14 7 and 19 7 13 1 and 25 3 under three scenarios respectively sun et al 2022 and lu et al 2018 indicated that the long term correlation characteristics of the temperature series in the syrb are persistent that is the trend of the overall temperature rise in the past indicates that it will continue to the future nevertheless the precipitation in the basin tends to present increasing trends but the intensity of it will not be great which corresponds with the results of this study 4 3 response to climate change on streamflow 4 3 1 calibration and validation of the hydrological model the vic model was calibrated from 1962 to 1981 and validated from 1982 to 1990 fig 5 is the observed runoff process and the process simulated by the vic model at tangnaihai station the model performance for runoff simulation in gauged basins was evaluated by the ns and re indexes the four intervals of evaluation were n s 0 9 0 9 n s 0 7 0 7 n s 0 5 and n s 0 5 meaning excellent satisfactory unsatisfactory and failed results respectively the nash efficiency coefficients of the calibration and verification periods are 0 84 and 0 87 respectively indicating that the simulation effect is satisfactory at the same time the re index of the calibration and the verification period are 1 72 and 0 41 respectively which are all less than 20 indicating that the simulation results are very close to the observation thus the model performance on a daily scale could be classified as satisfactory based on the evaluated criteria proposed by moriasi et al 2007 and kalin et al 2010 actually in addition to nse and re indicators reached a satisfactory level the absolute error of simulated runoff of vic model in the calibration and validation periods with observed runoff is only 0 03 mm d and 0 05 mm d and the logarithmic nash efficiency coefficients of vic model simulated runoff in syrb during the calibration period and verification period are 0 61 and 0 59 pushpalatha et al 2012 although they are not as satisfactory as high flow previous studies have shown that it is difficult to accurately simulate low flow arnoux et al 2021 merz et al 2011 and the syrb is an alpine region with complex underlying surface conditions the simulation of low flow in this region is more complex overall our results are generally acceptable when considering the previous research results so the vic model with six calibrated parameters could be applied to forecasting the future discharge process in the syrb 4 3 2 projection changes on future streamflow the annual flow variation of the basin in 2015 2100 with respect to baseline 1961 1990 under the scenario of ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 is shown in fig 6 bayesian average models the results indicate that the runoff of the basin will show a downward trend in the future as greenhouse gas emissions rise the runoff was projected to decrease at the rates of 0 06 a under ssp126 scenarios 0 16 a under ssp245 scenarios and 0 21 a under ssp585 scenarios the discharge in the syrb may vary from 44 7 to 13 0 48 7 to 2 43 and 53 7 to 4 0 during 2015 2100 in the view of the time scale the changes will be partly significant in the far future under ssp585 scenarios under the ssp126 scenario the annual flow tends to vary from 42 7 to 12 9 49 0 to13 2 and 45 3 to 8 6 in the near 2040 2059 middle 2060 2079 and far future periods 2080 2099 under the ssp245 scenario the annual flow varies from 48 1 to 4 0 52 3 to 2 0 and 52 5 to 0 19 in the near middle and far future periods with respect to baseline periods respectively under the ssp585 scenario the annual flow of the syrb tends to vary from 54 6 to 11 6 56 3 to 6 5 and 59 8 to 22 8 in the near middle and far future periods respectively in general the flow in the syrb is likely to decrease gradually with temperature rise although the precipitation in the basin will increase in the future the gradually rising temperature will accelerate the basin water cycle and the evaporation and dispersion of the basin will also greatly increase which will lead to a decreasing trend of basin discharge the decreasing trends of streamflow were also reported by other researchers wang et al 2020a summarized the papers on runoff variation and prediction in the syrb published in the past 20 years 1980 2020 and found that the runoff in the basin generally shows a downward trend in recent decades and is characterised by alternating wet and dry periods at the same time the annual distribution of runoff is uneven and the runoff in the syrb will still decrease for a certain period in the future 4 4 ecological alteration and risk under climate change 4 4 1 alteration of monthly streamflow the changes in the monthly flow relative to the baseline period for future periods 2040 2099 are shown in fig 7 under the ssp126 scenario almost all monthly flow completely corresponds with the declining trend with the exception of december the flow of march will have the most significant decline of 41 1 in the near future 42 5 in the middle future and 39 9 in the far future while it in december is likely to increase by 11 2 and 6 2 in the near and middle future periods under the ssp245 scenario the variation discipline of monthly flow will be like the ssp126 scenario with all the monthly flows except december showing a downward trend ranging from 4 6 to 43 7 while in december it is likely to increase by 2 8 in the near future the outliers of the pattern are ignored all monthly flows tend to decline almost throughout all periods under the ssp585 scenario ranging from 8 24 to 44 3 overall the monthly flow in each scenario showed a decreasing trend among which the monthly flow in march and april is the most significant however it is going to increase in december in the near future precipitation in the syrb will not increase significantly in the future but the evaporation of the source region will increase as temperatures rise which will lead to a decrease in runoff in the basin yang et al 2012 and yang et al 2020 showed that the runoff in the syrb will decrease in the future and the annual distribution of runoff will change greatly due to climate change underlying surface change and other complex factors in addition the underlying surface of the source area of the basin is very complex with a large area of frozen soil layer and snow rising temperatures in the future will lead to an increase in snowmelt in winter so the flow in december will show an increasing state and the downward trend of flow in january and february tend to be lower than that in other months yang et al 2018 at the same time due to the early snowmelt the snow cover and melt will decrease in earlier months which will lead to a decrease in discharge in march and april li et al 2021 in addition all scenarios occurred with anomalies of increased flow in may and june ranging from 7 3 to 81 3 therefore the prediction results have great uncertainty due to the global climate models wang et al 2018 selected 1971 2000 as the baseline period the runoff changes in the future period of the syrb were predicted based on four cmip5 models and hbv models it was found that the discharge in the future flood season in the source region might show an increasing trend which further explained the influence of the difference of the baseline period the uncertainty of the hydrological model and global climate model on the research results therefore further research and in depth discussion are needed on the projection of hydrological situation in the syrb in the future 4 4 2 alteration of magnitude of annual extreme streamflow the changes in annual extreme flow relative to the reference period are illustrated in fig 8 the results indicate that under the ssp126 scenario the annual minimum 1 day flow may decrease most significantly by 34 4 36 8 and 54 2 in the near future middle future and far future meanwhile the maximum annual 30 day flow had the most significant decrease in the annual maximum extreme flow group which is likely to decrease by 21 8 24 8 and 21 4 respectively the variation discipline of annual maximum and minimum extreme flow under the ssp245 scenario was projected to be the same as that under the ssp126 scenario and their decline rate will increase over time in addition the average decline rate of all indexes tends to be higher than that of the ssp126 scenario except for the annual maximum flow in the far future it will range from 3 6 to 57 7 ignoring the maximum 1 day flow predicted by the cnrm esm2 1 will increase by 2 96 in the near future under the ssp585 scenario the variation law of the annual minimum extreme flow is the same as that of the ssp126 ssp245 scenarios and the average decline rate over all periods will be higher than that of them in contrast the decline rate of the annual maximum flow under the ssp585 scenario will be lower than that of the ssp245 scenario but it will still be higher than that of the ssp126 scenario this is because the flow in the middle and future period of the ssp585 scenario will be slightly higher than that of the ssp245 period and the decline rate of the two with respect to the baseline period is 0 14 and 0 23 respectively in fact except for the increase in the change rate of the maximum annual extreme flow predicted by the esm2 model almost all models agree that the annual extreme flow will decrease in the future in the syrb the annual minimum flow is closely related to the annual flow especially in cold regions so the minimum annual extreme flow in the syrb will be easily influenced by the decreased flow in the future assani et al 2006 zhang et al 2018 cui et al 2018 reported that the annual extreme flow on different scales of the syrb showed a decreasing trend in varying degrees and the change rate of the annual maximum extreme flow was larger than that of the minimum extreme flow which is consistent with the conclusion of this study 4 4 3 alteration of the date of minimum and maximum flow fig 9 shows the change in the date of the annual maximum and minimum1 day flow with respect to the baseline period the results reflect that the date of the annual minimum 1 day flow will be significantly shift backward that of the baseline period while the date of the annual maximum 1 day flow is uncertain for the date of the annual minimum 1 day flow the lagging trend of the ssp245 ssp585 scenarios in the middle and future period will be the most significant with a lag time of 82 3 days and 80 days with respect to the baseline period respectively specifically the near future period of the ssp126 scenario is likely to delay the most compared with the other two periods ranging from 70 5d 82d in the view of the date of the 1 day maximum flow except for the middle future periods of the ssp126 scenario it of the other scenarios and their corresponding periods is going to postpone when compared with the baseline period among them the backward trend of 11 days under the ssp245 scenario is the most significant in the middle future period followed by the 10 9 days of the far future period of the ssp585 scenario practically the date of annual extreme flow is an important signal in the biological rhythms of fish and its change will significantly impact fish spawning and habitat furthermore the advance or postponement of extreme flow may lead to the failure of aquatic reproduction and the increase in mortality the most direct manifestation is fish migration and spawning fenkes et al 2016 and other scholars anil et al 2019 hwan and carlson 2016 believe that one of the signals of fish breeding is rising water that is the time when the maximum flow occurs therefore it is particularly necessary to carry out reservoir ecological operations in time during the fish spawning period to ensure the spawning process the study found that the date of maximum 1 day flow in the future period of the syrb is uncertain for example in the near future period of the ssp126 scenario the prediction of the date of the 1 day maximum flow by the access cm2 bcc csm2 mr and cnrm cm6 1 models will delay while the prediction results of the cnrm esm2 1 and mpi esm1 2 lr models are completely opposite thus the uncertainty of climate models will be transmitted with the hydrological simulation process and the trend of single model prediction may be different from that of multi model set average which indicates that a method needs to be considered to obtain the best prediction in climate change impact research 4 4 4 alteration of frequency and duration of high and low pulses the variation of the number and duration of the high and low flow pulses relative to the reference period is shown infig 10 under the ssp126 scenario the duration of high and low pulses flow tends to show a downward trend in each period the decreasing range of the low pulse duration is 1 25d 8d while the decline range of the high flow pulses is 10 5d to 13 5d at the same time the number of high and low pulses flow may increase with respect to the baseline period and high flow pulses may be relatively higher increasing by 5 1 days in the middle future period the same law of change also appears in the ssp245 ssp585 scenarios with the increase in greenhouse gas emissions the duration of low pulses decreases more violently compared with the reference period while the number of low pulse flows increases gradually in the far future of the ssp585 scenario the number of low pulses flow may increase by 4 6 days relative to the baseline period but its duration is likely to decrease by 6 75 days in addition with the increase in greenhouse gas emissions the increase rate of high pulses gradually slows and its maximum value may appear in the middle future period of ssp126 meanwhile the duration of high pulses may decrease more sharply under the ssp245 scenario followed by the ssp585 scenario which ranges from 10 75d to 13 75d and 10 5d to 13 75d respectively notably the high and low pulses are generally regarded as flood and drought events so the frequency of drought events and flood events in the syrb may increase in the future but the duration of them may decrease the frequency of drought and flood events will affect the frequency of soil moisture and hypoxia and their intensity and duration will increase the stress of plant water demand and the demand of aquatic organisms for habitat moreover poff et al 1997 found that the continuous emergence of high flow pulse conveys fine particles of sediment maintains the high fecundity of benthos and provides a spawning place for fish thus the decrease in the duration of high pulses in the syrb in the future may affect the reproduction of benthos by affecting the stability of the river basement 4 4 5 alteration of streamflow variability fig 11 shows the alteration of the rise rates fall rates and the number of hydrological reversals of annual flow from the point of the rise rates of flow it was projected to increase during the whole period under the ssp126 ssp245 ssp585 scenarios while this trend tends to slow with the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and the passage of time the increasing trend in the near future period of the ssp126 scenario will be the most significant ranging from 149 6 to 253 9 the fall rates of flow will first decrease and then increase over time with the increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the near future period of the ssp126 scenario the fall rate is the highest the average decline rate is 15 1 while in the far future period the average increase rate will reach 29 7 in the middle and far future of the ssp585 scenario the fall rate of flow tends to increase ranging from 0 4 to 23 0 and 14 4 to 59 2 respectively for the number of hydrological reversals the change discipline will be similar to the fall rate of flow generally speaking the rate and frequency of flow alteration of the basin are going to increase in the far future period and the change in rise rate and fall rate of flow will affect the distribution of organic matter in water therefore corresponding measures should be taken to strengthen the water resources management in the source area of the yellow river basin to meet the water demand of the ecological environment of the basin and to ensure the healthy development of the ecosystem it is worth noting that in the far future the number of hydrological reversals of the ssp126 scenario and the ssp585 scenario will increase while that of ssp245 scenario tends to decrease which indicates that the uncertainty of the climate model and emission scenario have a great impact on the prediction results 4 4 6 projection of the overall flow regime alteration based on the calculation method and classification of rva proposed above the hydrological regime alteration degree of 32 parameters with respect to the baseline period is presented in table 4 bayesian average models the results revealed that 31 3 of indexes in all scenarios may alter to a high degree about 15 6 of indexes of each gcm in all scenarios may change to medium and high degrees under the ssp126 scenario the hydrological alteration degree of basin will increase over time with 10 indicators in the near future period 12 indicators in the middle future period and 11 indicators in the far future period changing to a high degree the discharge of february tends to change to a high degree during the middle future period while the high pulse duration was projected to change to a high degree over the middle future and far future periods under the ssp245 scenario the variation discipline of hydrological regime change degree will be similar to that of the ssp126 scenario but the hydrological change degree of each period tends to be higher than that of the ssp126 scenario in all 40 6 of indicators in the near future period and middle future period and 43 7 of indicators in the far future period were detected to change to a high degree moreover the number of low pulses may change to the high degree in the far future period under the ssp585 scenario the hydrological change degree in the period except the near future period will be higher than that in the ssp245 scenario with 50 of indexes tending to change to a high degree during the far future period meanwhile two indexes of high change were detected to be larger than those in the previous two periods overall the hydrological regime alteration of the source area of the yellow river will change at a low degree under the ssp126 scenario and may change to a moderate degree in the middle and far future periods under the ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios the hydrological change degree will gradually increase with time this indicates that the hydrological regime in the syrb will be not positive in the future and the changes in some hydrological indexes may have adverse effects on the ecological environment system of the basin for example the decrease in the monthly discharge will lead to a decrease in the stability of the river flow as well as changes in the habitat and the composition of aquatic organisms according to the paris agreement the long term temperature goal is to hold the global average temperature increase to well below 2 c and pursue efforts to limit this to 1 5 c above pre industrial levels similar to the ssp126 scenarios in the ipcc6 masson delmotte et al 2021 schleussner et al 2016 if the temperature rise can be controlled in accordance with this goal the adverse effects of climate change on the ecosystems in the syrb could be greatly reduced therefore corresponding measures should be taken to strengthen the water resources management in the syrb to satisfy the water demand of the ecological environment of the basin and to ensure the healthy development of the ecosystem 4 4 7 uncertainty analysis although the gcms from cmip6 could provide the basis for the projection of hydrological regimes in the future due to the differences in climate scenarios and their boundary conditions there is still great uncertainty in the results of the future projection for example for the date of the maximum 1 day flow the trend estimated by access cm2 bcc csm2 mr cnrm cm6 1 increased relative to the baseline period while cnrm esm2 1 and mpi esm1 2 lr predicted the opposite downward trend shen et al 2018 and gao et al 2020a found that the uncertainty of the climate model the uncertainty of future scenarios the natural variability within the climate system and the uncertainty that characterizes the climate process are the main sources of uncertainty in climate prediction in order to quantify the contribution of different uncertainty sources the anova method was used to divide the total observed variance into different sources so as to calculate the contribution of each factor to the total variance yang et al 2019 in this study the uncertainty of the climate model and emission scenarios was considered and two way anova two factor was applied to quantify the source of uncertainty of 32 indicators in the iha index system fig 12 the results showed that the main source of uncertainty in predicting hydrological regimes is the climate model with an average contribution rate of about 69 5 followed by the interaction between the emission scenario and climate model with an average contribution rate of about 20 8 simultaneously the contribution of different sources of uncertainty to different indicators varies with the period in the near future the uncertainty of the emission scenario is mainly reflected in winter flow with a contribution range from 13 4 to 22 7 the uncertainty of the climate model is mainly presented in summer flow and annual maximum flow and the uncertainty of interaction is mainly reflected in the fall rate of flow and the duration of low pulse flow in the middle future period the uncertainty of emission scenario will mainly reflect in the fall rate of flow while the uncertain contribution discipline of climate model and interaction will be the same as in the near future period in the far future the influence of emission scenario on the overall uncertainty of the hydrological situation will be relatively weak with an average contribution rate of just 5 7 but the uncertainty attributed to the decline rate of flow tends to be higher than in other periods which is 52 4 specifically the uncertainty of the interaction between the emission scenario and climate model in this period is mainly reflected in the spring flow change and the uncertainty contribution of the climate model is similar to that in the near and middle future periods in summary although the contribution of emission scenario to the overall uncertainty of the hydrological regime of the basin is not obvious its influence on winter flow annual minimum flow and fall rate cannot be ignored moreover the interaction of emission scenario and climate model on hydrological uncertainty is obviously different in the three periods however the uncertain contribution of climate model to the overall hydrological situation is very significant which is most obvious in summer flow and annual maximum flow 5 discussion 5 1 impacts of hydrological alterations on eco hydrology a large number of studies have pointed out that alterations to hydrological regimes are among the leading factors causing changes in river ecosystems poff and zimmerman 2010 summarized 165 articles related to aquatic ecology they were found that 92 of the literature reflected the change of ecosystem caused by the change of flow and the change of hydrological regime would lead to the collective change of ecological index overall the hydrological regime of the syrb will change to a low and moderate degree in the future and some of the characterization indexes of the hydrological regime will alter to a high degree which will seriously affect the stability of the ecosystem of the basin the march and april discharge of each scenario in the basin will fall to a high degree in the future which will directly affect the normal spawning of fish in the river ecosystem qi 2016 revealed that the breeding period of the main fish in the syrb begins from march or april to august and the water temperature demand for normal spawning is 6 10 c therefore the rising temperature and decreasing flow in the future period will be not conducive to normal fish reproduction the annual minimum flow was also projected to change to a high degree with an decrease in intensity and increase in duration which is consistent with the results of xiao 2021 the decrease in annual extreme low flow will reshape the river morphology and natural habitat increase the stress of soil moisture and anoxic environment on plant growth and reproduction and affect the duration of nutrient accumulation in aquatic habitat and fish migration and spawning which has a direct impact on the stability of the ecosystem caruso 2002 gutiérrez fonseca et al 2020 the ecological environment of the syrb is very fragile and the alpine region is highly sensitive to climate change hirschberg et al 2021 consequently the decrease in river discharge will lead to a change in the range of water storage area and the riparian line thus changing the environment of the riparian habitat resulting in the abundance and species of riparian vegetation in addition wetlands and rivers in the source area of the yellow river are the main habitats for birds fish and plateau wildlife this will be difficult to restore if the ecosystem of the basin is destroyed the species will be seriously threatened and the genetic species resources will shrink or even disappear thus the impact of climate change on the future ecosystem of the syrb is very serious and effective measures are urgently needed to protect it 5 2 uncertainties and limitations in this study there are some uncertainties associated with the model simulations on the one hand because the study area is an alpine region the underlying surface of which is mostly frozen soil and snow cover it is difficult to conduct precise simulation of runoff process which is especially reflected in the model simulation of low discharge on the other hand it is precisely because of the particularity of the underlying surface of the study area that the rationality of snow cover and soil moisture in the model simulation needs to be verified however it is very difficult to obtain observed snow cover and soil moisture data due to the poor climatic conditions in syrb which leads to few grounds observation stations even if the vic model fully takes into account the simulation of snow depth and soil moisture its uncertainties are still worth studying in order to verify the simulation ability of vic model for snow depth and soil moisture in syrb the land surface model assimilation data and remote sensing inversion product were used to analyze soil moisture and snow depth in syrb region respectively these data can be downloaded from global land data assimilation system gldas https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets and the long term snow depth dataset of china westdc https data casnw net the data source and processing method were referenced from che et al 2008 and chen 2020 and then compared the simulation results of vic model with gldas and westdc products fig 13 and fig 14 which indicated that the trend of soil moisture and snow depth data provided by gldas and westdc in the syrb was basically consistent with that of vic model simulation data and there was a strong correlation with correlation coefficients of 0 75 and 0 73 respectively therefore the simulation rationality of the vic model of hydrological regime in syrb could be acceptable wu et al 2018 and zhou et al 2020a compared and improved the soil moisture provided by vic model and remote sensing data the results revealed that vic model has the ability to simulate the change of soil moisture zhao et al 2013 applied the vic model to simulate the variation of snow depth in a typical glacier area in china and found that the model showed an acceptable performance this also verifies the rationality of using vic model to simulate the hydrological alterations in syrb besides that due to the difficulty in obtaining daily runoff data only the outlet station of syrb tangnaihai station was selected in this study to verify the simulation accuracy of the model which may not be able to fully explain the simulation ability of vic model for syrb therefore the monthly flow data of jimai station during the historical period 1961 1990 at syrb was collected additional materials fig 15 and then the monthly runoff of it was simulated based on the parameters specified in the previous study for the vic model additional materials fig 16 the results showed that the nse of jimai station during the calibration and validation period were 0 84 and 0 82 respectively and the re index of them were 2 7 and 4 8 respectively thus the results of runoff simulated by vic model at jimai station in syrb have also reached the satisfactory level in fact according to previous studies jin et al 2020 meng et al 2016 wang et al 2022b the runoff simulation capability of vic model in syrb is good which is similar to the conclusion of our study overall in this study various measures were taken to reduce the uncertainty of the simulation process in this study the availability of climate factors is controlled through the selection of global climate models and bias correction so as to reduce the model input uncertainty of runoff process simulation and the vic model considering the simulation of snow and frozen soil was adopted to reduce the uncertainty of the model simulation moreover the bma method was used to collect the simulation results of five gcms which in order to reduce the output uncertainty of the simulation process and finally the anova method was applied to quantify the contribution of different influencing factors to the hydrological regime uncertainty of the syrb basin in terms of influencing factors of runoff the main factor of runoff in syrb basin is still climate factor but the influence of snowmelt and other factors cannot be ignored meng et al 2016 found that evapotranspiration plays an increasingly important role in affecting runoff variation of syrb with climate warming and climate change is the main influencing factor of runoff variation of syrb li et al 2021 compared the contribution of temperature and snow cover to spring runoff variation in syrb and the results indicated that the influence of snow cover on spring runoff in syrb is greater than that of air temperature which is similar to the conclusion in this paper that spring runoff changes significantly compared with other seasons in addition the syrb is located in the transition zone between permafrost and seasonal permafrost so the climate change especially temperature rise has caused serious degradation of regional frozen soil which also has a certain impact on the hydrological regime of the basin qin et al 2017 yang et al 2023 therefore it is a valuable research direction to explore the response of snow cover and frozen soil in syrb under climate change and its influence on regional hydrological regime in the future 6 conclusions in summary based on the five gcms under the ssp126 ssp245 ssp585 scenarios provided by cmip6 the climate models were evaluated for applicability and the downscaled and corrected for deviations the vic model was calibrated and validated then it was applied to project the future runoff changes of the basin and analyzed for its uncertainty finally combined with the iha rva system a framework for assessing the future hydrological regime alteration and its ecological effects was proposed the conclusions are as follows 1 the climate models provided by cmip6 could greatly simulate the future climate change in the syrb the maximum temperature minimum temperature and precipitation will increase in the future in 2015 2100 under the ssp126 ssp245 ssp585 scenarios with respect to the baseline period the maximum temperature will increase for all 3 scenarios with a range of warming between 0 9 and 3 8 c 1 5and 4 3 c 2 6 and 5 6 c respectively and the minimum temperature tends to increase between 0 7 and 3 8 c 1 4 to 4 4 c 2 4 to 5 5 c respectively the precipitation is likely to increase between 14 4 and 18 4 14 7 and 19 7 and 13 1 and 25 3 respectively 2 the vic model performs well in simulating the process of runoff variation in the basin the runoff in the syrb will show a downward trend under the background of climate change in the future by 2015 2100 the runoff in the basin may vary from 44 7 to 13 0 from 48 7 to 2 43 and from 53 7 to 4 0 respectively under the scenario of ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 3 the hydrological regime in the syrb will alter to a moderate degree under the ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios except for a low degree alteration in the ssp126 scenario the spring flow of the basin will decrease significantly in the future and the annual extreme flow may decrease but the frequency of drought events and flood events will tend to increase the plant soil water supply and drought stress in the basin will be obviously affected as well as the river morphology and structure and natural habitat conditions 4 the uncertainty of multiple sources significantly affected the projection of the future hydrological regime the uncertainty of the climate model is the dominant factor followed by the interaction between the emission scenario and climate model with their average contribution of uncertainty at 69 5 and 20 8 respectively the uncertainty due to emission scenario may mainly be reflected in winter flow while the climate model mainly affects summer flow and annual maximum flow and the uncertainty of interaction varies from different periods funding this research has been financially supported by the national key research and development programs of china china 2021yfc3201104

2082,the source region of the yellow river basin syrb is an alpine region sensitive to climate changes as global climate change intensifies it is essential to explore the future hydrological regime alteration and its ecological effects on the basin to provide evidence for water resources management and ecological restoration in the area this study offers a framework for assessing the future multi dimensional hydrological regime alteration and its ecological effects selected from global climate models gcms that performed well in the sixth coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 the vic model was forced by the gcms after downscaling and bias correction then the hydrological regime alteration and potential ecological effects in the region under ssp126 ssp245 ssp585 future scenarios were systematically assessed by the iha rva system and the contribution of different uncertainty sources was quantified through the two way anova the results indicated that 1 the temperature and precipitation will increase in the future under all scenarios while the runoff tends to show a downward trend by 2015 2100 the flow under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios may vary from 44 7 to 13 0 48 7 to 2 43 53 7 to 4 0 respectively when compared to the reference period 1961 1990 2 moderate alterations with rva 33 will be observed in the hydrological regime in the basin under ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios and low alterations with rva 26 7 under the ssp126 scenario the spring discharge of the basin will decrease significantly and the annual extreme flow is projected to decrease but the frequency of drought and flood events will tend to increase 3 there are multiple sources of uncertainty in predicting the future hydrological regime in the syrb the uncertainty due to the climate model is the dominant factor followed by the interaction between emission scenarios and the climate model and the average contribution to uncertainty of them is 69 5 and 20 8 respectively the uncertainty of emission scenarios is mainly reflected in winter flow while the climate model mainly affects the summer flow and annual maximum flow and the uncertainty of interaction between them varies in different periods keywords climate change hydrological regime alteration ecosystem uncertainty the yellow river basin data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction against the backdrop of global warming great changes have taken place in the hydrological regime of rivers lópez ballesteros et al 2020 tonkin et al 2018 especially in alpine regions ernakovich et al 2014 and hotaling et al 2017 pointed out that the three poles of the earth and alpine regions are more sensitive to global warming and global climate change is already having a major impact on polar and alpine ecosystems the hydrological regime is an important part of the integrity of an aquatic ecosystem to a certain extent the hydrological regime of a river determines the biological composition community structure and ecological function of its aquatic ecosystem horne et al 2019 rolls et al 2018 therefore changes in the hydrological regime can not only directly affect the ecosystem but also act indirectly on the ecosystem by changing the environment larsen et al 2021 at the same time the river ecosystem is very sensitive to changes in hydrological regimes so the alteration of the hydrological regime is regarded as the main driving factor of changes in a river s ecological process zeiringer et al 2018 moreover the influence of climate change on hydrological processes is becoming more significant attracting the attention of scholars at home and abroad gao et al 2020b john et al 2021 many researchers have showed that changes in a river s hydrological regime caused by climate change and human activities have a lot of adverse effects on its ecosystem polvi et al 2020 ramachandra et al 2020 for example lázaro et al 2020 investigated the rainfall patterns water retention and water level of the paraguay river over decades and the results indicated that the paraguay wetlands are losing water and experiencing more severe dry seasons than in the past these changes may lead to the loss of biological diversity and ecosystem services which are intrinsically linked to the hydrological regime of rivers liu et al 2020 quantified the impact of climate change on streamflow alterations and found that the hydrological regimes of rivers at all levels would be severely affected by future climate change with fish and macrophytes responding most strongly langhammer and bernsteinová 2020 conducted a comparative analysis of the historical and future hydrological regime of the mid latitude montane basins to assess short term medium term and long term eco hydrological risks with the results revealing that gradual reduction of river sections and aging of riparian habitats will jeopardize species renewal of these ecosystems in recent years climate change caused by the increase in greenhouse gas emissions is recognized globally gampe et al 2021 shen et al 2018 according to the sixth assessment report of the ipcc the global surface temperature has increased by 1 09 c in the last 20 years compared with the 1850 1900 average masson delmotte et al 2021 zhongming et al 2022 in the future the global climate will continue to warm and the probability of extreme events will also be greatly increased malede et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 amid climate change the projection of river hydrological regimes and their ecological effects has also become a keen area of research interest hydrological regimes are generally characterized by specific hydrological indicators and the qualitative or quantitative description of the indicators is an important part of research on ecohydrological processes cervi et al 2018 poff et al 1997 took the lead in using five kinds of indexes magnitude duration occurrence time frequency and change rate to comprehensively explain changes in hydrological regimes with the deepening of the research more than 170 hydrological indicators have been identified to assess hydrological changes and their ecological effects monk et al 2007 olden and poff 2003 among the most widely used index is the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha proposed by richter et al 1996 it has 32 parameters and has become an important basis for the study of ecohydrological processes in order to further quantitatively evaluate the degree of hydrological change and set the range of environmental flow in the natural state richter et al 1997 proposed the range of variability approach rva built on the iha since then researchers have factored in the complex requirements of setting environmental flow targets developing environmental flow assessment systems based on five different types of environmental flow components and 34 parameters environmental flow components efcs mathews and richter 2007 richter et al 1998 revisions by the american nature conservation association resulted in the original 32 iha parameters changing to 33 this increased the number of zero flow days and the base flow index and integrated the original number of rise flow days and the number of fall flow days into the number of reversals gao et al 2009 at present iha rva and efcs have integrated a set of open source software system iha software which is collectively known as the iha system conservancy 2007 based on the iha system a large number of studies have been carried out to evaluate the evolution of river hydrological regimes wang et al 2017 predicted the impact of future climate change on the hydrological regimes of four major rivers in three continents based on the fifth coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 and found that climate change would significantly affect the overall flow regime of the upper yellow river especially under the high emission scenarios song et al 2020 assessed the hydrological regime changes in china based on the iha rva system and the results showed that the hydrological regimes of chinese rivers were moderately changed due to reservoir impoundment which had a significant impact on the ecological environment wang et al 2018 applied the hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning model hbv in combination with three gcms under three representative emission pathways rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 and predicted that climate change would significantly influence the hydrological regime of the upper yellow river basin based on 32 iha indicators these previous studies have mainly focused on hydrological changes caused by human activities and their ecological effects such as dam reservoir construction water transfer and water diversion projects gunawardana et al 2021 huang et al 2019 singh et al 2022 zhou et al 2020b little effort however has been reported for the hydrological changes and ecological effects caused by climate change in addition the climate models have simulation uncertainties due to differences in their internal structures which cannot be ignored in the prediction of hydrological regimes but there are relatively few studies in this area kusangaya et al 2018 the source region of the yellow river basin syrb is an important water conservation area and it is also the lifeline of the economic and social development of the yellow river basin the syrb is located in an alpine area and very sensitive to climate change its unique geographical location and fragile ecological environment mean it is affected more by climate change and less disturbed by human activities xu et al 2021 therefore it is crucial to assess the alteration of the hydrological regime and its ecological effects on the syrb under climate changes in the future a set of global climate models simulating future climate changes was provided by the coupled model intercomparison project cmip which was carried out by the world climate research program wcrp and several well known organizations meehl et al 2020 cmip6 adds many new models based on the cmip5 and establishes a new composite scenario ssp rcp based on the shared socio economic path ssps it includes five basic paths the sustainable development path ssp1 intermediate path ssp2 regional competitive path ssp3 unbalanced path ssp4 and traditional fossil fuel based path ssp5 these five paths combine seven emission scenarios rcp1 9 rcp2 6 rcp3 4 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 rcp7 0 rcp8 5 into 35 combination scenarios séférian et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 based on this the objectives of this study are 1 to propose a comprehensive assessment and uncertainty quantification framework for the eco hydrological regime of the river under future climate change 2 to reveal the evolution of eco hydrological regimes alteration in the syrb in the next century under climate change 3 to quantitatively analyze the impact of multi source uncertainty on the projection of eco hydrological regimes 2 study area and data description 2 1 study area the syrb is situated in the northeast of the qinghai xizang plateau at 95 50 to 103 28 e 32 12 to 36 48 n the elevation of the basin is 2706 6248 m and the area is mainly a semi humid and semi arid continental monsoon climate the basin is obviously affected by the southwest monsoon the annual precipitation is 250 750 mm and the seasonal distribution is very uneven the precipitation in july september can account for 70 90 of the year s total and the annual evaporation is 800 1200 mm the basin covers 12 2 104 km2 and its outlet is the tangnaihai hydrological section the annual average runoff 1950 2020 is 2 04 1011 m3 which accounts for a third of the annual runoff in the yellow river basin so is an important water producing and conservation area for the basin bao et al 2019 the water network in the source area has many tributaries as well as snow cover glaciers grasslands and lakes the area also has a large area of permafrost and seasonally frozen soil omer et al 2020 the alpine geomorphological landscape and special climate environment of the area give it a unique hydrological regime this regime is the most important source of water resources in the upper reaches of the yellow river and directly affects the safety of water in the middle and lower reaches of the waterway wang et al 2020b in addition the region is home to national key ecological function areas such as the sanjiangyuan grassland meadow wetland ecological function area and the zoige grassland wetland ecological function area they contribute to a water conservation system that is extremely important for the country as a whole the water system of the syrb is shown in fig 1 2 2 data the historical meteorological data used in this paper is the cn05 1 grid data set derived from the china meteorological center it consists of the precipitation average temperature maximum temperature minimum temperature from 1961 to 2018 on a daily scale with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 the data have good applicability in portraying the climate characteristics in china guan et al 2020 the historical runoff data is the daily runoff of tangnaihai station during 1961 2018 which was obtained from the hydrological yearbook and the future meteorological data over 1961 2100 was obtained from the five gcms provided by cmip6 https pcmdi llnl gov cmip6 which was evaluated and selected from 19 gcms in our previous studies wang et al 2021 the attributes of five gcms is shown in table 1 in this study three scenarios were chosen ssp1 rcp2 6 ssp126 ssp2 rcp4 5 ssp245 and ssp5 rcp8 5 ssp585 the radiative forcing of the ssp126 ssp245 spp585 scenarios are 2 6 w m2 4 5 w m2 8 5 w m2 which were subjective to the low middle high radiation emission scenarios and social vulnerability respectively the vegetation data adopted in this study were collected from the global 1 km vegetation database of the university of maryland https glad umd edu dataset and the soil use and texture types data were collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa https www noaa gov infrastructure law infrastructure law climate data and services soil moisture and snowpack pilot program 3 methodology in this research a framework for assessing future hydrological regime alteration and its ecological effects was proposed fig 2 the main body of the framework included 1 evaluation of the performance of gcms from cmip6 the gcms with better performance were downscaled and deviation corrected 2 simulation and prediction of future meteorological and hydrological characteristics 3 assessment of hydrological alteration and quantifying the uncertainty of it under different emission scenarios 3 1 data downscaling and bias correction due to the inconsistent resolution of gcms provided by cmip6 the resolution of gcms was unified in this study to 0 5 0 5 by a bilinear interpolation method zhou et al 2017 the climatic element is an important driving variable of hydrological simulation although it simulated by gcms makes up for the shortage of meteorological stations in the alpine mountains however there are great deviation between the simulation and the observed data because of the different prediction process such as the total amount and frequency of precipitation output by the gcms so it is necessary to process the simulated data by deviation correction method horvat 2021 the daily basis correction dbc method is a distribution based bias correction method that is widely used to correct the systematic deviation of output data from gcms yin et al 2021 the local intensity scaling loci method is a deviation correction method based on mean value which can correct the precipitation probability and average precipitation of gcms at the same time yin et al 2020 using the observed data from 1961 to 1990 the study combined the loci and dbc methods to correct the frequency and magnitude of daily precipitation series of five gcms under the ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios during 2015 2100 3 2 runoff stimulating in this research the future runoff was simulated and predicted by the variable infiltration capacity vic model which is a large scale land surface model based on spatial distribution gridding it simulates the process of energy and water transfer between the atmosphere vegetation and soil based on the characteristics of area gridding and it has been widely used in various aspects such as runoff simulation and explores the influence of climate change on water resources nijssen et al 1997 the confluence model adopted in vic model is the grid confluence model which is mainly used to calculate the process of the runoff in each grid reaching the outlet section of the basin through the concentration of the over land flow and the river network seven parameters need to be calibrated according to the observed runoff data in the vic model the parameter b describes the shape of the soil water storage capacity curve dsmax is the maximum velocity of baseflow ds is the fraction of dsmax where non linear baseflow begins ws is the fraction of maximum soil moisture where non linear baseflow occurs and d1 d2 d3 is the thickness of first second and the third soil moisture layer respectively liang et al 1996 according to previous research jin et al 2020 the historical runoff of tangnaihai station changed suddenly in 1990 which means the runoff before 1990 was less affected by human activities therefore 1961 1990 was chosen as the baseline period 1961 as the preheating period 1961 1981 as the calibration period and 1982 1990 as the verification period the parameters were calibrated by the sce ua optimization algorithm combined with the observed meteorological data shu et al 2021 the nash efficiency coefficient ns and relative error re were selected to appraise the applicability of the climate model the formulas are as follows 1 n s q i o q o 2 q i s q i o 2 q i o q o 2 2 re q s q o q o 100 where q i s and q i o are the simulated and observed daily runoff and q s q o are the long series mean value of simulated and observed runoff respectively a perfect simulation would be the one with a centered re equal to 0 and both ns to 1 based on the vic model and confluence model the basin was divided into 74 grids with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 the precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature data of five gcms on a daily scale under three scenarios were inserted into each grid by the bilinear interpolation method which was used as meteorological driving data of the vic model then the vic model was forced by meteorological data vegetation soil data and optimized parameters and the evaporation and runoff in the basin were calculated according to the grid order finally the results were connected to the confluence model and the daily runoff process under different scenarios in the future at the tangnaihai station was simulated 3 3 evaluation of ecological flow regime in this study the indicators of hydrological alteration iha method was adopted to evaluate the change in the river s hydrological regime the hydrological regime and its ecological effects were assessed from five dimensions magnitude of monthly water conditions magnitude and duration of annual extreme water conditions timing of annual extreme water conditions frequency and duration of high and low pulses and the rate and frequency of water condition changes yang et al 2017 the index of zero flow days was not considered in this research because there was no outage in the syrb during the historical period the following 32 hydrological change indexes were selected in this paper table 2 for the sudden change of hydrological conditions at the tangnaihai station in 1990 the iha index under the ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios in the near future 2040 2059 middle future 2060 2079 and the far future period 2080 2099 was calculated with 1961 1990 as the baseline period among the 32 hydrological indexes the absolute change analysis was applied on the date of the maximum and minimum flow the duration and frequency of high and low pulse flow the relative change analysis was used for the other indexes in order to quantify the change degree of hydrological indexes in the relative reference period and then determine the restoration goal of river management according to the rva method created by richter et al 1998 75 and 25 of the occurrence frequency of each index before interference were taken as the variation ranges to meet the ecological needs of rivers the relative change rates and future hydrological regime alteration of the above 45 combinations 5 models 3 scenarios 3 periods were comprehensively analyzed the method for calculating the change degree of the rva is as follows 3 d i n i n io n io 100 where d i is the hydrological alteration degree of the i th index n i is the number of the observation years of i th index actually falling within the threshold n io is the number of the observation years of i th index expected to fall within the threshold among them the hydrological alteration degree is low at 0 33 more than 33 but not more than 67 in medium alteration and more than 67 in high alteration richter et al 1997 3 4 uncertainty evaluation method although hydrological projection based on the land air coupling is a hot research topic at present there are many uncertainties in predicting future hydrological regimes through the coupling of the global climate models and hydrological models the simulation uncertainty sources of the water circulation system model are mostly the model input data model structures model parameters and methods used to calibrate data shu et al 2021 bayesian model averaging bma is a method to obtain reliable composite forecast result by weighting the forecast values of different models it can be used not only for model combination but also for calculating the uncertainty of individual models and model combinations lotfirad et al 2022 shu et al 2022 therefore the bayesian model averaging bma method was applied to account for uncertainty in projecting the future precipitation temperature and streamflow the analysis of variance anova method two factors was used to account for the uncertainty contribution of climate models and emission scenarios aryal et al 2019 the total sum of squares sst was calculated by 4 sst s s ssp s s gcm s s ssp g c m where s s ssp s s gcm and s s ssp g c m is the partitioned squares of the emission scenario climate model and interaction between them respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 future climate change 4 1 1 downscaling and deviation corrected of gcms the main driving factors affecting the hydrological regime of rivers are precipitation and temperature based on the observed data of precipitation maximum and minimum temperature the original product data of gcms and the corrected gcms data the standard deviation std mean value mean percentage of relative deviation re root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient cor of the data series were selected to assess the metrological simulation ability of gcms on the basin table 3 the simulation ability of precipitation and temperature of the basin in the corrected gcms has been significantly improved for precipitation the percentage of relative deviation between the original gcms products the corrected series and the observed precipitation series are 106 and 1 08 respectively the original gcm products greatly overestimated the annual average precipitation and daily precipitation in the syrb for the maximum and the minimum temperature the raw data of gcms underestimated the historical temperature which is more obvious in the simulation of the maximum temperature after deviation correction the gcms offered good performance in simulating the temperature variation characteristics of the basin and the deviation of annual average maximum and minimum temperature between simulation and observation is close to 0 the correlation has also been significantly improved the spatial characteristics of precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures in the historical period simulated by the downscaling gcms and the observed data of syrb was presented in fig 3 the results indicated that the performance of downscaling gcms to reproduce the climatic variation characteristics of the syrb is good for precipitation the downscaling gcms cannot only simulate the spatial distribution characteristics of syrb precipitation decreasing gradually from southeast to northwest fig 3 b but also the relative deviation percentage of simulated precipitation relative to observation ranges from 1 53 to 0 29 which is very close to the observed precipitation for temperature the spatial deviation of the maximum and minimum temperature between observation and downscaling gcms in syrb is only 0 01 c to 0 05 c therefore the meteorological data simulated by gcms after deviation correction could be applied to predict the future climate change of the basin ding et al 2022 and wang et al 2022a projected precipitation changes in the yellow river basin based on cmip6 and found that gcms from cmip6 had good performances in simulating precipitation in the basin which was consistent with our results 4 2 projection and uncertainty of future climate change the changes in annual average precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature projected by bayesian average models with respect to the baseline 1961 1990 under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios are presented in fig 4 the precipitation and temperature in the syrb will increase in the future compared with the baseline period the maximum temperature will increase at 1 3 c 10a 3 3 c 10a and 6 7 c 10a respectively under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios during 2015 2100 fig 4a moreover the maximum temperature tends to increase between 0 9 c and 3 8 c 1 5 c and 4 3 c 2 6 c and5 6 c in 2015 2100 under low medium and high emission scenarios the minimum temperature is going to increase at the rate of 1 2 c 10a 3 0 c 10a and 6 4 c 10a respectively under the ssp126 ssp245 ssp585 scenarios fig 4b and will increase for all three scenarios with a range of warming between 0 7 c and 3 8 c 1 4 c and 4 4 c 2 4 c and 5 5 c according to the clausius clapeyron relation liu et al 2019 the temperature rise will lead to an increase of evaporation which in turn will accelerate the process of the water cycle therefore an increasing trend was also detected in the precipitation of the syrb fig 4c with the rate of 0 7 mm 10a 0 8 mm 10a and 0 18 mm 10a under ssp126 ssp245 ssp585 respectively besides that it was projected to increase with an extent between 14 4 and18 4 14 7 and 19 7 13 1 and 25 3 under three scenarios respectively sun et al 2022 and lu et al 2018 indicated that the long term correlation characteristics of the temperature series in the syrb are persistent that is the trend of the overall temperature rise in the past indicates that it will continue to the future nevertheless the precipitation in the basin tends to present increasing trends but the intensity of it will not be great which corresponds with the results of this study 4 3 response to climate change on streamflow 4 3 1 calibration and validation of the hydrological model the vic model was calibrated from 1962 to 1981 and validated from 1982 to 1990 fig 5 is the observed runoff process and the process simulated by the vic model at tangnaihai station the model performance for runoff simulation in gauged basins was evaluated by the ns and re indexes the four intervals of evaluation were n s 0 9 0 9 n s 0 7 0 7 n s 0 5 and n s 0 5 meaning excellent satisfactory unsatisfactory and failed results respectively the nash efficiency coefficients of the calibration and verification periods are 0 84 and 0 87 respectively indicating that the simulation effect is satisfactory at the same time the re index of the calibration and the verification period are 1 72 and 0 41 respectively which are all less than 20 indicating that the simulation results are very close to the observation thus the model performance on a daily scale could be classified as satisfactory based on the evaluated criteria proposed by moriasi et al 2007 and kalin et al 2010 actually in addition to nse and re indicators reached a satisfactory level the absolute error of simulated runoff of vic model in the calibration and validation periods with observed runoff is only 0 03 mm d and 0 05 mm d and the logarithmic nash efficiency coefficients of vic model simulated runoff in syrb during the calibration period and verification period are 0 61 and 0 59 pushpalatha et al 2012 although they are not as satisfactory as high flow previous studies have shown that it is difficult to accurately simulate low flow arnoux et al 2021 merz et al 2011 and the syrb is an alpine region with complex underlying surface conditions the simulation of low flow in this region is more complex overall our results are generally acceptable when considering the previous research results so the vic model with six calibrated parameters could be applied to forecasting the future discharge process in the syrb 4 3 2 projection changes on future streamflow the annual flow variation of the basin in 2015 2100 with respect to baseline 1961 1990 under the scenario of ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 is shown in fig 6 bayesian average models the results indicate that the runoff of the basin will show a downward trend in the future as greenhouse gas emissions rise the runoff was projected to decrease at the rates of 0 06 a under ssp126 scenarios 0 16 a under ssp245 scenarios and 0 21 a under ssp585 scenarios the discharge in the syrb may vary from 44 7 to 13 0 48 7 to 2 43 and 53 7 to 4 0 during 2015 2100 in the view of the time scale the changes will be partly significant in the far future under ssp585 scenarios under the ssp126 scenario the annual flow tends to vary from 42 7 to 12 9 49 0 to13 2 and 45 3 to 8 6 in the near 2040 2059 middle 2060 2079 and far future periods 2080 2099 under the ssp245 scenario the annual flow varies from 48 1 to 4 0 52 3 to 2 0 and 52 5 to 0 19 in the near middle and far future periods with respect to baseline periods respectively under the ssp585 scenario the annual flow of the syrb tends to vary from 54 6 to 11 6 56 3 to 6 5 and 59 8 to 22 8 in the near middle and far future periods respectively in general the flow in the syrb is likely to decrease gradually with temperature rise although the precipitation in the basin will increase in the future the gradually rising temperature will accelerate the basin water cycle and the evaporation and dispersion of the basin will also greatly increase which will lead to a decreasing trend of basin discharge the decreasing trends of streamflow were also reported by other researchers wang et al 2020a summarized the papers on runoff variation and prediction in the syrb published in the past 20 years 1980 2020 and found that the runoff in the basin generally shows a downward trend in recent decades and is characterised by alternating wet and dry periods at the same time the annual distribution of runoff is uneven and the runoff in the syrb will still decrease for a certain period in the future 4 4 ecological alteration and risk under climate change 4 4 1 alteration of monthly streamflow the changes in the monthly flow relative to the baseline period for future periods 2040 2099 are shown in fig 7 under the ssp126 scenario almost all monthly flow completely corresponds with the declining trend with the exception of december the flow of march will have the most significant decline of 41 1 in the near future 42 5 in the middle future and 39 9 in the far future while it in december is likely to increase by 11 2 and 6 2 in the near and middle future periods under the ssp245 scenario the variation discipline of monthly flow will be like the ssp126 scenario with all the monthly flows except december showing a downward trend ranging from 4 6 to 43 7 while in december it is likely to increase by 2 8 in the near future the outliers of the pattern are ignored all monthly flows tend to decline almost throughout all periods under the ssp585 scenario ranging from 8 24 to 44 3 overall the monthly flow in each scenario showed a decreasing trend among which the monthly flow in march and april is the most significant however it is going to increase in december in the near future precipitation in the syrb will not increase significantly in the future but the evaporation of the source region will increase as temperatures rise which will lead to a decrease in runoff in the basin yang et al 2012 and yang et al 2020 showed that the runoff in the syrb will decrease in the future and the annual distribution of runoff will change greatly due to climate change underlying surface change and other complex factors in addition the underlying surface of the source area of the basin is very complex with a large area of frozen soil layer and snow rising temperatures in the future will lead to an increase in snowmelt in winter so the flow in december will show an increasing state and the downward trend of flow in january and february tend to be lower than that in other months yang et al 2018 at the same time due to the early snowmelt the snow cover and melt will decrease in earlier months which will lead to a decrease in discharge in march and april li et al 2021 in addition all scenarios occurred with anomalies of increased flow in may and june ranging from 7 3 to 81 3 therefore the prediction results have great uncertainty due to the global climate models wang et al 2018 selected 1971 2000 as the baseline period the runoff changes in the future period of the syrb were predicted based on four cmip5 models and hbv models it was found that the discharge in the future flood season in the source region might show an increasing trend which further explained the influence of the difference of the baseline period the uncertainty of the hydrological model and global climate model on the research results therefore further research and in depth discussion are needed on the projection of hydrological situation in the syrb in the future 4 4 2 alteration of magnitude of annual extreme streamflow the changes in annual extreme flow relative to the reference period are illustrated in fig 8 the results indicate that under the ssp126 scenario the annual minimum 1 day flow may decrease most significantly by 34 4 36 8 and 54 2 in the near future middle future and far future meanwhile the maximum annual 30 day flow had the most significant decrease in the annual maximum extreme flow group which is likely to decrease by 21 8 24 8 and 21 4 respectively the variation discipline of annual maximum and minimum extreme flow under the ssp245 scenario was projected to be the same as that under the ssp126 scenario and their decline rate will increase over time in addition the average decline rate of all indexes tends to be higher than that of the ssp126 scenario except for the annual maximum flow in the far future it will range from 3 6 to 57 7 ignoring the maximum 1 day flow predicted by the cnrm esm2 1 will increase by 2 96 in the near future under the ssp585 scenario the variation law of the annual minimum extreme flow is the same as that of the ssp126 ssp245 scenarios and the average decline rate over all periods will be higher than that of them in contrast the decline rate of the annual maximum flow under the ssp585 scenario will be lower than that of the ssp245 scenario but it will still be higher than that of the ssp126 scenario this is because the flow in the middle and future period of the ssp585 scenario will be slightly higher than that of the ssp245 period and the decline rate of the two with respect to the baseline period is 0 14 and 0 23 respectively in fact except for the increase in the change rate of the maximum annual extreme flow predicted by the esm2 model almost all models agree that the annual extreme flow will decrease in the future in the syrb the annual minimum flow is closely related to the annual flow especially in cold regions so the minimum annual extreme flow in the syrb will be easily influenced by the decreased flow in the future assani et al 2006 zhang et al 2018 cui et al 2018 reported that the annual extreme flow on different scales of the syrb showed a decreasing trend in varying degrees and the change rate of the annual maximum extreme flow was larger than that of the minimum extreme flow which is consistent with the conclusion of this study 4 4 3 alteration of the date of minimum and maximum flow fig 9 shows the change in the date of the annual maximum and minimum1 day flow with respect to the baseline period the results reflect that the date of the annual minimum 1 day flow will be significantly shift backward that of the baseline period while the date of the annual maximum 1 day flow is uncertain for the date of the annual minimum 1 day flow the lagging trend of the ssp245 ssp585 scenarios in the middle and future period will be the most significant with a lag time of 82 3 days and 80 days with respect to the baseline period respectively specifically the near future period of the ssp126 scenario is likely to delay the most compared with the other two periods ranging from 70 5d 82d in the view of the date of the 1 day maximum flow except for the middle future periods of the ssp126 scenario it of the other scenarios and their corresponding periods is going to postpone when compared with the baseline period among them the backward trend of 11 days under the ssp245 scenario is the most significant in the middle future period followed by the 10 9 days of the far future period of the ssp585 scenario practically the date of annual extreme flow is an important signal in the biological rhythms of fish and its change will significantly impact fish spawning and habitat furthermore the advance or postponement of extreme flow may lead to the failure of aquatic reproduction and the increase in mortality the most direct manifestation is fish migration and spawning fenkes et al 2016 and other scholars anil et al 2019 hwan and carlson 2016 believe that one of the signals of fish breeding is rising water that is the time when the maximum flow occurs therefore it is particularly necessary to carry out reservoir ecological operations in time during the fish spawning period to ensure the spawning process the study found that the date of maximum 1 day flow in the future period of the syrb is uncertain for example in the near future period of the ssp126 scenario the prediction of the date of the 1 day maximum flow by the access cm2 bcc csm2 mr and cnrm cm6 1 models will delay while the prediction results of the cnrm esm2 1 and mpi esm1 2 lr models are completely opposite thus the uncertainty of climate models will be transmitted with the hydrological simulation process and the trend of single model prediction may be different from that of multi model set average which indicates that a method needs to be considered to obtain the best prediction in climate change impact research 4 4 4 alteration of frequency and duration of high and low pulses the variation of the number and duration of the high and low flow pulses relative to the reference period is shown infig 10 under the ssp126 scenario the duration of high and low pulses flow tends to show a downward trend in each period the decreasing range of the low pulse duration is 1 25d 8d while the decline range of the high flow pulses is 10 5d to 13 5d at the same time the number of high and low pulses flow may increase with respect to the baseline period and high flow pulses may be relatively higher increasing by 5 1 days in the middle future period the same law of change also appears in the ssp245 ssp585 scenarios with the increase in greenhouse gas emissions the duration of low pulses decreases more violently compared with the reference period while the number of low pulse flows increases gradually in the far future of the ssp585 scenario the number of low pulses flow may increase by 4 6 days relative to the baseline period but its duration is likely to decrease by 6 75 days in addition with the increase in greenhouse gas emissions the increase rate of high pulses gradually slows and its maximum value may appear in the middle future period of ssp126 meanwhile the duration of high pulses may decrease more sharply under the ssp245 scenario followed by the ssp585 scenario which ranges from 10 75d to 13 75d and 10 5d to 13 75d respectively notably the high and low pulses are generally regarded as flood and drought events so the frequency of drought events and flood events in the syrb may increase in the future but the duration of them may decrease the frequency of drought and flood events will affect the frequency of soil moisture and hypoxia and their intensity and duration will increase the stress of plant water demand and the demand of aquatic organisms for habitat moreover poff et al 1997 found that the continuous emergence of high flow pulse conveys fine particles of sediment maintains the high fecundity of benthos and provides a spawning place for fish thus the decrease in the duration of high pulses in the syrb in the future may affect the reproduction of benthos by affecting the stability of the river basement 4 4 5 alteration of streamflow variability fig 11 shows the alteration of the rise rates fall rates and the number of hydrological reversals of annual flow from the point of the rise rates of flow it was projected to increase during the whole period under the ssp126 ssp245 ssp585 scenarios while this trend tends to slow with the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and the passage of time the increasing trend in the near future period of the ssp126 scenario will be the most significant ranging from 149 6 to 253 9 the fall rates of flow will first decrease and then increase over time with the increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the near future period of the ssp126 scenario the fall rate is the highest the average decline rate is 15 1 while in the far future period the average increase rate will reach 29 7 in the middle and far future of the ssp585 scenario the fall rate of flow tends to increase ranging from 0 4 to 23 0 and 14 4 to 59 2 respectively for the number of hydrological reversals the change discipline will be similar to the fall rate of flow generally speaking the rate and frequency of flow alteration of the basin are going to increase in the far future period and the change in rise rate and fall rate of flow will affect the distribution of organic matter in water therefore corresponding measures should be taken to strengthen the water resources management in the source area of the yellow river basin to meet the water demand of the ecological environment of the basin and to ensure the healthy development of the ecosystem it is worth noting that in the far future the number of hydrological reversals of the ssp126 scenario and the ssp585 scenario will increase while that of ssp245 scenario tends to decrease which indicates that the uncertainty of the climate model and emission scenario have a great impact on the prediction results 4 4 6 projection of the overall flow regime alteration based on the calculation method and classification of rva proposed above the hydrological regime alteration degree of 32 parameters with respect to the baseline period is presented in table 4 bayesian average models the results revealed that 31 3 of indexes in all scenarios may alter to a high degree about 15 6 of indexes of each gcm in all scenarios may change to medium and high degrees under the ssp126 scenario the hydrological alteration degree of basin will increase over time with 10 indicators in the near future period 12 indicators in the middle future period and 11 indicators in the far future period changing to a high degree the discharge of february tends to change to a high degree during the middle future period while the high pulse duration was projected to change to a high degree over the middle future and far future periods under the ssp245 scenario the variation discipline of hydrological regime change degree will be similar to that of the ssp126 scenario but the hydrological change degree of each period tends to be higher than that of the ssp126 scenario in all 40 6 of indicators in the near future period and middle future period and 43 7 of indicators in the far future period were detected to change to a high degree moreover the number of low pulses may change to the high degree in the far future period under the ssp585 scenario the hydrological change degree in the period except the near future period will be higher than that in the ssp245 scenario with 50 of indexes tending to change to a high degree during the far future period meanwhile two indexes of high change were detected to be larger than those in the previous two periods overall the hydrological regime alteration of the source area of the yellow river will change at a low degree under the ssp126 scenario and may change to a moderate degree in the middle and far future periods under the ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios the hydrological change degree will gradually increase with time this indicates that the hydrological regime in the syrb will be not positive in the future and the changes in some hydrological indexes may have adverse effects on the ecological environment system of the basin for example the decrease in the monthly discharge will lead to a decrease in the stability of the river flow as well as changes in the habitat and the composition of aquatic organisms according to the paris agreement the long term temperature goal is to hold the global average temperature increase to well below 2 c and pursue efforts to limit this to 1 5 c above pre industrial levels similar to the ssp126 scenarios in the ipcc6 masson delmotte et al 2021 schleussner et al 2016 if the temperature rise can be controlled in accordance with this goal the adverse effects of climate change on the ecosystems in the syrb could be greatly reduced therefore corresponding measures should be taken to strengthen the water resources management in the syrb to satisfy the water demand of the ecological environment of the basin and to ensure the healthy development of the ecosystem 4 4 7 uncertainty analysis although the gcms from cmip6 could provide the basis for the projection of hydrological regimes in the future due to the differences in climate scenarios and their boundary conditions there is still great uncertainty in the results of the future projection for example for the date of the maximum 1 day flow the trend estimated by access cm2 bcc csm2 mr cnrm cm6 1 increased relative to the baseline period while cnrm esm2 1 and mpi esm1 2 lr predicted the opposite downward trend shen et al 2018 and gao et al 2020a found that the uncertainty of the climate model the uncertainty of future scenarios the natural variability within the climate system and the uncertainty that characterizes the climate process are the main sources of uncertainty in climate prediction in order to quantify the contribution of different uncertainty sources the anova method was used to divide the total observed variance into different sources so as to calculate the contribution of each factor to the total variance yang et al 2019 in this study the uncertainty of the climate model and emission scenarios was considered and two way anova two factor was applied to quantify the source of uncertainty of 32 indicators in the iha index system fig 12 the results showed that the main source of uncertainty in predicting hydrological regimes is the climate model with an average contribution rate of about 69 5 followed by the interaction between the emission scenario and climate model with an average contribution rate of about 20 8 simultaneously the contribution of different sources of uncertainty to different indicators varies with the period in the near future the uncertainty of the emission scenario is mainly reflected in winter flow with a contribution range from 13 4 to 22 7 the uncertainty of the climate model is mainly presented in summer flow and annual maximum flow and the uncertainty of interaction is mainly reflected in the fall rate of flow and the duration of low pulse flow in the middle future period the uncertainty of emission scenario will mainly reflect in the fall rate of flow while the uncertain contribution discipline of climate model and interaction will be the same as in the near future period in the far future the influence of emission scenario on the overall uncertainty of the hydrological situation will be relatively weak with an average contribution rate of just 5 7 but the uncertainty attributed to the decline rate of flow tends to be higher than in other periods which is 52 4 specifically the uncertainty of the interaction between the emission scenario and climate model in this period is mainly reflected in the spring flow change and the uncertainty contribution of the climate model is similar to that in the near and middle future periods in summary although the contribution of emission scenario to the overall uncertainty of the hydrological regime of the basin is not obvious its influence on winter flow annual minimum flow and fall rate cannot be ignored moreover the interaction of emission scenario and climate model on hydrological uncertainty is obviously different in the three periods however the uncertain contribution of climate model to the overall hydrological situation is very significant which is most obvious in summer flow and annual maximum flow 5 discussion 5 1 impacts of hydrological alterations on eco hydrology a large number of studies have pointed out that alterations to hydrological regimes are among the leading factors causing changes in river ecosystems poff and zimmerman 2010 summarized 165 articles related to aquatic ecology they were found that 92 of the literature reflected the change of ecosystem caused by the change of flow and the change of hydrological regime would lead to the collective change of ecological index overall the hydrological regime of the syrb will change to a low and moderate degree in the future and some of the characterization indexes of the hydrological regime will alter to a high degree which will seriously affect the stability of the ecosystem of the basin the march and april discharge of each scenario in the basin will fall to a high degree in the future which will directly affect the normal spawning of fish in the river ecosystem qi 2016 revealed that the breeding period of the main fish in the syrb begins from march or april to august and the water temperature demand for normal spawning is 6 10 c therefore the rising temperature and decreasing flow in the future period will be not conducive to normal fish reproduction the annual minimum flow was also projected to change to a high degree with an decrease in intensity and increase in duration which is consistent with the results of xiao 2021 the decrease in annual extreme low flow will reshape the river morphology and natural habitat increase the stress of soil moisture and anoxic environment on plant growth and reproduction and affect the duration of nutrient accumulation in aquatic habitat and fish migration and spawning which has a direct impact on the stability of the ecosystem caruso 2002 gutiérrez fonseca et al 2020 the ecological environment of the syrb is very fragile and the alpine region is highly sensitive to climate change hirschberg et al 2021 consequently the decrease in river discharge will lead to a change in the range of water storage area and the riparian line thus changing the environment of the riparian habitat resulting in the abundance and species of riparian vegetation in addition wetlands and rivers in the source area of the yellow river are the main habitats for birds fish and plateau wildlife this will be difficult to restore if the ecosystem of the basin is destroyed the species will be seriously threatened and the genetic species resources will shrink or even disappear thus the impact of climate change on the future ecosystem of the syrb is very serious and effective measures are urgently needed to protect it 5 2 uncertainties and limitations in this study there are some uncertainties associated with the model simulations on the one hand because the study area is an alpine region the underlying surface of which is mostly frozen soil and snow cover it is difficult to conduct precise simulation of runoff process which is especially reflected in the model simulation of low discharge on the other hand it is precisely because of the particularity of the underlying surface of the study area that the rationality of snow cover and soil moisture in the model simulation needs to be verified however it is very difficult to obtain observed snow cover and soil moisture data due to the poor climatic conditions in syrb which leads to few grounds observation stations even if the vic model fully takes into account the simulation of snow depth and soil moisture its uncertainties are still worth studying in order to verify the simulation ability of vic model for snow depth and soil moisture in syrb the land surface model assimilation data and remote sensing inversion product were used to analyze soil moisture and snow depth in syrb region respectively these data can be downloaded from global land data assimilation system gldas https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets and the long term snow depth dataset of china westdc https data casnw net the data source and processing method were referenced from che et al 2008 and chen 2020 and then compared the simulation results of vic model with gldas and westdc products fig 13 and fig 14 which indicated that the trend of soil moisture and snow depth data provided by gldas and westdc in the syrb was basically consistent with that of vic model simulation data and there was a strong correlation with correlation coefficients of 0 75 and 0 73 respectively therefore the simulation rationality of the vic model of hydrological regime in syrb could be acceptable wu et al 2018 and zhou et al 2020a compared and improved the soil moisture provided by vic model and remote sensing data the results revealed that vic model has the ability to simulate the change of soil moisture zhao et al 2013 applied the vic model to simulate the variation of snow depth in a typical glacier area in china and found that the model showed an acceptable performance this also verifies the rationality of using vic model to simulate the hydrological alterations in syrb besides that due to the difficulty in obtaining daily runoff data only the outlet station of syrb tangnaihai station was selected in this study to verify the simulation accuracy of the model which may not be able to fully explain the simulation ability of vic model for syrb therefore the monthly flow data of jimai station during the historical period 1961 1990 at syrb was collected additional materials fig 15 and then the monthly runoff of it was simulated based on the parameters specified in the previous study for the vic model additional materials fig 16 the results showed that the nse of jimai station during the calibration and validation period were 0 84 and 0 82 respectively and the re index of them were 2 7 and 4 8 respectively thus the results of runoff simulated by vic model at jimai station in syrb have also reached the satisfactory level in fact according to previous studies jin et al 2020 meng et al 2016 wang et al 2022b the runoff simulation capability of vic model in syrb is good which is similar to the conclusion of our study overall in this study various measures were taken to reduce the uncertainty of the simulation process in this study the availability of climate factors is controlled through the selection of global climate models and bias correction so as to reduce the model input uncertainty of runoff process simulation and the vic model considering the simulation of snow and frozen soil was adopted to reduce the uncertainty of the model simulation moreover the bma method was used to collect the simulation results of five gcms which in order to reduce the output uncertainty of the simulation process and finally the anova method was applied to quantify the contribution of different influencing factors to the hydrological regime uncertainty of the syrb basin in terms of influencing factors of runoff the main factor of runoff in syrb basin is still climate factor but the influence of snowmelt and other factors cannot be ignored meng et al 2016 found that evapotranspiration plays an increasingly important role in affecting runoff variation of syrb with climate warming and climate change is the main influencing factor of runoff variation of syrb li et al 2021 compared the contribution of temperature and snow cover to spring runoff variation in syrb and the results indicated that the influence of snow cover on spring runoff in syrb is greater than that of air temperature which is similar to the conclusion in this paper that spring runoff changes significantly compared with other seasons in addition the syrb is located in the transition zone between permafrost and seasonal permafrost so the climate change especially temperature rise has caused serious degradation of regional frozen soil which also has a certain impact on the hydrological regime of the basin qin et al 2017 yang et al 2023 therefore it is a valuable research direction to explore the response of snow cover and frozen soil in syrb under climate change and its influence on regional hydrological regime in the future 6 conclusions in summary based on the five gcms under the ssp126 ssp245 ssp585 scenarios provided by cmip6 the climate models were evaluated for applicability and the downscaled and corrected for deviations the vic model was calibrated and validated then it was applied to project the future runoff changes of the basin and analyzed for its uncertainty finally combined with the iha rva system a framework for assessing the future hydrological regime alteration and its ecological effects was proposed the conclusions are as follows 1 the climate models provided by cmip6 could greatly simulate the future climate change in the syrb the maximum temperature minimum temperature and precipitation will increase in the future in 2015 2100 under the ssp126 ssp245 ssp585 scenarios with respect to the baseline period the maximum temperature will increase for all 3 scenarios with a range of warming between 0 9 and 3 8 c 1 5and 4 3 c 2 6 and 5 6 c respectively and the minimum temperature tends to increase between 0 7 and 3 8 c 1 4 to 4 4 c 2 4 to 5 5 c respectively the precipitation is likely to increase between 14 4 and 18 4 14 7 and 19 7 and 13 1 and 25 3 respectively 2 the vic model performs well in simulating the process of runoff variation in the basin the runoff in the syrb will show a downward trend under the background of climate change in the future by 2015 2100 the runoff in the basin may vary from 44 7 to 13 0 from 48 7 to 2 43 and from 53 7 to 4 0 respectively under the scenario of ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 3 the hydrological regime in the syrb will alter to a moderate degree under the ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios except for a low degree alteration in the ssp126 scenario the spring flow of the basin will decrease significantly in the future and the annual extreme flow may decrease but the frequency of drought events and flood events will tend to increase the plant soil water supply and drought stress in the basin will be obviously affected as well as the river morphology and structure and natural habitat conditions 4 the uncertainty of multiple sources significantly affected the projection of the future hydrological regime the uncertainty of the climate model is the dominant factor followed by the interaction between the emission scenario and climate model with their average contribution of uncertainty at 69 5 and 20 8 respectively the uncertainty due to emission scenario may mainly be reflected in winter flow while the climate model mainly affects summer flow and annual maximum flow and the uncertainty of interaction varies from different periods funding this research has been financially supported by the national key research and development programs of china china 2021yfc3201104

2083,connectivity is a key topic in investigations of hydrogeomorphic processes in catchments mapping and determining quantitative values of hydrologic and sediment connectivity are prerequisites for understanding the linkages amongst various parts of catchment systems with different land use and topographic changes to properly manage sediment and water related issues given the need to develop appropriate methods for determining connectivity indices we developed a novel approach to estimate index of sediment connectivity ic using an artificial neural network ann algorithm physical characteristics of the catchments including elevation slope area length of stream channel length of overland flow normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and surface soil moisture ssm were used as inputs and the ic was assessed as the output of the ann model our findings revealed that the accuracy of the modelling within homogenous sub sections based on ic values of catchments was higher than that at the catchment scale even with fewer input parameters also the use of dynamic parameters e g ssm ndvi along with physiographic data improved performance of the ann model in estimating ic the results obtained from this study indicate that the proposed method can be applied as a promising reliable and cost effective tool for estimating ic at the catchment scale and also within homogenous sections of catchment keywords index of connectivity soil moisture normalized difference vegetation index artificial neural network physiography data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accelerated soil erosion and sediment production have caused serious on and off site problems worldwide montgomery 2007 sadeghi et al 2017 koci et al 2020b the determination of the extent and location of sediment sources areas susceptible to sediment transport and the degree of linkage between sediment sources and the channel network within a catchment are key steps for managing sediment yield and transport sidle et al 2017 najafi et al 2021b in this regard applying sediment connectivity concepts in catchment management especially in regions where high erosion and sediment delivery rates cause severe problems is an important and essential tool najafi et al 2017 in the past decade the use of sediment connectivity in studies of hydrological and geomorphic processes has increased fryirs 2013 parsons et al 2015 wohl et al 2019 koci et al 2020a index of sediment connectivity ic is one of the widely used hydrological connectivity indices that quantitatively depicts the potential for sediment transfer and the processes e g the continuum of sediment generation detachment transport and deposition in different sections of catchment i e between possible sediment sources and potential sinks sidle et al 2017 najafi et al 2021a sediment connectivity incorporates two distinct concepts structural physical sediment connectivity and functional process based sediment connectivity functional sediment connectivity reflects the dynamic of geomorphic and hydrologic processes and soil erosion processes within the system wainwright et al 2011 while structural sediment connectivity represents the spatial distribution of potential pathways of sediment transport and specifies pathways along which sediment can be transported in the direction of flow turnbull et al 2018 as a relatively new tool ic helps decision makers to optimize the use of resources planning and zoning and prioritizing areas for sediment control measures in catchments gonzález romero et al 2021 najafi et al 2021b previous studies related to sediment connectivity in different fields and catchments around the world have shown that sediment connectivity indices can facilitate investigations of water and sediment management and linkages within catchments for example lópez vicente et al 2020 showed that implementation of post fire programs in burned catchments can benefit from employing sediment connectivity indices to assess sediment control measures on hillslopes during intense rain events kalantari et al 2019 showed the benefits of using ic in modelling and quantifying the probability of flooding at major road stream junctions additionally keesstra et al 2018 indicated that sediment connectivity can improve flood hazard assessment and management marchamalo et al 2016 showed that assessment of flow and sediment connectivity in semi arid regions helps provide practical guidelines for mitigation and restoration of abandoned lands zarfl and lucía 2018 noted that for dam construction the application of models that estimate soil erosion rates and connectivity of detached soil to the fluvial network and fluvial sediment transport are required to evaluate sediment connectivity studies have used methods including geomorphological mapping and field observations sidle et al 2004 latocha 2014 wethered et al 2015 lisenby and fryirs 2017 sediment contributing area gis based modelling nicoll and brierley 2017 schopper et al 2019 digital elevation model dem of difference dod technique gartner et al 2015 heckmann and vericat 2018 gis modelling based on morphometric attributes borselli et al 2008 foerster et al 2014 cavalli et al 2016 mishra et al 2019 techniques of spatial network analysis graph theory phillips et al 2015 fressard and cossart 2019 and soil erosion and sediment delivery models liu and fu 2016 di stefano and ferro 2018 among these methods the morphometry based structural ic introduced by borselli et al 2008 is used extensively due to the availability of data i e dem and computing software on the other hand most methods require large data and or accurate field measurements hence these are less applicable at the catchment scale during the past decade researchers attempted to improve borselli s original approach modified versions have been developed for the slope computation flow accumulation algorithm and weighting factor lópez vicente and ben salem 2019 for instance to improve the weighting factor cavalli et al 2013 used a roughness index ri ortíz rodríguez et al 2017 used the combination of borselli s weighting factor and ri persichillo et al 2018 used manning s roughness coefficient and kalantari et al 2019 used a combination of soil moisture and ri instead of the weighting factor proposed by borselli et al 2008 thus although considerable research has been conducted on sediment connectivity due to the novelty of this concept methods are frequently updated bracken et al 2015 najafi et al 2021a however despite the increased use of high performance intelligent techniques to simulate complex phenomenon these algorithms have not been used to estimate sediment connectivity in the past several decades the use of smart data driven dd models as nonlinear networks have revolutionized the modeling of hydrological processes and geoscience worldwide moatamednia et al 2015 dastorani et al 2018 asadi et al 2019b isaev et al 2022 artificial neural network ann is a smart dd model with high flexibility that has been used in a wide spectrum of applications and can simulate 90 of processes related to nature kim and valdés 2003 generally the previous researches show that although advances have been achieved related to the concept of sediment connectivity quantifying its degree of connectivity and mapping water and sediment pathways there is still a lack of a suitable and comprehensive method to obtain quantitative values of sediment connectivity and processes related to it moreover there have been no studies that have used smart dd models to develop an efficient tool for ic modelling on the other hand there are drawbacks in current models such as gis based models that cannot address the simultaneous impact of various morphological meteorological and hydrological factors on ic estimation in fact these models cannot apply different factors and identify the complex relationships among them in a gis environment in contrast smart dd models can find complex relationships between input and output parameters within nonlinear and non stationary systems without considering the physical processes and limitations considering the weaknesses of the existing methods the aim of our research is to introduce a new approach to quantify ic using ann model our method strives to be easily applicable with no limitations in applying different factors therefore our study has three main objectives 1 develop ann model to estimate ic 2 evaluate the efficiency of an ann model to estimate ic within homogenous sections based on ic values of catchments and at the catchment scale and 3 investigate the effects of physiographic biophysical and hydrological parameters of catchment on estimating ic 2 study area and database to test these objectives two case studies were considered in the first case study we used data from seven sub catchments of the logan albert river catchment 1 logan river at forest home gauging station 145003b 2 cainbable creek at the gorge gauging station 145103a 3 running creek at dieckmans bridge gauging station 145010a 4 teviot brook at

145027a with drainage areas of 175 42 128 83 82 166 and 95 km2 respectively in queensland australia fig 1 for this case study we categorized sub catchments using a natural breaks classification algorithm into 32 classes based on ic maps i e fig 2 where the values of ic increase from class 1 to class 32 in total 224 classes were determined in all 7 sub catchments to identify which catchment classes have higher ic values that may produce more sediment an ic map of cainbable creek sub catchment was developed as an example fig 3 in the second case study we used data of 113 catchments in queensland australia whose drainage areas ranged from 6 4 km2 to 35 062 km2 and 137 catchments from different states of u s whose drainage areas ranged from 9 8 km2 to 6782 5 km2 fig 4 in our study all catchments were selected based on minimal anthropogenic influences e g the absence of major abstractions or dams in the upstream reaches to estimate ic we used a gis based borselli s approach and ann algorithm in ann algorithm data were divided into two groups training and testing where 70 of the total data were selected for the training phase in such a way that the maximum and minimum data values were placed in this group and the remaining 30 were selected for the testing phase the statistical parameters for training testing and total data of 224 classes and 250 catchments were calculated and were shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively 3 methodology 3 1 soil moisture to create water fluxes and connectivity between different parts of a catchment runoff is an essential factor that depends on various parameters such as intensity and duration of precipitation infiltration and antecedent soil moisture alagna et al 2016 ferreira et al 2015 soil moisture as an important component of hydrologic system reflects the impact of precipitation and temperature of the catchment the volume or mass of water in soil pores relative to total bulk soil volume or mass at different depths is soil moisture content destouni and verrot 2014 since direct field measurements of soil moisture are time consuming costly and difficult especially across large areas several methods using space borne remote sensing e g microwave optical or thermal infrared sensors have been developed for evaluation of large scale soil moisture barrett and petropoulos 2013 fascetti et al 2016 kerr et al 2010 in our study the nasa usda enhanced soil moisture active passive smap global soil moisture data from 2015 to 2022 were collected from nasa usda hsl smap10km soil moisture product available at https explorer earthengine google com these smap based soil moisture data are generated by merging smap level 3 soil moisture observations into the modified two layer palmer model using the ensemble kalman filter enkf approach these data at spatial resolution 10 000 m and temporal resolution 3 days include five bands in our study surface soil moisture ssm band 1 was used 3 2 normalized difference vegetation index land use and vegetation affect spatial and temporal aspects of connectivity borselli et al 2008 the widely used normalized difference vegetation index ndvi represents vegetation and land use in our study this index is generated from the near infrared nir and red red bands of landsat satellite imagery as shi et al 2020 1 ndvi nir red nir red in our study ndvi data from 2015 to 2022 were collected from the landsat lc08 c01 t1 32day ndvi product available at https explorer earthengine google com landsat 8 collection 1 tier 1 composites resolution of 30 30 m are created from all the tier 1 orthorectified scenes in each 32 day period using the computed top of atmosphere toa reflectance 3 3 physiographic parameters sediment connectivity is not only dependent on the overall catchment physiography but also on the internal connectivity of different physiographic units hooke 2003 moreover spatial variations of connectivity are also related to the catchment physiography borselli et al 2008 to extract the physiographic characteristics of catchments and process the spatial data geographic information system gis software arcgis 10 6 was used the parameters used include average elevation average slope gradient area total length of stream and average length of overland flow of catchments which were determined using a dem with resolution 30 m 30 m average length of overland flow was calculated as follows horton 1932 2 lof 0 5 total length of stream catchment area 3 4 the morphometry based structural index of sediment connectivity ic the ic proposed by borselli et al 2008 as a hydrological connectivity index can be computed in a gis environment using dynamic elements e g land use and static elements e g topography this index that depicts the potential connectivity between different parts of a catchment is comprised of upslope and downslope components that are expressed as follows borselli et al 2008 3 d up w s a 4 d dn i 1 n d i w i s i where d up is the upslope component w is the average weighting factor dimensionless s is the mean slope gradient m m and a m2 is the upslope contributing area d dn is the downslope component w i is a dimensionless weighting factor of the ith cell s i is the slope gradient of the ith cell m m and d i m is the length of the flow path along the ith cell based on the steepest downslope direction in total the downslope module considers the flow path length that a particle travels to reach a specified target or sink and the upslope module is the downward routing potential of the generated sediment from upslope the calculation of ic using these two components is expressed as follows borselli et al 2008 5 ic log 10 d up d dn ic values are in the range of and where higher ic values indicate increasing sediment connectivity and vice versa tiranti et al 2018 the first step in calculating ic involves preparation of raster maps with resolutions of 30 30 m of the hydrologically enforced dem dem h jarihani et al 2015 and the weighting factor as the main inputs of gis based modeling then the connectivity model was implemented via modelbuilder in an arcgis environment in which the algorithms and tools available in the spatial analyst extension as well as the taudem tool have been used cavalli et al 2013 details of the theoretical foundation of ic and its implementation in the arcgis environment are described by borselli et al 2008 finally results are as raster maps of ic that average values of ic pixels were calculated and considered as output in the ann model tables 1 and 2 the weighting factor indicates the resistance of each cell against runoff and sediment flow various parameters can be considered as weighting factors in this regard borselli et al 2008 used characteristics of local land use and soil surfaces in borselli s version weighting factor is derived from the cover management factor c factor of the universal soil loss equation usle revised universal soil loss equation rusle renard 1997 wischmeier and smith 1978 the c factor of these soil loss equations indicates the protective effect of soil vegetation cover and management practices against erosion durigon et al 2014 because obtaining the c factor from field surveys is difficult we used remotely sensed land cover datasets i e ndvi to estimate c factor similarly durigon et al 2014 estimated the c factor of rusle as follows 6 c 1 n d v i 2 where c factor values range from 0 to 1 with 0 indicating dense vegetation cover and protected soil and 1 denoting unprotected and bare soil raster maps of c factor of rusle were applied in the gis based connectivity model as weighting factor 3 5 artificial neural networks anns anns are promising and efficient soft computing techniques that have performance properties similar to biological neural networks haykin 1999 the ann used in this study is a feed forward neural network ffnn due to its widespread use in hydrological modeling kumar et al 2016 this network is comprised three layers i e input layer output layer and hidden layer in which the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer was selected through trial and error for network weightings adjustment i e training the network a back propagation mechanism based on a gradient scheme hagan and menhaj 1994 and the levenberg marquardt algorithm due to its high speed in training of neural networks were applied huang et al 2006 3 6 determination of input structure to conduct ic modeling using ann based on the choice of dynamic and static inputs we used two scenarios in case study 1 1 only physiographic data and 2 combining physiographic and biophysical data for case study 2 four scenarios were selected 1 only physiographic data 2 combining physiographic and biophysical data 3 combining physiographic and hydrological data and 4 a combination of all parameters of physiographic biophysical and hydrological moreover to identify the best input combination of physiographic parameters to estimate ic a simple procedure was implemented and the efficiency of different input patterns was evaluated by removing one physiographic factor in each step we also considered average length of overland flow in catchments as an additional required input in case study 2 since overland flow pathways are an important connection mechanism within the catchment croke et al 2005 finally six and nine input patterns were defined for case studies 1 and 2 presented in tables 3 and 4 respectively 3 7 data pre processing considering the highly variable data data pre processing and confining specific limits e g within the range of 0 to 1 can improve the modeling process zounemat kermani et al 2016 in this study all the variables were scaled as follows 7 x norm x ori x min x max x min where x min and x max represent the minimum and maximum value among original data and x norm and x ori represent the normalized and original data respectively 3 8 evaluation criteria we used four standard statistical parameters coefficient of determination r2 root mean squared error rmse mean absolute error mae and nash sutcliffe ns to determine the accuracy of the model 8 rmse 1 n i 1 i n o i s i 2 9 mae i 1 i n o i s i n 10 ns 1 i 1 i n o i s i 2 i 1 i n o i o 2 11 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 where n is the number of data oi and si are the ith observed and estimated ic respectively also o and s are the average of observed and estimated ic respectively generally higher ns and r2 values and lower rmse and mae values indicate better efficiency of models rmse and mae range from 0 to ns ranges from to 1 and r2 ranges from 0 to 1 zounemat kermani et al 2016 4 results and discussion 4 1 results of optimal structure for ann model in ann models there are parameters whose changes will influence the efficiency of modeling a trial and error method was used to calibrate these parameters the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer for training the network was set between 8 and 12 neurons for different input patterns also the activation functions used for the hidden and output layers were a combination of sigmoid and purelin functions respectively because they are efficient for extrapolating data beyond the training range maier and dandy 2000 4 2 model evaluation to evaluate the ann model performance indices rmse mae ns and r2 for all input patterns during the training and testing phases were computed and their values were presented in tables 5 and 6 for case studies 1 and 2 respectively evaluation of the results compared with the model using only physiographic factors showed that during the testing period in case study 1 ndvi improved ns by 3 42 r2 by 3 96 and reduced rmse and mae by 2 29 and 1 76 respectively in case study 2 ndvi improved ns by 18 10 r2 by 14 55 and reduced rmse by 14 08 and mae by 1 65 ssm improved ns by 16 41 r2 by 10 12 and reduced rmse and mae by 12 70 and 2 98 respectively and ndvi together with ssm improved ns by 23 51 r2 by 18 35 and reduced rmse and mae by 19 86 and 10 26 respectively comparison of different input scenarios indicated that ndvi input improved the results in both case studies however in case study 1 ndvi did not significantly improve the efficiency of the model moreover in case study 2 ndvi input contributed more to improvement of the model performance than ssm also concurrent use of ssm and ndvi along with physiographic factors produced a better input combination for estimating ic in ann with higher ns and r2 values and smaller rmse and mae during the testing phase these results may be because the increase in runoff cause more internal linkages among sediment sources within a catchment considering the effect of ndvi on the resistance of cells against runoff and sediment flow cavalli et al 2013 and the role of soil moisture in the runoff generation sazib et al 2020 the importance of these factors can be justified in estimating ic after investigation of the effect dynamic parameters in estimating ic we then tried to determine the optimal structure of the network by assessing physiographic factors because the use of effective and proper inputs in smart dd models elevates the model performance choubin et al 2018 asadi et al 2019a the results of analysis of standard statistics for case studies 1 and 2 were showed in tables 5 and 6 respectively the results of combination of different inputs showed that the most effective parameter in case study 1 was slope gradient followed by area length of stream ndvi and elevation in case study 2 the sequence was slope gradient followed by length of stream length of overland flow elevation ndvi area and ssm the high impact of slope gradient on ic is consistent with results of borselli et al 2008 they noted that structural ic is influenced by the local slope gradient and the type of land use that the flow encounters along its route in case study 1 our results also indicated that elevation had the lowest impact on estimating ic and model performance was increased by removing it in contrast for case study 2 elevation was proved as a required parameter to estimate ic catchment elevation often effects climatic conditions chow 1959 not only the amount of precipitation may vary with elevation e g higher elevations may have greater annual mean rainfall garcia martino et al 1996 but also the type of precipitation depends on elevation which impacts surface runoff energy balance and hydrology of catchment ding et al 2014 given that in case study 2 catchments are located in different elevationalareas of the us and australia the importance of elevation can be justified the results also showed that the catchment area affected ic for example an increase in catchment affects the delivery of sediment to channels particularly in the continuum from foothills to the floodplain which impacts the sediment output from the catchment de vente and poesen 2005 within a catchment connection can occur via channels or gullies and overland flow pathways sidle et al 2004 croke et al 2005 our results showed the importance of stream length longitudinal connectivity and length of overland flow lateral connectivity in estimating ic in fact in stream channels high concentrations of flow result in connection and sediment transport also overland flow pathways help join surface runoff to the stream network which increases connectivity on the other hand the longer the overland flow path generally the greater the infiltration and the less direct surface runoff horton 1932 which also impacts connection however this depends on the topography between the sediment source and the receiving stream sidle et al 2017 according to the results of different input scenarios the best scenario for estimating ic by the ann model during the testing phase in case study 1 was ndvi m area slp m ls with rmse mae ns and r2 values of 0 832 0 704 0 778 and 0 897 respectively table 5 therefore the best structure was obtained by eliminating the elevation variable which showed that more input parameters do not necessarily improve model results also the best scenario in case study 2 was ndvi m ssm m area slp m elev m lof ls with rmse mae ns and r2 of 0 347 0 271 0 730 and 0 748 respectively table 6 which indicated that combining ssm and ndvi along with physiographic data produced better results than other input combinations therefore choosing the proper inputs can influence the ic modelling results generally based on the recommendation by moriasi et al 2007 the ann model with the best input pattern exhibited very good performance in case study 1 based on the ns metric and the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr defined as rmse sdobs 0 75 ns 1 00 and 0 00 rsr 0 50 similarly in case study 2 a good performance was achieved 0 65 ns 0 75 and 0 50 rsr 0 60 thus modeling within homogenous sections of catchments yields superior results compared with modeling at the catchment scale accuracy of the best model in case study 1 was about 6 6 higher than the best model in case study 2 based on ns metric hence modeling homogenous sections within a catchment has more accuracy even with fewer input variables without the use of ssm and length of overland flow this improvement may arise due to the use of data associated with limited climatic conditions all selected sub catchments in case study 1 are located in the albert logan catchment in australia where climatic conditions are similar asadi et al 2021 also confirmed that the use of more homogenous data related to limited climatic conditions leads to improvements of smart dd model results to evaluate the performance of the developed models scatter plots during the testing phase were presented for the best input pattern of case studies 1 and 2 fig 5 comparison of plots showed that simulated ic values were in closer agreement with borselli s ic values in case study 1 than in case study 2 moreover plots of variations of borselli s ic values versus simulated ic for the best input pattern during the testing period for case studies 1 and 2 were shown in fig 6 a and 6 b respectively the comparison of borselli s ic versus simulated ic using the best input pattern in both case studies indicated that although there was a relatively good agreement between borselli s ic and simulated ic the results of case study 1 were better fig 6 also these plots confirmed that in some cases the simulated ic values were not accurate which often occurs in modeling sichingabula 1998 partly due to the choice of the data range during the training phase that affects estimates kumar et al 2016 additionally geomorphic and hydrologic perturbations e g landslides floods in catchment can affect water and sediment fluxes ziegler et al 2014 sidle et al 2017 khosravi et al 2022 and connectivity between different parts of a catchment moreover given that the type of smart dd model asadi et al 2022 and application of high quality data in these models affect results asadi et al 2021 hence the use of other smart models e g support vector regression svr adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis classification and regression tree cart and input data with high temporal and spatial resolution may improve results finally it is important to consider that ic can also be influenced by different variables including hydro meteorological variables e g precipitation runoff and physical attributes of catchments e g geology soil which we did not use as predictors for ic in our study results of the ann model were compared with the results of borselli s model although results of borselli s model may not be completely accurate due to limitations and computational uncertainties for example the errors of the maps used e g elevation maps may propagate downstream of the catchment heckmann and vericat 2018 therefore one of the model limitations in our study similar to previous sediment connectivity studies is the lack of comparison of model results with geomorphologic and sediment field observations thus studies should be conducted to investigate this problem in the future however the results of our study are an initial step to confirm the benefit and performance of using smart dd models e g ann to estimate ic one of the benefits of this model is its application in catchments with different conditions another advantage is the possibility of using different factors and also using remotely sensed data that saves time and facilitates data analysis durigon et al 2014 5 conclusion considering financial and equipment constraints especially in developing countries for accurate field measurements of sediment connectivity use of index of sediment connectivity ic for describing sediment flow helps distinguish homogeneous landscape sections with similar potentials for sediment transport and prioritizes them for purposeful managerial decisions on sediment yield and transfer in this regard this study was designed to develop a smart data driven model ann using physiographic biophysical and hydrological characteristics of catchments to estimate ic in which the results were compared with the calculated ic based on the approach of borselli et al 2008 our objective was to obtain a structural ic using a new method and determine the optimal and accessible input variables to achieve proper estimates of ic at the catchment scale and within homogenous sub sections based on ic values of catchments to accomplish this goal we examined the influence of dynamic parameters ndvi ssm within the catchment along with morphometric inputs as static information on model performance findings demonstrated that catchment geomorphic features alone do not explain connectivity and biophysical and hydrological features of catchments should be considered although our results showed that the ann model is a promising and reliable tool for estimating ic at the catchment scale and within small homogenous sections of catchments further research is required to evaluate the efficiency of other intelligent models using catchment characteristics overall our findings related to estimation of ic are valuable for optimizing the use of resources appropriate planning and zoning and prioritizing areas for sediment control within the

2083,connectivity is a key topic in investigations of hydrogeomorphic processes in catchments mapping and determining quantitative values of hydrologic and sediment connectivity are prerequisites for understanding the linkages amongst various parts of catchment systems with different land use and topographic changes to properly manage sediment and water related issues given the need to develop appropriate methods for determining connectivity indices we developed a novel approach to estimate index of sediment connectivity ic using an artificial neural network ann algorithm physical characteristics of the catchments including elevation slope area length of stream channel length of overland flow normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and surface soil moisture ssm were used as inputs and the ic was assessed as the output of the ann model our findings revealed that the accuracy of the modelling within homogenous sub sections based on ic values of catchments was higher than that at the catchment scale even with fewer input parameters also the use of dynamic parameters e g ssm ndvi along with physiographic data improved performance of the ann model in estimating ic the results obtained from this study indicate that the proposed method can be applied as a promising reliable and cost effective tool for estimating ic at the catchment scale and also within homogenous

request 1 introduction accelerated soil erosion and sediment production have caused serious on and off site problems worldwide montgomery 2007 sadeghi et al 2017 koci et al 2020b the determination of the extent and location of sediment sources areas susceptible to sediment transport and the degree of linkage between sediment sources and the channel network within a catchment are key steps for managing sediment yield and transport sidle et al 2017 najafi et al 2021b in this regard applying sediment connectivity concepts in catchment management especially in regions where high erosion and sediment delivery rates cause severe problems is an important and essential tool najafi et al 2017 in the past decade the use of sediment connectivity in studies of hydrological and geomorphic processes has increased fryirs 2013 parsons et al 2015 wohl et al 2019 koci et al 2020a index of sediment connectivity ic is one of the widely used hydrological connectivity indices that quantitatively depicts the potential for sediment transfer and the processes e g the continuum of sediment generation detachment transport and deposition in different sections of catchment i e between possible sediment sources and potential sinks sidle et al 2017 najafi et al 2021a sediment connectivity incorporates two distinct concepts structural physical sediment connectivity and functional process based sediment connectivity functional sediment connectivity reflects the dynamic of geomorphic and hydrologic processes and soil erosion processes within the system wainwright et al 2011 while structural sediment connectivity represents the spatial distribution of potential pathways of sediment transport and specifies pathways along which sediment can be transported in the direction of flow turnbull et al 2018 as a relatively new tool ic helps decision makers to optimize the use of resources planning and zoning and prioritizing areas for sediment control measures in catchments gonzález romero et al 2021 najafi et al 2021b previous studies related to sediment connectivity in different fields and catchments around the world have shown that sediment connectivity indices can facilitate investigations of water and sediment management and linkages within catchments for example lópez vicente et al 2020 showed that implementation of post fire programs in burned catchments can benefit from employing sediment connectivity indices to assess sediment control measures on hillslopes during intense rain events kalantari et al 2019 showed the benefits of using ic in modelling and quantifying the probability of flooding at major road stream junctions additionally keesstra et al 2018 indicated that sediment connectivity can improve flood hazard assessment and management marchamalo et al 2016 showed that assessment of flow and sediment connectivity in semi arid regions helps provide practical guidelines for mitigation and restoration of abandoned lands zarfl and lucía 2018 noted that for dam construction the application of models that estimate soil erosion rates and connectivity of detached soil to the fluvial network and fluvial sediment transport are required to evaluate sediment connectivity studies have used methods including geomorphological mapping and field observations sidle et al 2004 latocha 2014 wethered et al 2015 lisenby and fryirs 2017 sediment contributing area gis based modelling nicoll and brierley 2017 schopper et al 2019 digital elevation model dem of difference dod technique gartner et al 2015 heckmann and vericat 2018 gis modelling based on morphometric attributes borselli et al 2008 foerster et al 2014 cavalli et al 2016 mishra et al 2019 techniques of spatial network analysis graph theory phillips et al 2015 fressard and cossart 2019 and soil erosion and sediment delivery models liu and fu 2016 di stefano and ferro 2018 among these methods the morphometry based structural ic introduced by borselli et al 2008 is used extensively due to the availability of data i e dem and computing software on the other hand most methods require large data and or accurate field measurements hence these are less applicable at the catchment scale during the past decade researchers attempted to improve borselli s original approach modified versions have been developed for the slope computation flow accumulation algorithm and weighting factor lópez vicente and ben salem 2019 for instance to improve the weighting factor cavalli et al 2013 used a roughness index ri ortíz rodríguez et al 2017 used the combination of borselli s weighting factor and ri persichillo et al 2018 used manning s roughness coefficient and kalantari et al 2019 used a combination of soil moisture and ri instead of the weighting factor proposed by borselli et al 2008 thus although considerable research has been conducted on sediment connectivity due to the novelty of this concept methods are frequently updated bracken et al 2015 najafi et al 2021a however despite the increased use of high performance intelligent techniques to simulate complex phenomenon these algorithms have not been used to estimate sediment connectivity in the past several decades the use of smart data driven dd models as nonlinear networks have revolutionized the modeling of hydrological processes and geoscience worldwide moatamednia et al 2015 dastorani et al 2018 asadi et al 2019b isaev et al 2022 artificial neural network ann is a smart dd model with high flexibility that has been used in a wide spectrum of applications and can simulate 90 of processes related to nature kim and valdés 2003 generally the previous researches show that although advances have been achieved related to the concept of sediment connectivity quantifying its degree of connectivity and mapping water and sediment pathways there is still a lack of a suitable and comprehensive method to obtain quantitative values of sediment connectivity and processes related to it moreover there have been no studies that have used smart dd models to develop an efficient tool for ic modelling on the other hand there are drawbacks in current models such as gis based models that cannot address the simultaneous impact of various morphological meteorological and hydrological factors on ic estimation in fact these models cannot apply different factors and identify the complex relationships among them in a gis environment in contrast smart dd models can find complex relationships between input and output parameters within nonlinear and non stationary systems without considering the physical processes and limitations considering the weaknesses of the existing methods the aim of our research is to introduce a new approach to quantify ic using ann model our method strives to be easily applicable with no limitations in applying different factors therefore our study has three main objectives 1 develop ann model to estimate ic 2 evaluate the efficiency of an ann model to estimate ic within homogenous sections based on ic values of catchments and at the catchment scale and 3 investigate the effects of physiographic biophysical and hydrological parameters of catchment on estimating ic 2 study area and database to test these objectives two case studies were considered in the first case study we used data from seven sub catchments of the logan albert river catchment 1 logan river at forest home gauging station 145003b 2 cainbable creek at the gorge gauging station 145103a 3 running creek at dieckmans bridge gauging station 145010a 4 teviot brook at

145027a with drainage areas of 175 42 128 83 82 166 and 95 km2 respectively in queensland australia fig 1 for this case study we categorized sub catchments using a natural breaks classification algorithm into 32 classes based on ic maps i e fig 2 where the values of ic increase from class 1 to class 32 in total 224 classes were determined in all 7 sub catchments to identify which catchment classes have higher ic values that may produce more sediment an ic map of cainbable creek sub catchment was developed as an example fig 3 in the second case study we used data of 113 catchments in queensland australia whose drainage areas ranged from 6 4 km2 to 35 062 km2 and 137 catchments from different states of u s whose drainage areas ranged from 9 8 km2 to 6782 5 km2 fig 4 in our study all catchments were selected based on minimal anthropogenic influences e g the absence of major abstractions or dams in the upstream reaches to estimate ic we used a gis based borselli s approach and ann algorithm in ann algorithm data were divided into two groups training and testing where 70 of the total data were selected for the training phase in such a way that the maximum and minimum data values were placed in this group and the remaining 30 were selected for the testing phase the statistical parameters for training testing and total data of 224 classes and 250 catchments were calculated and were shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively 3 methodology 3 1 soil moisture to create water fluxes and connectivity between different parts of a catchment runoff is an essential factor that depends on various parameters such as intensity and duration of precipitation infiltration and antecedent soil moisture alagna et al 2016 ferreira et al 2015 soil moisture as an important component of hydrologic system reflects the impact of precipitation and temperature of the catchment the volume or mass of water in soil pores relative to total bulk soil volume or mass at different depths is soil moisture content destouni and verrot 2014 since direct field measurements of soil moisture are time consuming costly and difficult especially across large areas several methods using

kalman filter enkf approach these data at spatial resolution 10 000 m and temporal resolution 3 days include five bands in our study surface soil moisture ssm band 1 was used 3 2 normalized difference vegetation index land use and vegetation affect spatial and temporal aspects of connectivity borselli et al 2008 the widely used normalized difference vegetation index ndvi represents vegetation and land use in our study this index is generated from the near infrared nir and red red bands of landsat satellite imagery as shi et al 2020 1 ndvi nir red nir red in our study ndvi data from 2015 to

catchment physiography but also on the internal connectivity of different physiographic units hooke 2003 moreover spatial variations of connectivity are also related to the catchment physiography borselli et al 2008 to extract the physiographic characteristics of catchments and process the spatial data geographic information system gis software arcgis 10 6 was used the parameters used include average elevation average slope gradient area total length of stream and average length of overland flow of catchments which were determined using a dem with resolution 30 m 30 m average length of overland flow was calculated as follows horton 1932 2 lof 0 5 total length of stream catchment area 3 4 the morphometry based structural index of sediment connectivity ic the ic proposed by borselli

dimensionless weighting factor of the ith cell s i is the slope gradient of the ith cell m m and d i m is the length of the flow path along the ith cell based on the steepest downslope direction in total the downslope module considers the flow path length that a particle travels to reach a specified target or sink and the upslope module is the downward routing potential of the generated sediment from upslope the calculation of ic using these two components is expressed as follows borselli et al 2008 5 ic log 10 d up d dn ic values are in the range of and where higher ic values indicate increasing sediment connectivity and vice versa tiranti et al 2018 the first step in calculating ic involves preparation of raster maps with resolutions of 30 30 m of the hydrologically enforced dem dem h jarihani et al 2015 and the weighting factor as the main inputs of gis based modeling then the connectivity model was implemented via modelbuilder in an arcgis environment in which the algorithms and tools available in the spatial analyst extension as well as the taudem tool have been used cavalli et al 2013 details of the theoretical foundation of ic and its implementation in the arcgis environment are described by borselli et al 2008 finally results are as raster maps of ic that average values of ic pixels were calculated and considered as output in the ann model tables 1 and 2 the weighting factor indicates the resistance of each cell against runoff and sediment flow various parameters can be considered as weighting factors in this regard borselli et al 2008 used characteristics of local land use and soil surfaces in borselli s version weighting factor is derived from the cover management factor c factor of the universal soil loss equation usle revised universal soil loss equation rusle renard 1997 wischmeier and smith 1978 the c factor of these soil loss equations indicates the protective effect of soil vegetation cover and management practices against erosion durigon et al 2014 because obtaining the c factor from field surveys is difficult we used remotely sensed land cover datasets i e ndvi to estimate c factor similarly durigon et al 2014 estimated the c factor of rusle as follows 6 c 1 n d v i 2 where c factor values range from 0 to 1 with 0 indicating dense vegetation cover and protected soil and 1 denoting unprotected and bare soil raster maps of c factor of rusle were applied in the gis based connectivity model as weighting factor 3 5 artificial neural networks anns anns are promising and efficient soft computing techniques that have performance properties similar to biological neural networks haykin 1999 the ann used in this study is a feed forward neural network ffnn due to its widespread use in hydrological modeling kumar et al 2016 this network is comprised three layers i e input layer output layer and hidden layer in which the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer was selected through trial and error for network weightings adjustment i e training the network a back propagation mechanism based on a gradient scheme hagan and menhaj 1994 and the levenberg marquardt algorithm due to its high speed in training of neural networks were applied huang et al 2006 3 6 determination of input structure to conduct ic modeling using ann based on the choice of dynamic and static inputs we used two scenarios in case study 1 1 only physiographic data and 2 combining physiographic and biophysical data for case study 2 four scenarios were selected 1 only physiographic data 2 combining physiographic and biophysical data 3 combining physiographic and hydrological data and 4 a combination of all parameters of physiographic biophysical and hydrological moreover to identify the best input combination of physiographic parameters to estimate ic a simple procedure was implemented and the efficiency of different input patterns was evaluated by removing one physiographic factor in each step we also considered average length of overland flow in catchments as an additional required input in case study 2 since overland flow pathways are an important connection mechanism within the catchment croke et al 2005 finally six and nine input patterns were defined for case studies 1 and 2 presented in tables 3 and 4 respectively 3 7 data pre processing considering the highly variable data data pre processing and confining specific limits e g within the range of 0 to 1 can improve the modeling process zounemat kermani et al 2016 in this study all the variables were scaled as follows 7 x norm x ori x min x max x min where x min and x max represent the minimum and maximum value among original data and x norm and x ori represent the normalized and original data respectively 3 8 evaluation criteria we used four standard statistical parameters coefficient of determination r2 root mean squared error rmse mean absolute error mae and nash sutcliffe ns to determine the accuracy of the model 8 rmse 1 n i 1 i n o i s i 2 9 mae i 1 i n o i s i n 10 ns 1 i 1 i n o i s i 2 i 1 i n o i o 2 11 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 where n is the number of data oi and si are the ith observed and estimated ic respectively also o and s are the average of observed and estimated ic respectively generally higher ns and r2 values and lower rmse and mae values indicate better efficiency of models rmse and mae range from 0 to ns ranges from to 1 and r2 ranges from 0 to 1 zounemat kermani et al 2016 4 results and discussion 4 1 results of optimal structure for ann model in ann models there are parameters whose changes will influence the efficiency of modeling a trial and error method was used to calibrate these parameters the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer for training the network was set between 8 and 12 neurons for different input patterns also the activation functions used for the hidden and output layers were a combination of sigmoid and purelin functions respectively because they are efficient for extrapolating data beyond the training range maier and dandy 2000 4 2 model evaluation to evaluate the ann model performance indices rmse mae ns and r2 for all input patterns during the training and testing phases were computed and their values were presented in tables 5 and 6 for case studies 1 and 2 respectively evaluation of the results compared with the model using only physiographic factors showed that during the testing period in case study 1 ndvi improved ns by 3 42 r2 by 3 96 and reduced rmse and mae by 2 29 and 1 76 respectively in case study 2 ndvi improved ns by 18 10 r2 by 14 55 and reduced rmse by 14 08 and mae by 1 65 ssm improved ns by 16 41 r2 by 10 12 and reduced rmse and mae by 12 70 and 2 98 respectively and ndvi together with ssm improved ns by 23 51 r2 by 18 35 and reduced rmse and mae by 19 86 and 10 26 respectively comparison of different input scenarios indicated that ndvi input improved the results in both case studies however in case study 1 ndvi did not significantly improve the efficiency of the model moreover in case study 2 ndvi input contributed more to improvement of the model performance than ssm also concurrent use of ssm and ndvi along with physiographic factors produced a better input combination for estimating ic in ann with higher ns and r2 values and smaller rmse and mae during the testing phase these results may be because the increase in runoff cause more internal linkages among sediment sources within a catchment considering the effect of ndvi on the resistance of cells against runoff and sediment flow cavalli et al 2013 and the role of soil moisture in the runoff generation sazib et al 2020 the importance of these factors can be justified in estimating ic after investigation of the effect dynamic parameters in estimating ic we then tried to determine the optimal structure of the network by assessing physiographic factors because the use of effective and proper inputs in smart dd models elevates the model performance choubin et al 2018 asadi et al 2019a the results of analysis of standard statistics for case studies 1 and 2 were showed in tables 5 and 6 respectively the results of combination of different inputs showed that the most effective parameter in case study 1 was slope gradient followed by area length of stream ndvi and elevation in case study 2 the sequence was slope gradient followed by length of stream length of overland flow elevation ndvi area and ssm the high impact of slope gradient on ic is consistent with results of borselli et al 2008 they noted that structural ic is influenced by the local slope gradient and the type of land use that the flow encounters along its route in case study 1 our results also indicated that elevation had the lowest impact on estimating ic and model performance was increased by removing it in contrast for case study 2 elevation was proved as a required parameter to estimate ic catchment elevation often effects climatic conditions chow 1959 not only the amount of precipitation may vary with elevation e g higher elevations may have greater annual mean rainfall garcia martino et al 1996 but also the type of precipitation depends on elevation which impacts surface runoff energy balance and hydrology of catchment ding et al 2014 given that in case study 2 catchments are located in different elevationalareas of the us and australia the importance of elevation can be justified the results also showed that the catchment area affected ic for example an increase in catchment affects the delivery of sediment to channels particularly in the continuum from foothills to the floodplain which impacts the sediment output from the catchment de vente and poesen 2005 within a catchment connection can occur via channels or gullies and overland flow pathways sidle et al 2004 croke et al 2005 our results showed the importance of stream length longitudinal connectivity and length of overland flow lateral connectivity in estimating ic in fact in stream channels high concentrations of flow result in connection and sediment transport also overland flow pathways help join surface runoff to the stream network which increases connectivity on the other hand the longer the overland flow path generally the greater the infiltration and the less direct surface runoff horton 1932 which also impacts connection however this depends on the topography between the sediment source and the receiving stream sidle et al 2017 according to the results of different input scenarios the best scenario for estimating ic by the ann model during the testing phase in case study 1 was ndvi m area slp m ls with rmse mae ns and r2 values of 0 832 0 704 0 778 and 0 897 respectively table 5 therefore the best structure was obtained by eliminating the elevation variable which showed that more input parameters do not necessarily improve model results also the best scenario in case study 2 was ndvi m ssm m area slp m elev m lof ls with rmse mae ns and r2 of 0 347 0 271 0 730 and 0 748 respectively table 6 which indicated that combining ssm and ndvi along with physiographic data produced better results than other input combinations therefore choosing the proper inputs can influence the ic modelling results generally based on the recommendation by moriasi et al 2007 the ann model with the best input pattern exhibited very good performance in case study 1 based on the ns metric and the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr defined as rmse sdobs 0 75 ns 1 00 and 0 00 rsr 0 50 similarly in case study 2 a good performance was achieved 0 65 ns 0 75 and 0 50 rsr 0 60 thus modeling within homogenous sections of catchments yields superior results compared with modeling at the catchment scale accuracy of the best model in case study 1 was about 6 6 higher than the best model in case study 2 based on ns metric hence modeling homogenous sections within a catchment has more accuracy even with fewer input variables without the use of ssm and length of overland flow this improvement may arise due to the use of data associated with limited climatic conditions all selected sub catchments in case study 1 are located in the albert logan catchment in australia where climatic conditions are similar asadi et al 2021 also confirmed that the use of more homogenous data related to limited climatic conditions leads to improvements of smart dd model results to evaluate the performance of the developed models scatter plots during the testing phase were presented for the best input pattern of case studies 1 and 2 fig 5 comparison of plots showed that simulated ic values were in closer agreement with borselli s ic values in case study 1 than in case study 2 moreover plots of variations of borselli s ic values versus simulated ic for the best input pattern during the testing period for case studies 1 and 2 were shown in fig 6 a and 6 b respectively the comparison of borselli s ic versus simulated ic using the best input pattern in both case studies indicated that although there was a relatively good agreement between borselli s ic and simulated ic the results of case study 1 were better fig 6 also these plots confirmed that in some cases the simulated ic values were not accurate which often occurs in modeling sichingabula 1998 partly due to the choice of the data range during the training phase that affects estimates kumar et al 2016 additionally geomorphic and hydrologic perturbations e g landslides floods in catchment can affect water and sediment fluxes ziegler et al 2014 sidle et al 2017 khosravi et al 2022 and connectivity between different parts of a catchment moreover given that the type of smart dd model asadi et al 2022 and application of high quality data in these models affect results asadi et al 2021 hence the use of other smart models e g support vector regression svr adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis classification and regression tree cart and input data with high temporal and spatial resolution may improve results finally it is important to consider that ic can also be influenced by different variables including hydro meteorological variables e g precipitation runoff and physical attributes of catchments e g geology soil which we did not use as predictors for ic in our study results of the ann model were compared with the results of borselli s model although results of borselli s model may not be completely accurate due to limitations and computational uncertainties for example the errors of the maps used e g elevation maps may propagate downstream of the catchment heckmann and vericat 2018 therefore one of the model limitations in our study similar to previous sediment connectivity studies is the lack of comparison of model results with geomorphologic and sediment field observations thus studies should be conducted to investigate this problem in the future however the results of our study are an initial step to confirm the benefit and performance of using smart dd models e g ann to estimate ic one of the benefits of this model is its application in catchments with different conditions another advantage is the possibility of using different factors and also using remotely sensed data that saves time and facilitates data analysis durigon et al 2014 5 conclusion considering financial and equipment constraints especially in developing countries for accurate field measurements of sediment connectivity use of index of sediment connectivity ic for describing sediment flow helps distinguish homogeneous landscape sections with similar potentials for sediment transport and prioritizes them for purposeful managerial decisions on sediment yield and transfer in this regard this study was designed to develop a smart data driven model ann using physiographic biophysical and hydrological characteristics of catchments to estimate ic in which the results were compared with the calculated ic based on the approach of borselli et al 2008 our objective was to obtain a structural ic using a new method and determine the optimal and accessible input variables to achieve proper estimates of ic at the catchment scale and within homogenous sub sections based on ic values of catchments to accomplish this goal we examined the influence of dynamic parameters ndvi ssm within the catchment along with morphometric inputs as static information on model performance findings demonstrated that catchment geomorphic features alone do not explain connectivity and biophysical and hydrological features of catchments should be considered although our results showed that the ann model is a promising and reliable tool for estimating ic at the catchment scale and within small homogenous sections of catchments further research is required to evaluate the efficiency of other intelligent models using catchment characteristics overall our findings related to estimation of ic are valuable for optimizing the use of resources appropriate planning and zoning and prioritizing areas for sediment control within the

2084,clipping management by reducing the above ground parts of grassland has been gradually introduced to offset some of the additional issues caused by large scale vegetation restoration such as the formation of a dry soil layer approaching the limits of watershed water resources and reducing the sustainability of vegetation therefore there is a scientific and practical need to evaluate the effectiveness of clipping management on runoff and erosion processes to ensure a balance between erosion control surface water supply and vegetation sustainability in this study simulated rainfall experiments with four levels of clipping intensities no clipping light clipping heavy clipping and clear clipping were conducted to explore the mechanism of runoff and soil loss response under three rainfall intensities i e 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 and three slope gradients i e 18 36 and 58 using structural equation modeling and variation partitioning the results showed that the runoff depth increased by 42 119 and 299 respectively and the soil loss increased by 76 80 and 470 respectively in the light heavy and clear clipping treatments compared with the no clipping treatment indicating that the increase in the percentage of runoff production and soil loss was not synchronized according to the optimizing results of response surface method the recommended vegetation cover after clipping was 23 48 and the slope gradient of clipped vegetation should not exceed 36 which increased surface runoff while limiting soil erosion within an acceptable range runoff production and soil loss were primarily determined by rainfall intensity followed by clipping intensity and slope gradient increasing rainfall intensity and slope gradient increased the effect of clipping on soil loss therefore local rainfall and topography need to be considered in the application of clipping management this study provides valuable insights into the use of clipping treatment as a sustainable management strategy for mitigating soil erosion and conserving surface water resources and has important implications for developing restoration plans to promote sustainability in semi arid ecosystems

subject to the most severe soil erosion in the world especially in the northern part with average soil erosion of up to 5 000 25 000 t km 2 y 1 before 1999 zhao et al 2013 which is the main environmental limitation of the loess plateau feng et al 2016 to control soil erosion and protect the environment the chinese government has implemented the grain for green program since 1999 shi et al 2020 wei et al 2022 which has achieved remarkable results the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi on the loess plateau increased from 0 42 to 0 62 from 2001 to 2020 he et al 2022 and the increased vegetation significantly reduced soil erosion ran et al 2013 shi et al 2022 the measured sediment discharge at tongguan station on the yellow river has decreased from 1 6 billion t y 1 to 200 300 million t y 1 and runoff has been significantly reduced shi et al 2022 indicating that the water and sediment conditions of the yellow river have changed significantly with the implementation of the grain for green program in general the benefits of large scale revegetation on the loess plateau have been confirmed ran et al 2013 wu et al 2020 he et al 2022 however additional issues related to large scale revegetation of the loess plateau in china have emerged in recent years for example the sustainability of water resources is reaching its limits gao et al 2011 feng et al 2016 reduced soil water content has led to the phenomenon of the dry soil layer on the loess plateau wang et al 2015 which has caused vegetation mortality and in some cases made the biotic community unsustainable wang et al 2012 the water yield of watershed has been significantly reduced gao et al 2011 feng et al 2016 shi et al 2022 which has affected the ecology economy and domestic water availability of the yellow river in a word the large scale revegetation of the loess plateau has effectively controlled the soil erosion rate and conserved environmental resources but has also caused additional issues feng et al 2016 pan et al 2019 wu et al 2020 shi et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 however most of the studies conducted focus on the control functions of vegetation treatments on runoff and soil erosion to determine the critical vegetation cover as a guideline for vegetation plantation programs ran et al 2013 feng et al 2016 chen et al 2018 yao et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 neglecting their negative impacts on the local ecological hydrology and water resource use fang 2021 in this context how to continuously implement vegetation restoration and strike a balance between soil erosion control and surface runoff maintenance is crucial for the sustainability of the grain for green program on the loess plateau in recent years clipping management which reduces the above ground part of vegetation and retains the stem litter layer and roots has been gradually recommended and adopted in the grain for green program based on ecological and economic analyses pan et al 2019 on the one hand clipping management can reduce soil water depletion by decreasing vegetation cover to benefit the restored vegetation and ecosystem functions li et al 2015 li et al 2016 on the other hand it can help feed animals and increase farmers income by collecting and selling clipped residues pan et al 2019 in fact previous studies have confirmed that clipping management is potentially changing hydrological and erosional characteristics such as rainfall interception splash erosion reduction soil detachment and transport surface runoff generation and soil loss merz et al 2009 pan et al 2019 furthermore the above ground and below ground parts of vegetation have different relative contributions to the reduction of runoff generation and soil loss zhou and shangguan 2007 zhang et al 2012 li and pan 2018 lin et al 2019 runoff was influenced by both the above and below ground parts of the vegetation while soil erosion is mainly controlled by below ground part of the vegetation de figueiredo et al 2016 lin et al 2019 ding and fu 2022 these preliminary studies demonstrated that it is possible to regulate runoff production and soil loss by clipping vegetation however there are few studies on the effects of clipping management on soil erosion and only simple quantitative comparisons are conducted to compare variations in runoff production and soil loss before and after clipping sun et al 2007 xue et al 2011 xu et al 2012 pan et al 2019 and most studies on clipped vegetation are mainly interested in the effects of plant diversity soil microbial properties and soil carbon and nitrogen storage shahzad et al 2012 carey et al 2015 wei et al 2016 du et al 2022 grégoire et al 2022 with little consideration of the optimal clipping management based on the hydrological and erosional processes this knowledge gap needs to be addressed and further studies on the optimal clipping management to balance surface runoff production and soil erosion control for revegetated slopes should be conducted to guide the implementation of measures runoff and soil erosion processes on revegetated slopes involve many factors such as climate topography and soil texture yao et al 2018 dunkerley 2021 ke and zhang 2022 sadeghi et al 2022 sarkar et al 2022 the complex interactions between rainfall vegetation and slope gradient in runoff and erosion processes have received considerable attention from researchers cammeraat 2004 jiang et al 2014 lin et al 2019 pan et al 2019 wu et al 2020 tang et al 2021 ke and zhang 2022 found that the potential for both runoff production and soil loss on vegetated slopes varies with rainfall intensity and slope gradient when rainfall intensity exceeds certain thresholds the impact of vegetation cover patterns on runoff and soil loss may be weakened cammeraat 2004 tang et al 2021 the effect of vegetation cover on soil erosion control increased jiang et al 2014 or initially increased and then decreased wu et al 2020 with increasing in slope gradient while higher vegetation cover decreased the sensitivity of runoff production and soil loss reduction benefits to slope gradient lin et al 2019 as mentioned above previous studies have only focused on a single vegetation type or artificial grasslands with planted vegetation cover which differs significantly from the clipped natural grasslands wang et al 2023 resulting in different relationships between runoff and soil loss and rainfall intensity and slope gradient on clipped slopes merz et al 2009 pan et al 2019 however there are insufficient data available to quantify the effects of rainfall and slope gradient on the hydrological and erosional characteristics of clipped slopes therefore it is necessary to systematically investigate the complex interactions between clipping management rainfall intensity and slope gradient on runoff generation and soil loss which is essential to assess the effectiveness of clipping management on soil erosion and surface runoff generation and to guide the application of clipping management in semi arid areas with water limitations we hypothesize that the effects of clipping management on runoff production and soil loss are not synchronized under different conditions based on this hypothesis we designed an experiment with four levels of clipping intensity under different slope gradients and simulated rainfall intensities to 1 analyze the characteristics of runoff and soil loss responses to the clipping management 2 quantify the effects of clipping intensity rainfall intensity and slope gradient and their interactions on soil erosion 3 determine the optimal clipping intensity for the restored grassland to balance surface runoff production and soil erosion control these findings could clarify how to utilize clipping management and provide guidance to local farmers and decision makers for the development of restoration plans to promote sustainability in semi arid ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experimental design this study was conducted in the liudaogou watershed latitude 38 46 38 51 n longitude 110 21 110 23 e located in the northern loess plateau shaanxi province china fig 1 a the climate is semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 437 mm yr 1 with approximately 70 80 of the total rainfall occurring from june to september according to the meteorological data from the shenmu soil erosion and environment experimental station analysis of erosive rainfall events in the study area from 2014 to 2019 table1 where rainfall events that generated runoff were considered erosive rainfall events liu et al 2022 showed that rainfall depth for erosive events ranged from 9 50 109 60 mm and i30 ranged from 3 60 54 00 mm h 1 prior to the establishment of the experiment the study site was subjected to natural restoration for approximately 15 years which was dominated by bunge needlegrass and stipa grandis fig 1b the soil texture was classified as a sandy loam usda soil taxonomy with 67 90 sand 27 94 silt 4 16 clay and 0 54 organic matter experimental runoff plots were constructed using metal sheets with dimensions of 6 m length 2 m width a metal runoff collector was placed at the bottom of the plot to direct runoff into a container fig 1b according to the typical rainfall intensity of storms that cause severe soil erosion and major surface slopes in the hilly loess region zhou and wang 1987 the experimental treatments for this study included a combination of three rainfall intensities 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 and three slope gradients 18 36 and 58 on each slope the four clipping treatments were applied no clipping with approximately 70 vegetation cover light clipping with approximately 50 vegetation cover heavy clipping with approximately 25 vegetation cover and clear clipping without above ground vegetation a total of 36 simulated rainfall experiments 4 clipping treatments 3 rainfall intensities 3 slope gradients were set up without replication vegetation was clipped to a height of 0 2 cm above the soil surface without removing the root and litter below the clipping line and the unclipped vegetation was distributed relatively evenly across the plot in general the simulated rainfall experiment was completed within one week after the clipping treatment vegetation cover the ratio of the soil surface area covered by vegetation to the total soil surface area was determined by the point intercept method using gridded quadrats gao et al 2017 the pre soak rain was applied to maintain consistent soil moisture between 10 and 15 among experiments which was measured by the tdr 300 after the pre soak rain the soil surface was covered with a plastic sheet for 24 h to prevent evaporation of soil moisture and to allow soil consolidation and moisture equilibration all the simulation experiments were run for 60 min with runoff sediment samples collected every 2 min during the rainfall using a container after the rainfall the runoff and sediment collected in the containers were weighed and then allowed to settle for 24 h the supernatant was then removed and the sediment samples were oven dried at 105 c for 12 h after which each was weighed 2 2 data analysis the workflow for this analysis is shown in fig 2 analysis of variance anova was performed to determine the significance of the main effects and interactions between clipping intensity rainfall intensity and slope gradient on the runoff depth and soil loss using the glm multivariate procedure in ibm spss statistics 20 for windows variation partitioning was used to calculate the independent and shared influences of rainfall intensity clipping intensity and slope gradient on soil erosion under different experimental conditions variation partitioning primarily uses adjusted r2 to assess the partitions explained by the explanatory tables and their combinations okland 2003 structural equation modeling sem was then calculated to investigate the relative effect and the direct and indirect pathways of different factors rainfall intensity clipping intensity and slope gradient regulating runoff production and soil loss grace 2006 weighted least squares means and variance adjusted estimation was used to fit the model during sem the tucker lewis index tli goodness of fit index gfi standardized root mean square residual srmr and root mean square error of approximation rmsea were applied to determine the model fit adequacy the fit indices are interpreted using rules of thumb tli 0 90 gfi 0 90 srmr 0 08 and rmsea 0 05 are considered to indicate a good fit the vegan and lavaan packages of the r program was used to calculate the variation partitioning and construct the sem in this study the response surface method rsm was applied to assess the optimal clipping intensity under different experimental conditions in the optimization process important parameters like clipping intensity rainfall intensity and slope gradient can be considered as independent variables two metrics i e soil loss increment ratio si equation 3 and the ratio of soil loss increment to runoff depth increment rsd equation 4 were used as dependent variables to represent the ability of the different treatments to regulate runoff and soil loss the box behnken design was used to support the standard response surface method and the ridge analysis method was used to determine the appropriate clipping intensity rainfall intensity and slope gradient lenth 2010 hou et al 2020 rsm was implemented with the rsm package of the r program 1 rd rv pa 2 sl sla pa 3 si sl n c s n c s 4

results 3 1 runoff production and soil loss clipping intensity increased runoff depth and soil loss table 2 however the increase in the percentage of runoff depth and soil loss was not synchronized compared to the no clipping treatment the runoff depth for the light clipping heavy clipping and clear clipping treatments increased by 3 83 5 57 mm 42 10 86 7 85 mm 119 and 27 19 16 78 mm 299 and the soil loss increased by 22 43 50 04 g m 2 76 23 69 37 42 g m 2 80 and 138 40 111 55 g m 2 470 respectively these results mean that the clear clipping treatment had a greater effect on soil loss than on runoff depth while the heavy clipping treatment had a greater effect on runoff depth than on soil loss soil loss was slightly different between the light and heavy clipping treatments but the runoff depth was obviously different table 2 the variability of runoff depth and soil loss was higher under conditions with more vegetation cover smaller slope gradient and lower rainfall intensity table 2 these results imply that it is possible to find an appropriate clipping intensity to increase runoff production and limit soil loss within an acceptable range rainfall intensity and its interaction with clipping intensity significantly affected runoff depth and soil loss table 3 runoff depth and soil loss for the light clipping heavy clipping and clear clipping treatments in the three rainfall intensities were higher than those for the no clipping treatments with corresponding rainfall intensities and gradually increased with increasing rainfall intensity fig 3 a and 3c the runoff depth for the light clipping heavy clipping and clear clipping treatments was 1 14 2 56 and 6 73 times of the no clipping treatment in the 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity and was 1 39 2 02 and 2 94 times that of the no clipping treatment in the 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensity soil loss for the light clipping heavy clipping and clear clipping treatments was 0 45 0 99 and 5 01 times that of the no clipping treatment in the 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity and was 1 34 1 67 and 5 35 times that of the no clipping treatment in the 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensity these results indicate that increasing rainfall intensity strengthened the clipping effect on soil loss while weakening the clipping effect on runoff depth slope gradient and its interaction with clipping intensity significantly influenced runoff depth and soil loss table 3 runoff depth and soil loss for the no clipping light clipping and heavy clipping treatments at the three slope gradients were lower for the clear clipping treatments fig 3b and 3d except for the clear clipping treatment the mean runoff depth of the no clipping light clipping and heavy clipping treatments increased with slope gradient fig 3b the runoff depths of the light clipping heavy clipping and clear clipping treatments were 1 83 3 21 and 10 33 times that of the no clipping treatment at the 18 slope and were 1 02 1 58 and 1 98 times that of the no clipping treatment at the 58 slope this indicates that as the slope gradient increases the effect of clipping on runoff depth decreases the mean soil loss at the 36 slope was significantly greater than that at the 58 and 18 slopes for the no clipping light clipping and clear clipping treatments fig 3d indicating that there might be a critical slope gradient for soil loss around 36 slope 3 2 decoupling influencing factors of soil loss variation partitioning was used to quantify the independent and shared explained variation of each factor on soil erosion under different experimental conditions fig 4 the effect of rainfall intensity explained variation 0 26 on soil loss is slightly stronger than that of clipping intensity explained variation 0 24 followed by slope gradient explained variation 0 05 fig 4k in general the variations in influencing factors on soil loss can be explained by higher clipping intensity rainfall intensity and slope gradient the explained variation of rainfall intensity on soil loss for the heavy clipping and clear clipping treatments was higher for the no clipping and light clipping treatments fig 4a 4d the effect of rainfall intensity increased sharply in the clear clipping treatment without above ground vegetation interception indicating that heavily clipped vegetation enhanced the effect of rainfall intensity on soil erosion the explained variation in slope gradient varied erratically under different clipping intensities due to the critical slope gradient at around 36 fig 4a and 4b in fig 4e 4 g the effect of clipping intensity explained variation 0 27 0 55 is larger than that of slope gradient explained variation 0 04 0 06 for three rainfall intensities increasing rainfall intensity increased the clipping effect on soil loss and the higher rainfall intensity was more sensitive to variations in slope gradient fig 4e 4 g with increasing slope gradient the clipping effect on soil loss became stronger fig 4h 4j the 36 slope was more sensitive to variations in rainfall intensity fig 4i in summary increasing rainfall intensity and slope gradient increased the clipping effect on soil loss the role of rainfall intensity and slope gradient on soil loss became stronger in the heavy clipping treatment the structural equation model results reflect the complex relationship of each influencing factor on runoff depth and soil loss fig 5 rainfall intensity had the strongest effect on runoff path coefficient 0 67 and soil loss path coefficient 0 48 indicating that rainfall intensity plays the leading role in runoff production and soil erosion the effect of clipping intensity was stronger on runoff path coefficient 0 58 and soil loss path coefficient 0 48 than that of slope gradient path coefficient 0 16 and 0 20 for the effect of a single factor on runoff depth and soil loss the effect of rainfall intensity and clipping intensity on runoff depth was greater than that of soil loss while the effect of slope gradient on soil loss was greater than that of runoff depth these results suggest that rainfall and local terrain conditions should be considered when determining an appropriate clipping intensity to avoid causing severe soil erosion 3 3 optimal clipping intensity the rsm was carried out to describe the relationship between vegetation cover after clipping treatment rainfall intensity and slope gradient with the si equation 3 and rsd equation 4 indices fig 6 the results of the ridge analysis method suggest that the si index reached the minimum 0 20 under the condition of 85 mm h 1 rainfall intensity and 48 vegetation cover after clipping treatment on the 42 slope fig 6a the optimal vegetation cover after clipping treatment was 23 at 98 mm h 1 rainfall intensity and a 32 slope when the rsd index reached the minimum 4 44 g mm 1 fig 6b in summary the optimal clipping intensity was between the light and heavy clipping intensity treatments the recommended vegetation cover after clipping treatment was 23 48 which could significantly increase surface runoff production and limit soil loss within the acceptable range fig 6 shows that the si and rsd indices increased rapidly on slopes 36 suggesting that the clipping management slope should not exceed 36 4 discussion 4 1 optimal clipping intensity to balance soil erosion control and runoff production vegetation restoration is a safeguard measure to reduce soil erosion and protect the ecological environment and can be effective for erosion control under a wide range of environmental conditions fiener et al 2011 ran et al 2013 wu et al 2020 shi et al 2022 vegetation reduces soil erosion through the following processes a protecting the soil from direct raindrop impact by intercepting raindrops and reducing their energy b reducing surface runoff velocity by providing additional surface roughness and c holding soil particles in place by physically binding soil particles together to form a mechanical barrier to soil and water movement ran et al 2013 hou et al 2020 shi et al 2022 the above ground and below ground parts of vegetation have different relative contributions to the runoff production and soil loss zhou and shangguan 2007 zhang et al 2012 li and pan 2018 lin et al 2019 therefore clipping management alters the limiting factor of the runoff and soil erosion processes by reducing the above ground vegetation cover and retaining the roots and litter clipped vegetation with lower surface roughness could accelerate surface runoff velocity and increase the runoff generation prosser et al 1995 assouline and ben hur 2006 ding and fu 2022 the retained stem litter layer and roots maintain the soil resistance thus preventing severe soil erosion lin et al 2019 ding and fu 2022 this is consistent with the findings that the effects of clipping intensity on runoff production and soil loss are not synchronized table 2 and fig 6 the increased runoff ratio is higher than the soil loss ratio at the optimal clipping intensity therefore one aim of this study was to find an optimal vegetation clipping intensity to increase surface runoff yield and limit soil loss within an acceptable range the recommended clipping intensity was between the light and heavy clipping intensity treatments with 23 48 vegetation cover after clipping this result is lower than previous studies ran et al 2013 yan et al 2013 shi et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 which may be due to the use of different methods to control vegetation cover previous studies yan et al 2013 hou et al 2020 shi et al 2022 used scouring modeling experiments or simulated rainfall on artificial grassland with planted vegetation coverage rather than clipping natural grassland to specific coverages which maintains the underground roots and some plant residues various vegetation components have different relative contributions to controlling runoff production and soil loss zhou and shangguan 2007 zhang et al 2012 li and pan 2018 lin et al 2019 in general the above ground parts of vegetation canopy stems litter leaves shoots have a greater effect on reducing runoff and runoff velocity than the below ground parts roots while the below ground parts are relatively more conducive to reducing soil loss than the above ground parts lin et al 2019 ding and fu 2022 based on the si index results of rsm fig 6a and the critical slope for soil loss fig 3d the slope on which clipping management is applied should not exceed 36 which can be explained by the theory of previous studies koulouri and giourga 2007 li and pan 2018 han et al 2021 steep slopes have a limited capacity to control soil erosion which exceeds the protective benefits of soil properties or plant cover it is important to consider whether the recommendations of this study for optimal clipping management can be applied in practice according to the erosive rainfall events in the study area from 2014 to 2019 table 1 the maximum rainfall depth and rainfall intensity of erosive rainfall were within the range of this simulated rainfall experiment implying that the optimal clipping intensity could perform well for soil erosion and runoff regulation during natural rainfall events in the study area region however the application of the critical vegetation cover after clipping found in this study 23 48 to other areas should be done with caution this is because apart from vegetation management hydrological and erosional processes are influenced by other factors such as rainfall characteristics topography and soil texture el kateb et al 2013 wu et al 2020 han et al 2021 wang et al 2021 ke and zhang 2022 4 2 effects of clipping intensity rainfall intensity slope gradient and their interactions on runoff production and soil loss the hydrological and erosional processes of clipped grasslands become more complex under the influence of rainfall and topography wu et al 2018 pan et al 2019 ke and zhang 2022 wang et al 2023 in this study heavy rainfall intensity weakened the effect of clipping intensity on runoff depth fig 3a heavy rainfall with high raindrop energy hits the canopy leaves causing raindrops to be intercepted on the leaf surface and then fall from the leaf surface which is not conducive to rainwater storage on the canopy leaves thus weakening the role of vegetation wang et al 2021 however increasing clipping intensity increased the effect of rainfall intensity on soil loss fig 4a 4d heavier clipping treatments could increase the proportion of unintercepted direct raindrops hitting the soil surface the direct impact of raindrops could rapidly disrupt the aggregate structure of the surface soil in the absence of above ground vegetation increasing the number of loose soil particles pan et al 2019 in addition higher rainfall intensity was more sensitive to variations in slope gradient for soil loss fig 4e 4 g similar to the findings of mahmoodabadi and sajjadi 2016 from an energy perspective the downward component force of gravity along the slope surface increases with increasing slope gradient the enormous energy generated by increased runoff generation carries more soil particles wu et al 2018 the differences in runoff depth between clipping intensities became smaller with increasing slope gradient fig 3b implying that the role of vegetation cover after the clipping treatment was gradually weakened with increasing slope gradient and the role of slope gradient was gradually strengthened several studies have reported similar results cao et al 2017 lin et al 2019 hou et al 2020 at the 36 slope soil loss was more sensitive to variations in rainfall intensity fig 4h 4j possibly due to the complexity of critical slope characteristics the rain bearing area decreased with increasing slope gradient which reduced the actual rainfall depth and runoff scouring energy pan et al 2006 huang et al 2013 meanwhile the downward component of the surface soil under gravity increased along the slope which increased the instability of the surface soil and made it easier for runoff to strip and transport soil particles fox and bryan 2000 wu et al 2017 in addition soil loss is more affected by slope gradient than runoff depth fig 5 which is consistent with assouline and ben hur 2006 who attributed soil loss to the different combinations of rainfall intensities and slope gradients 4 3 implications and uncertainties in this study the differences in the runoff erosion process between different clipping intensities plots were attributed to the complex interaction between vegetation rainfall intensity and slope gradient in general clipping management showed comprehensive effects on the soil erosion control and runoff augmentation especially slopes lower than 36 with 23 48 vegetation cover after clipping the optimal clipping management increased surface runoff yield to meet the demands of the watershed water resources and limited soil loss within an acceptable range therefore with regard to the development of ecological environments in semi arid areas where water is limited clipping management could be considered for soil loss control as well as water resource conservation during vegetation restoration although our study determined the erosion control and runoff augmentation performance of different clipped grasslands during the field experiments there are still some limitations this study was conducted using short term controllable simulated rainfall experiments and the rainfall amounts and intensities of natural rainfall events are lower than in the simulated rainfall experiments therefore the optimal clipping intensity inferred here may be lower in practical application in addition the influence of grassland clipping management on plant cover litter mass and root biomass exhibited significant seasonality shi et al 2021 which affects the temporal variability of grassland runoff generation and soil erosion therefore long term field observations are needed to compensate for possible shortcomings of short term experiments future studies should focus on the temporal variability of hydrological and erosional characteristics of clipped vegetations based on long term field experiments with natural rainfall despite these limitations the analysis of runoff maintenance and soil loss control of different clipping management practices is useful and could potentially contribute to the sustainability of vegetation restoration functions in semi arid areas 5 conclusion this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of clipping management on soil erosion control and surface water resource supply in the semi arid areas which is important for land managers to consider when developing effective restoration plans our results demonstrate that clipping management is potential and practical for balancing soil erosion control and runoff production and suggest that optimal clipping intensity could increase surface runoff and limit soil loss within an acceptable range a vegetation cover of 23 48 after clipping treatment was recommended in slopes not exceeding 36 rainfall intensity and slope increased the clipping effect on soil loss the runoff erosion process on clipped slopes varied with rainfall intensity and slope gradient therefore local rainfall and topography need to be considered in the clipping management practice future studies should focus on the temporal variability of hydrological and erosional characteristics of clipped vegetations based on long term field experiments with natural rainfall to compensate for the possible shortcomings of short term simulation experiments this would further optimize the trade off between soil erosion control and surface water resources and improve the practicability of clipping management in

2084,clipping management by reducing the above ground parts of grassland has been gradually introduced to offset some of the additional issues caused by large scale vegetation restoration such as the formation of a dry soil layer approaching the limits of watershed water resources and reducing the sustainability of vegetation therefore there is a scientific and practical need to evaluate the effectiveness of clipping management on runoff and erosion processes to ensure a balance between erosion control surface water supply and vegetation sustainability in this study simulated rainfall experiments with four levels of clipping intensities no clipping light clipping heavy clipping and clear clipping were conducted to explore the mechanism of runoff and soil loss response under three rainfall intensities i e 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 and three slope gradients i e 18 36 and 58 using structural equation modeling and variation partitioning the results showed that the runoff depth increased by 42 119 and 299 respectively and the soil loss increased by 76 80 and 470 respectively in the light heavy and clear clipping treatments compared with the no clipping treatment indicating that the increase in the percentage of runoff production and soil loss was not synchronized according to the optimizing results of response surface method the recommended vegetation cover after clipping was 23 48 and the slope gradient of clipped vegetation should not exceed 36 which increased surface runoff while limiting soil erosion within an acceptable range runoff production and soil loss were primarily determined by rainfall intensity followed by clipping intensity and slope gradient increasing rainfall intensity and slope gradient increased the effect of clipping on soil loss therefore local rainfall and topography need to be considered in the application of clipping management this study provides valuable insights into the use of clipping treatment as a sustainable management strategy for mitigating soil erosion and conserving surface water resources and has important implications for developing restoration plans to promote sustainability in semi arid ecosystems

subject to the most severe soil erosion in the world especially in the northern part with average soil erosion of up to 5 000 25 000 t km 2 y 1 before 1999 zhao et al 2013 which is the main environmental limitation of the loess plateau feng et al 2016 to control soil erosion and protect the environment the chinese government has implemented the grain for green program since 1999 shi et al 2020 wei et al 2022 which has achieved remarkable results the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi on the loess plateau increased from 0 42 to 0 62 from 2001 to 2020 he et al 2022 and the increased vegetation significantly reduced soil erosion ran et al 2013 shi et al 2022 the measured sediment discharge at tongguan station on the yellow river has decreased from 1 6 billion t y 1 to 200 300 million t y 1 and runoff has been significantly reduced shi et al 2022 indicating that the water and sediment conditions of the yellow river have changed significantly with the implementation of the grain for green program in general the benefits of large scale revegetation on the loess plateau have been confirmed ran et al 2013 wu et al 2020 he et al 2022 however additional issues related to large scale revegetation of the loess plateau in china have emerged in recent years for example the sustainability of water resources is reaching its limits gao et al 2011 feng et al 2016 reduced soil water content has led to the phenomenon of the dry soil layer on the loess plateau wang et al 2015 which has caused vegetation mortality and in some cases made the biotic community unsustainable wang et al 2012 the water yield of watershed has been significantly reduced gao et al 2011 feng et al 2016 shi et al 2022 which has affected the ecology economy and domestic water availability of the yellow river in a word the large scale revegetation of the loess plateau has effectively controlled the soil erosion rate and conserved environmental resources but has also caused additional issues feng et al 2016 pan et al 2019 wu et al 2020 shi et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 however most of the studies conducted focus on the control functions of vegetation treatments on runoff and soil erosion to determine the critical vegetation cover as a guideline for vegetation plantation programs ran et al 2013 feng et al 2016 chen et al 2018 yao et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 neglecting their negative impacts on the local ecological hydrology and water resource use fang 2021 in this context how to continuously implement vegetation restoration and strike a balance between soil erosion control and surface runoff maintenance is crucial for the sustainability of the grain for green program on the loess plateau in recent years clipping management which reduces the above ground part of vegetation and retains the stem litter layer and roots has been gradually recommended and adopted in the grain for green program based on ecological and economic analyses pan et al 2019 on the one hand clipping management can reduce soil water depletion by decreasing vegetation cover to benefit the restored vegetation and ecosystem functions li et al 2015 li et al 2016 on the other hand it can help feed animals and increase farmers income by collecting and selling clipped residues pan et al 2019 in fact previous studies have confirmed that clipping management is potentially changing hydrological and erosional characteristics such as rainfall interception splash erosion reduction soil detachment and transport surface runoff generation and soil loss merz et al 2009 pan et al 2019 furthermore the above ground and below ground parts of vegetation have different relative contributions to the reduction of runoff generation and soil loss zhou and shangguan 2007 zhang et al 2012 li and pan 2018 lin et al 2019 runoff was influenced by both the above and below ground parts of the vegetation while soil erosion is mainly controlled by below ground part of the vegetation de figueiredo et al 2016 lin et al 2019 ding and fu 2022 these preliminary studies demonstrated that it is possible to regulate runoff production and soil loss by clipping vegetation however there are few studies on the effects of clipping management on soil erosion and only simple quantitative comparisons are conducted to compare variations in runoff production and soil loss before and after clipping sun et al 2007 xue et al 2011 xu et al 2012 pan et al 2019 and most studies on clipped vegetation are mainly interested in the effects of plant diversity soil microbial properties and soil carbon and nitrogen storage shahzad et al 2012 carey et al 2015 wei et al 2016 du et al 2022 grégoire et al 2022 with little consideration of the optimal clipping management based on the hydrological and erosional processes this knowledge gap needs to be addressed and further studies on the optimal clipping management to balance surface runoff production and soil erosion control for revegetated slopes should be conducted to guide the implementation of measures runoff and soil erosion processes on revegetated slopes involve many factors such as climate topography and soil texture yao et al 2018 dunkerley 2021 ke and zhang 2022 sadeghi et al 2022 sarkar et al 2022 the complex interactions between rainfall vegetation and slope gradient in runoff and erosion processes have received considerable attention from researchers cammeraat 2004 jiang et al 2014 lin et al 2019 pan et al 2019 wu et al 2020 tang et al 2021 ke and zhang 2022 found that the potential for both runoff production and soil loss on vegetated slopes varies with rainfall intensity and slope gradient when rainfall intensity exceeds certain thresholds the impact of vegetation cover patterns on runoff and soil loss may be weakened cammeraat 2004 tang et al 2021 the effect of vegetation cover on soil erosion control increased jiang et al 2014 or initially increased and then decreased wu et al 2020 with increasing in slope gradient while higher vegetation cover decreased the sensitivity of runoff production and soil loss reduction benefits to slope gradient lin et al 2019 as mentioned above previous studies have only focused on a single vegetation type or artificial grasslands with planted vegetation cover which differs significantly from the clipped natural grasslands wang et al 2023 resulting in different relationships between runoff and soil loss and rainfall intensity and slope gradient on clipped slopes merz et al 2009 pan et al 2019 however there are insufficient data available to quantify the effects of rainfall and slope gradient on the hydrological and erosional characteristics of clipped slopes therefore it is necessary to systematically investigate the complex interactions between clipping management rainfall intensity and slope gradient on runoff generation and soil loss which is essential to assess the effectiveness of clipping management on soil erosion and surface runoff generation and to guide the application of clipping management in semi arid areas with water limitations we hypothesize that the effects of clipping management on runoff production and soil loss are not synchronized under different conditions based on this hypothesis we designed an experiment with four levels of clipping intensity under different slope gradients and simulated rainfall intensities to 1 analyze the characteristics of runoff and soil loss responses to the clipping management 2 quantify the effects of clipping intensity rainfall intensity and slope gradient and their interactions on soil erosion 3 determine the optimal clipping intensity for the restored grassland to balance surface runoff production and soil erosion control these findings could clarify how to utilize clipping management and provide guidance to local farmers and decision makers for the development of restoration plans to promote sustainability in semi arid ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experimental design this study was conducted in the liudaogou watershed latitude 38 46 38 51 n longitude 110 21 110 23 e located in the northern loess plateau shaanxi province china fig 1 a the climate is semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 437 mm yr 1 with approximately 70 80 of the total rainfall occurring from june to september according to the meteorological data from the shenmu soil erosion and environment experimental station analysis of erosive rainfall events in the study area from 2014 to 2019 table1 where rainfall events that generated runoff were considered erosive rainfall events liu et al 2022 showed that rainfall depth for erosive events ranged from 9 50 109 60 mm and i30 ranged from 3 60 54 00 mm h 1 prior to the establishment of the experiment the study site was subjected to natural restoration for approximately 15 years which was dominated by bunge needlegrass and stipa grandis fig 1b the soil texture was classified as a sandy loam usda soil taxonomy with 67 90 sand 27 94 silt 4 16 clay and 0 54 organic matter experimental runoff plots were constructed using metal sheets with dimensions of 6 m length 2 m width a metal runoff collector was placed at the bottom of the plot to direct runoff into a container fig 1b according to the typical rainfall intensity of storms that cause severe soil erosion and major surface slopes in the hilly loess region zhou and wang 1987 the experimental treatments for this study included a combination of three rainfall intensities 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 and three slope gradients 18 36 and 58 on each slope the four clipping treatments were applied no clipping with approximately 70 vegetation cover light clipping with approximately 50 vegetation cover heavy clipping with approximately 25 vegetation cover and clear clipping without above ground vegetation a total of 36 simulated rainfall experiments 4 clipping treatments 3 rainfall intensities 3 slope gradients were set up without replication vegetation was clipped to a height of 0 2 cm above the soil surface without removing the root and litter below the clipping line and the unclipped vegetation was distributed relatively evenly across the plot in general the simulated rainfall experiment was completed within one week after the clipping treatment vegetation cover the ratio of the soil surface area covered by vegetation to the total soil surface area was determined by the point intercept method using gridded quadrats gao et al 2017 the pre soak rain was applied to maintain consistent soil moisture between 10 and 15 among experiments which was measured by the tdr 300 after the pre soak rain the soil surface was covered with a plastic sheet for 24 h to prevent evaporation of soil moisture and to allow soil consolidation and moisture equilibration all the simulation experiments were run for 60 min with runoff sediment samples collected every 2 min during the rainfall using a container after the rainfall the runoff and sediment collected in the containers were weighed and then allowed to settle for 24 h the supernatant was then removed and the sediment samples were oven dried at 105 c for 12 h after which each was weighed 2 2 data analysis the workflow for this analysis is shown in fig 2 analysis of variance anova was performed to determine the significance of the main effects and interactions between clipping intensity rainfall intensity and slope gradient on the runoff depth and soil loss using the glm multivariate procedure in ibm spss statistics 20 for windows variation partitioning was used to calculate the independent and shared influences of rainfall intensity clipping intensity and slope gradient on soil erosion under different experimental conditions variation partitioning primarily uses adjusted r2 to assess the partitions explained by the explanatory tables and their combinations okland 2003 structural equation modeling sem was then calculated to investigate the relative effect and the direct and indirect pathways of different factors rainfall intensity clipping intensity and slope gradient regulating runoff production and soil loss grace 2006 weighted least squares means and variance adjusted estimation was used to fit the model during sem the tucker lewis index tli goodness of fit index gfi standardized root mean square residual srmr and root mean square error of approximation rmsea were applied to determine the model fit adequacy the fit indices are interpreted using rules of thumb tli 0 90 gfi 0 90 srmr 0 08 and rmsea 0 05 are considered to indicate a good fit the vegan and lavaan packages of the r program was used to calculate the variation partitioning and construct the sem in this study the response surface method rsm was applied to assess the optimal clipping intensity under different experimental conditions in the optimization process important parameters like clipping intensity rainfall intensity and slope gradient can be considered as independent variables two metrics i e soil loss increment ratio si equation 3 and the ratio of soil loss increment to runoff depth increment rsd equation 4 were used as dependent variables to represent the ability of the different treatments to regulate runoff and soil loss the box behnken design was used to support the standard response surface method and the ridge analysis method was used to determine the appropriate clipping intensity rainfall intensity and slope gradient lenth 2010 hou et al 2020 rsm was implemented with the rsm package of the r program 1 rd rv pa 2 sl sla pa 3 si sl n c s n c s 4

results 3 1 runoff production and soil loss clipping intensity increased runoff depth and soil loss table 2 however the increase in the percentage of runoff depth and soil loss was not synchronized compared to the no clipping treatment the runoff depth for the light clipping heavy clipping and clear clipping treatments increased by 3 83 5 57 mm 42 10 86 7 85 mm 119 and 27 19 16 78 mm 299 and the soil loss increased by 22 43 50 04 g m 2 76 23 69 37 42 g m 2 80 and 138 40 111 55 g m 2 470 respectively these results mean that the clear clipping treatment had a greater effect on soil loss than on runoff depth while the heavy clipping treatment had a greater effect on runoff depth than on soil loss soil loss was slightly different between the light and heavy clipping treatments but the runoff depth was obviously different table 2 the variability of runoff depth and soil loss was higher under conditions with more vegetation cover smaller slope gradient and lower rainfall intensity table 2 these results imply that it is possible to find an appropriate clipping intensity to increase runoff production and limit soil loss within an acceptable range rainfall intensity and its interaction with clipping intensity significantly affected runoff depth and soil loss table 3 runoff depth and soil loss for the light clipping heavy clipping and clear clipping treatments in the three rainfall intensities were higher than those for the no clipping treatments with corresponding rainfall intensities and gradually increased with increasing rainfall intensity fig 3 a and 3c the runoff depth for the light clipping heavy clipping and clear clipping treatments was 1 14 2 56 and 6 73 times of the no clipping treatment in the 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity and was 1 39 2 02 and 2 94 times that of the no clipping treatment in the 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensity soil loss for the light clipping heavy clipping and clear clipping treatments was 0 45 0 99 and 5 01 times that of the no clipping treatment in the 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity and was 1 34 1 67 and 5 35 times that of the no clipping treatment in the 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensity these results indicate that increasing rainfall intensity strengthened the clipping effect on soil loss while weakening the clipping effect on runoff depth slope gradient and its interaction with clipping intensity significantly influenced runoff depth and soil loss table 3 runoff depth and soil loss for the no clipping light clipping and heavy clipping treatments at the three slope gradients were lower for the clear clipping treatments fig 3b and 3d except for the clear clipping treatment the mean runoff depth of the no clipping light clipping and heavy clipping treatments increased with slope gradient fig 3b the runoff depths of the light clipping heavy clipping and clear clipping treatments were 1 83 3 21 and 10 33 times that of the no clipping treatment at the 18 slope and were 1 02 1 58 and 1 98 times that of the no clipping treatment at the 58 slope this indicates that as the slope gradient increases the effect of clipping on runoff depth decreases the mean soil loss at the 36 slope was significantly greater than that at the 58 and 18 slopes for the no clipping light clipping and clear clipping treatments fig 3d indicating that there might be a critical slope gradient for soil loss around 36 slope 3 2 decoupling influencing factors of soil loss variation partitioning was used to quantify the independent and shared explained variation of each factor on soil erosion under different experimental conditions fig 4 the effect of rainfall intensity explained variation 0 26 on soil loss is slightly stronger than that of clipping intensity explained variation 0 24 followed by slope gradient explained variation 0 05 fig 4k in general the variations in influencing factors on soil loss can be explained by higher clipping intensity rainfall intensity and slope gradient the explained variation of rainfall intensity on soil loss for the heavy clipping and clear clipping treatments was higher for the no clipping and light clipping treatments fig 4a 4d the effect of rainfall intensity increased sharply in the clear clipping treatment without above ground vegetation interception indicating that heavily clipped vegetation enhanced the effect of rainfall intensity on soil erosion the explained variation in slope gradient varied erratically under different clipping intensities due to the critical slope gradient at around 36 fig 4a and 4b in fig 4e 4 g the effect of clipping intensity explained variation 0 27 0 55 is larger than that of slope gradient explained variation 0 04 0 06 for three rainfall intensities increasing rainfall intensity increased the clipping effect on soil loss and the higher rainfall intensity was more sensitive to variations in slope gradient fig 4e 4 g with increasing slope gradient the clipping effect on soil loss became stronger fig 4h 4j the 36 slope was more sensitive to variations in rainfall intensity fig 4i in summary increasing rainfall intensity and slope gradient increased the clipping effect on soil loss the role of rainfall intensity and slope gradient on soil loss became stronger in the heavy clipping treatment the structural equation model results reflect the complex relationship of each influencing factor on runoff depth and soil loss fig 5 rainfall intensity had the strongest effect on runoff path coefficient 0 67 and soil loss path coefficient 0 48 indicating that rainfall intensity plays the leading role in runoff production and soil erosion the effect of clipping intensity was stronger on runoff path coefficient 0 58 and soil loss path coefficient 0 48 than that of slope gradient path coefficient 0 16 and 0 20 for the effect of a single factor on runoff depth and soil loss the effect of rainfall intensity and clipping intensity on runoff depth was greater than that of soil loss while the effect of slope gradient on soil loss was greater than that of runoff depth these results suggest that rainfall and local terrain conditions should be considered when determining an appropriate clipping intensity to avoid causing severe soil erosion 3 3 optimal clipping intensity the rsm was carried out to describe the relationship between vegetation cover after clipping treatment rainfall intensity and slope gradient with the si equation 3 and rsd equation 4 indices fig 6 the results of the ridge analysis method suggest that the si index reached the minimum 0 20 under the condition of 85 mm h 1 rainfall intensity and 48 vegetation cover after clipping treatment on the 42 slope fig 6a the optimal vegetation cover after clipping treatment was 23 at 98 mm h 1 rainfall intensity and a 32 slope when the rsd index reached the minimum 4 44 g mm 1 fig 6b in summary the optimal clipping intensity was between the light and heavy clipping intensity treatments the recommended vegetation cover after clipping treatment was 23 48 which could significantly increase surface runoff production and limit soil loss within the acceptable range fig 6 shows that the si and rsd indices increased rapidly on slopes 36 suggesting that the clipping management slope should not exceed 36 4 discussion 4 1 optimal clipping intensity to balance soil erosion control and runoff production vegetation restoration is a safeguard measure to reduce soil erosion and protect the ecological environment and can be effective for erosion control under a wide range of environmental conditions fiener et al 2011 ran et al 2013 wu et al 2020 shi et al 2022 vegetation reduces soil erosion through the following processes a protecting the soil from direct raindrop impact by intercepting raindrops and reducing their energy b reducing surface runoff velocity by providing additional surface roughness and c holding soil particles in place by physically binding soil particles together to form a mechanical barrier to soil and water movement ran et al 2013 hou et al 2020 shi et al 2022 the above ground and below ground parts of vegetation have different relative contributions to the runoff production and soil loss zhou and shangguan 2007 zhang et al 2012 li and pan 2018 lin et al 2019 therefore clipping management alters the limiting factor of the runoff and soil erosion processes by reducing the above ground vegetation cover and retaining the roots and litter clipped vegetation with lower surface roughness could accelerate surface runoff velocity and increase the runoff generation prosser et al 1995 assouline and ben hur 2006 ding and fu 2022 the retained stem litter layer and roots maintain the soil resistance thus preventing severe soil erosion lin et al 2019 ding and fu 2022 this is consistent with the findings that the effects of clipping intensity on runoff production and soil loss are not synchronized table 2 and fig 6 the increased runoff ratio is higher than the soil loss ratio at the optimal clipping intensity therefore one aim of this study was to find an optimal vegetation clipping intensity to increase surface runoff yield and limit soil loss within an acceptable range the recommended clipping intensity was between the light and heavy clipping intensity treatments with 23 48 vegetation cover after clipping this result is lower than previous studies ran et al 2013 yan et al 2013 shi et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 which may be due to the use of different methods to control vegetation cover previous studies yan et al 2013 hou et al 2020 shi et al 2022 used scouring modeling experiments or simulated rainfall on artificial grassland with planted vegetation coverage rather than clipping natural grassland to specific coverages which maintains the underground roots and some plant residues various vegetation components have different relative contributions to controlling runoff production and soil loss zhou and shangguan 2007 zhang et al 2012 li and pan 2018 lin et al 2019 in general the above ground parts of vegetation canopy stems litter leaves shoots have a greater effect on reducing runoff and runoff velocity than the below ground parts roots while the below ground parts are relatively more conducive to reducing soil loss than the above ground parts lin et al 2019 ding and fu 2022 based on the si index results of rsm fig 6a and the critical slope for soil loss fig 3d the slope on which clipping management is applied should not exceed 36 which can be explained by the theory of previous studies koulouri and giourga 2007 li and pan 2018 han et al 2021 steep slopes have a limited capacity to control soil erosion which exceeds the protective benefits of soil properties or plant cover it is important to consider whether the recommendations of this study for optimal clipping management can be applied in practice according to the erosive rainfall events in the study area from 2014 to 2019 table 1 the maximum rainfall depth and rainfall intensity of erosive rainfall were within the range of this simulated rainfall experiment implying that the optimal clipping intensity could perform well for soil erosion and runoff regulation during natural rainfall events in the study area region however the application of the critical vegetation cover after clipping found in this study 23 48 to other areas should be done with caution this is because apart from vegetation management hydrological and erosional processes are influenced by other factors such as rainfall characteristics topography and soil texture el kateb et al 2013 wu et al 2020 han et al 2021 wang et al 2021 ke and zhang 2022 4 2 effects of clipping intensity rainfall intensity slope gradient and their interactions on runoff production and soil loss the hydrological and erosional processes of clipped grasslands become more complex under the influence of rainfall and topography wu et al 2018 pan et al 2019 ke and zhang 2022 wang et al 2023 in this study heavy rainfall intensity weakened the effect of clipping intensity on runoff depth fig 3a heavy rainfall with high raindrop energy hits the canopy leaves causing raindrops to be intercepted on the leaf surface and then fall from the leaf surface which is not conducive to rainwater storage on the canopy leaves thus weakening the role of vegetation wang et al 2021 however increasing clipping intensity increased the effect of rainfall intensity on soil loss fig 4a 4d heavier clipping treatments could increase the proportion of unintercepted direct raindrops hitting the soil surface the direct impact of raindrops could rapidly disrupt the aggregate structure of the surface soil in the absence of above ground vegetation increasing the number of loose soil particles pan et al 2019 in addition higher rainfall intensity was more sensitive to variations in slope gradient for soil loss fig 4e 4 g similar to the findings of mahmoodabadi and sajjadi 2016 from an energy perspective the downward component force of gravity along the slope surface increases with increasing slope gradient the enormous energy generated by increased runoff generation carries more soil particles wu et al 2018 the differences in runoff depth between clipping intensities became smaller with increasing slope gradient fig 3b implying that the role of vegetation cover after the clipping treatment was gradually weakened with increasing slope gradient and the role of slope gradient was gradually strengthened several studies have reported similar results cao et al 2017 lin et al 2019 hou et al 2020 at the 36 slope soil loss was more sensitive to variations in rainfall intensity fig 4h 4j possibly due to the complexity of critical slope characteristics the rain bearing area decreased with increasing slope gradient which reduced the actual rainfall depth and runoff scouring energy pan et al 2006 huang et al 2013 meanwhile the downward component of the surface soil under gravity increased along the slope which increased the instability of the surface soil and made it easier for runoff to strip and transport soil particles fox and bryan 2000 wu et al 2017 in addition soil loss is more affected by slope gradient than runoff depth fig 5 which is consistent with assouline and ben hur 2006 who attributed soil loss to the different combinations of rainfall intensities and slope gradients 4 3 implications and uncertainties in this study the differences in the runoff erosion process between different clipping intensities plots were attributed to the complex interaction between vegetation rainfall intensity and slope gradient in general clipping management showed comprehensive effects on the soil erosion control and runoff augmentation especially slopes lower than 36 with 23 48 vegetation cover after clipping the optimal clipping management increased surface runoff yield to meet the demands of the watershed water resources and limited soil loss within an acceptable range therefore with regard to the development of ecological environments in semi arid areas where water is limited clipping management could be considered for soil loss control as well as water resource conservation during vegetation restoration although our study determined the erosion control and runoff augmentation performance of different clipped grasslands during the field experiments there are still some limitations this study was conducted using short term controllable simulated rainfall experiments and the rainfall amounts and intensities of natural rainfall events are lower than in the simulated rainfall experiments therefore the optimal clipping intensity inferred here may be lower in practical application in addition the influence of grassland clipping management on plant cover litter mass and root biomass exhibited significant seasonality shi et al 2021 which affects the temporal variability of grassland runoff generation and soil erosion therefore long term field observations are needed to compensate for possible shortcomings of short term experiments future studies should focus on the temporal variability of hydrological and erosional characteristics of clipped vegetations based on long term field experiments with natural rainfall despite these limitations the analysis of runoff maintenance and soil loss control of different clipping management practices is useful and could potentially contribute to the sustainability of vegetation restoration functions in semi arid areas 5 conclusion this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of clipping management on soil erosion control and surface water resource supply in the semi arid areas which is important for land managers to consider when developing effective restoration plans our results demonstrate that clipping management is potential and practical for balancing soil erosion control and runoff production and suggest that optimal clipping intensity could increase surface runoff and limit soil loss within an acceptable range a vegetation cover of 23 48 after clipping treatment was recommended in slopes not exceeding 36 rainfall intensity and slope increased the clipping effect on soil loss the runoff erosion process on clipped slopes varied with rainfall intensity and slope gradient therefore local rainfall and topography need to be considered in the clipping management practice future studies should focus on the temporal variability of hydrological and erosional characteristics of clipped vegetations based on long term field experiments with natural rainfall to compensate for the possible shortcomings of short term simulation experiments this would further optimize the trade off between soil erosion control and surface water resources and improve the practicability of clipping management in
