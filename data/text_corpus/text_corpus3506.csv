17530,haloacetonitriles hans and haloacetamides hams are nitrogenous disinfection byproducts that are present in filter backwash water fbw and sedimentation sludge water ssw in many cases fbw and ssw are recycled to the head of drinking water treatment plants han and ham concentrations in fbw and ssw without additional oxidants ranged from 6 8 to 11 6 nm and 2 9 to 3 6 nm of three hans and four hams respectively upon oxidant addition to fbw and ssw under formation potential conditions concentrations for six hans and six hams ranged from 92 2 to 190 4 nm and 42 2 to 95 5 nm respectively therefore at common fbw and ssw recycle rates 2 to 10 of treated water flows the precursor levels in these recycle waters should not be ignored because they are comparable to levels present in finished water brominated han and chlorinated ham were the dominant species in fbw and ssw respectively the lowest molecular weight ultrafiltration fraction 3 kda contributed the most to han and ham formations the hydrophilic hpi organic fraction contributed the greatest to han precursors in sand fbw and ssw and were the most reactive ham precursors in both sand or carbon fbws fluorescence

volumes of filter backwash water fbw and sedimentation sludge water ssw are produced during water treatment accounting for approximately 2 10 of total water flow in dwtps shafiquzzaman et al 2018 walsh et al 2008 suspended solids natural organic matter nom disinfection byproduct dbp precursors bacteria and inorganic metals e g fe mn and al are present in abundance in fbw and ssw chen et al 2015 mccormick et al 2010 recycling of partially treated fbw or supernatant from ssw treatment is common at dwtps to maximize efficiency in china fbw and ssw are usually treated only via thickener induced precipitation prior to discharging the supernatant to surface waters impacting receiving ecosystems in response to economic development concerns stemming from adverse impacts of surface water discharges new standards for fbw and ssw discharge were recently issued in china therefore fbw and ssw recycling has attracted considerable interest not only to reduce receiving water pollution but also to improve net water production rates within dwtps bourgeois et al 2004 in the usa fbw and ssw are typically pumped to intermittent storage tanks where much of the solids precipitate before being recycled and blended with incoming raw water at the head of the dwtps tobiason et al 2003 recent work showed that recycling sludge supernatant containing polymer residuals and preformed dbps contributes to one specific dbp class nitrosamines that eventually impacts dbps in treated drinking water westerhoff et al 2019 while characteristics of natural organic matter nom that serve as precursors for unregulated dbps have been well studied in source water ersan et al 2019 krasner et al 2013 little is known about the nature of organic material unregulated dbps or dbp precursors in fbw or ssw that are recycled to the head of dwtps mccormick et al 2010 tan et al 2017 all disinfectants react with nom in water to form dbps some of which are potential or known human carcinogens ackerson et al 2018 an et al 2019 plewa et al 2002 2009 more than 600 dbps have been identified in water including trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetonitriles hans and haloacetamides hams chen et al 2010 plewa et al 2008a richardson et al 2007 2011 vu et al 2018 hans and hams are nitrogenous dbps with substantially greater cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than thms and haas karanfil et al 2008 muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2008b hans and hams are typically present at lower concentrations than thms and haas but they still contribute in many cases the greatest to overall toxicity of a treated water sample y h chuang et al 2019 dad et al 2018 komaki et al 2014 plewa et al 2010 wagner et al 2017 hans and other emerging dbps are predicted to exert the majority of the dbp related toxicity risk in drinking water cuthbertson et al 2019 kimura et al 2019 krasner et al 2016 hans and hams primarily dichloroacetonitrile dcan and 2 2 dichloroacetamide dcam have been frequently detected in raw drinking and reuse water sources liew et al 2012 krasner et al 2006 for instance six ham species were detected in drinking water in japan kosaka et al 2016 three ham species were detected in drinking water in england bond et al 2015 four han and ham species were detected in reuse water in the u s zeng et al 2016 and four han and ham species were detected in drinking water in china huang et al 2017 because of their high toxicity and occurrence strategies to control han and ham formations relative to other dbps are emerging as an important research area krasner et al 2006 mckenna et al 2020 removing han and ham precursors before disinfection is more practical than removing the associated dbps after formation because they are nonvolatile rendering practical methods such as air stripping ineffective hanigan et al 2012 jiang et al 2017 nom is composed of a complex mixture of heterogenous organic compounds which act as dbp precursors krasner et al 2018 yang et al 2012 the organic composition and the chemical structure of nom in plant recycled water are more complex and at higher concentration than in raw and treated drinking water krasner et al 2009 studies have shown that recycled fbw and ssw water increases formation of selected dbps although the number of studies is few and there are even fewer studies of the recycled precursors hou et al 2016 tan et al 2017 therefore to control dbp formation during in plant recycling in dwtps it is necessary to better understand the physicochemical properties of nom in reuse water molecular weight mw distribution and hydrophilicity of nom are common tools used to characterize dbp precursors finkbeiner et al 2020 wang et al 2013 xu et al 2007 low mw compounds 3 kda often disproportionately contribute to dbp

hanigan et al 2013 hua et al 2007 phetrak et al 2016 in china canada and turkey hpi fraction was the dominant nom in source water chu et al 2010 hu et al 2016 karapinar et al 2014 lamsal et al 2012 xu et al 2007 wang et al 2013 the characteristics of dom fractions may be due to industrial contaminants dom origins catchment geochemistry rainfall and other factors croué et al 2000 showed that the hpo fraction provided the most reactive thm and haa precursors at least for the studied water source chu et al 2010 found that hpi organic material had the highest dcam reactivity in a major dwtp source water of china these results indicate that different water sources and different nom fractions contain varying dbp precursors the goal of this research was to characterize and quantify han and ham precursors in fbw and ssw recycled water from two dwtps han and ham precursors were characterized using mw and hydrophilicity fractionation plus fluorescence spectral analysis to relate dbp formation to nom reactivity potential treatment methods are also discussed to lessen the dbp impact from fbw and ssw recycling 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sample collection water samples were collected

seven hans and six hams were analyzed by liquid liquid extraction lle and gas chromatography gc 7890b agilent technologies usa equipped with a 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 µm db 1701 column j w scientific usa and an electron capture detector ecd agilent technologies usa han and ham quantification methods are described in supplemental information dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved nitrogen dn of filtered solutions were measured by a total organic carbon toc analyzer multi n c 2100 analytik jena ag germany dissolved organic nitrogen don was calculated by subtracting nitrate nitrite and ammonia concentrations from the dn concentration apha 2005 free and total chlorine concentrations were measured by the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd powder pillow photometric method apha 2005 bromide incorporation factors bifs the fractional extent of bromination of the methyl group for han and ham were calculated as shown in supplemental information the experimental process for mw and hydrophilicity fractionations and analyses were conducted in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality table 1 shows the water quality characteristics for fbw and ssw from the two dwtps both plants use sand filters and generate sand filter backwash water sand fbw additionally dwtp b also has a granular activated carbon filter that generates carbon filter backwash water carbon fbw ssw contained 2 7 5 8 mgdoc l and 0 28 0 46 mgdon l these concentrations were higher than the doc and don in fbw table 1 aromaticity as measured by suva was greater in the fbw than the ssw bromide was up to 4x higher in the ssw than the fbw collectively the higher organic matter and bromide in ssw samples suggests they have greater potential to form dbps compared with fbw samples 3 2 han ham and precursor concentrations 3 2 1 hans and hams fig 1 shows preformed han and ham in fbw and ssw total hans were greater in fbw 6 8 11 6 nm than ssw 2 9 3 6 nm among the seven hans bcan was the most prevalent at 3 6 4 1 nm and 2 9 3 6 nm in fbw and ssw respectively finished water containing free chlorine is used to backwash the sand and carbon filters therefore hans in the fbw form in the finished water before backwashing and also react with organic matter in filters fig s3a han concentrations and speciation in sand and carbon fbws were different than the finished water indicating that hans were primarily generated by reactions between the residual disinfectant with organic matter in the filter while a small fraction 15 18 was from the finished water fig s3c total hams were 5 3 10 5 nm and 2 3 9 9 nm in fbw and ssw respectively among the six hams dcam was present at the highest concentration across all samples and both treatment plants which is consistent with another study of hams in recycled water from 12 dwtps in japan kosaka et al 2016 other ham species i e cam bam and bcam were present only at very low concentrations ham concentrations in sand and carbon fbws were higher than in ssw which were similar to concentrations in raw water fig s3 b notably the concentrations of the few dbps present in the raw water were somewhat greater than the finished waters fig s3 suggesting that the source waters are polluted at low levels with chlorinated and brominated organic matter and that the treatment plants removed at least some of these compounds 3 2 2 han and ham precursors fig 2 a and 2b show han and ham formation potentials in fbw and ssw which are higher in ssw than sand or carbon fbws this is likely due to more dom being present in ssw than in fbw and there was a linear correlation between han fp and don r2 0 92 p 0 05 dwtp a r2 0 99 p 0 05 dwtp b when data were aggregated from raw water ssw and fbw fig 3 a and 3b this indicates that nom particularly don were the major sources of han and ham precursors fig 3c shows that han fp strongly correlated with ham fp r2 0 94 p 0 05 suggesting that both of these n dbps may originate from a common precursor pool another reason may have been the hydrolysis of hans to hams huang et al 2012 among the seven hans only iodoacetonitrile ian was not detected after chlorination and dban formed to the greatest extent in all samples except for carbon fbw han formation can be influenced by bromide concentration because hypobromous acid hobr preferentially substitutes the halogen atom more than hocl allard et al 2015 westerhoff et al 2004 dban is one of the most cyto and genotoxic hans for which data are available wagner et al 2017 and dban 38 9 101 2 nm was formed during fp tests but not formed at detectable levels in the treatment plant from reactions with residual disinfectant this may be attributable to the much lower concentrations formed in the plant where dban may have formed but at levels that were below the detection limit as expected bromide incorporation factors bifs of hans and hams increased with increasing bromide concentrations although a similar trend was not observed for hans fig 3d ssw formed more hans than fbw which could be associated with the bromo haloacetonitriles br hans production in ssw br hans were 73 147 nm which was higher than fbw 27 79 nm total ham fp ranged from 56 4 to 62 9 nm and 73 6 to 95 5 nm in fbw and ssw respectively fig 2b cl ham fps were higher than br ham fps in fbw and ssw despite a strong relationship between br and ham fp this is similar to the findings reported by chu et al 2013 in lake tai water china where the cl ham was the main ham during chlorination 3 3 fractionation and characterization of han and ham precursors 3 3 1 mw distribution low mw 3 kda organic material was the primary dom in nearly all samples regardless of treatment plant or unit process the doc in this fraction accounted for 40 of the total doc fig 4 a and b in ssw collected from dwtp b the 100 kda fraction also contributed 42 of the total doc fig 4 also shows han and ham fps from the fractionated dom the fraction with mw 3 kda contributed the greatest amount of han and ham precursors in all samples accounting for 47 75 and 58 78 of the nonfractionated fps which indicates that low mw organic matter was the primary han and ham precursor this finding agrees with previous results by huang et al 2016 who found the low mw compounds had the greatest dcam yields accounting for more than 54 of the fp the low mw fraction 3 kda also had the greatest br han and br ham fps in all samples accounting for 61 79 and 66 87 of total br han and br ham formation respectively because the mw fractionation had little impact on the bromide concentration table s3 the 3 kda fraction had a greater bromide to doc ratio which likely influenced formation of br dbps 3 3 2 hydrophobic and hydrophilic distributions figs 5 a and 5b show that the hpi fraction accounted for more than 54 of total dom in all samples except carbon fbw carbon fbw contained more hpo components 52 potentially due to the enriched microorganisms in carbon filter that produced hpo soluble microbial products zheng et al 2018 which were subsequently washed into the fbw the highest han concentrations formed from the hpi fraction in sand fbw and ssw more than 57 of total han formation was attributable to the hpi fraction indicating that hpi organics were the primary han precursors in sand fbw and ssw on a dom normalized basis hpi organic matter from the sand fbw and ssw in dwtp a formed 53 8 and 58 1 nmolhan mgc respectively compared with 338 and 108 nmolhan mgc formed from the respective hpo fractions fig s4a this suggests that the hpo fraction is more reactive in forming hans the opposite result was found in dwtp b i e the hpi fraction was more reactive in the carbon fbw hpi and hpo fractions formed almost the same han after chlorination which was opposite to the observed trend for doc br hans were primarily produced by hpi organic matter suggesting that hpi organic matter contained more aliphatic organic matter and was more reactive with hobr than hocl in forming br hans hua et al 2007 alternatively the greater reactivity of the hpi fraction in forming br dbps may be at least partially attributable to the fractionation technique where br is not present in the hpo fraction for ham fps the hpi fraction had the most ham precursors more than 49 for the sand and carbon fbws the hpo fraction in ssw contained 51 of the ham precursors other fractions represented 49 these two opposing results indicate that hpi organic matter was the primary source of ham precursor in sand and carbon fbws and conversely that hpo organic matter dominated the ham precursor pool in ssw the results of dom normalization showed that the hpo fraction was more reactive in forming hams in dwtp a fig s4b higher br ham fps in the hpo fraction indicated that some hpo organic matter was more easily oxidized to hams than hans by hobr 3 3 3 eem spectra area volumes φi n from the eem spectra are shown in fig 6 the corresponding eem fluorescence spectra is provided in fig s5 sand fbw and ssw eem spectra exhibited high intensities in region ⅱ with corresponding area volumes for 35 38 and 32 42 respectively of all the sum of all the regional volumes region ⅱ contributed an even greater proportion of the eem volume for the carbon fbw sample up to 48 this region is typically associated with aromatic protein like compounds and indicates that they were a large component of dom in fbws and ssws figs 6c and 6d show that the mw 3 kda fraction had the greatest intensity volume more than 64 of the total volume which is similar to the proportion of doc han and ham fps in this fraction 41 81 of doc 48 80 of han and 59 75 of ham hpi and hpo fractions contributed the greatest amount to region ⅱ intensity volumes there was not a strong linear correlation between regional area volumes and han fp and ham fp likely because the han and ham formations were impacted more strongly by bromide fig 3c the correlations between region ⅱ area volumes and han fp r2 0 32 p 0 05 and between region i area volumes and ham fp r2 0 63 p 0 05 were better than other regions r2 0 3 p 0 05 fig s7 indicating that aromatic protein like compounds may play a greater role as han and ham precursors than other regions and associated functional groups the close association between the findings for region i and ⅱ mw fractionation and hydrophobicity fractionation fig s7 combined with fp results suggests that low mw hpo hpi aromatic protein like compounds are likely to be the largest source of han and ham precursors in fbws and ssws 3 4 backwash treatment options due to the variable water quality across treatment plants there is no single water treatment method suitable for the reuse of all fbw and ssw low mw and hpi organics have been shown to be the primary han and ham precursors in fbw and ssw but both conventional water treatment processes and advanced treatment process es are more effective at removing the high mw and hpo organic matter chiu et al 2012 hanigan et al 2015 wang et al 2017 therefore attention should be focused on permanent removal of low mw hpi organic matter because of its contribution to ham and han formation and because it is not well removed by current water treatment techniques activated carbon removes hpo matter well and removes some hpi matter and would likely result in reduced ham and han formation from the ssw and fbws but there is conflicting evidence as to whether activated carbon produces water that has an overall toxicity that is less than the untreated samples particularly for samples with high bromide due to greater rejection of doc than of bromide ates et al 2009 cuthbertson et al 2019 2020 mckenna et al 2020 krasner et al 2016 other alternatives are likely to be more energy and cost intensive for example coagulation combined with uf removes dom from water well but is energy intensive well but is energy intensive qian et al 2011 advanced oxidation processes aops especially uv h2o2 and uv cl2 have been proven effective for degrading nom especially low mw and hpi organics through formation of highly reactive radicals y h chuang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 it has also been shown that cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were reduced by combined uv plus chlorine plewa et al 2012 but again these methods are energy intensive thus it may be the most cost effective to consider strategies to either sequester bromide from fbw and ssw or to optimize coagulation strategies which result in limited bromide accumulation in the fbw and ssw 4 conclusion this research provides information and analyses on the han and ham concentrations and precursors in fbw and ssw in dwtps total han precursor loading in fbw and ssw resulted in 92 2 190 4 nm meanwhile total ham precursor loading in fbw and ssw resulted in 42 2 95 5 nm dban precursors tended to dominate the precursor loading and dban is known to be extremely geno and cytotoxic to mammalian cells at typical dilution of 90 98 for fbw and ssw recycle the precursor loading to the head of the plant cannot be ignored any dbp precursors recycled need to be removed a second time during treatment therefore attention should focus on occurrence and permanent removal of low mw hpi organic matter because of its contribution to ham and han formation by permanent removal we mean irreversible desorption from settled solids originating from fbw or ssw low mw and hpi organics which were found to be the main han and ham precursors in fbw and ssw are generally difficult to remove in dwtps the influence of bromide cycling in treatment plants also should not be ignored because high bromide tends to selectively promote the formation of the most toxic hams and hans and also other br dbps doc and don in fbw were higher than levels in the dwtp raw water doc don and bromide concentrations and han and ham fps obtained for ssw were higher than those obtained for raw water therefore treatment strategies should be pursued to remove precursors or preformed dbps in backwash water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

shown that recycled fbw and ssw water increases formation of selected dbps although the number of studies is few and there are even fewer studies of the recycled precursors hou et al 2016 tan et al 2017 therefore to control dbp formation during in plant recycling in dwtps it is necessary to better understand the physicochemical properties of nom in reuse water molecular weight mw distribution and hydrophilicity of nom are common tools used to characterize dbp precursors finkbeiner et al 2020 wang et al 2013 xu et al 2007 low mw compounds 3 kda often disproportionately contribute to dbp

et al 2007 wang et al 2013 the characteristics of dom fractions may be due to industrial contaminants dom origins catchment geochemistry rainfall and other factors croué et al 2000 showed that the hpo fraction provided the most reactive thm and haa precursors at least for the studied water source chu et al 2010 found that hpi organic material had the highest dcam reactivity in a major dwtp source water of china these results indicate that different water sources and different nom fractions contain varying dbp precursors the goal of this research was to characterize and quantify han and ham precursors in fbw and ssw recycled water from two dwtps han and ham precursors were characterized using mw and hydrophilicity fractionation plus fluorescence spectral analysis to relate dbp formation to nom reactivity potential treatment methods are also discussed to lessen the dbp impact from fbw and ssw recycling 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sample collection water samples were collected

seven hans and six hams were analyzed by liquid liquid extraction lle and gas chromatography gc 7890b agilent technologies usa equipped with a 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 µm db 1701 column j w scientific usa

filtered solutions were measured by a total organic carbon toc analyzer multi n c 2100 analytik jena ag germany dissolved organic nitrogen don was calculated by subtracting nitrate nitrite and ammonia concentrations from the dn concentration apha 2005 free and total chlorine concentrations were measured by the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd powder pillow photometric method apha 2005 bromide incorporation factors bifs the fractional extent of bromination of the methyl group for han and ham were calculated as shown in supplemental information the experimental process for mw and hydrophilicity fractionations and analyses were conducted in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality table 1 shows the water quality characteristics for fbw and ssw from the two dwtps both plants use sand filters and generate sand filter backwash water sand fbw additionally dwtp b also has a granular activated carbon filter that generates carbon filter backwash water carbon fbw ssw contained 2 7 5 8 mgdoc l and 0 28 0 46 mgdon l these concentrations were higher than the doc and don in fbw table 1 aromaticity as measured by suva was greater in the fbw than the ssw bromide was up to 4x higher in the ssw than the fbw collectively the higher organic matter and bromide in ssw samples suggests they have greater potential to form dbps compared with fbw samples 3 2 han ham and precursor concentrations 3 2 1 hans and hams fig 1 shows preformed han and ham in fbw and ssw total hans were greater in fbw 6 8 11 6 nm than ssw 2 9 3 6 nm among the seven hans bcan was the most prevalent at 3 6 4 1 nm and 2 9 3 6 nm in fbw and ssw respectively finished water containing free chlorine is used to backwash the sand and carbon filters therefore hans in the fbw form in the finished water before backwashing and also react with organic matter in filters fig s3a han concentrations and speciation in sand and carbon fbws were different than the finished water indicating that hans were primarily generated by reactions between the residual disinfectant with organic matter in the filter while a small fraction 15 18 was from the finished water fig s3c total hams were 5 3 10 5 nm and 2 3 9 9 nm in fbw and ssw respectively among the six hams dcam was present at the highest concentration across all samples and both treatment plants which is consistent with another study of hams in recycled water from 12 dwtps in japan kosaka et al 2016 other ham species i e cam bam and bcam were present only at very low concentrations ham concentrations in sand and carbon fbws were higher than in ssw which were similar to concentrations in raw water fig s3 b notably the concentrations of the few dbps present in the raw water were somewhat greater than the finished waters fig s3 suggesting that the source waters are polluted at low levels with chlorinated and brominated organic matter and that the treatment plants removed at least some of these compounds 3 2 2 han and ham precursors fig 2 a and 2b show han and ham formation potentials in fbw and ssw which are higher in ssw than sand or carbon fbws this is likely due to more dom being present in ssw than in fbw and there was a linear correlation between han fp and don r2 0 92 p 0 05 dwtp a r2 0 99 p 0 05 dwtp b when data were aggregated from raw water ssw and fbw fig 3 a and 3b this indicates that nom particularly don were the major sources of han and ham precursors fig 3c shows that han fp strongly correlated with ham fp r2 0 94 p 0 05 suggesting that both of these n dbps may originate from a common precursor pool another reason may have been the hydrolysis of hans to hams huang et al 2012 among the seven hans only iodoacetonitrile ian was not detected after chlorination and dban formed to the greatest extent in all samples except for carbon fbw han formation can be influenced by bromide concentration because hypobromous acid hobr preferentially substitutes the halogen atom more than hocl allard et al 2015 westerhoff et al 2004 dban is one of the most cyto and genotoxic hans for which data are available wagner et al 2017 and dban 38 9 101 2 nm was formed during fp tests but not formed at detectable levels in the treatment plant from reactions with residual disinfectant this may be attributable to the much lower concentrations formed in the plant where dban may have formed but at levels that were below the detection limit as expected bromide incorporation factors bifs of hans and hams increased with increasing bromide concentrations although a similar trend was not observed for hans fig 3d ssw formed more hans than fbw which could be associated with the bromo haloacetonitriles br hans production in ssw br hans were 73 147 nm which was higher than fbw 27 79 nm total ham fp ranged from 56 4 to 62 9 nm and 73 6 to 95 5 nm in fbw and ssw respectively fig 2b cl ham fps were higher than br ham fps in fbw and ssw despite a strong relationship between br and ham fp this is similar to the findings reported by chu et al 2013 in lake tai water china where the cl ham was the main ham during chlorination 3 3 fractionation and characterization of han and ham precursors 3 3 1 mw distribution low mw 3 kda organic material was the primary dom in nearly all samples regardless of treatment plant or unit process the doc in this fraction accounted for 40 of the total doc fig 4 a and b in ssw collected from dwtp b the 100 kda fraction also contributed 42 of the total doc fig 4 also shows han and ham fps from the fractionated dom the fraction with mw 3 kda contributed the greatest amount of han and ham precursors in all samples accounting for 47 75 and 58 78 of the nonfractionated fps which indicates that low mw organic matter was the primary han and ham precursor this finding agrees with previous results by huang et al 2016 who found the low mw compounds had the greatest dcam yields accounting for more than 54 of the fp the low mw fraction 3 kda also had the greatest br han and br ham fps in all samples accounting for 61 79 and 66 87 of total br han and br ham formation respectively because the mw fractionation had little impact on the bromide concentration table s3 the 3 kda fraction had a greater bromide to doc ratio which likely influenced formation of br dbps 3 3 2 hydrophobic and hydrophilic distributions figs 5 a and 5b show that the hpi fraction accounted for more than 54 of total dom in all samples except carbon fbw carbon fbw contained more hpo components 52 potentially due to the enriched microorganisms in carbon filter that produced hpo soluble microbial products zheng et al 2018 which were subsequently washed into the fbw the highest han concentrations formed from the hpi fraction in sand fbw and ssw more than 57 of total han formation was attributable to the hpi fraction indicating that hpi organics were the primary han precursors in sand fbw and ssw on a dom normalized basis hpi organic matter from the sand fbw and ssw in dwtp a formed 53 8 and 58 1 nmolhan mgc respectively compared with 338 and 108 nmolhan mgc formed from the respective hpo fractions fig s4a this suggests that the hpo fraction is more reactive in forming hans the opposite result was found in dwtp b i e the hpi fraction was more reactive in the carbon fbw hpi and hpo fractions formed almost the same han after chlorination which was opposite to the observed trend for doc br hans were primarily produced by hpi organic matter suggesting that hpi organic matter contained more aliphatic organic matter and was more reactive with hobr than hocl in forming br hans hua et al 2007 alternatively the greater reactivity of the hpi fraction in forming br dbps may be at least partially attributable to the fractionation technique where br is not present in the hpo fraction for ham fps the hpi fraction had the most ham precursors more than 49 for the sand and carbon fbws the hpo fraction in ssw contained 51 of the ham precursors other fractions represented 49 these two opposing results indicate that hpi organic matter was the primary source of ham precursor in sand and carbon fbws and conversely that hpo organic matter dominated the ham precursor pool in ssw the results of dom normalization showed that the hpo fraction was more reactive in forming hams in dwtp a fig s4b higher br ham fps in the hpo fraction indicated that some hpo organic matter was more easily oxidized to hams than hans by hobr 3 3 3 eem spectra area volumes φi n from the eem spectra are shown in fig 6 the corresponding eem fluorescence spectra is provided in fig s5 sand fbw and ssw eem spectra exhibited high intensities in region ⅱ with corresponding area volumes for 35 38 and 32 42 respectively of all the sum of all the regional volumes region ⅱ contributed an even greater proportion of the eem volume for the carbon fbw sample up to 48 this region is typically associated with aromatic protein like compounds and indicates that they were a large component of dom in fbws and ssws figs 6c and 6d show that the mw 3 kda fraction had the greatest intensity volume more than 64 of the total volume which is similar to the proportion of doc han and ham fps in this fraction 41 81 of doc 48 80 of han and 59 75 of ham hpi and hpo fractions contributed the greatest amount to region ⅱ intensity volumes there was not a strong linear correlation between regional area volumes and han fp and ham fp likely because the han and ham formations were impacted more strongly by bromide fig 3c the correlations between region ⅱ area volumes and han fp r2 0 32 p 0 05 and between region i area volumes and ham fp r2 0 63 p 0 05 were better than other regions r2 0 3 p 0 05 fig s7 indicating that aromatic protein like compounds may play a greater role as han and ham precursors than other regions and associated functional groups the close association between the findings for region i and ⅱ mw fractionation and hydrophobicity fractionation fig s7 combined with fp results suggests that low mw hpo hpi aromatic protein like compounds are likely to be the largest source of han and ham precursors in fbws and ssws 3 4 backwash treatment options due to the variable water quality across treatment plants there is no single water treatment method suitable for the reuse of all fbw and ssw low mw and hpi organics have been shown to be the primary han and ham precursors in fbw and ssw but both conventional water treatment processes and advanced treatment process es are more effective at removing the high mw and hpo organic matter chiu et al 2012 hanigan et al 2015 wang et al 2017 therefore attention should be focused on permanent removal of low mw hpi organic matter because of its contribution to ham and han formation and because it is not well removed by current water treatment techniques activated carbon removes hpo matter well and removes some hpi matter and would likely result in reduced ham and han formation from the ssw and fbws but there is conflicting evidence as to whether activated carbon produces water that has an overall toxicity that is less than the untreated samples particularly for samples with high bromide due to greater rejection of doc than of bromide ates et al 2009 cuthbertson et al 2019 2020 mckenna et al 2020 krasner et al 2016 other alternatives are likely to be more energy and cost intensive for example coagulation combined with uf removes dom from water well but is energy intensive well but is energy intensive qian et al 2011 advanced oxidation processes aops especially uv h2o2 and uv cl2 have been proven effective for degrading nom especially low mw and hpi organics through formation of highly reactive radicals y h chuang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 it has also been shown that cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were reduced by combined uv plus chlorine plewa et al 2012 but again these methods are energy intensive thus it may be the most cost effective to consider strategies to either sequester bromide from fbw and ssw or to optimize coagulation strategies which result in limited bromide accumulation in the fbw and ssw 4 conclusion this research provides information and analyses on the han and ham concentrations and precursors in fbw and ssw in dwtps total han precursor loading in fbw and ssw resulted in 92 2 190 4 nm meanwhile total ham precursor loading in fbw and ssw resulted in 42 2 95 5 nm dban precursors tended to dominate the precursor loading and dban is known to be extremely geno and cytotoxic to mammalian cells at typical dilution of 90 98 for fbw and ssw recycle the precursor loading to the head of the plant cannot be ignored any dbp precursors recycled need to be removed a second time during treatment therefore attention should focus on occurrence and permanent removal of low mw hpi organic matter because of its contribution to ham and han formation by permanent removal we mean irreversible desorption from settled solids originating from fbw or ssw low mw and hpi organics which were found to be the main han and ham precursors in fbw and ssw are generally difficult to remove in dwtps the influence of bromide cycling in treatment plants also should not be ignored because high bromide tends to selectively promote the formation of the most toxic hams and hans and also other br dbps doc and don in fbw were higher than levels in the dwtp raw water doc don and bromide concentrations and han and ham fps obtained for ssw were higher than those obtained for raw water therefore treatment strategies should be pursued to remove precursors or preformed dbps in backwash water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

17531,the settling behavior of aerobic granular sludge ags in full scale reactors is different from the settling of normal activated sludge current activated sludge models lack the features to describe the segregation of granules based on size during the settling process this segregation plays an important role in the granulation process and therefore a better understanding of the settling is essential the goal of this study was to model and evaluate the segregation of different granule sizes during settling and feeding in full scale aerobic granular sludge reactors hereto the patwardhan and tien model was used this model is an implementation of the richardson and zaki model allowing for multiple classes of particles to create the granular settling model the most relevant parameters were identified using aerobic granular sludge from different full scale nereda reactors the settling properties of individual granules were measured as was the bulk behavior of granular sludge beds with uniform granular sludge particles the obtained parameters were combined in a model containing multiple granule classes which then was validated for granular sludge settling in a full scale nereda reactor in practice a hydraulic selection pressure is used to select for granular sludge under the same hydraulic selection pressure the model predicted that different stable granular size distributions can occur this indicates that granular size distribution control would need a different mechanism then the hydraulic selection pressure alone this model can be used to better understand and optimize operational parameters of ags reactors that depend on granular sludge size like biological nutrient removal furthermore insights from this model can also be used in the development of continuously fed ags systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge model settling full scale practice wastewater design richardson and zaki 1 introduction in biological wastewater treatment the liquid solid separation through gravity induced settling is an important step in producing clean effluent henze et al 2008 therefore the settling behavior of conventional activated sludge has been intensively studied over the years for the design of secondary clarifiers a good understanding of the settling behavior of activated sludge is necessary and both design guidelines henze et al 2008 and dynamic models takács et al 1991 vesilind 1968 are readily available these guidelines generally use the sludge volume index or the zone settling velocity as input parameters for describing the settling behavior of activated sludge for dynamic modeling of the settling of activated sludge several generally accepted empirical relations are available relating the settling velocity to the solids concentration torfs et al 2017 these empirical relations can be used to dynamically describe the settling of sludge in secondary clarifiers thereby ensuring proper design and operation of the conventional activated sludge plants aerobic granular sludge ags is a technology enabling removal of nutrients and liquid solid separation in one tank due to the advantageous settling properties and unique granular structure of the aerobic granules heijnen and van loosdrecht 1998 pronk et al 2015 van der roest et al 2011 adav et al 2008 gao et al 2011 the settling behavior of aerobic granular sludge under full scale conditions has not yet been studied this is mostly because the full scale aerobic granular sludge process is a novel technology so far the settling of aerobic granular sludge has only been studied with granules obtained from laboratory reactors winkler et al 2012 nor anuar et al 2007 ni et al 2009 liu et al 2005 these reactors are usually operated with synthetic influent leading to a fully granulated system without flocs in practice there always is a non granular sludge fraction present of 10 20 pronk et al 2015 van dijk et al 2018 of the total mass which might influence the overall settling behavior also laboratory experiments mainly focused on the settling behavior of individual granules not the settling behavior of the granular sludge bed as a whole as such it is not yet possible to model settling of full scale aerobic granular sludge the settling velocity of granules in a bed is much lower than that of an individual granule solid separation theory shows that the influence a settling particle experiences from surrounding particles depends on the degree of particle coherence perry et al 1997 conventional activated sludge flocs will tend to flocculate which slows down the settling velocity of the sludge vesilind 1968 aerobic granular sludge by definition does not coagulate de kreuk et al 2007a and is thought to maintain it s discrete settling properties even in a concentrated sludge bed for small biofilm coated particles it was shown that the settling behavior could be well described using fluidized bed theory nicolella et al 1999 because of the similarities in size structure and density between biofilm coated particles and aerobic granular sludge it was theorized that the settling of aerobic granular sludge might also be described by fluidized bed theory current activated sludge models for example the widely used takács model takács et al 1991 lack the features to describe the segregation of granules based on size during the settling process the process of hydraulic sludge selection is a key element in the operation of granular sludge reactors qin et al 2004 larger granules have higher settling velocities than flocs and small granules winkler et al 2012 and as such they can be preferentially retained in the reactor under hydraulic selection pressure in an upwards fed reactor larger granules are more likely to receive substrate because they settle faster to the bottom of the reactor and thus receive substrate this differential settling of different sludge fractions is not covered in current settling models another feature not well described by the current models is the stacking of granules at the bottom of the reactor sludge flocs in a concentrated bed will slowly compress to higher concentrations while granules will stack on top of each other when the maximum packing grade is reached for a better understanding of these processes a model describing the segregation of granules in the reactor based on settling properties is necessary a potential model was proposed by cui et al 2019 but not further developed also dold et al 2019 proposed a model but in this model only flocs and one class of granules was used and all granules were allowed to survive the selection pressure while this approach might serve the purpose of describing the average conversions in an ags reactor no insight can be gained in the granulation process itself moreover it cannot be used to predict the influence of the granular size distribution on the biological conversions also for the development of continuously operated granular sludge reactors kent et al 2018 a good settling model will be essential the goal of this study was to implement a model describing the segregation of different granule sizes during settling and feeding in an aerobic granular sludge reactor hereto the model proposed by patwardhan and tien 1985 was adopted this model is an implementation of the richardson and zaki model richardson and zaki 1954 allowing for multiple classes of particles to create a granular sludge settling model the most relevant parameters were identified using aerobic granular sludge from different full scale nereda reactors the settling properties of individual granules were measured as was the bulk behavior of uniform granular sludge beds the obtained parameters were introduced in a model containing multiple granule classes which then was validated based on an experiment in a full scale nereda reactor 2 methodology 2 1 description of the plants in this study aerobic granular sludge from three wastewater treatment plants was used the nereda installation in garmerwolde the nereda installation in utrecht and the nereda prototype in utrecht all located in the netherlands the garmerwolde plant 53 14 56 9 n 6 40 33 0 e is a municipal wastewater treatment plant owned by the dutch district water authority noorderzijlvest and it is

is a municipal wastewater treatment plant owned by the dutch district water authority hoogheemraadschap de stichtse rijnlanden and it is operated since 2018 it consists of 6 nereda reactors each of

rate of these plants during the experiments are given in table 1 2 2 size distribution the granule size distribution of the sludge in the nereda reactors used in these experiments varied aggregates larger than 200 μ m are considered to be granules although the non granular fraction smaller than 200 μ m at least partly shows the same granular morphology these small aggregates are sometimes considered as baby granules to determine the granule size distribution 1 l of sample was poured over a series of sieves with different mesh sizes 212 425 630 1000 1400 and 2000 μ m a mixed sample of 100 ml was filtered for the determination of the total dry weight the obtained granular biomass of the different sieve fractions and the mixed sample were dried at 105 c until no change in weight was detected anymore 2 3 density measurements the percoll centrifugation method was used to measure the density of the granules etterer and wilderer 2001 winkler et al 2013 centrifugation was performed for 120 min at 12 000 rpm 15777g in a stratos biofuge heraeus instruments a standard non swing out rotor holding plastic tubes containing 10 ml solution was used the speed up setting on the biofuge was 9 and the slow down setting was 1 the slow reduction of speed was set to limit the change of sudden slowdown on the granule position in the percoll marker beads were added ranging from 1023 kg m 3 to 1084 kg m 3 2 4 voidage measurements the minimum voidage between granules was measured with the dextran blue method beun et al 2002 granules were sieved with tap water and a known volume between 300 ml and 400 ml was added to a graduated measuring cylinder an amount of 300 mg of dextran blue was weighed on an analytical balance dissolved in a small amount of water and added to the measuring cylinder then the measuring cylinder was filled up to 1000 ml and stirred after settling of the granules a sample of the supernatant was taken and filtered with a millipore 0 45 μ m glass fiber filter to remove small particulate matter the concentration of dextran blue in the sample was then measured with a spectrophotometer at 620 nm based on the dilution of the dextran blue and the known volume of the granular bed the voidage between the granules was calculated according the following formula where v is the volume of the cylinder c d b the concentration of dextran blue m d b the mass of the dextran blue and v s b is the volume of the settled sludge 1 ε 1 v c d b m d b v s b c d b 2 5 measurement of terminal velocities to determine the terminal velocity of individual granules sludge was sieved using sieves with mesh sizes of 212 425 630 1180 1700 and 2000 μ m sieved granules were placed in a glass measuring cylinder with a height of 43 cm and a diameter of 6 cm the cylinder was filled with tap water at room temperature the granules were pre conditioned and washed with tap water since the difference of the total dissolved solids of tap water 254 mg l 1 and effluent 439 mg l 1 was small the effect of using tap water instead of effluent on the settling velocity likely was very small the settling of granules was recorded using a video camera in order to determine the settling time for a marked distance of 20 7 cm the camera was placed perpendicular to the exact mid point of the marked settling distance to minimize parallax errors the settling velocity was subsequently calculated by dividing the marked distance by the settling time the influence of the wall effect on the measured settling velocity was evaluated based on the method described by di felice 1996 in the worst case situation granules of 2 mm this effect was less than 2 5 this was deemed sufficiently low to be negligible 2 6 measurement of bed expansion experiments with full scale aerobic granular sludge were performed using a setup adapted from baldock baldock et al 2004 using this setup fig 1 the settling characteristics of granules of different sizes were measured the height of the column was 200 cm with an inner diameter of 153 6 mm the lower 18 cm of the column was used as a flow equalization section and therefore filled with glass marbles on top of the marbles there was a mesh support to prevent granules to cross into the equalization section the volume above the mesh was partially filled with granules for the experiment the granules were obtained by sieving granules directly from a full scale aerobic granular sludge reactor using sieves with mesh sizes of 1000 μ m and 2000 μ m effluent of the wastewater treatment plant was fed from the bottom of the column using a peristaltic pump the water was fed at upflow velocities between 3 m h 1 and 15 m h 1 to fluidize the granular bed the upflow velocity was increased in steps until the granular bed reached the top of the column then the upflow velocity was decreased in steps until the bed was completely settled again at every step the upflow velocity was kept constant until no change in the bed height was detected anymore the effluent was removed through a hole in the wall at the top of the column 2 7 full scale settling of a mixed granular bed settling of a mature granular bed was measured in the full scale nereda reactor in utrecht which is a 12000 m3 reactor containing 6 7 g l 1 of mlss first the reactor was intensely mixed by aerating for 20 min and a sample was taken to determine the biomass concentration after the aeration the sludge bed was allowed to settle samples of the sludge bed were taken at different levels below the water surface 0 2 4 6 and 7 m after 0 5 10 15 and 17 min the samples were taken with a kemmerer sampling bottle of 1 5l and sieved to measure the granule size distribution 2 8 modeling of terminal velocity the terminal settling velocity of a spherical particle in a fluid can be calculated based on a force balance 2 f w f b f d here f w is the weight of the particle f b is the buoyancy and f d is the drag force the weight of a particle can be calculated from the diameter d and the density ρ s using the following equation where g is the gravitational acceleration 3 f w π 6 d 3 ρ s g with a similar equation the buoyance can be calculated using ρl for the density of the surrounding liquid 4 f b π 6 d 3 ρ l g the drag force of the particle while falling in the fluid is calculated by 5 f d 1 8 π c d ρ l d 2 u t 2 where u t is the terminal velocity of the particle and c d is the drag coefficient combining equations 2 5 leads to the equation for the terminal velocity of a particle 6 u t 4 g ρ s ρ l d 3 c d ρ l 1 2 for particle reynolds numbers r e p below 0 1 the value of c d can be calculated using stokes law since settling of aerobic granular mostly takes place in the intermediate flow regime 0 1 r e p 1000 another relationship needs to be adopted also equations 3 6 assume smooth rigid spherical particles although aerobic granules have a nearly spherical shape they are not always smooth or rigid therefore a specific empirical relation for the drag coefficient has to be established for aerobic granular sludge several empirical relationships exist to relate the drag coefficient c d to the particle reynolds number nicolella et al 1999 a common approach is the use of the equation 7 c d a r e p b where a and b are empirical constants to be fitted to the type of particles the parameters a and b are only valid in a specific range of the particle reynolds number the latter is calculated by 8 r e p ρ l d u t μ here μ is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid in this study the values of a and b where measured using the column set up described earlier 2 9 modeling of bed behavior the richardson and zaki equation richardson and zaki 1954 is widely used to model the bed expansion of rigid spherical particles 9 u u f ε n here u is the fluidizing velocity ε is the voidage fraction u f is the extrapolated fluidizing velocity at a voidage fraction of unity and n is the expansion index in the original work of richarson and zaki u f was found to be equal to the terminal velocity u t for installations where the reactor diameter was much larger than the particle diameter according to equation 10 u f u t 10 d d r later it was shown that if the density of the particles approaches the density of the fluid this relation is incorrect and u f is at least 20 smaller than u t di felice 1995 nicolella et al 1999 the expansion index n is also a function of the flow regime richardson and zaki proposed a relation with the particle reynolds number others studies andalib et al 2012 found a relation to the archimedes number more suitable for describing the relation between flow regime and expansion index here we use the relation given by mulcahy and shieh 1987 11 n 10 35 r e p 0 18 the richardson and zaki equation is only valid for mono disperse solids since an aerobic granular sludge bed generally consists of granules with sizes in the range of 200 μ m to 5000 μ m see table 2 a multi disperse approach is needed to model the fluidization and settling of aerobic granular sludge beds multiple solutions describing multi disperse solids exist yang 2003 and here the approach described by patwardhan and tien 1985 was used the granules are divided in n classes with subscript i and the local settling velocity is calculated based on an apparent voidage ε e i this leads to the following equation 12 u i k i u f i ε e i n i 2 ρ s i ρ b ρ s i ρ here k i is a correction factor for wall effects this factor can be set to unity for large full scale reactors where the diameter of the reactor d r is much larger than the granule diameter and consequently has less impact for smaller reactors for example lab reactors the value of k can be calculated according to 13 k 1 1 15 d d r 0 6 the density of the sludge bed ρ b is based on the density and the volumetric concentration c i of each class 14 ρ b i 1 n ρ s i c i ρ 1 i 1 n c i the apparent voidage factor ε e i is calculated for every fraction using equation 15 15 ε e i 1 1

minimum voidage no settling of granules will occur anymore in the model this is simulated by simply setting the settling velocity to zero below the minimum voidage this also implies a minimum

granules obtained from the nereda reactor in garmerwolde were measured by dropping individual granules in a measuring cylinder the obtained terminal velocities with granule sizes between 200 μ m and 2000 μ m are presented in fig 2 since the granules were sieved this yielded a range of granule sizes per class for example between 212 μ m and 425 μ m and thus a range of settling velocities per class a minimum average and maximum settling velocity was calculated and these values were attributed to the minimum average and maximum granule size of the class the terminal velocity varied between 10 6 mh 1 and 86 5 mh 1 as shown in fig 2 using the percoll method a density for granules of 1035 14 kg m 3 was found for full scale granules with this density the drag coefficient can be calculated using equation 6 also the particle reynolds number can be calculated using equation 8 then a plot can be made of the drag coefficient versus the particle reynolds number fig 3 these data were used to estimate the coefficients a and b of equation 7 at values a 22 57 and b 0 690 we found the best fit with the data the experiments resulting in fig 2 were all obtained with relatively spherical and smooth granules sometimes granules are not smooth and spherical and for example finger type outgrowths exist at the surface of the granules this can have a negative effect on the settling velocity fig 4 shows the difference between smooth spherical granules and granules with finge type outgrowth on the granule surface for granules of 1 7 mm and 2 0 mm the difference in terminal velocity is up to 27 and seems to be larger for smaller granules a comparison of smooth granules and granules with outgrowth is shown in fig 5 3 2 bed expansion the results of the bed expansion experiment for granules from the prototype nereda in utrecht of sizes between 1 mm and 2 mm are shown in fig 6 the experiment was started with a sludge bed of 47 cm of sieved granules the voidage fraction of de sludge bed was 51 9 the up flow velocity was increased in steps from 6 0 m h 1 to 14 1 m h 1 at an up flow velocity of 14 1 m h 1 some of the granules started to wash out because the top of the sludge blanket reached the outlet of the column subsequently the up flow velocity was reduced in steps from 14 1 m h 1 to 3 3 m h 1 after the experiment some segregation in the sludge bed could be noticed showing larger granules at the bottom of the column and smaller granules at the top of the sludge blanket the data from the bed expansion experiment were used to estimate the parameters of the richardson and zaki model at an average granule size of 1 5 mm we found a value of v i of 29 9 m h 1 and an expansion index n of 5 65 the extrapolated fluidizing velocity v i of 29 9 m h 1 is 50 lower than the terminal velocity for granules of 1 5 mm calculated with equations 6 8 and the parameters for a and b calculated in the previous paragraph which yield a v t of 60 4 m h 1 3 3 full scale bed settling in the full scale nereda reactor in utrecht a settling experiment was performed to measure the settling of a mature granular bed the results were used to validate the multi disperse settling model the parameters that were identified using the sludge from garmerwolde and from the prototype nereda in utrecht were used in this multi disperse settling model for the full scale nereda in utrecht since all three plants are treating domestic wastewater we expect that the observed parameters are valid for granular sludge reactors operated with similar type of domestic wastewater the granule size distribution of the sludge bed is shown in table 2 the table also shows the class average diameter which is used in the model in fig 7 an example of the results is shown the figure shows the measurements and simulation results for the different granule fractions at the start of the experiment 0 min and after 15 min of settling the concentration of the granule fraction is shown on the x axis and the depth below the water surface is shown on the y axis at the start of the simulation the reactor is assumed to be completely mixed in the experiment this was done by intense aerating for 20 min after the aeration was stopped the sludge started to settle after 15 min the model shows that the largest fraction 2000 mm is almost settled and granules are stacking on top of each other at the bottom of the reactor the model calculates that at the bottom the minimum voidage fraction is already reached after 5 min on the other hand the smallest fraction 212 425 μ m only just started to settle only in the first meter from the top of the reactor a decrease of this fraction can be seen in the model results at the sampling point 2 m below the water surface even no change compared to the start was detected which is also observed in the model results only at the bottom first meter of the reactor an increase of this fraction can be seen the measured sludge concentrations are well resembled by the model for all fractions for the middle fractions and especially for the fraction of 1400 2000 μ m a peak in the solids concentration can be seen at a depth just below 6 m this is caused by the lower concentration of the largest fraction at this water depth because this fraction is already almost completely settled below 6 m the smaller fractions settle on top of the larger fraction allowing for the smaller fractions to reach higher concentrations fig 8 shows the measurements and simulation results for the granule fraction between 1000 and 1400 μ m for every timeframe the concentration of the granule fraction is shown on the x axis and the depth below the water surface is shown on the y axis after 5 min no change was measured at the sampling points which is resembled by the model after 10 min the concentrations at the upper sampling point goes down and the concentration at the lower sampling point goes up this behavior is also resembled by the model although at the lower sampling point the concentrations seems to increase a bit faster than in the model after 15 min and 17 min the model and the sampling show similar behavior the results for the other fractions also showed a good agreement between model and the measurements performed at the full scale installation these results can be found in the supplementary data 4 discussion 4 1 terminal settling velocity this study showed that the terminal settling velocity of aerobic granular sludge can be well described by a model based on newtonian drag the proposed formula to calculate the drag coefficient equation 17 was tested for particle reynolds numbers between 1 and 50 the coefficients of the formula are different from the values reported in literature nicolella et al 1999 for biofilm coated particles this is not remarkable since the average density of the aerobic sludge granules used in this study was considerably lower than the density of the biofilm coated particles 17 c d 22 57 r e p 0 690 1 r e p 50 4 2 bed expansion characteristics the bed expansion experiment showed good correlation with the richardson and zaki model equation 9 in the experiment sieved granules were used in the range of 1 2 mm the experiment yielded an expansion index n of 5 65 for an average granule size of 1 5 mm which is close to the value of 5 79 given by equation 11 the ratio between the terminal velocity u t and the extrapolated fluidizing velocity u f was close to 0 5 for biofilm coated particles a value of 0 8 was found by nicolella et al 1999 according to nicolella et al 1999 it is not uncommon for large low density solids that this ratio is lower than unity but no explanation was given 4 3 full scale validation as shown in the full scale experiment in the nereda reactor in utrecht a mature aerobic granular sludge bed can consist of a wide range of granule sizes the difference in setting velocity can be an order of magnitude leading to segregation in the sludge bed the largest granules will settle much faster than the smallest granules this leads to a high concentration of large granules at the bottom of the reactor after only a few minutes of settling while the smallest granules are still distributed throughout the reactor to describe this behavior a single fraction richardson and zaki model does not suffice and a multi disperse version of the richardson and zaki model was adopted using the patwardhan and tien extension with this extended model it was possible to describe the settling experiments performed at the full scale nereda reactor in utrecht well without any further calibration of the model 4 4 selection pressure in ags reactors a hydraulic selection pressure to selectively retain granules over flocs is applied this is especially relevant during the start up phase when granules are still relatively small the differential settling rate of granules and flocs is essential for this selection process excess sludge is typically removed from the top of the sludge blanket after a settling period removing the slower settling sludge flocculent matter small granules or eroded material from larger granules from the reactor and thereby selecting for the better settling granules in the reactor using the hydraulic selection pressure as a sludge wasting mechanism is a good method for making the cut off between granules and flocs and it is often used as the only sludge wasting mechanism the downside of using the selection pressure as the only wasting mechanism is that it does not directly influence the granule size distribution this is important because the granule size distribution will influence overall nutrient removal the differences in diffusion limitation into the granules and differences in overall mlss concentrations will lead to different nutrient removal rates de kreuk et al 2005 ni and yu 2010 chen et al 2011 using the model it can be shown that different stable granule size distributions can exist at the same selection pressure a uniform sludge bed with granules of 700 μ m can be as stable regarding selection pressure as a disperse bed with granules in the range of 200 5000 μ m this is shown in fig 9 after 30 min of settling the bed height of the uniform bed and the disperse bed are equal however when granules grow too large they become difficult to suspend by aeration and they will get diffusion limited during the anaerobic feeding phase therefore it is necessary to remove both selection sludge and excess granular sludge in aerobic granular sludge reactors with a well developed sludge bed this implies that a dynamic selection pressure is needed to control the granule size distribution in the reactor in full scale reactors this can be done by increasing the selection pressure to remove specific granule sizes the here developed model combined with a bioconversion model ni and yu 2010 could be used to predict the optimal selection pressure and granule size for every cycle of an ags reactor 4 5 differences between settling of flocs and granules fig 10 schematically shows the effect of the degree of particle coherence on the settling behavior of sludge particles conventional activated sludge flocs typically reside on the right part of this schematic small flocs coagulate into larger flocs adapting a zone settling regime and at higher concentrations under influence of the surrounding sludge flocs a compression regime in contrast aerobic granules typically reside on the left side of the schematic per definition they do not coagulate de kreuk et al 2007a and will remain in the particle settling regime even at high concentrations as shown in the full scale experiment in the nereda reactor in utrecht after reaching the minimum voidage fraction the granules are stacked on top of each other and they do not undergo an extensive compression regime this will especially be the case for laboratory ags reactors in a full scale ags reactor a mature granular bed will typically have a fraction of 1 2 kg m 3 smaller than 200 μ m because of wash in of suspended solids in the influent sheared off parts of large granules and because of less optimal sludge selection compared to a laboratory reactor the fraction smaller than 200 μ m will at least for a part consists of baby granules the question arises if the multi disperse richardson and zaki also applies for the non granular fraction smaller than 200 μ m in the full scale test this fraction was not measured so no data is available although the floc fraction was not taken into account in the full scale experiment in utrecht there was a good resemblance between measurements and model also for the smallest granule fractions if the non granular fraction would have a large impact on the settling behavior of the granules it would likely be influencing the smallest fractions this was not observed in the experiment it therefore appears that the effect of flocs on the settling behavior was limited in the experiment in the future our proposed model could be extended with a settling model for the floc fraction for example by adding a settling characteristic based on kinetics described by takács model 4 6 sludge morphology fig 4 shows the difference in terminal velocity of smooth spherical granules and granules with outgrowth on the sphere surface a difference of 27 was measured for granules of 1 7 mm no measurements were done on the interaction between granules with outgrowth in a sludge bed but it is expected that in a reactor with many granules with outgrowth on the surface the settling velocity will be even more reduced when an ags reactor is operated at a certain selection pressure a sudden increase of granules with outgrowth can lead to a drop in the sludge concentration in the reactor because many granules with outgrowth will be removed via sludge selection which typical is set to maintain a constant sludge bed height after the set settling time small changes in granule morphology therefore can have a major impact on the stability of the granular bed and ultimately effluent quality can be affected 4 7 potential applications of the settling model to show the effect of the granule size distribution on nutrient removal in full scale aerobic granular sludge reactors a settling model is required since nitrogen and phosphorus removal will depend on both sludge concentration and granule size de kreuk et al 2007b large granules will be more diffusion limited for processes requiring oxygen in comparison to small granules pérez et al 2005 small granules will therefore have a lower anoxic volume and their contribution to simultaneous denitrification will consequently be less moreover larger granules will reside more at the bottom of the reactor because of superior settling behavior since the current used batch fed reactor types are fed from the bottom de kreuk et al 2005 large granules will receive more cod during anaerobic uptake the combination of larger granules storing more cod during anaerobic feeding and larger granules being more diffusion limited for oxygen during aeration gives them a large role in simultaneous nitrification denitrification xavier et al 2007 our proposed settling model could be combined with already existing conversion models to gain more insight in the influence of settling and segregation of granules on overall conversion rates the model could also be used for optimizing other operational parameters such as the mlss concentration mixing energy and aeration strategy another potential application of the multi disperse settling model is in the understanding of continuously fed ags reactors these reactors are currently under development devlin and oleszkiewicz 2018 zou et al 2018 conventional activated sludge systems operated with clarifiers for sludge water separation will require different design and operation when the sludge partially consists of granules larger granules will settle faster than small granules and flocs resulting in a different distribution of granules and flocs over the clarifier depth this differential sedimentation can even be used to perform a form of sludge selection zou et al 2018 the flow patterns in a final clarifier are more complex than in batch wise operated granular sludge reactors with feeding from the bottom and need to be better investigated the here proposed multi disperse settling model in combination with a cfd model can be used to investigate and optimize the clarification process in traditional settlers of continuous ags reactors 5 conclusion a multi dispersed settling model was made describing the settling and fluidization of aerobic granular sludge validation of this model with measurements in a full scale ags reactor showed a good resemblance between model and measurements the model is based on the richardson and zaki model for multi disperse particles a relation between granule size and drag coefficient was established describing the terminal velocity of individual granules based on granule size the parameters of the richardson and zaki model were measured with mono disperse granules the extrapolation at a voidage of unity of the fluidizing velocity is approximately 50 of the terminal settling velocity the model can be used for optimizing the selection pressure in ags reactors and for improving nutrient removal the presented results can be used to better understand the granulation process and can be valuable for future research of continuously fed ags reactors declaration of

17531,the settling behavior of aerobic granular sludge ags in full scale reactors is different from the settling of normal activated sludge current activated sludge models lack the features to describe the segregation of granules based on size during the settling process this segregation plays an important role in the granulation process and therefore a better understanding of the settling is essential the goal of this study was to model and evaluate the segregation of different granule sizes during settling and feeding in full scale aerobic granular sludge reactors hereto the patwardhan and tien model was used this model is an implementation of the richardson and zaki model allowing for multiple classes of particles to create the granular settling model the most relevant parameters were identified using aerobic granular sludge from different full scale nereda reactors the settling properties of individual granules were measured as was the bulk behavior of granular sludge beds with uniform granular sludge particles the obtained parameters were combined in a model containing multiple granule classes which then was validated for granular sludge settling in a full scale nereda reactor in practice a hydraulic selection pressure is used to select for granular sludge under the same hydraulic selection pressure the model predicted that different stable granular size distributions can occur this indicates that granular size distribution control would need a different mechanism then the hydraulic selection pressure alone this model can be used to better understand and optimize operational parameters of ags reactors that depend on granular sludge size like biological nutrient removal furthermore insights from this model can also be used in the development of continuously fed ags systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge model settling full scale practice wastewater design richardson and zaki 1 introduction in biological wastewater treatment the liquid solid separation through gravity induced settling is an important step in producing clean effluent henze et al 2008 therefore the settling behavior of conventional activated sludge has been intensively studied over the years for the design of secondary clarifiers a good understanding of the settling behavior of activated sludge is necessary and both design guidelines henze et al 2008 and dynamic models takács et al 1991 vesilind 1968 are readily available these guidelines generally use the sludge volume index or the zone settling velocity as input parameters for describing the settling behavior of activated sludge for dynamic modeling of the settling of activated sludge several generally accepted empirical relations are available relating the settling velocity to the solids concentration torfs et al 2017 these empirical relations can be used to dynamically describe the settling of sludge in secondary clarifiers thereby ensuring proper design and operation of the conventional activated sludge plants aerobic granular sludge ags is a technology enabling removal of nutrients and liquid solid separation in one tank due to the advantageous settling properties and unique granular structure of the aerobic granules heijnen and van loosdrecht 1998 pronk et al 2015 van der roest et al 2011 adav et al 2008 gao et al 2011 the settling behavior of aerobic granular sludge under full scale conditions has not yet been studied this is mostly because the full scale aerobic granular sludge process is a novel technology so far the settling of aerobic granular sludge has only been studied with granules obtained from laboratory reactors winkler et al 2012 nor anuar et al 2007 ni et al 2009 liu et al 2005 these reactors are usually operated with synthetic influent leading to a fully granulated system without flocs in practice there always is a non granular sludge fraction present of 10 20 pronk et al 2015 van dijk et al 2018 of the total mass which might influence the overall settling behavior also laboratory experiments mainly focused on the settling behavior of individual granules not the settling behavior of the granular sludge bed as a whole as such it is not yet possible to model settling of full scale aerobic granular sludge the settling velocity of granules in a bed is much lower than that of an individual granule solid separation theory shows that the influence a settling particle experiences from surrounding particles depends on the degree of particle coherence perry et al 1997 conventional activated sludge flocs will tend to flocculate which slows down the settling velocity of the sludge vesilind 1968 aerobic granular sludge by definition does not coagulate de kreuk et al 2007a and is thought to maintain it s discrete settling properties even in a concentrated sludge bed for small biofilm coated particles it was shown that the settling behavior could be well described using fluidized bed theory nicolella et al 1999 because of the similarities in size structure and density between biofilm coated particles and aerobic granular sludge it was theorized that the settling of aerobic granular sludge might also be described by fluidized bed theory current activated sludge models for example the widely used takács model takács et al 1991 lack the features to describe the segregation of granules based on size during the settling process the process of hydraulic sludge selection is a key element in the operation of granular sludge reactors qin et al 2004 larger granules have higher settling velocities than flocs and small granules winkler et al 2012 and as such they can be preferentially retained in the reactor under hydraulic selection pressure in an upwards fed reactor larger granules are more likely to receive substrate because they settle faster to the bottom of the reactor and thus receive substrate this differential settling of different sludge fractions is not covered in current settling models another feature not well described by the current models is the stacking of granules at the bottom of the reactor sludge flocs in a concentrated bed will slowly compress to higher concentrations while granules will stack on top of each other when the maximum packing grade is reached for a better understanding of these processes a model describing the segregation of granules in the reactor based on settling properties is necessary a potential model was proposed by cui et al 2019 but not further developed also dold et al 2019 proposed a model but in this model only flocs and one class of granules was used and all granules were allowed to survive the selection pressure while this approach might serve the purpose of describing the average conversions in an ags reactor no insight can be gained in the granulation process itself moreover it cannot be used to predict the influence of the granular size distribution on the biological conversions also for the development of continuously operated granular sludge reactors kent et al 2018 a good settling model will be essential the goal of this study was to implement a model describing the segregation of different granule sizes during settling and feeding in an aerobic granular sludge reactor hereto the model proposed by patwardhan and tien 1985 was adopted this model is an implementation of the richardson and zaki model richardson and zaki 1954 allowing for multiple classes of particles to create a granular sludge settling model the most relevant parameters were identified using aerobic granular sludge from different full scale nereda reactors the settling properties of individual granules were measured as was the bulk behavior of uniform granular sludge beds the obtained parameters were introduced in a model containing multiple granule classes which then was validated based on an experiment in a full scale nereda reactor 2 methodology 2 1 description of

rate of these plants during the experiments are given in table 1 2 2 size distribution the granule size distribution of the sludge in the nereda reactors used in these experiments varied aggregates larger than 200 μ m are considered to be granules although the non granular fraction smaller than 200 μ m at least partly shows the same granular morphology these small aggregates are sometimes considered as baby granules to determine the granule size distribution 1 l of sample was poured over a series of sieves with different mesh sizes 212 425 630 1000 1400 and 2000 μ m a mixed sample of 100 ml was filtered for the determination of the total dry weight the obtained granular biomass of the different sieve fractions and the mixed sample were dried at 105 c until no change in weight was detected anymore 2 3 density measurements the percoll centrifugation method was used to measure the density of the granules etterer and wilderer 2001 winkler et al 2013 centrifugation was performed for 120 min at 12 000 rpm 15777g in a stratos biofuge heraeus instruments a standard non swing out rotor holding plastic tubes containing 10 ml solution was used the speed up setting on the biofuge was 9 and the slow down setting was 1 the slow reduction of speed was set to limit the change of sudden slowdown on the granule position in the percoll marker beads were added ranging from 1023 kg m 3 to 1084 kg m 3 2 4 voidage measurements the minimum voidage between granules was measured with the dextran blue method beun et al 2002 granules were sieved with tap water and a known volume between 300 ml and 400 ml was added to a graduated measuring cylinder an amount of 300 mg of dextran blue was weighed on an analytical balance dissolved in a small amount of water and added to the measuring cylinder then the measuring cylinder was filled up to 1000 ml and stirred after settling of the granules a sample of the supernatant was taken and filtered with a millipore 0 45 μ m glass fiber filter to remove small particulate matter the concentration of dextran blue in the sample was then measured with a spectrophotometer at 620 nm based on the dilution of the dextran blue and the known volume of the granular bed the voidage between the granules was calculated according the following formula where v is the volume of the cylinder c d b the concentration of dextran blue m d b the mass of the dextran blue and v s b is the volume of the settled sludge 1 ε 1 v c d b m d b v s b c d b 2 5 measurement of terminal velocities to determine the terminal velocity of individual granules sludge was sieved using sieves with mesh sizes of 212 425 630 1180 1700 and 2000 μ m sieved granules were placed in a glass measuring cylinder with a height of 43 cm and a diameter of 6 cm the cylinder was filled with tap water at room temperature the granules were pre conditioned and washed with tap water since the difference of the total dissolved solids of tap water 254 mg l 1 and effluent 439 mg l 1 was small the effect of using tap water instead of effluent on the settling velocity likely was very small the settling of granules was recorded using a video camera in order to determine the settling time for a marked distance of 20 7 cm the camera was placed perpendicular to the exact mid point of the marked settling distance to minimize parallax errors the settling velocity was subsequently calculated by dividing the marked distance by the settling time the influence of the wall effect on the measured settling velocity was evaluated based on the method described by di felice 1996 in the worst case situation granules of 2 mm this effect was less than 2 5 this was deemed sufficiently low to be negligible 2 6 measurement of bed expansion experiments with full scale aerobic granular sludge were performed using a setup adapted from baldock baldock et al 2004 using this setup fig 1 the settling characteristics of granules of different sizes were measured the height of the column was 200 cm with an inner diameter of 153 6 mm the lower 18 cm of the column was used as a flow equalization section and therefore filled with glass marbles on top of the marbles there was a mesh support to prevent granules to cross into the equalization section the volume above the mesh was partially filled with granules for the experiment the granules were obtained by sieving granules directly from a full scale aerobic granular sludge reactor using sieves with mesh sizes of 1000 μ m and 2000 μ m effluent of the wastewater treatment plant was fed from the bottom of the column using a peristaltic pump the water was fed at upflow velocities between 3 m h 1 and 15 m h 1 to fluidize the granular bed the upflow velocity was increased in steps until the granular bed reached the top of the column then the upflow velocity was decreased in steps until the bed was completely settled again at every step the upflow velocity was kept constant until no change in the bed height was detected anymore the effluent was removed through a hole in the wall at the top of the column 2 7 full scale settling of a mixed granular bed settling of a mature granular bed was measured in the full scale nereda reactor in utrecht which is a 12000 m3 reactor containing 6 7 g l 1 of mlss first the reactor was intensely mixed by aerating for 20 min and a sample was taken to determine the biomass concentration after the aeration the sludge bed was allowed to settle samples of the sludge bed were taken at different levels below the water surface 0 2 4 6 and 7 m after 0 5 10 15 and 17 min the samples were taken with a kemmerer sampling bottle of 1 5l and sieved to measure the granule size distribution 2 8 modeling of terminal velocity the terminal settling velocity of a spherical particle in a fluid can be calculated based on a force balance 2 f w f b f d here f w is the weight of the particle f b is the buoyancy and f d is the drag force the weight of a particle can be calculated from the diameter d and the density ρ s using the following equation where g is the gravitational acceleration 3 f w π 6 d 3 ρ s g with a similar equation the buoyance can be calculated using ρl for the density of the surrounding liquid 4 f b π 6 d 3 ρ l g the drag force of the particle while falling in the fluid is calculated by 5 f d 1 8 π c d ρ l d 2 u t 2 where u t is the terminal velocity of the particle and c d is the drag coefficient combining equations 2 5 leads to the equation for the terminal velocity of a particle 6 u t 4 g ρ s ρ l d 3 c d ρ l 1 2 for particle reynolds numbers r e p below 0 1 the value of c d can be calculated using stokes law since settling of aerobic granular mostly takes place in the intermediate flow regime 0 1 r e p 1000 another relationship needs to be adopted also equations 3 6 assume smooth rigid spherical particles although aerobic granules have a nearly spherical shape they are not always smooth or rigid therefore a specific empirical relation for the drag coefficient has to be established for aerobic granular sludge several empirical relationships exist to relate the drag coefficient c d to the particle reynolds number nicolella et al 1999 a common approach is the use of the equation 7 c d a r e p b where a and b are empirical constants to be fitted to the type of particles the parameters a and b are only valid in a specific range of the particle reynolds number the latter is calculated by 8 r e p ρ l d u t μ here μ is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid in this study the values of a and b where measured using the column set up described earlier 2 9 modeling of bed behavior the richardson and zaki equation richardson and zaki 1954 is widely used to model the bed expansion of rigid spherical particles 9 u u f ε n here u is the fluidizing velocity ε is the voidage fraction u f is the extrapolated fluidizing velocity at a voidage fraction of unity and n is the expansion index in the original work of richarson and zaki u f was found to be equal to the terminal velocity u t for installations where the reactor diameter was much larger than the particle diameter according to equation 10 u f u t 10 d d r later it was shown that if the density of the particles approaches the density of the fluid this relation is incorrect and u f is at least 20 smaller than u t di felice 1995 nicolella et al 1999 the expansion index n is also a function of the flow regime richardson and zaki proposed a relation with the particle reynolds number others studies andalib et al 2012 found a relation to the archimedes number more suitable for describing the relation between flow regime and expansion index here we use the relation given by mulcahy and shieh 1987 11 n 10 35 r e p 0 18 the richardson and zaki equation is only valid for mono disperse solids since an aerobic granular sludge bed generally consists of granules with sizes in the range of 200 μ m to 5000 μ m see table 2 a multi disperse approach is needed to model the fluidization and settling of aerobic granular sludge beds multiple solutions describing multi disperse solids exist yang 2003 and here the approach described by patwardhan and tien 1985 was used the granules are divided in n classes with subscript i and the local settling velocity is calculated based on an apparent voidage ε e i this leads to the following equation 12 u i k i u f i ε e i n i 2 ρ s i ρ b ρ s i ρ here k i is a correction factor for wall effects this factor can be set to unity for large full scale reactors where the diameter of the reactor d r is much larger than the granule diameter and consequently has less impact for smaller reactors for example lab reactors the value of k can be calculated according to 13 k 1 1 15 d d r 0 6 the density of the sludge bed ρ b is based on the density and the volumetric concentration c i of each class 14 ρ b i 1 n ρ s i c i ρ 1 i 1 n c i the apparent voidage factor ε e i is calculated for every fraction using equation 15 15 ε e i 1 1

minimum voidage no settling of granules will occur anymore in the model this is simulated by simply setting the settling velocity to zero below the minimum voidage this also implies a minimum

granules obtained from the nereda reactor in garmerwolde were measured by dropping individual granules in a measuring cylinder the obtained terminal velocities with granule sizes between 200 μ m and 2000 μ m are presented in fig 2 since the granules were sieved this yielded a range of granule sizes per class for example between 212 μ m and 425 μ m and thus a range of settling velocities per class a minimum average and maximum settling velocity was calculated and these values were attributed to the minimum average and maximum granule size of the class the terminal velocity varied between 10 6 mh 1 and 86 5 mh 1 as shown in fig 2 using the percoll method a density for granules of 1035 14 kg m 3 was found for full scale granules with this density the drag coefficient can be calculated using equation 6 also the particle reynolds number can be calculated using equation 8 then a plot can be made of the drag coefficient versus the particle reynolds number fig 3 these data were used to estimate the coefficients a and b of equation 7 at values a 22 57 and b 0 690 we found the best fit with the data the experiments resulting in fig 2 were all obtained with relatively spherical and smooth granules sometimes granules are not smooth and spherical and for example finger type outgrowths exist at the surface of the granules this can have a negative effect on the settling velocity fig 4 shows the difference between smooth spherical granules and granules with finge type outgrowth on the granule surface for granules of 1 7 mm and 2 0 mm the difference in terminal velocity is up to 27 and seems to be larger for smaller granules a comparison of smooth granules and granules with outgrowth is shown in fig 5 3 2 bed expansion the results of the bed expansion experiment for granules from the prototype nereda in utrecht of sizes between 1 mm and 2 mm are shown in fig 6 the experiment was started with a sludge bed of 47 cm of sieved granules the voidage fraction of de sludge bed was 51 9 the up flow velocity was increased in steps from 6 0 m h 1 to 14 1 m h 1 at an up flow velocity of 14 1 m h 1 some of the granules started to wash out because the top of the sludge blanket reached the outlet of the column subsequently the up flow velocity was reduced in steps from 14 1 m h 1 to 3 3 m h 1 after the experiment some segregation in the sludge bed could be noticed showing larger granules at the bottom of the column and smaller granules at the top of the sludge blanket the data from the bed expansion experiment were used to estimate the parameters of the richardson and zaki model at an average granule size of 1 5 mm we found a value of v i of 29 9 m h 1 and an expansion index n of 5 65 the extrapolated fluidizing velocity v i of 29 9 m h 1 is 50 lower than the terminal velocity for granules of 1 5 mm calculated with equations 6 8 and the parameters for a and b calculated in the previous paragraph which yield a v t of 60 4 m h 1 3 3 full scale bed settling in the full scale nereda reactor in utrecht a settling experiment was performed to measure the settling of a mature granular bed the results were used to validate the multi disperse settling model the parameters that were identified using the sludge from garmerwolde and from the prototype nereda in utrecht were used in this multi disperse settling model for the full scale nereda in utrecht since all three plants are treating domestic wastewater we expect that the observed parameters are valid for granular sludge reactors operated with similar type of domestic wastewater the granule size distribution of the sludge bed is shown in table 2 the table also shows the class average diameter which is used in the model in fig 7 an example of the results is shown the figure shows the measurements and simulation results for the different granule fractions at the start of the experiment 0 min and after 15 min of settling the concentration of the granule fraction is shown on the x axis and the depth below the water surface is shown on the y axis at the start of the simulation the reactor is assumed to be completely mixed in the experiment this was done by intense aerating for 20 min after the aeration was stopped the sludge started to settle after 15 min the model shows that the largest fraction 2000 mm is almost settled and granules are stacking on top of each other at the bottom of the reactor the model calculates that at the bottom the minimum voidage fraction is already reached after 5 min on the other hand the smallest fraction 212 425 μ m only just started to settle only in the first meter from the top of the reactor a decrease of this fraction can be seen in the model results at the sampling point 2 m below the water surface even no change compared to the start was detected which is also observed in the model results only at the bottom first meter of the reactor an increase of this fraction can be seen the measured sludge concentrations are well resembled by the model for all fractions for the middle fractions and especially for the fraction of 1400 2000 μ m a peak in the solids concentration can be seen at a depth just below 6 m this is caused by the lower concentration of the largest fraction at this water depth because this fraction is already almost completely settled below 6 m the smaller fractions settle on top of the larger fraction allowing for the smaller fractions to reach higher concentrations fig 8 shows the measurements and simulation results for the granule fraction between 1000 and 1400 μ m for every timeframe the concentration of the granule fraction is shown on the x axis and the depth below the water surface is shown on the y axis after 5 min no change was measured at the sampling points which is resembled by the model after 10 min the concentrations at the upper sampling point goes down and the concentration at the lower sampling point goes up this behavior is also resembled by the model although at the lower sampling point the concentrations seems to increase a bit faster than in the model after 15 min and 17 min the model and the sampling show similar behavior the results for the other fractions also showed a good agreement between model and the measurements performed at the full scale installation these results can be found in the supplementary data 4 discussion 4 1 terminal settling velocity this study showed that the terminal settling velocity of aerobic granular sludge can be well described by a model based on newtonian drag the proposed formula to calculate the drag coefficient equation 17 was tested for particle reynolds numbers between 1 and 50 the coefficients of the formula are different from the values reported in literature nicolella et al 1999 for biofilm coated particles this is not remarkable since the average density of the aerobic sludge granules used in this study was considerably lower than the density of the biofilm coated particles 17 c d 22 57 r e p 0 690 1 r e p 50 4 2 bed expansion characteristics the bed expansion experiment showed good correlation with the richardson and zaki model equation 9 in the experiment sieved granules were used in the range of 1 2 mm the experiment yielded an expansion index n of 5 65 for an average granule size of 1 5 mm which is close to the value of 5 79 given by equation 11 the ratio between the terminal velocity u t and the extrapolated fluidizing velocity u f was close to 0 5 for biofilm coated particles a value of 0 8 was found by nicolella et al 1999 according to nicolella et al 1999 it is not uncommon for large low density solids that this ratio is lower than unity but no explanation was given 4 3 full scale validation as shown in the full scale experiment in the nereda reactor in utrecht a mature aerobic granular sludge bed can consist of a wide range of granule sizes the difference in setting velocity can be an order of magnitude leading to segregation in the sludge bed the largest granules will settle much faster than the smallest granules this leads to a high concentration of large granules at the bottom of the reactor after only a few minutes of settling while the smallest granules are still distributed throughout the reactor to describe this behavior a single fraction richardson and zaki model does not suffice and a multi disperse version of the richardson and zaki model was adopted using the patwardhan and tien extension with this extended model it was possible to describe the settling experiments performed at the full scale nereda reactor in utrecht well without any further calibration of the model 4 4 selection pressure in ags reactors a hydraulic selection pressure to selectively retain granules over flocs is applied this is especially relevant during the start up phase when granules are still relatively small the differential settling rate of granules and flocs is essential for this selection process excess sludge is typically removed from the top of the sludge blanket after a settling period removing the slower settling sludge flocculent matter small granules or eroded material from larger granules from the reactor and thereby selecting for the better settling granules in the reactor using the hydraulic selection pressure as a sludge wasting mechanism is a good method for making the cut off between granules and flocs and it is often used as the only sludge wasting mechanism the downside of using the selection pressure as the only wasting mechanism is that it does not directly influence the granule size distribution this is important because the granule size distribution will influence overall nutrient removal the differences in diffusion limitation into the granules and differences in overall mlss concentrations will lead to different nutrient removal rates de kreuk et al 2005 ni and yu 2010 chen et al 2011 using the model it can be shown that different stable granule size distributions can exist at the same selection pressure a uniform sludge bed with granules of 700 μ m can be as stable regarding selection pressure as a disperse bed with granules in the range of 200 5000 μ m this is shown in fig 9 after 30 min of settling the bed height of the uniform bed and the disperse bed are equal however when granules grow too large they become difficult to suspend by aeration and they will get diffusion limited during the anaerobic feeding phase therefore it is necessary to remove both selection sludge and excess granular sludge in aerobic granular sludge reactors with a well developed sludge bed this implies that a dynamic selection pressure is needed to control the granule size distribution in the reactor in full scale reactors this can be done by increasing the selection pressure to remove specific granule sizes the here developed model combined with a bioconversion model ni and yu 2010 could be used to predict the optimal selection pressure and granule size for every cycle of an ags reactor 4 5 differences between settling of flocs and granules fig 10 schematically shows the effect of the degree of particle coherence on the settling behavior of sludge particles conventional activated sludge flocs typically reside on the right part of this schematic small flocs coagulate into larger flocs adapting a zone settling regime and at higher concentrations under influence of the surrounding sludge flocs a compression regime in contrast aerobic granules typically reside on the left side of the schematic per definition they do not coagulate de kreuk et al 2007a and will remain in the particle settling regime even at high concentrations as shown in the full scale experiment in the nereda reactor in utrecht after reaching the minimum voidage fraction the granules are stacked on top of each other and they do not undergo an extensive compression regime this will especially be the case for laboratory ags reactors in a full scale ags reactor a mature granular bed will typically have a fraction of 1 2 kg m 3 smaller than 200 μ m because of wash in of suspended solids in the influent sheared off parts of large granules and because of less optimal sludge selection compared to a laboratory reactor the fraction smaller than 200 μ m will at least for a part consists of baby granules the question arises if the multi disperse richardson and zaki also applies for the non granular fraction smaller than 200 μ m in the full scale test this fraction was not measured so no data is available although the floc fraction was not taken into account in the full scale experiment in utrecht there was a good resemblance between measurements and model also for the smallest granule fractions if the non granular fraction would have a large impact on the settling behavior of the granules it would likely be influencing the smallest fractions this was not observed in the experiment it therefore appears that the effect of flocs on the settling behavior was limited in the experiment in the future our proposed model could be extended with a settling model for the floc fraction for example by adding a settling characteristic based on kinetics described by takács model 4 6 sludge morphology fig 4 shows the difference in terminal velocity of smooth spherical granules and granules with outgrowth on the sphere surface a difference of 27 was measured for granules of 1 7 mm no measurements were done on the interaction between granules with outgrowth in a sludge bed but it is expected that in a reactor with many granules with outgrowth on the surface the settling velocity will be even more reduced when an ags reactor is operated at a certain selection pressure a sudden increase of granules with outgrowth can lead to a drop in the sludge concentration in the reactor because many granules with outgrowth will be removed via sludge selection which typical is set to maintain a constant sludge bed height after the set settling time small changes in granule morphology therefore can have a major impact on the stability of the granular bed and ultimately effluent quality can be affected 4 7 potential applications of the settling model to show the effect of the granule size distribution on nutrient removal in full scale aerobic granular sludge reactors a settling model is required since nitrogen and phosphorus removal will depend on both sludge concentration and granule size de kreuk et al 2007b large granules will be more diffusion limited for processes requiring oxygen in comparison to small granules pérez et al 2005 small granules will therefore have a lower anoxic volume and their contribution to simultaneous denitrification will consequently be less moreover larger granules will reside more at the bottom of the reactor because of superior settling behavior since the current used batch fed reactor types are fed from the bottom de kreuk et al 2005 large granules will receive more cod during anaerobic uptake the combination of larger granules storing more cod during anaerobic feeding and larger granules being more diffusion limited for oxygen during aeration gives them a large role in simultaneous nitrification denitrification xavier et al 2007 our proposed settling model could be combined with already existing conversion models to gain more insight in the influence of settling and segregation of granules on overall conversion rates the model could also be used for optimizing other operational parameters such as the mlss concentration mixing energy and aeration strategy another potential application of the multi disperse settling model is in the understanding of continuously fed ags reactors these reactors are currently under development devlin and oleszkiewicz 2018 zou et al 2018 conventional activated sludge systems operated with clarifiers for sludge water separation will require different design and operation when the sludge partially consists of granules larger granules will settle faster than small granules and flocs resulting in a different distribution of granules and flocs over the clarifier depth this differential sedimentation can even be used to perform a form of sludge selection zou et al 2018 the flow patterns in a final clarifier are more complex than in batch wise operated granular sludge reactors with feeding from the bottom and need to be better investigated the here proposed multi disperse settling model in combination with a cfd model can be used to investigate and optimize the clarification process in traditional settlers of continuous ags reactors 5 conclusion a multi dispersed settling model was made describing the settling and fluidization of aerobic granular sludge validation of this model with measurements in a full scale ags reactor showed a good resemblance between model and measurements the model is based on the richardson and zaki model for multi disperse particles a relation between granule size and drag coefficient was established describing the terminal velocity of individual granules based on granule size the parameters of the richardson and zaki model were measured with mono disperse granules the extrapolation at a voidage of unity of the fluidizing velocity is approximately 50 of the terminal settling velocity the model can be used for optimizing the selection pressure in ags reactors and for improving nutrient removal the presented results can be used to better understand the granulation process and can be valuable for future research of continuously fed ags reactors declaration of

17532,resource recovery and emissions from sanitation systems are critical sustainability indicators for strategic urban sanitation planning in this context sanitation systems are the most often structured using technology driven templates rather than performance based sustainability indicators in this work we answer two questions firstly can we estimate generic resource recovery and loss potentials and their uncertainties for a diverse and large set of sanitation systems and secondly can we identify technological aspects of sanitation systems that indicate a better overall resource recovery performance the aim is to obtain information that can be used as an input into any strategic planning process and to help shape technology development and system design for resource recovery in the future starting from 41 technologies which include novel and conventional options we build 101 548 valid sanitation system configurations for each system configuration we quantify phosphorus nitrogen total solids and water flows and use that to calculate recovery potentials and losses to the environment i e the soil air or surface water the four substances cover different properties and serve as a proxy for nutrient organics energy and water resources for modelling the flows ex ante we use a novel approach to consider a large range of international literature and expert data considering uncertainties thus all results are generic and can therefore be used as input into any strategic planning process or to help guide future technology development a detailed analysis of the results allows us to identify factors that influence recovery and losses these factors include the type of source the length of systems and the level of containment in storage and treatment the factors influencing recovery are related to interactions of different technologies in a system which shows the relevance of a modelling approach that allows to look at all possible system configurations systematically based on our analysis we developed five recommendations for the optimization of resource recovery i prioritize short systems that close the loop at the lowest possible level ii separate waste streams as much as possible because this allows for higher recovery potentials iii use storage and treatment technologies that contain the products as much as possible avoid

and to prevent pollution and accumulation of emerging pollutants andersson et al 2018 nikiema et al 2014 rao et al 2017 susana 2008 sustainable sanitation that allows for resource recovery has the

place dodman et al 2013 undesa 2014 today it is widely recognized that substance flows and resource recovery potentials are highly relevant performance indicators for sustainability evaluations of different sanitation systems e g ashley et al 2008 drangert et al 2018 harder et al 2019 orner and mihelcic 2018 they serve as input for comparisons using methods such as multi criteria decision analysis schütze et al 2019 life cycle analysis pasqualino et al 2009 or cost benefit analysis balkema et al 2002 döberl et al 2002 currently the sanitation system options space is however mostly structured based on technologies and their characteristics but not on their functions and performance characteristics related to sustainability this is reflected in the sanitation system templates spuhler et al 2018 tilley et al 2014 or the sanitation ladder used by the joint monitoring programme who and unicef 2017 to consider resource recovery in line with sdg 6 un 2014 a more functional approach to characterise sanitation systems is required as suggested by the functional sanitation ladder kvarnström et al 2011 one of these functions is the protection of the environment and natural resources kvarnström et al 2011 susana 2008 the most straightforward attribute that allows to evaluate this objectives is the knowledge how much pollutants are lost to the environment and how much of resources can be recovered e g lienert et al 2015 mcconville et al 2014 spuhler et al 2020a interestingly for sanitation systems many of occurring substances such as nutrients or organic matter are both potential pollutant and resource for agricultural or energy production therefore a typical method to quantify resource recovery and loss potentials is material flow analysis mfa also known as substance flow modelling sfm it is a type of system analysis based on the principles of mass balances providing indication of material use emissions and costs the nature of the system is captured in a mathematical model analytical methods quantify flows and stocks of substances and or materials which are transformed or consumed within the system boundaries baccini and brunner 2012 brunner and

measurements to quantify transfer coefficients the data requirements make it very demanding to use sfm at a pre planning stage consequently they most existing studies apply sfm to a few technologies and systems in a specific context only e g montangero and belevi 2007 the increasing number of technologies and corresponding system configurations increase the complexity further as shown in spuhler et al 2020b a set of over 40 technologies can be combined to over 100 000 plausible system configurations due to combinatorial explosion little knowledge exists about which combination might be the most performant for a given case moreover little or no data exists on novel technologies and systems therefore we have developed a method for the ex ante quantification of substance flows e g nutrients water total solids of a diverse and large set of sanitation systems which we presented in spuhler et al 2020b this method builds on algorithms that automatically generate sanitation systems spuhler et al 2018 the model uses different technologies as building blocks and products as connectors each technology contains transfer coefficients for the substance in question the flow path of substances is defined by the connections between technologies the fate of the substances is defined by three loss compartments air loss soil loss and surface water loss and one recovery compartment to be applicable ex ante the algorithms are complemented with a data library that provides transfer coefficients based on international literature and expert knowledge dataset spuhler and roller 2020 additionally uncertainties are modelled to express the variability of available data and the confidence in the expert opinion by summing up all losses and recoveries for a system the overall system resource recovery potentials and their uncertainty can be calculated these results serve as basis for the performance comparison of the different sanitation systems in question the experiences from developing this model and its preliminary application to a full case real example have indicated that there exists some system characteristics that could help to predict the resource recovery or loss potentials these predictors could be used to develop a more functional characterisation of the system options at least in relation to resource recovery and loss potentials 1 1 aim in this work we aim to answer the following two questions 1 can we estimate generic resource recovery and loss potentials and their uncertainties for a diverse and large set of sanitation systems 2 can we identify technological characteristics of sanitation systems that indicate a better overall resource recovery performance and therefore can be used as a predictor for resource recovery potentials or to guide future technology and system development to answer these questions we perform a quantitative analysis of the recovery and loss potentials for a diverse and large range of sanitation systems using the model and full scale application from spuhler et al 2020b this case generated from 41 sanitation technologies 101 548 valid sanitation systems and quantifies the resource recovery and loss potentials for nitrogen phosphorus total solids and water 2 methods 2 1 overview this paper presents an advanced application of a modelling approach previously presented in spuhler et al 2020b the approach includes two main elements first spuhler et al 2020b presents a generic substance flow model to be applied ex ante and for a large and diverse set of sanitation technologies and systems and secondly spuhler et al 2020b also presents transfer coefficients for four substances for 41 technologies the four substances represent different properties and cover nutrients phosphorus nitrogen total solids as a proxy for energy and organics and water these results are then to be looked at and discussed in regards of the influence of technical aspects such as technology interaction and system configurations on resource recovery and losses the advanced application requires three steps 1 the generation of entire system using the system builder spuhler et al 2018 2 the characterisation of the option space using the system templates as defined in spuhler et al 2020b 3 the modelling of substance flows in all sanitation systems and the quantification of recovery and loss potentials spuhler et al 2020b the definition of the technologies and the transfer coefficients are provided in the technology library that is available here https doi org 10 25678 0000ss dataset spuhler and roller 2020 and spuhler and roller 2020 the system builder and the substance flow model are implemented in julia bezanson et al 2017 and are accessible at https github com eawag sww sanitationsystemmassflow jl v1 0 a copy of the algorithms as well as all input and output data used for this publication are available in the associated data package at eric https doi org 10 25678 0001tn dataset spuhler 2020 2 2 sanitation system generation sanitation system generation is based on the system builder spuhler et al 2018 which is an algorithm that automatically generates all valid sanitation system configurations from a set of technologies here we provide just a short summary of definitions and the applied methodology a sanitation technology tech is defined as any process infrastructure method or service that contains transforms or transports sanitation products it is characterized by its name and the in and output products e g blackwater or greywater septic tank sludge and effluent and its functional group fg the toilet user interface or source fg u on site storage fg s conveyance fg c treatment fg t and reuse or disposal sinks fg d a technology belonging to fg u is always a source while a technology belonging to fg d is always a sink in this paper we focus on toilet sources only a sanitation system sansys is defined as a combination of compatible technologies which manage sanitation products from the point of generation to a final point of reuse or disposal maurer et al 2012 spuhler et al 2018 tilley et al 2014 a sanitation system is valid if it contains only compatible technologies and every sanitation product either finds its way into a subsequent technology or a sink spuhler et al 2018 two sanitation technologies are compatible if the output product of one can be the input product of the other maurer et al 2012 for each source fg u the system builder tests stepwise which combination of technologies allow treatment of output products and ends when there is no further combination possible this happens when there is no more output meaning that a valid system was formed or when it results in an open ended system which is not valid and abandoned loops between technologies are only permitted if the infrastructures are situated close enough to each other which is true for technologies from the functional groups storage fg s and treatment fg t an example would be a loop between the two technologies wastewater stabilisation pond wsp and a biogas reactor both from fg t the sludge from the wsp could be circulated to the biogas reactor while the effluent from the reactor could be circulated back to the wsp 2 3 characterisation of the option space system templates starting from 41 technologies typically over 100 000 systems can be automatically generated to structure and characterize the option space system templates sts are used the templates characterize technologies in terms of technological features and thereby group them regarding technical concepts dry or wet urine diversion energy recovery etc and spatial concepts onsite offsite decentralized hybrid the system templates were first defined in tilley et al 2010 and further detailed in the compendium of sanitation systems and technologies tilley et al 2014 this compendium is supported by the the water supply sanitation collaborative council and by the international water association its second edition is published in six different languages based on this widespread use spuhler and germann 2019 spuhler et al 2020a spuhler and scheidegger 2019 we adapted the existing templates to include novel technologies such as the production of liquid urine fertilizer or briquetting see also section 2 6 here we use the templates from spuhler et al 2020b which include 19 templates that cover the entire options space while grouping the options into four categories simple onsite systems st1 st3 urine diversion st4 st8 biofuel systems st9 st12 and blackwater systems st13 st19 an overview is shown in fig 1 based on dataset spuhler and roller 2020 2 4 substance flow modelling to quantify substance mass flows transfer coefficients tcs for each technology are required the tcs define how much of an entering substance is either transferred to one of the output products or to the loss compartments air soil or surface water the tcs and the corresponding uncertainties as well as the data used to define them are compiled in the technology library dataset spuhler and roller 2020 the detailed description on how transfer coefficients and their uncertainties are derived can be found in spuhler et al 2020b here we provide a short overview we use two ways to define transfer coefficient whenever possible we use literature data from which we selected the median of all data reported and the variability range between the lowest and highest data point to model the uncertainty in the absence of literature data for example for very novel technologies we contacted experts involved in the development of the technology there we elicited the median value for the tc based on the expert s judgement to define the variability range we used their confidence in the knowledge about the substance behaviour and the technology readiness level all variability ranges are expressed as a concentration factor and modelled using a dirichlet distribution using the transfer coefficients the inputs are propagated through the systems this allows to calculate for each technology the percentage of substance transferred or lost in the sink technologies substances are not transferred further but either lost or recovered by summing up all losses and recoveries within one system the system s resource recovery and loss potentials can be calculated the uncertainties are computed by monte carlo error propagation and expressed as standard deviations the standard deviations obtained in preliminary results spuhler et al 2020b are comparable to those obtained in studies applying a more sophisticated conventional post ante material flow analysis in sanitation systems e g montangero and belevi 2008 therefore we concluded that our approach is capable of providing reasonable results also ex ante spuhler et al 2020b 2 5 substances and inflows so far we have defined transfer coefficients for four substances that typify different properties total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn total solids ts and water h2o all four substances are relevant as indicators for resource recovery and pollution potential both phosphorus and nitrogen have value and crucial significance as important macronutrients there are resources to be recovered and as environmental pollutants there are emissions to be minimised total solids can be used as a proxy for energy that could be recovered for example in the form of briquettes or biochar as well as for organic matter that could be recovered as soil amendment if discharged into the environment total solids also has significant pollution potential water is under increasing pressure in many urban areas and has become a scarce commodity which should either be saved or reused for these four substances we also defined fluxes for toilet sources using the values based on international literature e g lohri et al 2010 rose et al 2015 provided in the technology library these inflow values are shown in table 1 and are based on literature from all over the world and therefore are quite generic for the application in a specific case those values could be adjusted to account for the local diet and flush water usages because we are more interested in the impact of the technology uncertainty then the uncertainty related to the population specificities in a given case we did not consider inflow variability in our calculations however the variability range of the literature data can be found in the supplementary material of spuhler et al 2020b and in the technology library dataset spuhler and roller 2020 2 6 technologies and application case in collaboration with a swiss philanthropic organisation and a local organisation we tested the system builder from spuhler et al 2018 and the sfm model from spuhler et al 2020b in nepal in 2017 the details for this application case are described in spuhler et al 2018 the characterisation of the technology is independent of the case and are therefore fully transferrable to any case as shown in spuhler et al 2020b therefore the case circumstances are not relevant for the analysis presented in this manuscript the 41 sanitation technologies see fig 2 are originally based on the compendium tilley et al 2014 and further developed in spuhler et al 2018 and spuhler et al 2020b the resulting set includes conventional as well as novel technologies examples of such novel technologies include production of liquid urine fertilizer aurin and its application bonvin et al 2015 etter et al 2015 fumasoli et al 2016 briquetting based on the process implemented by sanivation in naivasha jones 2017 and latrine dehydration and pasteurization using ladepa pelletizing septien et al 2018b using these 41 technologies the system builder created automatically 101 548 valid sanitation systems valid means they are all able to manage all products from a given source in such a way that no open output remains at the end the number is so high because of combinatorial explosion the large number of generated sanitation systems represents almost the entire space of potential solutions some of them with only minor variations it is important to note that we here only consider toilet sources in order to reduce the complexity of the results we also did not consider urine diversion flush toilets and therefore no systems from st7 and st8 were formed however the underlying models both the system builder and the substance flow model could also accommodate other streams and related technologies such as greywater stormwater or organic solid waste for the substance flow modelling we used the transfer coefficients from the library and inflow masses for 1000 person equivalent and a period of one year this was based on the requirements of our partner organisation that aimed of developing a city sanitation plan for the centre of the small town in nepal 2 7 data analysis to identify the influence of technical aspects such as technology interaction and system configurations on resource recovery and losses we used r for visual data analysis r development core team 2018 we also triangulated and reflected the results with data from two other case studies for larger cities one of this case studies was the city of arba minch with 100 000 inhabitants in ethiopia and another case studies was a low income settlement of 20 000 inhabitants in lima peru with visual data analysis we refer to plotting different combinations of results in order to show dependencies between different technical aspects such as for instance the occurrence of urine diversion or the length of a system 3 results 3 1 overview from the 41 techs 101 548 valid sanitation systems were generated and the substance flows for total phosphorus tp nitrogen tn total solids ts and water h2o were computed considering the uncertainty of the tcs fig 3 shows a density plot of the resource recovery of all systems in the x axis the recover potential from 0 to 100 is shown and in the y axis the relative occurrence of systems with a given recovery density for tp tn and ts we show the ratio for water we provide the absolute volume m3year 1 as the relative recovery does not provide any useful information e g comparing dry toilets with pour flush as can be expected across more than 100 000 systems all four substances show recovery from nothing to almost 100 this indicates that the choice of technologies has enough breadth to cover the entire spectrum however the maximum recovery ratio for the four substances are different and lower for nitrogen and total solids than for phosphorus and water 98 for tp 87 for tn 88 for ts and 97 for h2o also the shapes of the profiles differ greatly from each other but all of them show several peaks indicating some key characteristics that lead to shifts in the recovery potentials in the following paragraphs we look at some of these key characteristics in more detail 3 2 source technologies fg u the two wet sources u1 cistern flush and u2 pour flush toilets generate the same output product blackwater and therefore also the same numbers of sansys 26 124 for dry toilets u3 the number of valid systems is significantly lower 3704 because the generated output excreta can enter far fewer subsequent technologies and results in fewer partitions almost half of all the sansys generated 45 596 originate from the urine diversion dry toilet u4 increasing the diversity of the option space uddt toilets generate two output products urine and faeces the more products occur the more valid system configurations can be created besides the fact that sources influence the number of system configurations they also impact the recovery potentials and losses this is illustrated in fig 4 which shows all resource recovery and loss potentials grouped by the source of the system each dot represents a system the colours represent the sources for phosphorus the median recovery ratio is highest for uddts 61 and lowest for dry toilets 21 tp losses are dominated by soil loss and significantly higher for dry toilets which show a median soil loss of 75 as compared to 32 and 37 for wet sources and uddts respectively but for wet sources substantial amounts can also be lost to surface waters a similar but even more pronounced pattern is observed for nitrogen again the highest median recovery which is 75 is observed for uddt systems and the lowest for dry toilets 4 nitrogen losses go also to the soil and are also higher for dry sources 29 for dry toilet 17 for wet sources and 5 for uddts what is different for nitrogen is that high amounts are also lost to the air for all sources 59 for dry toilet 40 for wet sources and 15 for uddts for total solids the pattern is similar to the nitrogen pattern but less pronounced water recovery is obviously dominated by cistern flush systems as the water volume entering the system is much higher 0 to 21 773 m3year 1 median of 1687 m3year 1 however cistern flush systems also have the potential for important losses from all three compartments 3125 m3year 1 to air 362 m3year 1 to water and 4021 m3year 1 to soil in summary we learn three things from this figure first dry toilets result in much higher losses and thus in lower recovery potentials secondly uddt systems result in low losses and high recovery ratio and thirdly most losses occur for nitrogen and total solids 3 3 system length number of technologies in a system urine diversion systems are generally longer and more complex more products more bifurcations and onsite dry st1 and st2 biogas or blackwater e g st9 st13 and st16 systems are shorter for longer systems the number of different sansys and thus the diversity increases illustrated by the high number of uddt systems however this also means that sansys which are longer are also more similar and therefore have similar resource recovery potentials this is illustrated in fig 5 showing a clustering of similar recovery potentials to the right the figure also shows that the median recovery potential increases initially with length and is maximal at 14 technologies but there are some very short systems that show extreme values either very low what is the case for systems including uncontained storage and a disposal sink or very high recovery ratio for systems that include contained storage and a recovery sink the absolute highest recovery is achieved in short uddt systems combined with biofuel again st9 for longer uddt systems recovery is systematically reduced by more possibilities for losses this shows that the shorter the system the higher the potential for a very high recovery 3 4 templates table 2 provides the number of systems per system template st and the detailed description of each template there are far fewer onsite simple systems than urine diversion biofuel or blackwater systems mainly because they are simpler and fewer permutations can be generated fig 6 shows the recovery potentials for all substances grouped by template and coloured by source most templates include systems with both high and low recoveries thus template are not sufficient indicators for resource recovery potentials exceptions are st1 and st2 with exclusively low recovery rates the clouds indicate clusters of systems with similar recovery potentials some sts show only two clusters of either very high or very low recovery potentials e g st3 dry onsite and composting this distinction is due to only a few products ending up either in a disposal or in a recovery sink at a first glance the pattern of all four substances looks similar but there are some differences for phosphorus urine diversion templates st4 st6 show the highest median recovery ratio followed by the biofuel templates st9 st12 and some blackwater templates st14 st16 the five systems with the absolute highest phosphorus recovery ratios are from st3 onsite composting and st14 onsite blackwater systems with fewer treatment steps this is different for the accumulated recovery ratio which is highest for st9 as we have shown in the previous paragraph and fig 5 for nitrogen and total solids urine diversion templates clearly outcompete the other the five systems with the highest nitrogen recovery ratios are from st6 urine diversion and onsite faeces storage and st9 urine diversion and biofuel production the five sansys with the highest total solids recovery ratios are also from st9 and st11 with exclusively uddt sources this also explains why the absolute highest accumulated recovery is achieved in st9 for water the recovery ratio in is not that interesting as a system with high recovery is similar to a system with low use therefore we look at the absolute amount of water recovered or lost higher recovery is obviously obtained in templates with a cistern flush toilet st9 to st 19 the five sansys with the highest water recovery by mass are again from st9 followed by a st11 and st15 onsite blackwater system high water recovery ratios in can also be achieved by dry systems especially uddt systems but are obviously not relevant in absolute terms looking at the accumulated ratios bottom of fig 6 urine diversion systems clearly perform best especially if combined with biofuel production as it is the case for st9 onsite biofuel without effluent transport or st11 offsite biogas without blackwater transport 3 5 shifting factors and key technologies the peaks in fig 3 and clusters in fig 6 indicate that key characteristics act as shifting factors which are either due to the occurrence of a single technology or a combination of technologies by analysing the systems that are part of the peaks we identified ten possible shifting factors 1 if a single pit is part of the system 2 if transport is by pipe 3 if no transport technology occurs purely onsite system 4 if urine source separation occurs in uddt 5 if blackwater occurs 6 if biofuel production occurs 7 if toilet producing pit occur i e in twin pits 8 if composting technologies are used 9 if surface water discharge is used and 10 if soak pits are used we used visual data analysis to better understand the respective influence of these shifting factors the detailed figures are presented in the supplementary material si figs 10 to 13 fig 7 summarised the following the single pit and soak pit are clear indicators for losses because of soil infiltration as they occur in the beginning of the chain they have increased influence however these soil losses are also associated with high uncertainties quality of inflow technology implementation obviously cistern flush combined with sewers achieve comparatively higher water recovery volumes because inflowing water volumes are also higher but they also have the potential to lead to more losses e g if effluent is simply discharged transport technologies assuming reasonable implementation operation and maintenance have no major impact on resource recovery composting can lead to high recovery ratios but major air losses can occur for total solids and nitrogen either in the composting technology itself or during an earlier or later drying or storage step benitez et al 1999 jönsson et al 2004 lalander et al 2015 meinzinger 2010 yadav et al 2012 systems producing biofuel achieve high recovery rates only if all side streams are exploited for reuse no imperative trade offs exist between energy nutrient or water recovery because the different recovery pathways can be combined and can help to optimize resource recovery for example urine diversion and reuse technologies combined with technologies that transform faeces into biofuel resulted in the highest recovery potentials 3 6 functional groups the shifting factors and key technologies presented in the previous paragraph can clearly be associated with the functional groups user interface sources fg u storage fg s treatment fg t or reuse or disposal sinks fg d sources have a direct impact on water volume and thus on the magnitude of losses or recoveries or if urine diversion or blackwater occurs transport fg c has little influence to validate these results and be more specific we looked at the mean recoveries and losses of all systems over the system templates the results are displayed in fig 8 obviously sinks fg d have a major impact on recovery ratios as they define whether the final product is reused or lost however the storage fg s and treatment fg t are also relevant because they determine how much is lost before products end up in the sinks storage fg s losses are mainly to soil and air and are important for onsite systems without sludge st4 st13 st14 treatment fg t losses are mainly air losses of tn and to a lesser extent ts and are particularly dominant in onsite blackwater systems with sludge st 16 to st18 offsite blackwater systems st19 and biogas systems with effluent transport st10 st11 storage fg s and treatment fg t also have high uncertainties for sinks fg d losses are mainly soil losses and relevant for all templates some biogas and blackwater systems with effluent transport st10 st11 st16 and offsite blackwater systems st19 also show substantial water losses 3 7 uncertainty in fig 9 we show the simulated standard deviation of all substance recovery potentials each dot in a figure represents a system the colour code shows the system template the system belongs to the x axis shows the recovery potential and the y axis shows the standard deviation low and high recovery ratios have lower uncertainties because the tcs cannot vary below 0 or above 100 to conserve the mass balance spuhler et al 2020b as shown in spuhler et al 2020b and dataset spuhler and roller 2020 the identified uncertainties for each technology can already be quite high as they integrated different aspects such as the quality of inflow the technology implementation design and maintenance environmental conditions measurement methods or available knowledge which is particularly limited for novel technologies nevertheless the maximum standard deviation of the system recovery ratio is 28 which is comparable to the accuracy of classical material flow analysis e g montangero and belevi 2008 this indicates that the used approach for the ex ante quantification of resource recovery potentials is capable of producing plausible and thus relevant results for practice as a consequence we suggest to use recovery ratios and standard deviations presented in fig 9 as a data pool to guide any strategic sanitation planning case for instance the resource recovery potentials can be used to prioritise resource efficient systems already at an early planning phase or the recovery ratio are used to compare different options when making a final decision using e g multi criteria decision analysis this would allow to introduce value functions for different resource recovery pathways e g nutrients versus energy and the uncertainties could be used to evaluate the robustness of the final outcome 4 discussion the quantitative analysis of recovery and loss potentials of four typical substances and over 100 000 sanitation systems contribute to science and practice in two ways first most of the input data represents a large body of literature and is therefore generic and could be utilised for other applications thus the resulting recovery and loss potentials and the uncertainty estimations are transferable and could serve as input for the multi criteria decision analysis or costs benefit analysis second we were able to identify system characteristics and technology interactions relevant for recovery potentials in order to help shape future technology and system design in the following two paragraphs we briefly discuss the main results in order to answer our two main questions we will start with the discussion of key characteristics that can help to predict resource recovery and guide future technology and system innovations secondly we will discuss the generalisation of the results and their relevance for strategic planning 4 1 factors influencing resource recovery and losses by analysing the mass flows for a large number of sanitation systems we extracted some key characteristics that have a direct impact on the understanding of resource recovery potentials see also table 3 most of these influencing factors are related to technology interactions and system configurations however we were not able to identify an unequivocal set of factors determining resource recovery or loss which reveals the need for two considerations first performance evaluation in terms of resource recovery cannot be based on a single technology but must be based on the analysis of the entire system second the need for a generic and automated model that allows substance mass flows to be quantified even for large numbers of sanitation systems is highlighted length shorter systems can achieve higher recovery rates due to fewer possibilities for losses each additional treatment step potentially contributes to more losses while the recovery only depends on the sinks quantitative knowledge about such trade offs e g treatment quality versus recovery potential can be used to support the decision making process source the system source functional group fg u strongly impacts both the system configuration and the recovery potentials for all four sources studied tn and ts recovery ratios cannot be as high as for tp and water more stable substances but wet systems based on cistern flush and pour flush toilets generally have lower tn recovery potentials than urine diversion systems due to losses to soil and air however some systems based on wet sources can achieve very high recovery ratios for all substances if they are short and effluent is reused in irrigation obviously wet systems lead to higher water recovery in absolute terms but also more significantly to higher losses in absolute terms dry toilets create systems that perform poorly in recovery either due to the combination with the single pit fg s high soil losses and or sludge treatments such as composting and drying beds fg t high air losses however if dry toilets are linked to pit humus or compost production and irrigation they can achieve high recovery combined with low water use loss urine diversion systems that integrate recovery sinks clearly show recovery potentials for tp tn and ts that are higher than for all other sources other functional groups resource recovery is influenced not only by sources fg u but also by the sinks storage and treatment fg d technologies and how these are combined obviously sinks fg d have a major impact on recovery ratios as they define whether the final product is reused or lost however the storage and treatment technologies define how much of a substance is lost before it enters the sink sink fg d losses are mainly soil losses and relevant for all templates some biogas and blackwater systems with effluent transport system template st10 st11 st16 and offsite blackwater systems st19 also show substantial water losses storage fg s losses are mainly soil and air losses and are important for onsite systems without sludge system template st4 st13 st14 treatment fg t losses are mainly air losses of tn and to a lower extent ts and are particularly dominant in onsite blackwater systems with sludge system template st16 to st18 offsite blackwater systems st19 and biogas systems with effluent transport st10 st11 storage fg s and treatment fg t also have high uncertainties see spuhler and roller 2020 spuhler et al 2020b system templates system templates are currently the approach most used to describe the sanitation system option space see e g gensch et al 2018 tilley et al 2014 wsp 2007 zakaria et al 2015 system templates are not a sufficient indicator for potential resource recovery however different templates lead to different recovery and loss characteristics dry onsite systems without sludge templates st1 and st2 mostly include systems with high losses and little recovery urine diversion templates st4 st6 have the least number of loss systems and the most recovery systems followed by biogas templates st9 st12 the blackwater templates st13 st19 integrate systems with mostly moderate losses however short blackwater systems with relatively little treatment e g st 15 can achieve high recovery ratios for all substances the highest recovery ratios are achieved in urine diversion systems combined with biofuel production st9 key technologies single pits and soak pits based on the literature data we found these clearly show high losses of phosphorus and nitrogen except if urine is separated and recovered and other substances to a smaller extent but these high losses are also associated with high uncertainties dependant on contextual conditions transport generally does not impact recovery potentials cistern flush systems with no sewers achieve higher water recovery but also potentially higher losses composting systems show high recovery potentials for tp and tn but high losses for ts and in some cases also for tn systems with technologies that produce biofuel achieve high recovery rates but only if the side products e g sludge from biogas digesters are also reused e g drying and application to soil there is no imperative trade off between energy nutrient and water recovery the highest recovery is achieved when combining urine diversion and reuse biogas production from faeces in co digestion reuse of sludge for soil amendment and irrigation with any effluent 4 2 relevance of the results the above findings are based on generic data from the literature and therefore likely to be relevant input for strategic planning in general furthermore they could also contribute to the design of future technologies or to the development of policies and decision support tools the generic datasets contain the technologies and systems the considered substances inflows per capita and transfer coefficients and their uncertainties technologies and system configurations the set of technologies covers a broad range of currently available concepts onsite offsite decentralized nature based advanced dry wet etc consequently the generated system configurations also cover almost the entire diversity defined by the system templates see also spuhler et al 2018 system templates the system templates are efficient in describing the diversity of systems in terms of technological concepts however they fail to predict resource recovery this leads us to ask whether a more performance based characterisation of systems would contribute to a more streamlined strategic planning process in this publication we identify a set of factors for resource recovery which could be used to implement such a performance based characterisation and to render templates useful for the operationalisation of sdg 6 for instance the factors would allow groups of templates to be defined based on different types of system requirements e g high freshwater requirements versus low or more importantly on different types of recovery e g nutrients versus energy relevance of substances considered in principle our model could be extended to any substance we have chosen substances which we rated as most relevant to the discourse on sustainable sanitation water management and resource recovery both tp and tn are important macronutrients with significant environmental pollution potential ts can be used as a proxy for energy for example as briquettes or biochar e g andriessen et al 2019 motte et al 2013 and as organic matter for soil amendment e g diener et al 2014 septien et al 2018a principally also the chemical oxygen demand cod or the exergy flow could be used however in most circumstance ts data are more readily available and more frequently used in the available case studies water in many urban areas is under increasing pressure and has become a scarce commodity inflows as for the other input data we used generic data from literature for a reference case of a city zone of 1000 people to quantify inflows e g centre of an emerging small town in nepal these inflows could be adapted to reflect local specifications related to diet nutrient intake water volumes used for flushing or the number of inhabitants however the mean recovery ratio as well as the standard deviation would not change and therefore these results can also be reused directly in any other case transfer coefficients tcs and uncertainties a major strength of our approach is the quantitative integration of literature data in the form of tcs the data in the library are based on an extensive literature research complemented with expert knowledge it represented a compact and accessible overview of the currently available knowledge on the performance of diverse set of sanitation technologies and makes it available for almost any application dataset spuhler and roller 2020 confidence in knowledge about the performance of a specific technology is reflected in the defined variability ranges this approach has two main advantages first it allows to use a large body of knowledge second it enables the evaluation of the robustness of the final results based this can be illustrated with the transfer coefficients for phosphorus and nitrogen in the single pit based on our literature data we found a median p loss to soil of 71 and a variability range of almost 40 this high literature data variability is due to the uncertainty about the technology implementation e g how sealed is it the local context e g climate and most importantly the inflowing product dilution of the products considering not only the median but the variability range as well allows to safeguard this knowledge in the simulation the uncertainty reflects in the standard deviations of the resource recovery of the entire systems which in this case are almost as high as the recovery ratio itself this was shown for system 11 in a didactic example presented in spuhler et al 2020b nevertheless it is important to note that the coefficients presented here may not be fully representative of all possible conditions in the world especially for complex processes that can vary greatly depending on context additional to these generic data we also compared our results to those from similar studies to check the plausibility of the resource recovery results for instance we found a median nitrogen recovery of 76 in st6 dry onsite storage and treatment with urine diversion fig 6 this is very similar to the nitrogen recovery potentials of 82 for urine diverting composting latrine systems found in orner and mihelcic 2018 the maximum standard deviation of the recovery ratio is 28 which is comparable to the accuracy found by montangero and belevi 2008 this study used a material flow analysis to determine the phosphorus flows to surface water from sanitation systems in hanoi and found 1572 tonnes per year with a standard deviation of 608 tonnes due to the generic approach both the resource recovery potentials and the key influencing factors generalize well we see three possible use for the results in practice as an input into strategic sanitation planning either to pre screen for resource efficient systems or systems with low emissions during the pre planning phase for instance if sensitive urban water bodies require protection systems with high nitrogen or phosphorus water losses could be eliminated from the beginning or in the case of a demand for organic fertiliser systems with high nutrient recovery potentials could be preselected see also spuhler et al 2020b obviously the resource recovery and loss potentials are not the only performance indicator for sustainable sanitation but should be evaluated simultaneously with other important indicators such as hygiene economic and financial viability and technical institutional and socio cultural appropriateness e g bracken et al 2005 spuhler et al 2020a susana 2008 in spuhler et al 2018 we provide a method to evaluate the technical institutional and socio cultural appropriateness the key factors for resource recovery and the four recommendations for their optimisation could be used for the fine tuning of systems during the detailed planning and implementation phase for example the length of the system could be optimised with the combination of different recovery sinks the key factors and recommendations could also guide researchers or technology developers working on future innovations for instance the recommendations for resource recovery could be used to guide the development of containment and treatment technologies that minimise losses above these direct practical applications we also see a potential of the presented approach to be used by researchers or technology developer the potential recovery potentials of a novel technology could be pre evaluated by first generating valid system configurations and then quantifying potential recovery ratio this aspect is discussed on in spuhler et al 2020b 4 3 outlook the most obvious next step would be to make the results available to practice an interactive user interface could be developed with different use cases for instance one could submit a technology and its transfer coefficients and would get back possible system configurations and phosphorus recovery potentials translating the influencing factors into guidelines for future technology development is another way of dissemination as described in the relevance chapter attempts to summarize the results with easy to interpret decision guidance for option selection were not very successful as shown in the example decision tree shown in supplementary information si figure 15 in the supplementary information this hints to highly interlinked influence factors another exciting future activity includes the expansion of the technology library with additional products e g greywater stormwater or organic solid waste and technologies e g black solder flies vertical gardens etc this would allow to analyse the resulting systems and their recovery and loss potentials and to complete the set of recommendations provided here 4 4 limitations it is important to note that the models used to produce the presented data are based on a number of simplifications that include the very generic definitions of technologies and products consequently the substance transfer coefficients which are defined for each technology and product are also impacted by these simplifications therefore systems must be checked by an expert for plausibility when they are being seriously considered as planning options an example is the treatment of faeces alone in a biogas reactor it would not make much sense from an engineering perspective while it would make sense if sludge and e g organics are also digested in the same reactor another example concerns transfer coefficients soil loss in a single pit could be defined much more accurately if one would know whether the input product is moist excreta with pour flush water or dry pure faeces consequently the approach is suitable for strategic planning but not for detailed design and implementation of a specific sanitation system modelling substance flows based only on tcs is clearly a simplification as it excludes possible substance generation e g through biological fixation see also spuhler et al 2020b for most technologies this limitation is not relevant a more detailed approach would substantially increase computational demand and the collection of comparable parameters from literature would also be difficult another simplification is the assumption of fault free implementation operation and maintenance of the technologies importantly these simplifications allow the automation and generalization of the model application consequences of the simplifications are captured in the uncertainty calculations the user is free to be more specific in the technology and product definition e g make different types of single pits for different products or to use more complicated tc models if more accuracy is needed 5 conclusions and outlook nutrient water and total solids recovery potentials and losses to the environment are relevant indicators in evaluation of the sustainability of different sanitation options by analysing a large set of system options representative for almost the entire option space we could 1 quantify resource recovery and loss potentials that are generic and can be used to influence technology design or strategic planning and 2 identify characteristics of sanitation systems that provide information on potential resource recovery and losses and can be used to orientate future technology and system development the consideration of a large body of international literature data and expert knowledge to generate is the results is enabled through a novel approach to consider uncertainty factors influencing recovery are related to the interaction of different technologies in a system for instance even if a sink technology could potentially recover 99 of inflowing substances the recovery of the entire system will depend on the fraction of substances that actually arrives at this specific sink this means that resource recovery potentials have to be looked at on a system level and not at an individual technology level it also justifies such a modelling approach that allows to look at all possible configurations factors influencing resource recovery are source and sink technologies the length of the systems and the storage and treatment technologies and their level of containment moreover five key recommendations for the optimization of resource recovery from sanitation systems are developed i prioritize short systems that close the loop at the lowest possible level fewer treatment steps less losses ii separate waste streams as much as possible because this does not lead necessarily to fewer treatment steps but it allows for higher recovery potentials e g through urine diversion iii use storage and treatment technologies that contain the products as much as possible avoid leaching technologies e g single pits and technologies with high risk of volatilization e g drying beds iv design sinks to optimise recovery and avoid disposal sinks and v combine various reuse options for different side streams e g urine diversion systems that combine reuse of urine and production of biofuel from faeces the comparative analysis also showed that system templates are very efficient in describing technological diversity but not in providing indicators on resource recovery this leads to the question of whether the concept of system templates should be adapted in order to become more performance based and thereby more useful for the strategic planning process in line with sdg 6 the factors for resource recovery which we present here could be used to implement such a performance based characterisation for instance based on different types of recovery e g nutrients versus energy in order to make the generic resource recovery potentials available for practice an interactive interface could be developed that would allow browsing and extracting results for a specific system for instance one could submit a given system configuration and the number of inhabitants of its area to receive the specific resource recovery potentials or one could provide a number of technologies and explore which systems could be used and find their respective resource recovery potentials the same could be done to explore loss potentials as indicators for environmental pollution another straightforward extension of the approach would be to include additional substances e g potassium technologies e g future innovations or product streams e g solid waste or storm water future research activities could look at the potential quantification of performance indicators other than resource and loss potentials for instance the mass flows within a system could feed into technology specific costing functions as discussed in spuhler and germann 2019 this would allow the exploration of economies of scale author contributions d

17532,resource recovery and emissions from sanitation systems are critical sustainability indicators for strategic urban sanitation planning in this context sanitation systems are the most often structured using technology driven templates rather than performance based sustainability indicators in this work we answer two questions firstly can we estimate generic resource recovery and loss potentials and their uncertainties for a diverse and large set of sanitation systems and secondly can we identify technological aspects of sanitation systems that indicate a better overall resource recovery performance the aim is to obtain information that can be used as an input into any strategic planning process and to help shape technology development and system design for resource recovery in the future starting from 41 technologies which include novel and conventional options we build 101 548 valid sanitation system configurations for each system configuration we quantify phosphorus nitrogen total solids and water flows and use that to calculate recovery potentials and losses to the environment i e the soil air or surface water the four substances cover different properties and serve as a proxy for nutrient organics energy and water resources for modelling the flows ex ante we use a novel approach to consider a large range of international literature and expert data considering uncertainties thus all results are generic and can therefore be used as input into any strategic planning process or to help guide future technology development a detailed analysis of the results allows us to identify factors that influence recovery and losses these factors include the type of source the length of systems and the level of containment in storage and treatment the factors influencing recovery are related to interactions of different technologies in a system which shows the relevance of a modelling approach that allows to look at all possible system configurations systematically based on our analysis we developed five recommendations for the optimization of resource recovery i prioritize short systems that close the loop at the lowest possible level ii separate waste streams as much as possible because this allows for higher recovery potentials iii use storage and treatment technologies that contain the products as much as possible avoid

and thereby promotes social and economic development sustainable sanitation also protects natural resources by closing material cycles the aim is to reduce the net consumption of water and nutrients and to prevent pollution and accumulation of emerging pollutants andersson et al 2018 nikiema et al 2014 rao et al 2017 susana 2008 sustainable sanitation that allows for resource recovery has the

tobias et al 2017 such innovations have the potential to enhance sustainability and resilience by reducing water requirements being more adaptable for socio demographic changes and environmental changes and allowing for recovery of nutrient energy and water resources e g diener et al 2014 larsen et al 2016 tilmans et al 2015 tobias et al 2017 being independent from energy water and sewer networks these innovations are also more appropriate for developing urban areas e g evans 2013 hoffmann et al 2020 larsen et al 2016 russel et al 2019 where most current population growth is taking place dodman et al 2013 undesa 2014 today it is widely recognized that substance flows and resource recovery potentials are highly relevant performance indicators for sustainability evaluations of different sanitation systems e g ashley et al 2008 drangert et al 2018 harder et al 2019 orner and mihelcic 2018 they serve as input for comparisons using methods such as multi criteria decision analysis schütze et al 2019 life cycle analysis pasqualino et al 2009 or cost benefit analysis balkema et al 2002 döberl et al 2002 currently the sanitation system options space is however mostly structured based on technologies and their characteristics but not on their functions and performance characteristics related to sustainability this is reflected in the sanitation system templates spuhler et al 2018 tilley et al 2014 or the sanitation ladder used by the joint monitoring programme who and unicef 2017 to consider resource recovery in line with sdg 6 un 2014 a more functional approach to characterise sanitation systems is required as suggested by the functional sanitation ladder kvarnström et al 2011 one of these functions is the protection of the environment and natural resources kvarnström et al 2011 susana 2008 the most straightforward attribute that allows to evaluate this objectives is the knowledge how much pollutants are lost to the environment and how much of resources can be recovered e g lienert et al 2015 mcconville et al 2014 spuhler et al 2020a interestingly for sanitation systems many of occurring substances such as nutrients or organic matter are both potential pollutant and resource for agricultural or energy production therefore a typical method to quantify resource recovery and loss potentials is material flow analysis mfa also known as substance flow modelling sfm it is a type of system analysis based on the principles of mass balances providing indication of material use emissions and costs the nature of the system is captured in a mathematical model analytical methods quantify flows and stocks of substances and or materials which are transformed or consumed within the system boundaries baccini and brunner 2012 brunner and rechberger 2004 mfa sfm are widely applied for waste and wastewater management in europe beretta et al 2013 binder 2007 binder et al 2010 binder et al 2009 cooper and carliell marquet 2013 finnveden

2012 wang 2013 yiougo et al 2011 various simulation tools have been implemented to support these quantifications e g i static modelling of costs and contaminant for treatment units e g wawttar finney

energy costs and emissions of entire systems e g orware assefa et al 2005 urware dahlmann 2009 jeppsson et al 2005 more recently also a simulation software that potentially could be applied for novel sanitation systems has been developed schütze et al 2019 unfortunately all these models require detailed knowledge about technologies and how they connect together as well as available data or in situ measurements to quantify transfer coefficients the data requirements make it very demanding to use sfm at a pre planning stage consequently they most existing studies apply sfm to a few technologies and systems in a specific context only e g montangero and belevi 2007 the increasing number of technologies and corresponding system configurations increase the complexity further as shown in spuhler et al 2020b a set of over 40 technologies can be combined to over 100 000 plausible system configurations due to combinatorial explosion little knowledge exists about which combination might be the most performant for a given case moreover little or no data exists on novel technologies and systems therefore we have developed a method for the ex ante quantification of substance flows e g nutrients water total solids of a diverse and large set of sanitation systems which we presented in spuhler et al 2020b this method builds on algorithms that automatically generate sanitation systems spuhler et al 2018 the model uses different technologies as building blocks and products as connectors each technology contains transfer coefficients for the substance in question the flow path of substances is defined by the connections between technologies the fate of the substances is defined by three loss compartments air loss soil loss and surface water loss and one recovery compartment to be applicable ex ante the algorithms are complemented with a data library that provides transfer coefficients based on international literature and expert knowledge dataset spuhler and roller 2020 additionally uncertainties are modelled to express the variability of available data and the confidence in the expert opinion by summing up all losses and recoveries for a system the overall system resource recovery potentials and their uncertainty can be calculated these results serve as basis for the performance comparison of the different sanitation systems in question the experiences from developing this model and its preliminary application to a full case real example have indicated that there exists some system characteristics that could help to predict the resource recovery or loss potentials these predictors could be used to develop a more functional characterisation of the system options at least in relation to resource recovery and loss potentials 1 1 aim in this work we aim to answer the following two questions 1 can we estimate generic resource recovery and loss potentials and their uncertainties for a diverse and large set of sanitation systems 2 can we identify technological characteristics of sanitation systems that indicate a better overall resource recovery performance and therefore can be used as a predictor for resource recovery potentials or to guide future technology and system development to answer these questions we perform a quantitative analysis of the recovery and loss potentials for a diverse and large range of sanitation systems using the model and full scale application from spuhler et al 2020b this case generated from 41 sanitation technologies 101 548 valid sanitation systems and quantifies the resource recovery and loss potentials for nitrogen phosphorus total solids and water 2 methods 2 1 overview this paper presents an advanced application of a modelling approach previously presented in spuhler et al 2020b the approach includes two main elements first spuhler et al 2020b presents a generic substance flow model to be applied ex ante and for a large and diverse set of sanitation technologies and systems and secondly spuhler et al 2020b also presents transfer coefficients for four substances for 41 technologies the four substances represent different properties and cover nutrients phosphorus nitrogen total solids as a proxy for energy and organics and water these results are then to be looked at and discussed in regards of the influence of technical aspects such as technology interaction and system configurations on resource recovery and losses the advanced application requires three steps 1 the generation of entire system using the system builder spuhler et al 2018 2 the characterisation of the option space using the system templates as defined in spuhler et al 2020b 3 the modelling of substance flows in all sanitation systems and the quantification of recovery and loss potentials spuhler et al 2020b the definition of the technologies and the transfer coefficients are provided in the technology library that is available here https doi org 10 25678 0000ss dataset spuhler and roller 2020 and spuhler and roller 2020 the system builder and the substance flow model are implemented in julia bezanson et al 2017 and are accessible at https github com eawag sww sanitationsystemmassflow jl v1 0 a copy of the algorithms as well as all input and output data used for this publication are available in the associated data package at eric https doi org 10 25678 0001tn dataset spuhler 2020 2 2 sanitation system generation sanitation system generation is based on the system builder spuhler et al 2018 which is an algorithm that automatically generates all valid sanitation system configurations from a set of technologies here we provide just a short summary of definitions and the applied methodology a sanitation technology tech is defined as any process infrastructure method or service that contains transforms or transports sanitation products it is characterized by its name and the in and output products e g blackwater or greywater septic tank sludge and effluent and its functional group fg the toilet user interface or source fg u on site storage fg s conveyance fg c treatment fg t and reuse or disposal sinks fg d a technology belonging to fg u is always a source while a technology belonging to fg d is always a sink in this paper we focus on toilet sources only a sanitation system sansys is defined as a combination of compatible technologies which manage sanitation products from the point of generation to a final point of reuse or disposal maurer et al 2012 spuhler et al 2018 tilley et al 2014 a sanitation system is valid if it contains only compatible technologies and every sanitation product either finds its way into a subsequent technology or a sink spuhler et al 2018 two sanitation technologies are compatible if the output product of one can be the input product of the other maurer et al 2012 for each source fg u the system builder tests stepwise which combination of technologies allow treatment of output products and ends when there is no further combination possible this happens when there is no more output meaning that a valid system was formed or when it results in an open ended system which is not valid and abandoned loops between technologies are only permitted if the infrastructures are situated close enough to each other which is true for technologies from the functional groups storage fg s and treatment fg t an example would be a loop between the two technologies wastewater stabilisation pond wsp and a biogas reactor both from fg t the sludge from the wsp could be circulated to the biogas reactor while the effluent from the reactor could be circulated back to the wsp 2 3 characterisation of the option space system templates starting from 41 technologies typically over 100 000 systems can be automatically generated to structure and characterize the option space system templates sts are used the templates characterize technologies in terms of technological features and thereby group them regarding technical concepts dry or wet urine diversion energy recovery etc and spatial concepts onsite offsite decentralized hybrid the system templates were first defined in tilley et al 2010 and further detailed in the compendium of sanitation systems and technologies tilley et al 2014 this compendium is supported by the the water supply sanitation collaborative council and by the international water association its second edition is published in six different languages based on this widespread use spuhler and germann 2019 spuhler et al 2020a spuhler and scheidegger 2019 we adapted the existing templates to include novel technologies such as the production of liquid urine fertilizer or briquetting see also section 2 6 here we use the templates from spuhler et al 2020b which include 19 templates that cover the entire options space while grouping the options into four categories simple onsite systems st1 st3 urine diversion st4 st8 biofuel systems st9 st12 and blackwater systems st13 st19 an overview is shown in fig 1 based on dataset spuhler and roller 2020 2 4 substance flow modelling to quantify substance mass flows transfer coefficients tcs for each technology are required the tcs define how much of an entering substance is either transferred to one of the output products or to the loss compartments air soil or surface water the tcs and the corresponding uncertainties as well as the data used to define them are compiled in the technology library dataset spuhler and roller 2020 the detailed description on how transfer coefficients and their uncertainties are derived can be found in spuhler et al 2020b here we provide a short overview we use two ways to define transfer coefficient whenever possible we use literature data from which we selected the median of all data reported and the variability range between the lowest and highest data point to model the uncertainty in the absence of literature data for example for very novel technologies we contacted experts involved in the development of the technology there we elicited the median value for the tc based on the expert s judgement to define the variability range we used their confidence in the knowledge about the substance behaviour and the technology readiness level all variability ranges are expressed as a concentration factor and modelled using a dirichlet distribution using the transfer coefficients the inputs are propagated through the systems this allows to calculate for each technology the percentage of substance transferred or lost in the sink technologies substances are not transferred further but either lost or recovered by summing up all losses and recoveries within one system the system s resource recovery and loss potentials can be calculated the uncertainties are computed by monte carlo error propagation and expressed as standard deviations the standard deviations obtained in preliminary results spuhler et al 2020b are comparable to those obtained in studies applying a more sophisticated conventional post ante material flow analysis in sanitation systems e g montangero and belevi 2008 therefore we concluded that our approach is capable of providing reasonable results also ex ante spuhler et al 2020b 2 5 substances and inflows so far we have defined transfer coefficients for four substances that typify different properties total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn total solids ts and water h2o all four substances are relevant as indicators for resource recovery and pollution potential both phosphorus and nitrogen have value and crucial significance as important macronutrients there are resources to be recovered and as environmental pollutants there are emissions to be minimised total solids can be used as a proxy for energy that could be recovered for example in the form of briquettes or biochar as well as for organic matter that could be recovered as soil amendment if discharged into the environment total solids also has significant pollution potential water is under increasing pressure in many urban areas and has become a scarce commodity which should either be saved or reused for these four substances we also defined fluxes for toilet sources using the values based on international literature e g lohri et al 2010 rose et al 2015 provided in the technology library these inflow values are shown in table 1 and are based on literature from all over the world and therefore are quite generic for the application in a specific case those values could be adjusted to account for the local diet and flush water usages because we are more interested in the impact of the technology uncertainty then the uncertainty related to the population specificities in a given case we did not consider inflow variability in our calculations however the variability range of the literature data can be found in the supplementary material of spuhler et al 2020b and in the technology library dataset spuhler and roller 2020 2 6 technologies and application case in collaboration with a swiss philanthropic organisation and a local organisation we tested the system builder from spuhler et al 2018 and the sfm model from spuhler et al 2020b in nepal in 2017 the details for this application case are described in spuhler et al 2018 the characterisation of the technology is independent of the case and are therefore fully transferrable to any case as shown in spuhler et al 2020b therefore the case circumstances are not relevant for the analysis presented in this manuscript the 41 sanitation technologies see fig 2 are originally based on the compendium tilley et al 2014 and further developed in spuhler et al 2018 and spuhler et al 2020b the resulting set includes conventional as well as novel technologies examples of such novel technologies include production of liquid urine fertilizer aurin and its application bonvin et al 2015 etter et al 2015 fumasoli et al 2016 briquetting based on the process implemented by sanivation in naivasha jones 2017 and latrine dehydration and pasteurization using ladepa pelletizing septien et al 2018b using these 41 technologies the system builder created automatically 101 548 valid sanitation systems valid means they are all able to manage all products from a given source in such a way that no open output remains at the end the number is so high because of combinatorial explosion the large number of generated sanitation systems represents almost the entire space of potential solutions some of them with only minor variations it is important to note that we here only consider toilet sources in order to reduce the complexity of the results we also did not consider urine diversion flush toilets and therefore no systems from st7 and st8 were formed however the underlying models both the system builder and the substance flow model could also accommodate other streams and related technologies such as greywater stormwater or organic solid waste for the substance flow modelling we used the transfer coefficients from the library and inflow masses for 1000 person equivalent and a period of one year this was based on the requirements of our partner organisation that aimed of developing a city sanitation plan for the centre of the small town in nepal 2 7 data analysis to identify the influence of technical aspects such as technology interaction and system configurations on resource recovery and losses we used r for visual data analysis r development core team 2018 we also triangulated and reflected the results with data from two other case studies for larger cities one of this case studies was the city of arba minch with 100 000 inhabitants in ethiopia and another case studies was a low income settlement of 20 000 inhabitants in lima peru with visual data analysis we refer to plotting different combinations of results in order to show dependencies between different technical aspects such as for instance the occurrence of urine diversion or the length of a system 3 results 3 1 overview from the 41 techs 101 548 valid sanitation systems were generated and the substance flows for total phosphorus tp nitrogen tn total solids ts and water h2o were computed considering the uncertainty of the tcs fig 3 shows a density plot of the resource recovery of all systems in the x axis the recover potential from 0 to 100 is shown and in the y axis the relative occurrence of systems with a given recovery density for tp tn and ts we show the ratio for water we provide the absolute volume m3year 1 as the relative recovery does not provide any useful information e g comparing dry toilets with pour flush as can be expected across more than 100 000 systems all four substances show recovery from nothing to almost 100 this indicates that the choice of technologies has enough breadth to cover the entire spectrum however the maximum recovery ratio for the four substances are different and lower for nitrogen and total solids than for phosphorus and water 98 for tp 87 for tn 88 for ts and 97 for h2o also the shapes of the profiles differ greatly from each other but all of them show several peaks indicating some key characteristics that lead to shifts in the recovery potentials in the following paragraphs we look at some of these key characteristics in more detail 3 2 source technologies fg u the two wet sources u1 cistern flush and u2 pour flush toilets generate the same output product blackwater and therefore also the same numbers of sansys 26 124 for dry toilets u3 the number of valid systems is significantly lower 3704 because the generated output excreta can enter far fewer subsequent technologies and results in fewer partitions almost half of all the sansys generated 45 596 originate from the urine diversion dry toilet u4 increasing the diversity of the option space uddt toilets generate two output products urine and faeces the more products occur the more valid system configurations can be created besides the fact that sources influence the number of system configurations they also impact the recovery potentials and losses this is illustrated in fig 4 which shows all resource recovery and loss potentials grouped by the source of the system each dot represents a system the colours represent the sources for phosphorus the median recovery ratio is highest for uddts 61 and lowest for dry toilets 21 tp losses are dominated by soil loss and significantly higher for dry toilets which show a median soil loss of 75 as compared to 32 and 37 for wet sources and uddts respectively but for wet sources substantial amounts can also be lost to surface waters a similar but even more pronounced pattern is observed for nitrogen again the highest median recovery which is 75 is observed for uddt systems and the lowest for dry toilets 4 nitrogen losses go also to the soil and are also higher for dry sources 29 for dry toilet 17 for wet sources and 5 for uddts what is different for nitrogen is that high amounts are also lost to the air for all sources 59 for dry toilet 40 for wet sources and 15 for uddts for total solids the pattern is similar to the nitrogen pattern but less pronounced water recovery is obviously dominated by cistern flush systems as the water volume entering the system is much higher 0 to 21 773 m3year 1 median of 1687 m3year 1 however cistern flush systems also have the potential for important losses from all three compartments 3125 m3year 1 to air 362 m3year 1 to water and 4021 m3year 1 to soil in summary we learn three things from this figure first dry toilets result in much higher losses and thus in lower recovery potentials secondly uddt systems result in low losses and high recovery ratio and thirdly most losses occur for nitrogen and total solids 3 3 system length number of technologies in a system urine diversion systems are generally longer and more complex more products more bifurcations and onsite dry st1 and st2 biogas or blackwater e g st9 st13 and st16 systems are shorter for longer systems the number of different sansys and thus the diversity increases illustrated by the high number of uddt systems however this also means that sansys which are longer are also more similar and therefore have similar resource recovery potentials this is illustrated in fig 5 showing a clustering of similar recovery potentials to the right the figure also shows that the median recovery potential increases initially with length and is maximal at 14 technologies but there are some very short systems that show extreme values either very low what is the case for systems including uncontained storage and a disposal sink or very high recovery ratio for systems that include contained storage and a recovery sink the absolute highest recovery is achieved in short uddt systems combined with biofuel again st9 for longer uddt systems recovery is systematically reduced by more possibilities for losses this shows that the shorter the system the higher the potential for a very high recovery 3 4 templates table 2 provides the number of systems per system template st and the detailed description of each template there are far fewer onsite simple systems than urine diversion biofuel or blackwater systems mainly because they are simpler and fewer permutations can be generated fig 6 shows the recovery potentials for all substances grouped by template and coloured by source most templates include systems with both high and low recoveries thus template are not sufficient indicators for resource recovery potentials exceptions are st1 and st2 with exclusively low recovery rates the clouds indicate clusters of systems with similar recovery potentials some sts show only two clusters of either very high or very low recovery potentials e g st3 dry onsite and composting this distinction is due to only a few products ending up either in a disposal or in a recovery sink at a first glance the pattern of all four substances looks similar but there are some differences for phosphorus urine diversion templates st4 st6 show the highest median recovery ratio followed by the biofuel templates st9 st12 and some blackwater templates st14 st16 the five systems with the absolute highest phosphorus recovery ratios are from st3 onsite composting and st14 onsite blackwater systems with fewer treatment steps this is different for the accumulated recovery ratio which is highest for st9 as we have shown in the previous paragraph and fig 5 for nitrogen and total solids urine diversion templates clearly outcompete the other the five systems with the highest nitrogen recovery ratios are from st6 urine diversion and onsite faeces storage and st9 urine diversion and biofuel production the five sansys with the highest total solids recovery ratios are also from st9 and st11 with exclusively uddt sources this also explains why the absolute highest accumulated recovery is achieved in st9 for water the recovery ratio in is not that interesting as a system with high recovery is similar to a system with low use therefore we look at the absolute amount of water recovered or lost higher recovery is obviously obtained in templates with a cistern flush toilet st9 to st 19 the five sansys with the highest water recovery by mass are again from st9 followed by a st11 and st15 onsite blackwater system high water recovery ratios in can also be achieved by dry systems especially uddt systems but are obviously not relevant in absolute terms looking at the accumulated ratios bottom of fig 6 urine diversion systems clearly perform best especially if combined with biofuel production as it is the case for st9 onsite biofuel without effluent transport or st11 offsite biogas without blackwater transport 3 5 shifting factors and key technologies the peaks in fig 3 and clusters in fig 6 indicate that key characteristics act as shifting factors which are either due to the occurrence of a single technology or a combination of technologies by analysing the systems that are part of the peaks we identified ten possible shifting factors 1 if a single pit is part of the system 2 if transport is by pipe 3 if no transport technology occurs purely onsite system 4 if urine source separation occurs in uddt 5 if blackwater occurs 6 if biofuel production occurs 7 if toilet producing pit occur i e in twin pits 8 if composting technologies are used 9 if surface water discharge is used and 10 if soak pits are used we used visual data analysis to better understand the respective influence of these shifting factors the detailed figures are presented in the supplementary material si figs 10 to 13 fig 7 summarised the following the single pit and soak pit are clear indicators for losses because of soil infiltration as they occur in the beginning of the chain they have increased influence however these soil losses are also associated with high uncertainties quality of inflow technology implementation obviously cistern flush combined with sewers achieve comparatively higher water recovery volumes because inflowing water volumes are also higher but they also have the potential to lead to more losses e g if effluent is simply discharged transport technologies assuming reasonable implementation operation and maintenance have no major impact on resource recovery composting can lead to high recovery ratios but major air losses can occur for total solids and nitrogen either in the composting technology itself or during an earlier or later drying or storage step benitez et al 1999 jönsson et al 2004 lalander et al 2015 meinzinger 2010 yadav et al 2012 systems producing biofuel achieve high recovery rates only if all side streams are exploited for reuse no imperative trade offs exist between energy nutrient or water recovery because the different recovery pathways can be combined and can help to optimize resource recovery for example urine diversion and reuse technologies combined with technologies that transform faeces into biofuel resulted in the highest recovery potentials 3 6 functional groups the shifting factors and key technologies presented in the previous paragraph can clearly be associated with the functional groups user interface sources fg u storage fg s treatment fg t or reuse or disposal sinks fg d sources have a direct impact on water volume and thus on the magnitude of losses or recoveries or if urine diversion or blackwater occurs transport fg c has little influence to validate these results and be more specific we looked at the mean recoveries and losses of all systems over the system templates the results are displayed in fig 8 obviously sinks fg d have a major impact on recovery ratios as they define whether the final product is reused or lost however the storage fg s and treatment fg t are also relevant because they determine how much is lost before products end up in the sinks storage fg s losses are mainly to soil and air and are important for onsite systems without sludge st4 st13 st14 treatment fg t losses are mainly air losses of tn and to a lesser extent ts and are particularly dominant in onsite blackwater systems with sludge st 16 to st18 offsite blackwater systems st19 and biogas systems with effluent transport st10 st11 storage fg s and treatment fg t also have high uncertainties for sinks fg d losses are mainly soil losses and relevant for all templates some biogas and blackwater systems with effluent transport st10 st11 st16 and offsite blackwater systems st19 also show substantial water losses 3 7 uncertainty in fig 9 we show the simulated standard deviation of all substance recovery potentials each dot in a figure represents a system the colour code shows the system template the system belongs to the x axis shows the recovery potential and the y axis shows the standard deviation low and high recovery ratios have lower uncertainties because the tcs cannot vary below 0 or above 100 to conserve the mass balance spuhler et al 2020b as shown in spuhler et al 2020b and dataset spuhler and roller 2020 the identified uncertainties for each technology can already be quite high as they integrated different aspects such as the quality of inflow the technology implementation design and maintenance environmental conditions measurement methods or available knowledge which is particularly limited for novel technologies nevertheless the maximum standard deviation of the system recovery ratio is 28 which is comparable to the accuracy of classical material flow analysis e g montangero and belevi 2008 this indicates that the used approach for the ex ante quantification of resource recovery potentials is capable of producing plausible and thus relevant results for practice as a consequence we suggest to use recovery ratios and standard deviations presented in fig 9 as a data pool to guide any strategic sanitation planning case for instance the resource recovery potentials can be used to prioritise resource efficient systems already at an early planning phase or the recovery ratio are used to compare different options when making a final decision using e g multi criteria decision analysis this would allow to introduce value functions for different resource recovery pathways e g nutrients versus energy and the uncertainties could be used to evaluate the robustness of the final outcome 4 discussion the quantitative analysis of recovery and loss potentials of four typical substances and over 100 000 sanitation systems contribute to science and practice in two ways first most of the input data represents a large body of literature and is therefore generic and could be utilised for other applications thus the resulting recovery and loss potentials and the uncertainty estimations are transferable and could serve as input for the multi criteria decision analysis or costs benefit analysis second we were able to identify system characteristics and technology interactions relevant for recovery potentials in order to help shape future technology and system design in the following two paragraphs we briefly discuss the main results in order to answer our two main questions we will start with the discussion of key characteristics that can help to predict resource recovery and guide future technology and system innovations secondly we will discuss the generalisation of the results and their relevance for strategic planning 4 1 factors influencing resource recovery and losses by analysing the mass flows for a large number of sanitation systems we extracted some key characteristics that have a direct impact on the understanding of resource recovery potentials see also table 3 most of these influencing factors are related to technology interactions and system configurations however we were not able to identify an unequivocal set of factors determining resource recovery or loss which reveals the need for two considerations first performance evaluation in terms of resource recovery cannot be based on a single technology but must be based on the analysis of the entire system second the need for a generic and automated model that allows substance mass flows to be quantified even for large numbers of sanitation systems is highlighted length shorter systems can achieve higher recovery rates due to fewer possibilities for losses each additional treatment step potentially contributes to more losses while the recovery only depends on the sinks quantitative knowledge about such trade offs e g treatment quality versus recovery potential can be used to support the decision making process source the system source functional group fg u strongly impacts both the system configuration and the recovery potentials for all four sources studied tn and ts recovery ratios cannot be as high as for tp and water more stable substances but wet systems based on cistern flush and pour flush toilets generally have lower tn recovery potentials than urine diversion systems due to losses to soil and air however some systems based on wet sources can achieve very high recovery ratios for all substances if they are short and effluent is reused in irrigation obviously wet systems lead to higher water recovery in absolute terms but also more significantly to higher losses in absolute terms dry toilets create systems that perform poorly in recovery either due to the combination with the single pit fg s high soil losses and or sludge treatments such as composting and drying beds fg t high air losses however if dry toilets are linked to pit humus or compost production and irrigation they can achieve high recovery combined with low water use loss urine diversion systems that integrate recovery sinks clearly show recovery potentials for tp tn and ts that are higher than for all other sources other functional groups resource recovery is influenced not only by sources fg u but also by the sinks storage and treatment fg d technologies and how these are combined obviously sinks fg d have a major impact on recovery ratios as they define whether the final product is reused or lost however the storage and treatment technologies define how much of a substance is lost before it enters the sink sink fg d losses are mainly soil losses and relevant for all templates some biogas and blackwater systems with effluent transport system template st10 st11 st16 and offsite blackwater systems st19 also show substantial water losses storage fg s losses are mainly soil and air losses and are important for onsite systems without sludge system template st4 st13 st14 treatment fg t losses are mainly air losses of tn and to a lower extent ts and are particularly dominant in onsite blackwater systems with sludge system template st16 to st18 offsite blackwater systems st19 and biogas systems with effluent transport st10 st11 storage fg s and treatment fg t also have high uncertainties see spuhler and roller 2020 spuhler et al 2020b system templates system templates are currently the approach most used to describe the sanitation system option space see e g gensch et al 2018 tilley et al 2014 wsp 2007 zakaria et al 2015 system templates are not a sufficient indicator for potential resource recovery however different templates lead to different recovery and loss characteristics dry onsite systems without sludge templates st1 and st2 mostly include systems with high losses and little recovery urine diversion templates st4 st6 have the least number of loss systems and the most recovery systems followed by biogas templates st9 st12 the blackwater templates st13 st19 integrate systems with mostly moderate losses however short blackwater systems with relatively little treatment e g st 15 can achieve high recovery ratios for all substances the highest recovery ratios are achieved in urine diversion systems combined with biofuel production st9 key technologies single pits and soak pits based on the literature data we found these clearly show high losses of phosphorus and nitrogen except if urine is separated and recovered and other substances to a smaller extent but these high losses are also associated with high uncertainties dependant on contextual conditions transport generally does not impact recovery potentials cistern flush systems with no sewers achieve higher water recovery but also potentially higher losses composting systems show high recovery potentials for tp and tn but high losses for ts and in some cases also for tn systems with technologies that produce biofuel achieve high recovery rates but only if the side products e g sludge from biogas digesters are also reused e g drying and application to soil there is no imperative trade off between energy nutrient and water recovery the highest recovery is achieved when combining urine diversion and reuse biogas production from faeces in co digestion reuse of sludge for soil amendment and irrigation with any effluent 4 2 relevance of the results the above findings are based on generic data from the literature and therefore likely to be relevant input for strategic planning in general furthermore they could also contribute to the design of future technologies or to the development of policies and decision support tools the generic datasets contain the technologies and systems the considered substances inflows per capita and transfer coefficients and their uncertainties technologies and system configurations the set of technologies covers a broad range of currently available concepts onsite offsite decentralized nature based advanced dry wet etc consequently the generated system configurations also cover almost the entire diversity defined by the system templates see also spuhler et al 2018 system templates the system templates are efficient in describing the diversity of systems in terms of technological concepts however they fail to predict resource recovery this leads us to ask whether a more performance based characterisation of systems would contribute to a more streamlined strategic planning process in this publication we identify a set of factors for resource recovery which could be used to implement such a performance based characterisation and to render templates useful for the operationalisation of sdg 6 for instance the factors would allow groups of templates to be defined based on different types of system requirements e g high freshwater requirements versus low or more importantly on different types of recovery e g nutrients versus energy relevance of substances considered in principle our model could be extended to any substance we have chosen substances which we rated as most relevant to the discourse on sustainable sanitation water management and resource recovery both tp and tn are important macronutrients with significant environmental pollution potential ts can be used as a proxy for energy for example as briquettes or biochar e g andriessen et al 2019 motte et al 2013 and as organic matter for soil amendment e g diener et al 2014 septien et al 2018a principally also the chemical oxygen demand cod or the exergy flow could be used however in most circumstance ts data are more readily available and more frequently used in the available case studies water in many urban areas is under increasing pressure and has become a scarce commodity inflows as for the other input data we used generic data from literature for a reference case of a city zone of 1000 people to quantify inflows e g centre of an emerging small town in nepal these inflows could be adapted to reflect local specifications related to diet nutrient intake water volumes used for flushing or the number of inhabitants however the mean recovery ratio as well as the standard deviation would not change and therefore these results can also be reused directly in any other case transfer coefficients tcs and uncertainties a major strength of our approach is the quantitative integration of literature data in the form of tcs the data in the library are based on an extensive literature research complemented with expert knowledge it represented a compact and accessible overview of the currently available knowledge on the performance of diverse set of sanitation technologies and makes it available for almost any application dataset spuhler and roller 2020 confidence in knowledge about the performance of a specific technology is reflected in the defined variability ranges this approach has two main advantages first it allows to use a large body of knowledge second it enables the evaluation of the robustness of the final results based this can be illustrated with the transfer coefficients for phosphorus and nitrogen in the single pit based on our literature data we found a median p loss to soil of 71 and a variability range of almost 40 this high literature data variability is due to the uncertainty about the technology implementation e g how sealed is it the local context e g climate and most importantly the inflowing product dilution of the products considering not only the median but the variability range as well allows to safeguard this knowledge in the simulation the uncertainty reflects in the standard deviations of the resource recovery of the entire systems which in this case are almost as high as the recovery ratio itself this was shown for system 11 in a didactic example presented in spuhler et al 2020b nevertheless it is important to note that the coefficients presented here may not be fully representative of all possible conditions in the world especially for complex processes that can vary greatly depending on context additional to these generic data we also compared our results to those from similar studies to check the plausibility of the resource recovery results for instance we found a median nitrogen recovery of 76 in st6 dry onsite storage and treatment with urine diversion fig 6 this is very similar to the nitrogen recovery potentials of 82 for urine diverting composting latrine systems found in orner and mihelcic 2018 the maximum standard deviation of the recovery ratio is 28 which is comparable to the accuracy found by montangero and belevi 2008 this study used a material flow analysis to determine the phosphorus flows to surface water from sanitation systems in hanoi and found 1572 tonnes per year with a standard deviation of 608 tonnes due to the generic approach both the resource recovery potentials and the key influencing factors generalize well we see three possible use for the results in practice as an input into strategic sanitation planning either to pre screen for resource efficient systems or systems with low emissions during the pre planning phase for instance if sensitive urban water bodies require protection systems with high nitrogen or phosphorus water losses could be eliminated from the beginning or in the case of a demand for organic fertiliser systems with high nutrient recovery potentials could be preselected see also spuhler et al 2020b obviously the resource recovery and loss potentials are not the only performance indicator for sustainable sanitation but should be evaluated simultaneously with other important indicators such as hygiene economic and financial viability and technical institutional and socio cultural appropriateness e g bracken et al 2005 spuhler et al 2020a susana 2008 in spuhler et al 2018 we provide a method to evaluate the technical institutional and socio cultural appropriateness the key factors for resource recovery and the four recommendations for their optimisation could be used for the fine tuning of systems during the detailed planning and implementation phase for example the length of the system could be optimised with the combination of different recovery sinks the key factors and recommendations could also guide researchers or technology developers working on future innovations for instance the recommendations for resource recovery could be used to guide the development of containment and treatment technologies that minimise losses above these direct practical applications we also see a potential of the presented approach to be used by researchers or technology developer the potential recovery potentials of a novel technology could be pre evaluated by first generating valid system configurations and then quantifying potential recovery ratio this aspect is discussed on in spuhler et al 2020b 4 3 outlook the most obvious next step would be to make the results available to practice an interactive user interface could be developed with different use cases for instance one could submit a technology and its transfer coefficients and would get back possible system configurations and phosphorus recovery potentials translating the influencing factors into guidelines for future technology development is another way of dissemination as described in the relevance chapter attempts to summarize the results with easy to interpret decision guidance for option selection were not very successful as shown in the example decision tree shown in supplementary information si figure 15 in the supplementary information this hints to highly interlinked influence factors another exciting future activity includes the expansion of the technology library with additional products e g greywater stormwater or organic solid waste and technologies e g black solder flies vertical gardens etc this would allow to analyse the resulting systems and their recovery and loss potentials and to complete the set of recommendations provided here 4 4 limitations it is important to note that the models used to produce the presented data are based on a number of simplifications that include the very generic definitions of technologies and products consequently the substance transfer coefficients which are defined for each technology and product are also impacted by these simplifications therefore systems must be checked by an expert for plausibility when they are being seriously considered as planning options an example is the treatment of faeces alone in a biogas reactor it would not make much sense from an engineering perspective while it would make sense if sludge and e g organics are also digested in the same reactor another example concerns transfer coefficients soil loss in a single pit could be defined much more accurately if one would know whether the input product is moist excreta with pour flush water or dry pure faeces consequently the approach is suitable for strategic planning but not for detailed design and implementation of a specific sanitation system modelling substance flows based only on tcs is clearly a simplification as it excludes possible substance generation e g through biological fixation see also spuhler et al 2020b for most technologies this limitation is not relevant a more detailed approach would substantially increase computational demand and the collection of comparable parameters from literature would also be difficult another simplification is the assumption of fault free implementation operation and maintenance of the technologies importantly these simplifications allow the automation and generalization of the model application consequences of the simplifications are captured in the uncertainty calculations the user is free to be more specific in the technology and product definition e g make different types of single pits for different products or to use more complicated tc models if more accuracy is needed 5 conclusions and outlook nutrient water and total solids recovery potentials and losses to the environment are relevant indicators in evaluation of the sustainability of different sanitation options by analysing a large set of system options representative for almost the entire option space we could 1 quantify resource recovery and loss potentials that are generic and can be used to influence technology design or strategic planning and 2 identify characteristics of sanitation systems that provide information on potential resource recovery and losses and can be used to orientate future technology and system development the consideration of a large body of international literature data and expert knowledge to generate is the results is enabled through a novel approach to consider uncertainty factors influencing recovery are related to the interaction of different technologies in a system for instance even if a sink technology could potentially recover 99 of inflowing substances the recovery of the entire system will depend on the fraction of substances that actually arrives at this specific sink this means that resource recovery potentials have to be looked at on a system level and not at an individual technology level it also justifies such a modelling approach that allows to look at all possible configurations factors influencing resource recovery are source and sink technologies the length of the systems and the storage and treatment technologies and their level of containment moreover five key recommendations for the optimization of resource recovery from sanitation systems are developed i prioritize short systems that close the loop at the lowest possible level fewer treatment steps less losses ii separate waste streams as much as possible because this does not lead necessarily to fewer treatment steps but it allows for higher recovery potentials e g through urine diversion iii use storage and treatment technologies that contain the products as much as possible avoid leaching technologies e g single pits and technologies with high risk of volatilization e g drying beds iv design sinks to optimise recovery and avoid disposal sinks and v combine various reuse options for different side streams e g urine diversion systems that combine reuse of urine and production of biofuel from faeces the comparative analysis also showed that system templates are very efficient in describing technological diversity but not in providing indicators on resource recovery this leads to the question of whether the concept of system templates should be adapted in order to become more performance based and thereby more useful for the strategic planning process in line with sdg 6 the factors for resource recovery which we present here could be used to implement such a performance based characterisation for instance based on different types of recovery e g nutrients versus energy in order to make the generic resource recovery potentials available for practice an interactive interface could be developed that would allow browsing and extracting results for a specific system for instance one could submit a given system configuration and the number of inhabitants of its area to receive the specific resource recovery potentials or one could provide a number of technologies and explore which systems could be used and find their respective resource recovery potentials the same could be done to explore loss potentials as indicators for environmental pollution another straightforward extension of the approach would be to include additional substances e g potassium technologies e g future innovations or product streams e g solid waste or storm water future research activities could look at the potential quantification of performance indicators other than resource and loss potentials for instance the mass flows within a system could feed into technology specific costing functions as discussed in spuhler and germann 2019 this would allow the exploration of economies of scale author contributions d

17533,urine dilution is often performed to avoid clogging or scaling of pipes which occurs due to urine s ca2 and mg2 precipitating at the alkaline conditions created by ureolysis the large salinity gradient between urine and flushing water is theoretically a source of potential energy which is currently unexploited as such this work explored the use of a compact reverse electrodialysis red system to convert the chemical potential energy of urine dilution into electric energy urine composition and ureolysis state as well as solution pumping costs were all taken into account despite having almost double its electric conductivity real hydrolysed urine obtained net energy recoveries enet of 0 053 0 039 kwh m3 which is similar to energy recovered from real fresh urine the reduced performances of hydrolysed urine were linked to its higher organic fouling potential and possible volatilisation of nh3 due to its high ph however the higher than expected performance achieved by fresh urine is possibly due to the fast diffusion of uncharged urea to the freshwater side real urine was also tested as a novel electrolyte solution and its performance compared with a conventional k4fe cn 6 k3fe cn 6 couple while k4fe cn 6 k3fe cn 6 outperformed urine in terms of power densities and energy recoveries net chemical reactions seemed to have occurred in urine when used as an electrolyte solution leading to toc ammonia and urea removal of up to 13 6 and 4 4 respectively finally due to the migration of k nh4 and po4 3 the low concentration solution could be utilised for fertigation overall this process has the potential of providing off grid urine treatment or energy production at a household or building level image graphical abstract keywords human urine reverse electrodialysis nutrients recovery power generation oxidation 1 introduction the latest who unicef joint monitoring program for water supply sanitation and hygiene shows that more than 30 of the world population still does not have access to essential sanitation services who and unicef 2017 however in areas like urban slums centralised wastewater ww treatment is not practical as sewage pipelines cannot be laid as such on site sanitation is the only option one commonly proposed approach for improving decentralised sanitation is to treat human urine separately from the remaining ww this is because urine separation would reduce up to 81 of the nitrogen n and 50 of the phosphorus p in the remaining ww thereby making it easier to treat maurer et al 2006 putnam 1971a rose et al 2015 the reported concentration of nitrogenous compounds in typical urine can exceed 8000 mg n l while total phosphorus levels can add up to 500 mg l larsen et al 2016 2013 udert et al 2006 that is because urine contains over 6000 mgn l of urea which hydrolyses into nh3 during storage 300 mg l of uric acid 250 mg l of creatine and 1400 mg l creatinine putnam 1971b this makes urine almost as saline as seawater volpin et al 2019 as urine is generally mixed with flushing water which has an average total dissolved solids tds between 0 1 and 1 g l there is a large salinity gradient of mixing which could be converted into chemical potential energy while several articles looked at the energy recovery from the mixing of saline industrial wastewaters mainly using processes like pressure retarded osmosis pro and reverse electrodialysis red so far only a few articles looked into the recovery of urine s chemical potential energy han et al 2020 ma et al 2020 mehdizadeh et al 2020 for example in one case urine was used as a draw solution for forward osmosis fo to dewater a microalgae culture volpin et al 2019 there urine was used to draw water from the algae solution as its osmotic pressure was higher than the one of the algae solutions however this approach is only useful for dewatering applications to extract water and energy from urine mercer et al 2019 used a combination of membrane distillation md and red here urine is firstly concentrated urine md and the md concentrate is then used to power the red process in red cation and anion exchange membranes cems and aems were used to allow only for the transport of ions by separating the higher concentration hc urine solution from the lower concentration lc freshwater through alternated cems and aems membranes an ionic flux from hc to lc is created post et al 2007 veerman et al 2011 vermaas et al 2013 the ionic flux is then converted into an electrical current thanks to redox reactions occurring at the anode and cathode of the electrode compartment veerman et al 2010 however the hybrid red md process was designed only for scenarios where waste heat is available however if used as a stand alone process red is possibly more competitive compared to other salinity gradient driven energy recovery processes such as pro in the recovery of energy from urine that is because red here has the advantage of being able to operate at low flow rates of requiring lower capital investment given that no turbine or pressure exchangers are necessary and is easily scalable post et al 2007 yip and elimelech 2014 as reduced process complexity and cost is paramount if energy is to be recovered from urine at a household building level red seems to be the best candidate for this job that is why the goal of this work is to explore the use of stand alone red to recover energy from the dilution of real fresh and hydrolysed urine also for the first time real urine was used both as a high concentration solution and as an electrolyte solution this would reduce the costs of the process as no additional chemicals e g electrolytes would be required additionally the net chemical reactions occurring at the electrode compartment when urine is used as electrolyte solution could promote organics and nitrogen removal finally the transport of plant macronutrients n p k from urine to the freshwater was also investigated to understand if the low concentration solution could then be used as fertigation solution 2 methodology 2 1 experimental plan 2 1 1 process description two different process operation modes were adopted and compared while the first approach is expected to maximise the energy recovery i e system a the second does not need any additional chemical i e system b see fig 1 ø system a a mixture of k4fe cn 6 k3fe cn 6 and nacl was recirculated as electrolyte solution es ø system b urine was flowed in single pass as es both systems were tested with fresh and hydrolysed human urine as hc solutions that is because fresh and hydrolysed urine are chemically very different as when stored without any ph adjustment the urea in the fresh urine hydrolyses into ammonia and bicarbonate causing a significant increase in urine s ionic strength and ph randall et al 2016 ray et al 2018 volpin et al 2019 in this work we refer to the urine before ureolysis as fu and after as hu also each test was firstly run with synthetic urine solution table s1 and afterwards a real solution the model solutions were used to provide an upper boundary in the maximum energy extractable from human urine that is because synthetic urine resembles the ionic strength and composition of real urine without its complex and high fouling organic matrix all the experimental investigations were run were in triplicates 2 1 2 hc and lc solutions the collection and storage of urine were done as described in our previous work volpin et al 2019 before the feeding in the module hu was pre filtered using a 0 1 µm hollow fibre microfiltration module to remove the carbonates and phosphates salts that typically precipitate during urine hydrolysis this was done to prevent clogging of the red flow channels the average composition of fu and hu is displayed in table 1 before running the experiments with real urine synthetic fu and hu solutions were prepared see composition in table s1 and fed to the red stack volpin et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 the results from these tests were used to compare open circuit voltage ocv and gross power densities pdgross of synthetic and real urine as well as to analyse the transport of monovalent and multivalent anions and cations from the hc to the lc solution each stack was also tested with synthetic seawater 0 6 m nacl before and after the urine experiments to ensure similar stack baseline performances and measure any loss in performance after the urine tests all the standard tests were performed using 0 015 m nacl as lc solution however to have consistent results real freshwater table 1 was also examined with real fu and hu before the analysis of the fouled membrane this was done to see if any of the ca2 or mg2 in the freshwater would precipitate on the iems however the results might differ if harder water is used finally both the lc and hc solutions were fed to the red cell in single pass and counter current flow using peristaltic pumps longer bt100 2 j flow rates of 5 10 15 25 and 35 ml min were used and kept the same for both hc and lc solutions at all conditions according to eq 1 where acs is the channels cross section area as spacer thickness

assumption had to be made firstly the osmotic pressure of the solutions was approximated using the van t hoff equation π c νrtc where ν r and t are the van t hoff factor for strong electrolytes an activity coefficient of one was used for the calculations using an activity coefficient of one lin et al 2014 showed less than 10 error on the δg of ro brine river water mixing as urine is even more dilute than seawater it is expected that the error would be even lower finally a maximum hc lc mixing fraction of ϕ 50 was used for the calculations as both solutions were pumped at the same rate i e at equilibrium 50 of the solutes in the hc solution is moved to the lc solution once these assumptions were made the δgmax for synthetic fu and hu was calculated using eq 3 lin et al 2014 straub et al

mp aes 4100 agilent usa chloride was measured using chloride test kit kit 114 897 merck kgaa darmstadt germany also the urea ammonium megazime kit megazyme australia was used to measure the concentration of nh3 and urea this was done by measuring the nh3 concentration through a uv spectrophotometer uv 1700 shimadzu japan at 340 nm wavelength before and after inducing urea hydrolysis via the addition of urease enzyme finally toc was measured using a multi n c 2000 analytikjena sydney australia 2 3 2 mass balance calculations for nutrients recovery the transport of ions and urea from the hc to the lc solution was measured for each feed solution operating mode and linear velocities as both hc and lc solutions were pumped with the same flow rate and assuming a negligible water transport due to osmosis mass balance equations were used to calculate the recovery of each targeted species eq 7 7 c i r e c o v e r y 1 c i h c e f f m g l c i u r i n e m g l c i l c e f f m g l c i u r i n e m g l here ci hc eff and ci lc eff are the concentration of the targeted species i in hc and lc solutions after passing through the stack ci urine is the initial concentration of the species i in the urine if the difference between the mass balance in the hc and lc solution was less than 5 an average between the two values was taken hc and lc effluents were sampled after operating the stack for at least 15 min at the amperage that maximises pdgross during this period voltage and pressure losses were continuously measured to ensure that the system was operated in steady state conditions finally the difference in the total dissolved solids tds between the inlet urine and the hc and lc effluents was also measured to calculate the overall tds recovery using eq 7 2 3 3 toc nitrogen and chloride removal calculations only for scenario b i e urine as electrolyte solution the composition of urine before and after flowing through the electrolyte compartments was measured to assess the any change in the nh3 nh4 urea tn toc and cl concentrations the results were then discussed by comparing the mass balance of such compounds as ci removal 1 ci urine effluent mg l ci urine influent mg l with theoretical pathways of electrooxidation urine samples was taken only after reaching stable voltage readings no2 and no3 concentrations at the effluent were also measured as nh4 could be directly oxidised to those species tarpeh et al 2018 2 4 membrane characterisation pristine and used cems and aems were characterised by scanning electron microscopy coupled with electron dispersive x ray edx using a supra 55 vp instrument zeiss germany and by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy using the iraffinity 1 from shimadzu japan the iems were characterised before and after the tests with real fu and real hu before the characterisation a picture of the membranes was taken for visual analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance using reversible redox couple as es in this section the outcomes from the experiments that employed k3fe cn 6 k4fe cn 6 as es are discussed the change in pdnet enet and n p k recovery at increasing urine flow rate was investigated firstly baseline tests using synthetic seawater were conducted and the results shown in fig 2 a and figure s4 the goals of the section were ø to describe and discuss the differences in the outcomes using fresh and hydrolysed urine ø to provide an optimal stack operating condition to balance the trade off between power density and energy nutrients recovery 3 1 1 energy recovery and energy efficiency 3 1 1 1 synthetic vs real urine the results in fig 2 and figure s2 confirm the hypothesised drop in the performances when real urine is used precisely a 10 12 and a 90 drop in performances were measured with real and synthetic fu and hu respectively the two main explanation for the reduction in voltage and pd are 1 the effect of organic fouling on the aems and spacers which was also observed by rijnaarts et al 2019 and 2 the higher ohmic resistance in real hu caused by its lower ec compared to synthetic hu that is because the synthetic recipe used to simulate hu overestimated its ionic strength as it disregarded the nh3 losses due to volatilisation regarding the effect of organic fouling on the red performance rijnaarts et al 2019 found a 15 20 decrease in red performances after operating it with natural river water for over 12 days of that only 2 4 was due to an increase in aems resistance and decrease in its permeselectivity due to sorption of humic like substances the remaining was due to spacer fouling even though our experiments were run only for a maximum of 8 h the concentration of low molecular weight organic lmw and humic like substances in real urine is up to 50 times higher compared to river water jacquin et al 2018 as such aems performance drop is highly likely when using real urine this was also confirmed by the results from the membrane autopsy which is detailed in section 3 3 finally the performances of real fu and hu were benchmarked with the one of synthetic seawater a standard red benchmark while it is clear that urine achieved rather low pd compared to a 0 6 m nacl solution i e 60 70 less pdgross fig 2 also reveals that except for real hu its ocv was similar this could be ascribed to organic fouling changing the surface charge of the membranes moreover the i v curves for hu both synthetic and real display higher slopes than the seawater benchmark despite having similar or higher ionic conductivities this again leads to the hypothesis of organic fouling introducing additional resistance 3 1 1 2 real fu vs hu performances fig 3 shows that the performances of real hu are just 13 4 higher than fu even though hu has 50 higher salinity compared to fu i e 33 1 vs 17 1 ms cm and a much lower concentration of multivalent ions as almost half of the po4 3 and all the ca2 and mg2 precipitates during storage ureolysis of fu during the experiments was also excluded as the ph of fu in the influent and effluent was the same indicating no increase in alkalinity the explanation for this could be twofold the most plausible reason is that hu has higher fouling tendency compared to fu due to the bacterial aided transformation of the organics in urine during storage the hydrolysis fermentation that occurs during storage causes the transformation of the long chain organic acids creatinine amino acids and carbohydrates into acetate and other smaller molecules barbosa et al 2019 in fact fig 9 shows a significantly higher amount of coloured compounds deposited on the aems tested with real hu see section 3 3 for more details though fouling did not cause any steep increase in the urine channel s pressure drop which increased linearly at increasing flow velocity fig 3a additionally we here propose another mechanism that could have enhanced fu performances the hypothesis is that the high flux of urea from the hc to lc solution in fu could accelerate the ionic transport to the lc solution as urea molecules could have helped to push the ions through the iems in fact the uncharged nature high diffusivity coefficient i e 1 38 109 m2 s and high concentrations of urea in fu would mean that a significant amount would diffuse through the iems following a pure diffusion driven model ma et al 2018 this can be observed by looking at the high tn in the lc effluent when using fu fig 6b however at this stage this hypothesis still has to be experimentally validated overall at the tested flow rates real fu achieved ocv 1 6 3 3 v pdnet 0 32 0 75 w m 2 enet 0 006 0 039 kwh m 3 and overall energy efficiency η 5 22 assuming δgfu max 0 140 kwh m 3 as per eq 3 and table s1 for real hu ocv 1 53 2 75 v pdnet 0 40 0 70 w m 2 enet 0 018 0 053 kwh m 3 and η 7 20 were obtained δgsu max 0 262 kwh m 3 the only other available benchmark to these results is from a recent article from mercer et al 2019 their experimental conditions however were quite different firstly they operated in co current mode and used an 0 25 m nacl as the electrode rinse solution additionally the authors concentrated real hu twice i e from ec of 12 4 ms cm to 24 1 ms cm using md as md is a thermal process and hu has over 30 of its nitrogen in the form of volatile nh3 it is expected that some of the ammonia would be lost in the md permeate during the concentration process the combination of all the above could explain why the authors achieved lower performances i e ocv 0 79 0 9 v and pdgross 0 2 0 3 w m 2 finally given the trade off between power density and energy recovery this section aimed at suggesting an optimal operating range to achieve relatively high pdnet and enet overall the results showed that low flow velocities i e 2 5 7 5 cm s are recommended to obtain reasonable pd and enet values 3 1 2 ionic transport 3 1 2 3 synthetic urine the transport of the main species through the iems was firstly analysed at different linear velocities fig 4 shows a characterisation of the transport of different species when synthetic fu fig 4a and synthetic hu fig 4b were used synthetic solutions were used to eliminate the effect of membrane fouling as expected the transport rate of multivalent ions e g so4 2 po4 3 is 2 to 5 times lower than that of monovalent ions e g na k cl interestingly hu has higher cl and slightly lower na and k transport compared to fu this could be balanced by the more significant flow of nh4 ions in hu as they account for over 70 of all the cations in hu compared to only 10 in fu by focusing on the total nitrogen transport fu shows a lower decrease in the tn transport at increasing flow velocities this could be due to the high concentration of urea which is uncharged whose transport is regulated solely by the concentration difference in the hc lc channels as it follows solely the solution diffusion transport mechanism ma et al 2018 as such the flow rate would have an effect on the urea transport only when it increases the hydraulic retention time hrt enough to allow for a higher δcurea inside the stack 3 1 2 4 real urine fig 5 a shows that the relative ionic transport from the real urine to the lc solution the widening gap between fu and hu results at increasing flow velocities could also be the results of lower aems permeselectivity due to more severe fouling deposition in aems fouled with hu see section 3 3 these ec data however provide only a piece of information on the electrolyte transport while neglecting nh3 and urea as such fig 5 b shows the overall transport of tn po4 3 and k i e n p k n p k analyses were chosen as it is hypothesised that the lc effluent could be used as fertigation overall by operating at 5 61 cm s which has been identified as the velocity that maximises the stack s power densities in our experiments about 30 5 of nitrogen 5 2 1 for phosphorus and 31 4 for potassium were recovered in the lc solution 3 2 performance using urine as electrolyte solution in this section the outcomes from the experiments that employed urine as es are discussed the principal goal of this configuration was to compare the power densities achievable with urine as es and whether toc or tn removal can occur at the electrode chambers 3 2 1 energy recovery energy efficiency and ionic transport fig 6 and figure s5 show that despite only having a decrease in ocv of just 10 20 compared to synthetic urine the reduction in pdgross pdnet and enet in real urine was between 80 110 additionally a 10 50 decrease in ionic transport was also observed fig 7 a while the reduction of the ocv and ionic transport could be explained by urine s higher ohmic resistance compared to k3fe cn 6 k4fe cn 6 nacl the decrease in power and energy recovery was also due to the electromotive force and overpotentials of the oxidation and reduction reactions occurring at the ecs this is also confirmed by the reduction in nh4 urea and toc concentrations in fig 8 as the relative ionic transport decreases compared to system a the recovery of k and po4 3 from real urine was also found to be about 2 5 times lower interestingly though the reduction in tn was only 1 4 and 1 7 times in fu and hu respectively that is probably because the transport of uncharged urea and nh3 from the hc to the lc solution would not be affected by the increase in ohmic resistances as this is purely regulated by their concentration profile overall utilising urine as es drastically decreases the energy efficiency and nutrients recovery of the process as it increases the stacks resistance and the voltage losses due to net chemical reactions at the electrodes 3 2 2 change in the cl nh4 urea and toc in the electrolyte solution here urine s mass balance results before and after flowing through the ecs of the red stack are presented the stack was always operated at the current densities that maximise the power densities figure s5 the initial hypothesis was that the sharp reduction in the stack s performances was a result of net chemical reactions occurring at the ecs the open circuit voltages as shown in fig 6a are in most cases higher than the minimum voltage to achieve water splitting i e 1 229 v or anodic chloride formation coupled to cathodic hydrogen evolution i e 1 358 v however that does not necessarily mean that reactive oxygen species or free chlorine species were produced katsounaros et al 2012 tarpeh et al 2018 as activation overpotentials could have played a major role indeed fig 8 shows that the cl mass balance in the urine before and after the flowing through the anode and cathode is closed indicating no loss to chlorine gas if true this would be a positive result as zöllig et al 2015 demonstrated that the formation of cl2 gas in urine can lead to the formation of dangerous chlorination by products which if able to transfer to the lc solution might hamper its reuse for fertigation however given the high reactivity of free chlorine and significant mass transfer in the system cl is also unlikely to be present in its free state but rather in a reacted state which would not have been detected by our analysis fig 8 shows that nh4 removal ranged from 0 5 and it was the highest when using hu on the other hand up to 4 4 of the initial urea was removed i e 397 mg l of urea in fu in the case of ammonia if no free cl2 was produced indirect oxidation through monochloramine should not have occurred candido and gomes 2011 one other hypothesis is instead the direct ammonia oxidation through no2 no3 eq 12 candido and gomes 2011 tarpeh et al 2018 in fact platinum based electrodes like the one used in this study have often proven to be an effective electro catalyst for the oxidation of nh4 to no3 or n2 gas bunce and bejan 2011 8 n h 4 p k a 9 2 n h 3 n o n o 2 n o 3 n 2 o r n 2 o n 2 also it was found that the ammonia removal for hu was about 3 times higher compared to fu and no3 and no2 concentrations of 4 5 0 4 mg l and 0 1 0 04 mg l were measured in hu effluents but not in fu effluents that is probably because of the high concentration of nh3 in hu whose lone electron pair makes it easier to be oxidised compared to nh4 ion cheng et al 2005 while nh3 adsorbs onto the surface of the electrode before being oxidised to n2 at ph 7 no adsorption oxidation occurs and nh4 is directly decomposed to n2 as per reaction below eq 13 candido and gomes 2011 in the case of urea eq 14 was suggested as a possible degradation pathway ye et al 2018 9 2 n h 4 δ e θ 0 517 v n 2 8 h 8 e 10 c o n h 2 2 h 2 o δ e θ 0 34 v n 2 c o 2 3 h 2 finally toc removal of up to 13 was measured in hu at this stage though it is still unknown whether the mineralisation has occurred through direct electrochemical oxidation indirect oxidation due to water splitting and the formation of reactive oxygen species ros or a combination of both also the toc removal in hu is over 6 times higher than fu that might be because of the high concentration of lmw acids and neutrals mw 350 da in urine 62 16 of the toc which are generally more efficient in alkaline media as it occurs with lower overpotential jacquin et al 2018 munoz et al 2015 to conclude the mass balance of nh4 urea and toc showed that some degree of removal was achieved which would also explain the lower stack s performances when urine was used as es however the redox reactions occurring at the anode and cathode compartments are still quite speculative and should be investigated further additionally it should be noted that with the stack s scale up and optimisation higher voltages are expected which could lead to the formation of chlorine peroxides persulfate species this together with the effect of electrode material hrt and current density should be optimised to achieve a higher degree of nutrients removal 3 3 characterisation of used aems and cems the high concentration of lmw organic acids such as oxalic uric citric hippuric lactic and acetic acid putnam 1971b in urine makes it a solution with high fouling potential nam et al 2018 this is particularly true for hu as during storage anaerobic microorganisms can use the creatinine fatty acids and other organic acids in urine as an electron donor to grow and possibly release high fouling potential polymeric substances udert et al 2006 the results of the interaction between organics and the aems are evident when looking at fig 9 there the change in aems colour before and after testing the stack with real urine is quite evident especially for hu given the negative charge density of lmw acids it is expected that the positive fix charge in aems would allow them to migrate through and possibly accumulate on the membrane s surface rijnaarts et al 2019 this was confirmed both by analysing the toc transport to the lc effluent figure s3 and by analysis ftir analysis fig 9 ftir analysis in particular shows that in the aems after being in contact with fu and hu shows a new peak appears between 1040 and 1240 cm 1 wavelength this is generally attributed to the presence of co bonds due to ethers carboxylic acids and polysaccharides cho et al 1998 on the other hand there is no difference between the cems ftir analyses this suggests that only negatively charged low mw organics were able to pass through the non porous imes also the edx spectra for both cems and aems show no significant difference between pristine and fouled membrane indicating that phosphate scaling has not occurred during the short experimental period this was expected as no significant increase in pressure drop was observed during the experiments over time however the transport of po4 3 to the tap water side or the uphill transport of mg2 and ca2 to the urine could trigger carbonates and phosphates precipitation especially in the alkaline environment of hu 4 conclusions this study proved that red could effectively be used to convert the ionic gradient between urine and flushing water into potential energy the results showed that i a maximum enet of 0 053 0 039 kwh per m3 of real urine can be achieved when utilising homogenous redox couples as es while ii a toc ammonia and urea removal of up to 13 6 and 4 4 can be obtained when real fu and hu are used as es on the other hand in the experiments with k3fe cn 6 k4fe cn 6 relatively high ocv and power densities were achieved in fact η 5 22 and pdnet 0 3 0 7 w m 2 were obtained using real solutions interestingly though despite its higher ec hu performed similarly to fu the principal explanation for that was the higher aems fouling with real hu probably due to sorption of lmw acids and humic substances on the membrane surface this was also confirmed by visually observing the darker colour of aems after flowing hu though despite the sorption of organics on the aems no significant pressure drop was measured during the experiments overall an important outcome from this work is that organics and nitrogen removal can be achieved when urine is used as es and red driving force simultaneously this opens the possibility of designing a gravity driven and decentralised urine treatment unit to partially sanitise urine in situ before it is discharged in the combined sewage network declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

17533,urine dilution is often performed to avoid clogging or scaling of pipes which occurs due to urine s ca2 and mg2 precipitating at the alkaline conditions created by ureolysis the large salinity gradient between urine and flushing water is theoretically a source of potential energy which is currently unexploited as such this work explored the use of a compact reverse electrodialysis red system to convert the chemical potential energy of urine dilution into electric energy urine composition and ureolysis state as well as solution pumping costs were all taken into account despite having almost double its electric conductivity real hydrolysed urine obtained net energy recoveries enet of 0 053 0 039 kwh m3 which is similar to energy recovered from real fresh urine the reduced performances of hydrolysed urine were linked to its higher organic fouling potential and possible volatilisation of nh3 due to its high ph however the higher than expected performance achieved by fresh urine is possibly due to the fast diffusion of uncharged urea to the freshwater side real urine was also tested as a novel electrolyte solution and its performance compared with a conventional k4fe cn 6 k3fe cn 6 couple while k4fe cn 6 k3fe cn 6 outperformed urine in terms of power densities and energy recoveries net chemical reactions seemed to have occurred in urine when used as an electrolyte solution leading to toc ammonia and urea removal of up to 13 6 and 4 4 respectively finally due to the migration of k nh4 and po4 3 the low concentration solution could be utilised for fertigation overall this process has the potential of providing off grid urine treatment or energy production at a household or building level image graphical abstract keywords human urine reverse electrodialysis nutrients recovery power generation oxidation 1 introduction the latest who unicef joint monitoring program for water supply sanitation and hygiene shows that more than 30 of the world population still does not have access to essential sanitation services who and unicef 2017 however in areas like urban slums centralised wastewater ww treatment is not practical as sewage pipelines cannot be laid as such on site sanitation is the only option one commonly proposed approach for improving decentralised sanitation is to treat human urine separately from the remaining ww this is because urine separation would reduce up to 81 of the nitrogen n and 50 of the phosphorus p in the remaining ww thereby making it easier to treat maurer et al 2006 putnam 1971a rose et al 2015 the reported concentration of nitrogenous compounds in typical urine can exceed 8000 mg n l while total phosphorus levels can add up to 500 mg l larsen et al 2016 2013 udert et al 2006 that is because urine contains over 6000 mgn l of urea which hydrolyses into nh3 during storage 300 mg l of uric acid 250 mg l of creatine and 1400 mg l creatinine putnam 1971b this makes urine almost as saline as seawater volpin et al 2019 as urine is generally mixed with flushing water which has an average total dissolved solids tds between 0 1 and 1 g l there is a large salinity gradient of mixing which could be converted into chemical potential energy while several articles looked at the energy recovery from the mixing of saline industrial wastewaters mainly using processes like pressure retarded osmosis pro and reverse electrodialysis red so far only a few articles looked into the recovery of urine s chemical potential energy han et al 2020 ma et al 2020 mehdizadeh et al 2020 for example in one case urine was used as a draw solution for forward osmosis fo to dewater a microalgae culture volpin et al 2019 there urine was used to draw water from the algae solution as its osmotic pressure was higher than the one of the algae solutions however this approach is only useful for dewatering applications to extract water and energy from urine mercer et al 2019 used a combination of membrane distillation md and red here urine is firstly concentrated urine md and the md concentrate is then used to power the red process in red cation and anion exchange membranes cems and aems were used to allow only for the transport of ions by separating the higher concentration hc urine solution from the lower concentration lc freshwater through alternated cems and aems membranes an ionic flux from hc to lc is created post et al 2007 veerman et al 2011 vermaas et al 2013 the ionic flux is then converted into an electrical current thanks to redox reactions occurring at the anode and cathode of the electrode compartment veerman et al 2010 however the hybrid red md process was designed only for scenarios where waste heat is available however if used as a stand alone process red is possibly more competitive compared to other salinity gradient driven energy recovery processes such as pro in the recovery of energy from urine that is because red here has the advantage of being able to operate at low flow rates of requiring lower capital investment given that no turbine or pressure exchangers are necessary and is easily scalable post et al 2007 yip and elimelech 2014 as reduced process complexity and cost is paramount if energy is to be recovered from urine at a household building level red seems to be the best candidate for this job that is why the goal of this work is to explore the use of stand alone red to recover energy from the dilution of real fresh and hydrolysed urine also for the first time real urine was used both as a high concentration solution and as an electrolyte solution this would reduce the costs of the process as no additional chemicals e g electrolytes would be required additionally the net chemical reactions occurring at the electrode compartment when urine is used as electrolyte solution could promote organics and nitrogen removal finally the transport of plant macronutrients n p k from urine to the freshwater was also investigated to understand if the low concentration solution could then be used as fertigation solution 2 methodology 2 1 experimental plan 2 1 1 process description two different process operation modes were adopted and compared while the first approach is expected to maximise the energy recovery i e system a the second does not need any additional chemical i e system b see fig 1 ø system a a mixture of k4fe cn 6 k3fe cn 6 and nacl was recirculated as electrolyte solution es ø system b urine was flowed in single pass as es both systems were tested with fresh and hydrolysed human urine as hc solutions that is because fresh and hydrolysed urine are chemically very different as when stored without any ph adjustment the urea in the fresh urine hydrolyses into ammonia and bicarbonate causing a significant increase in urine s ionic strength and ph randall et al 2016 ray et al 2018 volpin et al 2019 in this work we refer to the urine before ureolysis as fu and after as hu also each test was firstly run with synthetic urine solution table s1 and afterwards a real solution the model solutions were used to provide an upper boundary in the maximum energy extractable from human urine that is because synthetic urine resembles the ionic strength and composition of real urine without its complex and high fouling organic matrix all the experimental investigations were run were in triplicates 2 1 2 hc and lc solutions the collection and storage of urine were done as described in our previous work volpin et al 2019 before the feeding in the module hu was pre filtered using a 0 1 µm hollow fibre microfiltration module to remove the carbonates and phosphates salts that typically precipitate during urine hydrolysis this was done to prevent clogging of the red flow channels the average composition of fu and hu is displayed in table 1 before running the experiments with real urine synthetic fu and hu solutions were prepared see composition in table s1 and fed to the red stack volpin et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 the results from these tests were used to compare open circuit voltage ocv and gross power densities pdgross of synthetic and real urine as well as to analyse the transport of monovalent and multivalent anions and cations from the hc to the lc solution each stack was also tested with synthetic seawater 0 6 m nacl before and after the urine experiments to ensure similar stack baseline performances and measure any loss in performance after the urine tests all the standard tests were performed using 0 015 m nacl as lc solution however to have consistent results real freshwater table 1 was also examined with real fu and hu before the analysis of the fouled membrane this was done to see if any of the ca2 or mg2 in the freshwater would precipitate on the iems however the results might differ if harder water is used finally both the lc and hc solutions were fed to the red cell in single pass and counter current flow using peristaltic pumps longer bt100 2 j flow rates of 5 10 15 25 and 35 ml min were used and kept the same for both hc and lc solutions at all conditions according to eq 1 where acs is the channels cross section area as spacer thickness

assumption had to be made firstly the osmotic pressure of the solutions was approximated using the van t hoff equation π c νrtc where ν r and t are the van t hoff factor for strong electrolytes an activity coefficient of one was used for the calculations using an activity coefficient of one lin et al 2014 showed less than 10 error on the δg of ro brine river water mixing as urine is even more dilute than seawater it is expected that the error would be even lower finally a maximum hc lc mixing fraction of ϕ 50 was used for the calculations as both solutions were pumped at the same rate i e at equilibrium 50 of the solutes in the hc solution is moved to the lc solution once these assumptions were made the δgmax for synthetic fu and hu was calculated using eq 3 lin et al 2014 straub et al

mp aes 4100 agilent usa chloride was measured using chloride test kit kit 114 897 merck kgaa darmstadt germany also the urea ammonium megazime kit megazyme australia was used to measure the concentration of nh3 and urea this was done by measuring the nh3 concentration through a uv spectrophotometer uv 1700 shimadzu japan at 340 nm wavelength before and after inducing urea hydrolysis via the addition of urease enzyme finally toc was measured using a multi n c 2000 analytikjena sydney australia 2 3 2 mass balance calculations for nutrients recovery the transport of ions and urea from the hc to the lc solution was measured for each feed solution operating mode and linear velocities as both hc and lc solutions were pumped with the same flow rate and assuming a negligible water transport due to osmosis mass balance equations were used to calculate the recovery of each targeted species eq 7 7 c i r e c o v e r y 1 c i h c e f f m g l c i u r i n e m g l c i l c e f f m g l c i u r i n e m g l here ci hc eff and ci lc eff are the concentration of the targeted species i in hc and lc solutions after passing through the stack ci urine is the initial concentration of the species i in the urine if the difference between the mass balance in the hc and lc solution was less than 5 an average between the two values was taken hc and lc effluents were sampled after operating the stack for at least 15 min at the amperage that maximises pdgross during this period voltage and pressure losses were continuously measured to ensure that the system was operated in steady state conditions finally the difference in the total dissolved solids tds between the inlet urine and the hc and lc effluents was also measured to calculate the overall tds recovery using eq 7 2 3 3 toc nitrogen and chloride removal calculations only for scenario b i e urine as electrolyte solution the composition of urine before and after flowing through the electrolyte compartments was measured to assess the any change in the nh3 nh4 urea tn toc and cl concentrations the results were then discussed by comparing the mass balance of such compounds as ci removal 1 ci urine effluent mg l ci urine influent mg l with theoretical pathways of electrooxidation urine samples was taken only after reaching stable voltage readings no2 and no3 concentrations at the effluent were also measured as nh4 could be directly oxidised to those species tarpeh et al 2018 2 4 membrane characterisation pristine and used cems and aems were characterised by scanning electron microscopy coupled with electron dispersive x ray edx using a supra 55 vp instrument zeiss germany and by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy using the iraffinity 1 from shimadzu japan the iems were characterised before and after the tests with real fu and real hu before the characterisation a picture of the membranes was taken for visual analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance using reversible redox couple as es in this section the outcomes from the experiments that employed k3fe cn 6 k4fe cn 6 as es are discussed the change in pdnet enet and n p k recovery at increasing urine flow rate was investigated firstly baseline tests using synthetic seawater were conducted and the results shown in fig 2 a and figure s4 the goals of the section were ø to describe and discuss the differences in the outcomes using fresh and hydrolysed urine ø to provide an optimal stack operating condition to balance the trade off between power density and energy nutrients recovery 3 1 1 energy recovery and energy efficiency 3 1 1 1 synthetic vs real urine the results in fig 2 and figure s2 confirm the hypothesised drop in the performances when real urine is used precisely a 10 12 and a 90 drop in performances were measured with real and synthetic fu and hu respectively the two main explanation for the reduction in voltage and pd are 1 the effect of organic fouling on the aems and spacers which was also observed by rijnaarts et al 2019 and 2 the higher ohmic resistance in real hu caused by its lower ec compared to synthetic hu that is because the synthetic recipe used to simulate hu overestimated its ionic strength as it disregarded the nh3 losses due to volatilisation regarding the effect of organic fouling on the red performance rijnaarts et al 2019 found a 15 20 decrease in red performances after operating it with natural river water for over 12 days of that only 2 4 was due to an increase in aems resistance and decrease in its permeselectivity due to sorption of humic like substances the remaining was due to spacer fouling even though our experiments were run only for a maximum of 8 h the concentration of low molecular weight organic lmw and humic like substances in real urine is up to 50 times higher compared to river water jacquin et al 2018 as such aems performance drop is highly likely when using real urine this was also confirmed by the results from the membrane autopsy which is detailed in section 3 3 finally the performances of real fu and hu were benchmarked with the one of synthetic seawater a standard red benchmark while it is clear that urine achieved rather low pd compared to a 0 6 m nacl solution i e 60 70 less pdgross fig 2 also reveals that except for real hu its ocv was similar this could be ascribed to organic fouling changing the surface charge of the membranes moreover the i v curves for hu both synthetic and real display higher slopes than the seawater benchmark despite having similar or higher ionic conductivities this again leads to the hypothesis of organic fouling introducing additional resistance 3 1 1 2 real fu vs hu performances fig 3 shows that the performances of real hu are just 13 4 higher than fu even though hu has 50 higher salinity compared to fu i e 33 1 vs 17 1 ms cm and a much lower concentration of multivalent ions as almost half of the po4 3 and all the ca2 and mg2 precipitates during storage ureolysis of fu during the experiments was also excluded as the ph of fu in the influent and effluent was the same indicating no increase in alkalinity the explanation for this could be twofold the most plausible reason is that hu has higher fouling tendency compared to fu due to the bacterial aided transformation of the organics in urine during storage the hydrolysis fermentation that occurs during storage causes the transformation of the long chain organic acids creatinine amino acids and carbohydrates into acetate and other smaller molecules barbosa et al 2019 in fact fig 9 shows a significantly higher amount of coloured compounds deposited on the aems tested with real hu see section 3 3 for more details though fouling did not cause any steep increase in the urine channel s pressure drop which increased linearly at increasing flow velocity fig 3a additionally we here propose another mechanism that could have enhanced fu performances the hypothesis is that the high flux of urea from the hc to lc solution in fu could accelerate the ionic transport to the lc solution as urea molecules could have helped to push the ions through the iems in fact the uncharged nature high diffusivity coefficient i e 1 38 109 m2 s and high concentrations of urea in fu would mean that a significant amount would diffuse through the iems following a pure diffusion driven model ma et al 2018 this can be observed by looking at the high tn in the lc effluent when using fu fig 6b however at this stage this hypothesis still has to be experimentally validated overall at the tested flow rates real fu achieved ocv 1 6 3 3 v pdnet 0 32 0 75 w m 2 enet 0 006 0 039 kwh m 3 and overall energy efficiency η 5 22 assuming δgfu max 0 140 kwh m 3 as per eq 3 and table s1 for real hu ocv 1 53 2 75 v pdnet 0 40 0 70 w m 2 enet 0 018 0 053 kwh m 3 and η 7 20 were obtained δgsu max 0 262 kwh m 3 the only other available benchmark to these results is from a recent article from mercer et al 2019 their experimental conditions however were quite different firstly they operated in co current mode and used an 0 25 m nacl as the electrode rinse solution additionally the authors concentrated real hu twice i e from ec of 12 4 ms cm to 24 1 ms cm using md as md is a thermal process and hu has over 30 of its nitrogen in the form of volatile nh3 it is expected that some of the ammonia would be lost in the md permeate during the concentration process the combination of all the above could explain why the authors achieved lower performances i e ocv 0 79 0 9 v and pdgross 0 2 0 3 w m 2 finally given the trade off between power density and energy recovery this section aimed at suggesting an optimal operating range to achieve relatively high pdnet and enet overall the results showed that low flow velocities i e 2 5 7 5 cm s are recommended to obtain reasonable pd and enet values 3 1 2 ionic transport 3 1 2 3 synthetic urine the transport of the main species through the iems was firstly analysed at different linear velocities fig 4 shows a characterisation of the transport of different species when synthetic fu fig 4a and synthetic hu fig 4b were used synthetic solutions were used to eliminate the effect of membrane fouling as expected the transport rate of multivalent ions e g so4 2 po4 3 is 2 to 5 times lower than that of monovalent ions e g na k cl interestingly hu has higher cl and slightly lower na and k transport compared to fu this could be balanced by the more significant flow of nh4 ions in hu as they account for over 70 of all the cations in hu compared to only 10 in fu by focusing on the total nitrogen transport fu shows a lower decrease in the tn transport at increasing flow velocities this could be due to the high concentration of urea which is uncharged whose transport is regulated solely by the concentration difference in the hc lc channels as it follows solely the solution diffusion transport mechanism ma et al 2018 as such the flow rate would have an effect on the urea transport only when it increases the hydraulic retention time hrt enough to allow for a higher δcurea inside the stack 3 1 2 4 real urine fig 5 a shows that the relative ionic transport from the real urine to the lc solution the widening gap between fu and hu results at increasing flow velocities could also be the results of lower aems permeselectivity due to more severe fouling deposition in aems fouled with hu see section 3 3 these ec data however provide only a piece of information on the electrolyte transport while neglecting nh3 and urea as such fig 5 b shows the overall transport of tn po4 3 and k i e n p k n p k analyses were chosen as it is hypothesised that the lc effluent could be used as fertigation overall by operating at 5 61 cm s which has been identified as the velocity that maximises the stack s power densities in our experiments about 30 5 of nitrogen 5 2 1 for phosphorus and 31 4 for potassium were recovered in the lc solution 3 2 performance using urine as electrolyte solution in this section the outcomes from the experiments that employed urine as es are discussed the principal goal of this configuration was to compare the power densities achievable with urine as es and whether toc or tn removal can occur at the electrode chambers 3 2 1 energy recovery energy efficiency and ionic transport fig 6 and figure s5 show that despite only having a decrease in ocv of just 10 20 compared to synthetic urine the reduction in pdgross pdnet and enet in real urine was between 80 110 additionally a 10 50 decrease in ionic transport was also observed fig 7 a while the reduction of the ocv and ionic transport could be explained by urine s higher ohmic resistance compared to k3fe cn 6 k4fe cn 6 nacl the decrease in power and energy recovery was also due to the electromotive force and overpotentials of the oxidation and reduction reactions occurring at the ecs this is also confirmed by the reduction in nh4 urea and toc concentrations in fig 8 as the relative ionic transport decreases compared to system a the recovery of k and po4 3 from real urine was also found to be about 2 5 times lower interestingly though the reduction in tn was only 1 4 and 1 7 times in fu and hu respectively that is probably because the transport of uncharged urea and nh3 from the hc to the lc solution would not be affected by the increase in ohmic resistances as this is purely regulated by their concentration profile overall utilising urine as es drastically decreases the energy efficiency and nutrients recovery of the process as it increases the stacks resistance and the voltage losses due to net chemical reactions at the electrodes 3 2 2 change in the cl nh4 urea and toc in the electrolyte solution here urine s mass balance results before and after flowing through the ecs of the red stack are presented the stack was always operated at the current densities that maximise the power densities figure s5 the initial hypothesis was that the sharp reduction in the stack s performances was a result of net chemical reactions occurring at the ecs the open circuit voltages as shown in fig 6a are in most cases higher than the minimum voltage to achieve water splitting i e 1 229 v or anodic chloride formation coupled to cathodic hydrogen evolution i e 1 358 v however that does not necessarily mean that reactive oxygen species or free chlorine species were produced katsounaros et al 2012 tarpeh et al 2018 as activation overpotentials could have played a major role indeed fig 8 shows that the cl mass balance in the urine before and after the flowing through the anode and cathode is closed indicating no loss to chlorine gas if true this would be a positive result as zöllig et al 2015 demonstrated that the formation of cl2 gas in urine can lead to the formation of dangerous chlorination by products which if able to transfer to the lc solution might hamper its reuse for fertigation however given the high reactivity of free chlorine and significant mass transfer in the system cl is also unlikely to be present in its free state but rather in a reacted state which would not have been detected by our analysis fig 8 shows that nh4 removal ranged from 0 5 and it was the highest when using hu on the other hand up to 4 4 of the initial urea was removed i e 397 mg l of urea in fu in the case of ammonia if no free cl2 was produced indirect oxidation through monochloramine should not have occurred candido and gomes 2011 one other hypothesis is instead the direct ammonia oxidation through no2 no3 eq 12 candido and gomes 2011 tarpeh et al 2018 in fact platinum based electrodes like the one used in this study have often proven to be an effective electro catalyst for the oxidation of nh4 to no3 or n2 gas bunce and bejan 2011 8 n h 4 p k a 9 2 n h 3 n o n o 2 n o 3 n 2 o r n 2 o n 2 also it was found that the ammonia removal for hu was about 3 times higher compared to fu and no3 and no2 concentrations of 4 5 0 4 mg l and 0 1 0 04 mg l were measured in hu effluents but not in fu effluents that is probably because of the high concentration of nh3 in hu whose lone electron pair makes it easier to be oxidised compared to nh4 ion cheng et al 2005 while nh3 adsorbs onto the surface of the electrode before being oxidised to n2 at ph 7 no adsorption oxidation occurs and nh4 is directly decomposed to n2 as per reaction below eq 13 candido and gomes 2011 in the case of urea eq 14 was suggested as a possible degradation pathway ye et al 2018 9 2 n h 4 δ e θ 0 517 v n 2 8 h 8 e 10 c o n h 2 2 h 2 o δ e θ 0 34 v n 2 c o 2 3 h 2 finally toc removal of up to 13 was measured in hu at this stage though it is still unknown whether the mineralisation has occurred through direct electrochemical oxidation indirect oxidation due to water splitting and the formation of reactive oxygen species ros or a combination of both also the toc removal in hu is over 6 times higher than fu that might be because of the high concentration of lmw acids and neutrals mw 350 da in urine 62 16 of the toc which are generally more efficient in alkaline media as it occurs with lower overpotential jacquin et al 2018 munoz et al 2015 to conclude the mass balance of nh4 urea and toc showed that some degree of removal was achieved which would also explain the lower stack s performances when urine was used as es however the redox reactions occurring at the anode and cathode compartments are still quite speculative and should be investigated further additionally it should be noted that with the stack s scale up and optimisation higher voltages are expected which could lead to the formation of chlorine peroxides persulfate species this together with the effect of electrode material hrt and current density should be optimised to achieve a higher degree of nutrients removal 3 3 characterisation of used aems and cems the high concentration of lmw organic acids such as oxalic uric citric hippuric lactic and acetic acid putnam 1971b in urine makes it a solution with high fouling potential nam et al 2018 this is particularly true for hu as during storage anaerobic microorganisms can use the creatinine fatty acids and other organic acids in urine as an electron donor to grow and possibly release high fouling potential polymeric substances udert et al 2006 the results of the interaction between organics and the aems are evident when looking at fig 9 there the change in aems colour before and after testing the stack with real urine is quite evident especially for hu given the negative charge density of lmw acids it is expected that the positive fix charge in aems would allow them to migrate through and possibly accumulate on the membrane s surface rijnaarts et al 2019 this was confirmed both by analysing the toc transport to the lc effluent figure s3 and by analysis ftir analysis fig 9 ftir analysis in particular shows that in the aems after being in contact with fu and hu shows a new peak appears between 1040 and 1240 cm 1 wavelength this is generally attributed to the presence of co bonds due to ethers carboxylic acids and polysaccharides cho et al 1998 on the other hand there is no difference between the cems ftir analyses this suggests that only negatively charged low mw organics were able to pass through the non porous imes also the edx spectra for both cems and aems show no significant difference between pristine and fouled membrane indicating that phosphate scaling has not occurred during the short experimental period this was expected as no significant increase in pressure drop was observed during the experiments over time however the transport of po4 3 to the tap water side or the uphill transport of mg2 and ca2 to the urine could trigger carbonates and phosphates precipitation especially in the alkaline environment of hu 4 conclusions this study proved that red could effectively be used to convert the ionic gradient between urine and flushing water into potential energy the results showed that i a maximum enet of 0 053 0 039 kwh per m3 of real urine can be achieved when utilising homogenous redox couples as es while ii a toc ammonia and urea removal of up to 13 6 and 4 4 can be obtained when real fu and hu are used as es on the other hand in the experiments with k3fe cn 6 k4fe cn 6 relatively high ocv and power densities were achieved in fact η 5 22 and pdnet 0 3 0 7 w m 2 were obtained using real solutions interestingly though despite its higher ec hu performed similarly to fu the principal explanation for that was the higher aems fouling with real hu probably due to sorption of lmw acids and humic substances on the membrane surface this was also confirmed by visually observing the darker colour of aems after flowing hu though despite the sorption of organics on the aems no significant pressure drop was measured during the experiments overall an important outcome from this work is that organics and nitrogen removal can be achieved when urine is used as es and red driving force simultaneously this opens the possibility of designing a gravity driven and decentralised urine treatment unit to partially sanitise urine in situ before it is discharged in the combined sewage network declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

17534,aim of this study was to investigate the impact of advanced wastewater treatment techniques combining ozonation with activated carbon filtration on acute and genotoxic activities of tertiary treated wastewater concentrated samples were tested in salmonella microsome assays furthermore induction of dna damage was measured in liver derived cells human hepatoma and primary rat hepatocytes in single cell gel electrophoresis experiments which are based on the measurement of dna migration in an electric field these cell types possess phase i and phase ii enzymes which catalyze the activation detoxification of mutagens acute toxicity was determined with the trypan blue exclusion technique we found no evidence for mutagenic effects of non ozonated samples in several bacterial tester strains ta98 ta100 yg7108 yg7104 yg7112 and yg7113 but clear induction of his mutants after o3 treatment in two strains with defective genes encoding for dna repair which are highly sensitive towards alkylating agents yg7108 and yg7104 these effects were reduced after activated carbon filtration furthermore we detected a slight increase of mutagenic activity in strain yg1024 with increased acetyltransferase activity which is sensitive towards aromatic amines and nitro compounds in untreated water which was not reduced by o3 treatment a completely different pattern of mutagenic activity was seen in liver derived cells non ozonated samples caused in both cell types pronounced dna damage which was reduced by ca 25 after ozonation activated carbon treatment did not cause a substantial further reduction of dna damage additional experiments with liver homogenate indicate that the compounds which cause the effects in the human cells are promutagens which require enzymatic activation none of the waters caused acute toxicity in the liver derived cells and in the bacterial indicators assuming that hepatic mammalian cells reflect the genotoxic properties of the waters in vertebrates including humans more adequately as genetically modified bacterial indicators we conclude that ozonation has beneficial effects in regard to the reduction of genotoxic properties of treated wastewaters graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words ozone genotoxicity salmonella hepg2 comet yg7108 1 introduction the discharge of conventionally treated wastewater leads to the emission of organic micropollutants to the aquatic ecosystems loos et al 2013 and may also affect drinking water quality in particular in regions where groundwater is replenished by river bank filtration maeng et al 2011 to improve micropollutant removal conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtp can be upgraded with oxidative and sorptive techniques one of the most widely used approaches is currently the treatment with ozone rizzo et al 2019 it was shown that ozonation reduces the concentrations of representatives of many groups of micropollutants by more than 80 bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 margot et al 2013 petala et al 2008 chemical analyses demonstrated that toxic compounds in wastewaters are degraded by ozonation lee and von gunten 2016 margot et al 2013 reungoat et al 2010 völker et al 2019 however a number of studies provided evidence that new biologically active compounds are formed as a consequence of oxidation reactions dna reactive products which have been identified are bromate hollender et al 2009 zimmermann et al 2011 nitrosamines hollender et al 2009 petala et al 2008 schmidt and brauch 2008 as well as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde chai et al 2018 the release of such genotoxic carcinogens in the environment may affect the stability of ecosystems and may cause adverse effects in humans if they consume water from ground water wells and if water specific toxic substance accumulates in the food chains for a number of genotoxins it is well known that they cause damage of germ cells and lead to trans generation effects which reduce the abundance and fertility of selected species in ecosystems hamlin and guillette jr 2010 medina et al 2007 it is well known that the overall toxic properties of ozonation by products can be reduced in general by subsequent sand or activated carbon filtration bourgin et al 2018 magdeburg et al 2012 magdeburg et al 2014 stalter et al 2010a stalter et al 2010b völker et al 2019 but it is still a matter of debate to which extent genotoxic effects decrease after o3 treatment which compounds are responsible for induction of dna damage which was detected in a number of studies if the effects are relevant for humans and which technologies are optimal aim of the present study was to elucidate if effects which were detected earlier in bacterial test system after ozonation of treated waters are also found in metabolically competent liver derived cells which reflect the situation in humans more adequately than indicator cells which do not possess drug metabolising enzymes we included also ozonated water samples which were filtered with activated carbon to find out if this step has an impact on their genotoxic activities before we realised the present study we performed a computer aided literature search in major data bases concerning the impact of ozonation on genotoxic properties of wastewaters in total salmonella mutagenicity assays were performed in 40 studies no positive results were detected in most investigations with standard tester strains ta100 ta98 and in umu tests which are based on the detection of induction of sos repair oda 2016 while mutagenic effects were found in a number of recent investigations with strain yg 7108 which has defective genes encoding for the repair of alkylated bases magdeburg et al 2014 punzi et al 2015 schindler wildhaber et al 2015 this derivative is highly sensitive towards alkylating agents yamada et al 1997 in total only 10 studies were published with mammalian cell lines mainly with cell types that do not possess drug metabolising enzymes cho cells lymphocytes liver derived cells were used only in two investigations itzel et al 2017 misik et al 2011 itzel et al 2017 used the human derived hepatoma line hepg2 but did not perform additional experiments with bacteria while we misik et al 2011 used in a previous study rat liver hepatocytes but did not perform experiments with salmonella strains that are sensitive towards alkylating agents and did also not include experiments with activated carbon filtration bacterial indicators as well as mammalian cell lines which were used in most earlier experiments do not possess enzymes which catalyse the activation and detoxification of genotoxic carcinogens therefore an exogenous activation homogenate the so called s9 mix is added which contains active phase i enzymes catalysing activation reactions leading to dna reactive intermediates phase ii enzymes which detoxify a broad variety of dna reactive molecules are not represented kirkland et al 2007 it is known that experiments with metabolically incompetent indicator cells lead to many false positive results kirkland et al 2007 which could be avoided by use of more reliable experimental models in this study we performed experiments with a panel of bacterial indicator strains including ta98 and ta100 several strain derivatives that are sensitive to alkylating agents yg7104 yg7108 yg7112 and yg7113 yamada et al 1997 as well as yg 1024 which is highly sensitive towards heterocyclic aromatic amines and nitroarenes watanabe et al 1993 these later agents were detected in earlier studies with wastewaters kataoka et al 2000 ohe et al 2004 all water samples were tested additionally in parallel with human hepatoma hepg2 and primary rat hepatocytes the hepatoma cells possess phase i and phase ii enzymes and were used in numerous earlier genotoxicity studies for review see knasmüller et al 2004 misik et al 2019b recent mutagenicity experiments with these cells indicated that the results are more reliable than experiments with bacterial and mammalian indicator cells that are commonly used in routine testing of chemicals i e a high sensitivity and specificity was found in calibration experiments fowler et al 2012 westerink et al 2011 the experiments were conducted for reasons of comparison with concentrated water samples which were also used in most previous investigations and in the present study in the experiments with the bacterial indicators primary rat hepatocytes were used less extensively but it is known that they have higher activities of drug metabolising enzymes than stable hepatoma lines misik et al 2019b we used them in the present experiments to investigate the effects of native unconcentrated water samples as it is known that all concentration procedures which are available lead to loss of compounds which may cause damage of the genetic material or acute toxicity abbas et al 2019 stahl 1991 all bacterial mutagenicity tests were conducted with and without arochlor induced rat liver s9 mix which was composed according to the standard recipe of maron and ames 1984 the experiments with liver derived cells hepg2 and rat hepatocytes were conducted in general without addition of s9 mix only in one series with non ozonated water enzyme liver homogenate was added to find out if phase i enzymes contribute to the mutagenic activities of these waters the bacterial tests which we performed are based on the detection of gene mutations leading to his auxotrophic revertants for details see maron and ames 1984 in the experiments with the liver derived cells we monitored dna damage with the single cell gel electrophoresis scge technique which is based on the quantification of dna migration in an electric field and detects single and double strand breaks and apurinic sites tice et al 2000 this method was developed in the 1990s and is increasingly used in genetic toxicology collins 2004 2015 koppen et al 2017 also acute toxicity measurements were included in the present study in experiments with salmonella strains bacteriostatic bactericidal effects lead to a reduction of the number of background colonies

prepared from the livers of aroclor 1254 induced male sprague dawley rats according to the standard recipe of maron and ames 1984 2 7 single cell gel electrophoresis scge tests and cytotoxicity experiments we used two liver cell lines namely a human derived hepatoma line hepg2 which came from the american type culture collection atcc manassas va usa and cryopreserved primary rat hepatocytes from male sprague dawley rats thermo fischer scientific dreieich germany hepg2 cells were grown in minimal essential medium eagle meme sigma aldrich steinheim germany supplemented with 1 0 mm sodium pyruvate and 10 fcs for thawing of the primary rat hepatocytes the tubes were placed in a water bath 37 c for 5 min the cell suspensions were immediately diluted 1 15 with williams medium e thermo fischer scientific dreieich germany and centrifuged for 5 min 50 g 8 c experiments with hepg2 were conducted with native un concentrated water samples which were used to prepare the cultivation media

conventional physicochemical parameters for both sampling dates are summarized in table 3 the effluent of the wastewater treatment plant cas out had low doc concentrations and low dissolved nitrogen levels the conventional treatment comprised nitrification followed by denitrification and chemical phosphorus precipitation advanced treatment lead to no significant decrease of the doc levels after ozonation and in the post reaction tank n while gac resulted in a decrease by 12 and 30 respectively the multibarrier advanced wastewater treatment plant lead to a clear decline of absorption of 254 nm by 42 and 53 which is indicative for an additional reduction after activated carbon filtration dissolved nutrient concentrations did not change substantially after advanced treatment in the cas out samples the levels of ammonium were very low consistently 0 2 mg l the ph during both sampling campaigns remained relatively stable between ph 7 6 to ph 7 8 bromate levels were monitored in the november campaign and the concentrations were consistently below the limit of quantification loq 5 µg l the concentration of the micropollutants are listed in table 4 with highly o3 reactive substances diclofenac carbamazepine trimethopin and sulfamethoxazole an abatement of 95 and below loq respectively was achieved by ozonation other micropollutants with moderate reactivity were removed between 24 and 89 the concentrations of most compounds decreased further after the filtration step the lowest efficiency of removal by the multibarrier system was observed with the artificial sweetener acesulfame k 3 2 results of experiments with bacteria bacteriocidal bacteriostatic effects can be detected in plate incorporation experiments by a decrease of the formation of revertants colonies in the negative control plates no indication for such effects was seen in the present study however clear mutagenic effects were observed and are described in the subsequent chapters 3 2 1 experiments with standard salmonella tester strains the first experimental series was conducted with native un concentrated water samples 100 500 µl filtered 0 2 µm corning germany raw water were added per plate clear negative results were obtained with the different strains ta98 ta100 and yg7108 in presence and absence of metabolic activation mix data not shown all subsequent experiments were carried out with concentrated dmso extracts the results of two representative experiments with strains ta98 and ta100 are summarized in table 5 no evidence for dose dependent mutagenic effects of the waters was found 3 2 2 experiments with derivatives of the standard strains when the waters were tested in strain yg7108 which is highly sensitive towards alkylating agents significant dose dependent induction of his revertants was observed see fig 2 the effects were most pronounced after ozonation and were clearly reduced after filtration with activated carbon gac n however the revertants numbers which were obtained in both series with effluents of the activated carbon filtration system were still higher than in those induced by non ozonated samples cas out addition of liver s9 homogenate resulted in all experiments in a pronounced decline of the revertants colonies with 67 µl dmso extract from ozonated water corresponding to 400 ml of the native sample 147 3 3 1 and 138 7 18 0 mutants were induced per plate with samples which were collected in october and november 2018 in absence of s9 the mutant numbers decreased in presence of liver homogenate by 51 and 34 respectively water extracts from the second campaign nov 2018 were tested in experiments with a panel of additional tester strains which have defective genes for repair functions required to eliminate alkylated bases the results are summarized in fig 3 a clear ozonation effect was detected in yg7104 which is isogenic to yg7108 but lacks the δada st deletion in contrast consistently negative results were obtained with yg7113 which has the same deletions as yg7108 but is a derivative of ta100 and with yg7112 which is isogenic but lacks a functional ogt gene for details see table 1 fig 4 shows the results of experiments with yg1024 this strain is a derivative of the frameshift tester strain ta98 and has increased oat activity we found moderate induction of his revertants before ozonation cas out in absence of s9 these effects increased only slightly after o3 treatment in contrast to the results obtained with the repair deficient strains after storage n and filtration gac n the mutagenic activities decreased 3 3 results of experiments with liver derived cells we used in the present study two different experimental models we conducted experiments with native un concentrated water samples with human derived hepatoma hepg2 cells and additionally performed assays with concentrated water extracts with primary rat liver cells it is known that acute toxic effects may lead to false positive results in scge experiments koppen et al 2017 therefore we monitored the vitality of the liver derived cells in all experimental series and no impact of the exposure to native or concentrated waters samples was detected see figs 5 a c 6 a c and 7 a 3 3 1 results with hepg2 cells the results of the first experimental series in which human derived cells hepg2 were exposed to media which had been prepared with native water samples for 3 h consistently yielded negative results data not shown to improve the sensitivity of the model we used in all subsequent experiments a longer treatment time 24 h it is known that extended exposure periods increase the sensitivity of liver derived cells towards certain classes of mutagens in particular to those which require metabolic activation misik et al 2019a natarajan and darroudi 1991 the reason is probably that these compounds cause an induction of phase i enzymes which catalyse their conversion dna reactive intermediates pezdirc et al 2013 the results of two independent experimental series are summarized in fig 5a d in both trials we did not find evidence for an impact of the waters on the viability of the cells fig 5a and c however we observed in the scge experiments a consistently pronounced induction of dna damage with the non ozonated samples cas out the effects were similar in both experimental series and decreased after ozonation the mutagenic activities of the water samples were further reduced after activated carbon filtration gac n however we detected in the second series with the highest water concentrations still more dna damage after the activated carbon filtration step than in the untreated control cultures most effects were clearly dose dependent 3 3 2 results with rat hepatocytes to confirm the results with an additional model experiments were conducted with primary rat hepatocytes which were treated with concentrated water extracts these extracts were also used in the bacterial tests the results are summarised in fig 6a d the findings are similar to those which were obtained with the hepg2 cells we found no evidence for reduction of the viability of the cells under the present experimental conditions but again pronounced induction of dna damage in both series with the non ozonated water samples cas out ozonation caused clear reduction of dna damage by 38 and 31 respectively a further decrease was detected after filtration in both series with granular activated carbon also in this model the extent of dna migration after the filtration step gac n was higher than that seen with the solvent control 3 3 3 results obtained with hepg2 cells after addition of s9 mix to elucidate which chemicals cause the effects of the effluent of the wwtp we conducted further experiments in which hepg2 cells were incubated with the cas out samples in presence and absence of rat liver homogenate s9 which contains phase i enzymes if these enzymes contribute to the mutagenic activity of the samples an increase of the effects can be expected the results are summarized in fig 7 clear induction of dna damage was seen when the cells were tested in absence of s9 addition of the enzyme homogenate caused a substantial increase of comet formation no such effects were seen with heat inactivated s9 mix indicating that compounds which require enzymatic activation account for the dna damage fig 8 summarises the main findings of the present study and shows the differential responses which were obtained with the pro and eukaryotic indicator cells results which were found with samples after short storage before filtration n are less relevant and were not included in the scheme 4 discussion the overall aim of this study was to compare the impact of ozone treatment on the acute toxic and genotoxic activities of the treated waste waters in pro and eukaryotic indicator cells and to elucidate the impact of activated carbon filtration 4 1 alteration of physic chemical parameters the ozone dose which we used is commonly applied for micropollutant abetment rizzo et al 2019 and did not lead to substantial alterations of conventional wastewaters parameters see table 3 this finding is in agreement with results of earlier studies bahr et al 2007 bourgin et al 2018 nöthe et al 2009 and the corresponding reaction rates of dissolved inorganic ions von sontag and von gunten 2012 the doc levels remained stable during ozonation as o3 treatment does not lead to mineralisation but causes chemical alterations of the effluent organic matter nöthe et al 2009 this explains the decrease of uv absorbance see table 3 in both campaigns the reduction of doc after gac filtration was in the expected range benstoem et al 2017 bourgin et al 2018 nitrite is an important factor for ozone treatment as it reacts fast with o3 von sontag and von gunten 2012 in the present study the concentrations which we found in treated wastewaters cas out were low 0 03 mg l as a consequence only low amounts of o3 were consumed by nitrite reactions bromate is a relevant adverse oxidation by product as it causes damage of the genetic material wu et al 2019 its formation was only monitored in the november campaign the molar ratio bromate bromide was 2 which is in the range of the values reported by soltermann et al 2016 notably the concentrations of bromate after o3 treatment 5 0 µg l did not exceed the levels defined for drinking water by who 2011 and it is unlikely that it accounted for the positive results which were detected in the genotoxicity experiments the removal capacity of organic trace compounds by ozonation can be grouped according to the substance specific reaction rates with ozone and hydroxyl radicals for details see lee et al 2013 the concentrations of highly reactive substances such as carbamazepine diclofenac trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole were strongly reduced after ozonation and were below the loq for moderately reacting compounds e g acesulfame benzotriazole bezafibrate and metoprolol the abatement by ozonation 24 81 varied in accordance to their reactivity for these groups of chemicals it is obvious that gac filtration is beneficial as it lead to reduction of the concentrations in the range between 27 and 96 taken together gac treatment caused a total reduction of approximately 50 of the overall decrease of micro pollutants which was achieved by the multibarrier system the results which we obtained are in agreement with the findings of earlier studies see for example rizzo et al 2019 and confirm the adequate functioning of the multibarrier system however the determination of individual physico chemical parameters and micropollutants does not enable to predict the biological consequences of treatment steps on acute and genotoxic properties of the waters which are described in the following chapters 4 2 results of experiments with bacterial indicators the results of the bacterial tests show that ozonation causes mutagenic effects in treated wastewaters in specific strains which are highly sensitive towards alkylating agents yg7108 and yg7104 but not in parental strains with normal repair capacity in all three experiments the mutagenic effects were reduced after addition of metabolic activation mix s9 in a derivative which increased n acetyltransferase activity yg1024 a moderate but significant increase of his revertants was found before ozonation these findings enable to draw conclusions which compounds account for the positive results and enable to assess the efficiency of removal of mutagens by activated carbon filtration as mentioned above no ozonation effects were seen in a number of earlier investigations with standard tester strains ta98 and ta100 while experiments with the deletion mutant yg7108 detected a clear increase of the mutagenic activities after ozonation giebner et al 2018 magdeburg et al 2014 mestankova et al 2014 ternes et al 2017 our results confirm these findings the mutagenic activities decreased in our study after addition of s9 indicating that directly acting compounds which do not require metabolic activation account for these effects fig 2 an identical result was also reported in an earlier study in germany magdeburg et al 2014 a typical example for such agents are alkylating cytostatic drugs which are present in wastewaters of hospitals isidori et al 2016 it is known that nitrosamines which are a relevant group of environmental genotoxic carcinogens gushgari and halden 2018 are formed during ozonation hollender et al 2009 schmidt and brauch 2008 these compounds require metabolic activation via liver enzymes he and feng 2015 therefore it is unlikely that they account for the positive findings recently it was shown by mestankova et al 2014 that ozonation of specific nitrosamines n nitrosopyrrolidine and n propylamine leads to formation of breakdown products which are directly mutagenic in yg7108 furthermore it is also notable that aldehydes and ketones are ozonation by products and it is well documented that formaldehyde and acetaldehyde which were detected in ozonated waters chai et al 2018 richardson et al 2007 cause alkylation of dna bases cheng et al 2008 espina et al 1988 taatjes et al 1997 as described in the results section fig 4 we detected mutagenic activity in the present study in strain yg1024 this strain is highly sensitive towards nitro compounds aromatic amines and heterocyclic aromatic amines which require activation by oat watanabe et al 1993 in the present experiments we found mutagenic activity with extracts of untreated non ozonated waters without metabolic activation s9 these effects were not altered after o3 treatment since nitro compounds do not require activation by cytochrome p450 enzymes contained in liver s 9 mix they may be responsible for the effects which we detected such compounds were repeatedly found in wastewaters and aquatic sediments chen and white 2004 kataoka et al 2000 our findings allow also to draw conclusions on the impact of carbon filtration on the mutagenic activities of the ozonated waters it is evident that the substances which account for the ozonation effects in yg7108 and yg7104 are partly eliminated by activated carbon however the mutagenic activities which we detected after the filtration step were still higher than those which were found before o3 treatment fig 8 also earlier findings indicated that carbon filtration reduces the mutagenic activity in a strain yg7108 which is sensitive to alkylating compounds magdeburg et al 2014 völker et al 2019 as mentioned above we detected also reduction of the mutagenic activities which were seen with native un treated wastewaters in strain yg1024 after filtration 4 3 results of experiments with liver derived cells the results of the bacterial mutagenicity experiments depended strongly on the genetic background of the indicator strains and it is questionable if the results obtained in these tests reflect the adverse health effects in humans as mentioned above most investigations with ozonated waters were conducted with bacteria only in two studies metabolically competent liver derived cells were used which reflect the metabolism of xenobiotics better than bacterial indicators and cell lines which lack xenobiotic drug metabolising enzymes knasmüller et al 2004 misik et al 2019b itzel et al 2017 used in a previous study hepg2 cells but did not conduct parallel experiments with bacterial strains misik et al 2011 used primary rat hepatocytes but did not study the effects of the waters in highly sensitive repair deficient strains which were included in the present study furthermore they did not investigate the impact of activated carbon filtration in the present study we used both experimental models in the first primary rat hepatocytes were exposed to concentrated dmso extracts of the waters which were also used in the bacterial experiments therefore the results of these experiments can be compared in the second experimental system human hepatoma cells hepg2 were exposed to unconcentrated water samples as it is known that biologically active compounds can be lost by concentration procedures stahl 1991 in both models we found an identical pattern of genotoxic activities of the different test waters which was in strong contrast to the results obtained with the bacterial indicators the most pronounced effects were consistently observed with non ozonated samples while ozonation lead to a decrease of the genotoxic activities activated carbon filtration did not cause a substantial further decrease of the dna damaging properties of the samples it is notable that the extent of genetic damage which was observed after the filtration step was in all experimental series with both cell types still higher than the background levels indicating that the water samples after ozonation and filtration still contained compounds which cause damage of the genetic material the differences between the results of the bacterial tests and the findings with the liver derived cells may be due to differences in the metabolic capacity of the indicator cells and also to differences in their repair activities as mentioned above liver homogenate s9 is added in experiments with bacterial indicators and metabolically incompetent cells this activation mix contains only active phase i enzymes but no active phase ii enzymes which catalyse mainly detoxification reactions glatt 2009 kirkland et al 2007 phase ii enzymes are also involved in the activation of specific genotoxins for example of certain halogenated water disinfection products which are found by chlorination of waters richardson et al 2007 both types of enzymes are present in the liver derived cells which we used in the present study the discrepancies of the effects seen with ozonated waters in the repair deficient salmonella strains yg7018 and yg7104 and in the liver cells can be explained by the high sensitivity of the bacteria towards alkylating agents for example compounds like ethylmethanesulfonate ems and methylmethanesulfonate mms can be detected with extremely low concentrations 50 µm in yg7018 and yg7104 yamada et al 1997 while substantially higher concentrations 50 µm mms and 100 µm ems are required to detect dna damage in hepg2 cells elje et al 2019 kim et al 2016 valentin severin et al 2003 it is also well documented that salmonella strains lead to an overestimation of the mutagenic properties of certain groups of mutagens which are found in water for example of disinfection by products derived from humic acids brunborg et al 1991 and nitroaromatic compounds silvers et al 1994 apart from differences in biotransformation and repair also other factors may account for the divergent results for example differences in the membrane permeability and in the organisation of the genetic material several systematic evaluations of the usefulness of the salmonella microsome assay and of genotoxicity experiments with liver derived cells for the detection of dna reactive carcinogens have been published the results show that the sensitivity and specificity of the bacterial tests is relatively low i e between 58 60 and 63 70 respectively kamber et al 2009 kirkland et al 2005 a substantially better predictive value was constantly found for scge and other genotoxicity experiments with human derived liver cells and primary hepatocytes in most calculations the sensitivity specificity was above 88 hong et al 2018 le hegarat et al 2010 seo et al 2019 wang et al 2007 for review see guo et al 2020 the present results show that part of the compounds which cause the genotoxic effects in the two types of liver derived cells are destroyed by ozonation but it is still unclear which chemicals are responsible for the damage of the genetic material since addition of s9 mix in experiments with hepg2 cells led to an increase of the genotoxic activities of non ozonated water samples fig 7 it is likely that the chemicals which cause the genotoxic effects are at least partly activated by phase i enzymes potential candidates which were found earlier in waters are aromatic amines which are breakdown products of azo dyes ohe et al 2004 and heterocyclic aromatic amines that are found in fried meats and feces and were detected in urban wastewaters kataoka et al 2000 5 conclusions this is the first study in which a broad panel of bacteria tester strains was used in combination with two different models with liver derived cells to study the impact of ozonation and activated carbon filtration on genotoxic and acute toxic properties of treated wastewaters an increase of the mutagenic activities of treated wastewaters was observed in selected bacterial indicator strains after ozonation which decreased after activated carbon filtration on the contrary we found a beneficial effect of ozonation in experiments with liver derived cells i e we detected pronounced genotoxic activity in the treated wastewaters which declined after ozone treatment bacterial tests are a useful tool for the detection of mutagenic properties of individual chemicals and complex mixtures in general but may lead to an overestimation of the activities of certain groups of chemicals the sensitivity specificity of experiments with liver derived cells for the detection of genotoxic carcinogens is higher as that of salmonella microsome assays therefore also future studies concerning the impact of advanced treatment procedures on the genotoxic properties of waters should include bacterial tests as well as experiments with liver derived cell lines declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17534,aim of this study was to investigate the impact of advanced wastewater treatment techniques combining ozonation with activated carbon filtration on acute and genotoxic activities of tertiary treated wastewater concentrated samples were tested in salmonella microsome assays furthermore induction of dna damage was measured in liver derived cells human hepatoma and primary rat hepatocytes in single cell gel electrophoresis experiments which are based on the measurement of dna migration in an electric field these cell types possess phase i and phase ii enzymes which catalyze the activation detoxification of mutagens acute toxicity was determined with the trypan blue exclusion technique we found no evidence for mutagenic effects of non ozonated samples in several bacterial tester strains ta98 ta100 yg7108 yg7104 yg7112 and yg7113 but clear induction of his mutants after o3 treatment in two strains with defective genes encoding for dna repair which are highly sensitive towards alkylating agents yg7108 and yg7104 these effects were reduced after activated carbon filtration furthermore we detected a slight increase of mutagenic activity in strain yg1024 with increased acetyltransferase activity which is sensitive towards aromatic amines and nitro compounds in untreated water which was not reduced by o3 treatment a completely different pattern of mutagenic activity was seen in liver derived cells non ozonated samples caused in both cell types pronounced dna damage which was reduced by ca 25 after ozonation activated carbon treatment did not cause a substantial further reduction of dna damage additional experiments with liver homogenate indicate that the compounds which cause the effects in the human cells are promutagens which require enzymatic activation none of the waters caused acute toxicity in the liver derived cells and in the bacterial indicators assuming that hepatic mammalian cells reflect the genotoxic properties of the waters in vertebrates including humans more adequately as genetically modified bacterial indicators we conclude that ozonation has beneficial effects in regard to the reduction of genotoxic properties of treated wastewaters graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words ozone genotoxicity salmonella hepg2 comet yg7108 1 introduction the discharge of conventionally treated wastewater leads to the emission of organic micropollutants to the aquatic ecosystems loos et al 2013 and may also affect drinking water quality in particular in regions where groundwater is replenished by river bank filtration maeng et al 2011 to improve micropollutant removal conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtp can be upgraded with oxidative and sorptive techniques one of the most widely used approaches is currently the treatment with ozone rizzo et al 2019 it was shown that ozonation reduces the concentrations of representatives of many groups of micropollutants by more than 80 bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 margot et al 2013 petala et al 2008 chemical analyses demonstrated that toxic compounds in wastewaters are degraded by ozonation lee and von gunten 2016 margot et al 2013 reungoat et al 2010 völker et al 2019 however a number of studies provided evidence that new biologically active compounds are formed as a consequence of oxidation reactions dna reactive products which have been identified are bromate hollender et al 2009 zimmermann et al 2011 nitrosamines hollender et al 2009 petala et al 2008 schmidt and brauch 2008 as well as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde chai et al 2018 the release of such genotoxic carcinogens in the environment may affect the stability of ecosystems and may cause adverse effects in humans if they consume water from ground water wells and if water specific toxic substance accumulates in the food chains for a number of genotoxins it is well known that they cause damage of germ cells and lead to trans generation effects which reduce the abundance and fertility of selected species in ecosystems hamlin and guillette jr 2010 medina et al 2007 it is well known that the overall toxic properties of ozonation by products can be reduced in general by subsequent sand or activated carbon filtration bourgin et al 2018 magdeburg et al 2012 magdeburg et al 2014 stalter et al 2010a stalter et al 2010b völker et al 2019 but it is still a matter of debate to which extent genotoxic effects decrease after o3 treatment which compounds are responsible for induction of dna damage which was detected in a number of studies if the effects are relevant for humans and which technologies are optimal aim of the present study was to elucidate if effects which were detected earlier in bacterial test system after ozonation of treated waters are also found in metabolically competent liver derived cells which reflect the situation in humans more adequately than indicator cells which do not possess drug metabolising enzymes we included also ozonated water samples which were filtered with activated carbon to find out if this step has an impact on their genotoxic activities before we realised the present study we performed a computer aided literature search in major data bases concerning the impact of ozonation on genotoxic properties of wastewaters in total salmonella mutagenicity assays were performed in 40 studies no positive results were detected in most investigations with standard tester strains ta100 ta98 and in umu tests which are based on the detection of induction of sos repair oda 2016 while mutagenic effects were found in a number of recent investigations with strain yg 7108 which has defective genes encoding for the repair of alkylated bases magdeburg et al 2014 punzi et al 2015 schindler wildhaber et al 2015 this derivative is highly sensitive towards alkylating agents yamada et al 1997 in total only 10 studies were published with mammalian cell lines mainly with cell types that do not possess drug metabolising enzymes cho cells lymphocytes liver derived cells were used only in two investigations itzel et al 2017 misik et al 2011 itzel et al 2017 used the human derived hepatoma line hepg2 but did not perform additional experiments with bacteria while we misik et al 2011 used in a previous study rat liver hepatocytes but did not perform experiments with salmonella strains that are sensitive towards alkylating agents and did also not include experiments with activated carbon filtration bacterial indicators as well as mammalian cell lines which were used in most earlier experiments do not possess enzymes which catalyse the activation and detoxification of genotoxic carcinogens therefore an exogenous activation homogenate the so called s9 mix is added which contains active phase i enzymes catalysing activation reactions leading to dna reactive intermediates phase ii enzymes which detoxify a broad variety of dna reactive molecules are not represented kirkland et al 2007 it is known that experiments with metabolically incompetent indicator cells lead to many false positive results kirkland et al 2007 which could be avoided by use of more reliable experimental models in this study we performed experiments with a panel of bacterial indicator strains including ta98 and ta100 several strain derivatives that are sensitive to alkylating agents yg7104 yg7108 yg7112 and yg7113 yamada et al 1997 as well as yg 1024 which is highly sensitive towards heterocyclic aromatic amines and nitroarenes watanabe et al 1993 these later agents were detected in earlier studies with wastewaters kataoka et al 2000 ohe et al 2004 all water samples were tested additionally in parallel with human hepatoma hepg2 and primary rat hepatocytes the hepatoma cells possess phase i and phase ii enzymes and were used in numerous earlier genotoxicity studies for review see knasmüller et al 2004 misik et al 2019b recent mutagenicity experiments with these cells indicated that the results are more reliable than experiments with bacterial and mammalian indicator cells that are commonly used in routine testing of chemicals i e a high sensitivity and specificity was found in calibration experiments fowler et al 2012 westerink et al 2011 the experiments were conducted for reasons of comparison with concentrated water samples which were also used in most previous investigations and in the present study in the experiments with the bacterial indicators primary rat hepatocytes were used less extensively but it is known that they have higher activities of drug metabolising enzymes than stable hepatoma lines misik et al 2019b we used them in the present experiments to investigate the effects of native unconcentrated water samples as it is known that all concentration procedures which are available lead to loss of compounds which may cause damage of the genetic material or acute toxicity abbas et al 2019 stahl 1991 all bacterial mutagenicity tests were conducted with and without arochlor induced rat liver s9 mix which was composed according to the standard recipe of maron and ames 1984 the experiments with liver derived cells hepg2 and rat hepatocytes were conducted in general without addition of s9 mix only in one series with non ozonated water enzyme liver homogenate was added to find out if phase i enzymes contribute to the mutagenic activities of these waters the bacterial tests which we performed are based on the detection of gene mutations leading to his auxotrophic revertants for details see maron and ames 1984 in the experiments with the liver derived cells we monitored dna damage with the single cell gel electrophoresis scge technique which is based on the quantification of dna migration in an electric field and detects single and double strand breaks and apurinic sites tice et al 2000 this method was developed in the 1990s and is increasingly used in genetic toxicology collins 2004 2015 koppen et al 2017 also acute toxicity measurements were included in the present study in experiments with salmonella strains bacteriostatic bactericidal effects lead to a reduction of the number of background colonies

prepared from the livers of aroclor 1254 induced male sprague dawley rats according to the standard recipe of maron and ames 1984 2 7 single cell gel electrophoresis scge tests and cytotoxicity experiments we used two liver cell lines namely a human derived hepatoma line hepg2 which came from the american type culture collection atcc manassas va usa and cryopreserved primary rat hepatocytes from male sprague dawley rats thermo fischer scientific dreieich germany hepg2 cells were grown in minimal essential medium eagle meme sigma aldrich steinheim germany supplemented with 1 0 mm sodium pyruvate and 10 fcs for thawing of the primary rat hepatocytes the tubes were placed in a water bath 37 c for 5 min the cell suspensions were immediately diluted 1 15 with williams medium e thermo

square root transformation was used p 0 05 statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism 5 0 graphpad software san diego ca 3 results 3 1 measurement of physico chemical parameters conventional physicochemical parameters for both sampling dates are summarized in table 3 the effluent of the wastewater treatment plant cas out had low doc concentrations and low dissolved nitrogen levels the conventional treatment comprised nitrification followed by denitrification and chemical phosphorus precipitation advanced treatment lead to no significant decrease of the doc levels after ozonation and in the post reaction tank n while gac resulted in a decrease by 12 and 30 respectively the multibarrier advanced wastewater treatment plant lead to a clear decline of absorption of 254 nm by 42 and 53 which is indicative for an additional reduction after activated carbon filtration dissolved nutrient concentrations did not change substantially after advanced treatment in the cas out samples the levels of ammonium were very low consistently 0 2 mg l the ph during both sampling campaigns remained relatively stable between ph 7 6 to ph 7 8 bromate levels were monitored in the november campaign and the concentrations were consistently below the limit of quantification loq 5 µg l the concentration of the micropollutants are listed in table 4 with highly o3 reactive substances diclofenac carbamazepine trimethopin and sulfamethoxazole an abatement of 95 and below loq respectively was achieved by ozonation other micropollutants with moderate reactivity were removed between 24 and 89 the concentrations of most compounds decreased further after the filtration step the lowest efficiency of removal by the multibarrier system was observed with the artificial sweetener acesulfame k 3 2 results of experiments with bacteria bacteriocidal bacteriostatic effects can be detected in plate incorporation experiments by a decrease of the formation of revertants colonies in the negative control plates no indication for such effects was seen in the present study however clear mutagenic effects were observed and are described in the subsequent chapters 3 2 1 experiments with standard salmonella tester strains the first experimental series was conducted with native un concentrated water samples 100 500 µl filtered 0 2 µm corning germany raw water were added per plate clear negative results were obtained with the different strains ta98 ta100 and yg7108 in presence and absence of metabolic activation mix data not shown all subsequent experiments were carried out with concentrated dmso extracts the results of two representative experiments with strains ta98 and ta100 are summarized in table 5 no evidence for dose dependent mutagenic effects of the waters was found 3 2 2 experiments with derivatives of the standard strains when the waters were tested in strain yg7108 which is highly sensitive towards alkylating agents significant dose dependent induction of his revertants was observed see fig 2 the effects were most pronounced after ozonation and were clearly reduced after filtration with activated carbon gac n however the revertants numbers which were obtained in both series with effluents of the activated carbon filtration system were still higher than in those induced by non ozonated samples cas out addition of liver s9 homogenate resulted in all experiments in a pronounced decline of the revertants colonies with 67 µl dmso extract from ozonated water corresponding to 400 ml of the native sample 147 3 3 1 and 138 7 18 0 mutants were induced per plate with samples which were collected in october and november 2018 in absence of s9 the mutant numbers decreased in presence of liver homogenate by 51 and 34 respectively water extracts from the second campaign nov 2018 were tested in experiments with a panel of additional tester strains which have defective genes for repair functions required to eliminate alkylated bases the results are summarized in fig 3 a clear ozonation effect was detected in yg7104 which is isogenic to yg7108 but lacks the δada st deletion in contrast consistently negative results were obtained with yg7113 which has the same deletions as yg7108 but is a derivative of ta100 and with yg7112 which is isogenic but lacks a functional ogt gene for details see table 1 fig 4 shows the results of experiments with yg1024 this strain is a derivative of the frameshift tester strain ta98 and has increased oat activity we found moderate induction of his revertants before ozonation cas out in absence of s9 these effects increased only slightly after o3 treatment in contrast to the results obtained with the repair deficient strains after storage n and filtration gac n the mutagenic activities decreased 3 3 results of experiments with liver derived cells we used in the present study two different experimental models we conducted experiments with native un concentrated water samples with human derived hepatoma hepg2 cells and additionally performed assays with concentrated water extracts with primary rat liver cells it is known that acute toxic effects may lead to false positive results in scge experiments koppen et al 2017 therefore we monitored the vitality of the liver derived cells in all experimental series and no impact of the exposure to native or concentrated waters samples was detected see figs 5 a c 6 a c and 7 a 3 3 1 results with hepg2 cells the results of the first experimental series in which human derived cells hepg2 were exposed to media which had been prepared with native water samples for 3 h consistently yielded negative results data not shown to improve the sensitivity of the model we used in all subsequent experiments a longer treatment time 24 h it is known that extended exposure periods increase the sensitivity of liver derived cells towards certain classes of mutagens in particular to those which require metabolic activation misik et al 2019a natarajan and darroudi 1991 the reason is probably that these compounds cause an induction of phase i enzymes which catalyse their conversion dna reactive intermediates pezdirc et al 2013 the results of two independent experimental series are summarized in fig 5a d in both trials we did not find evidence for an impact of the waters on the viability of the cells fig 5a and c however we observed in the scge experiments a consistently pronounced induction of dna damage with the non ozonated samples cas out the effects were similar in both experimental series and decreased after ozonation the mutagenic activities of the water samples were further reduced after activated carbon filtration gac n however we detected in the second series with the highest water concentrations still more dna damage after the activated carbon filtration step than in the untreated control cultures most effects were clearly dose dependent 3 3 2 results with rat hepatocytes to confirm the results with an additional model experiments were conducted with primary rat hepatocytes which were treated with concentrated water extracts these extracts were also used in the bacterial tests the results are summarised in fig 6a d the findings are similar to those which were obtained with the hepg2 cells we found no evidence for reduction of the viability of the cells under the present experimental conditions but again pronounced induction of dna damage in both series with the non ozonated water samples cas out ozonation caused clear reduction of dna damage by 38 and 31 respectively a further decrease was detected after filtration in both series with granular activated carbon also in this model the extent of dna migration after the filtration step gac n was higher than that seen with the solvent control 3 3 3 results obtained with hepg2 cells after addition of s9 mix to elucidate which chemicals cause the effects of the effluent of the wwtp we conducted further experiments in which hepg2 cells were incubated with the cas out samples in presence and absence of rat liver homogenate s9 which contains phase i enzymes if these enzymes contribute to the mutagenic activity of the samples an increase of the effects can be expected the results are summarized in fig 7 clear induction of dna damage was seen when the cells were tested in absence of s9 addition of the enzyme homogenate caused a substantial increase of comet formation no such effects were seen with heat inactivated s9 mix indicating that compounds which require enzymatic activation account for the dna damage fig 8 summarises the main findings of the present study and shows the differential responses which were obtained with the pro and eukaryotic indicator cells results which were found with samples after short storage before filtration n are less relevant and were not included in the scheme 4 discussion the overall aim of this study was to compare the impact of ozone treatment on the acute toxic and genotoxic activities of the treated waste waters in pro and eukaryotic indicator cells and to elucidate the impact of activated carbon filtration 4 1 alteration of physic chemical parameters the ozone dose which we used is commonly applied for micropollutant abetment rizzo et al 2019 and did not lead to substantial alterations of conventional wastewaters parameters see table 3 this finding is in agreement with results of earlier studies bahr et al 2007 bourgin et al 2018 nöthe et al 2009 and the corresponding reaction rates of dissolved inorganic ions von sontag and von gunten 2012 the doc levels remained stable during ozonation as o3 treatment does not lead to mineralisation but causes chemical alterations of the effluent organic matter nöthe et al 2009 this explains the decrease of uv absorbance see table 3 in both campaigns the reduction of doc after gac filtration was in the expected range benstoem et al 2017 bourgin et al 2018 nitrite is an important factor for ozone treatment as it reacts fast with o3 von sontag and von gunten 2012 in the present study the concentrations which we found in treated wastewaters cas out were low 0 03 mg l as a consequence only low amounts of o3 were consumed by nitrite reactions bromate is a relevant adverse oxidation by product as it causes damage of the genetic material wu et al 2019 its formation was only monitored in the november campaign the molar ratio bromate bromide was 2 which is in the range of the values reported by soltermann et al 2016 notably the concentrations of bromate after o3 treatment 5 0 µg l did not exceed the levels defined for drinking water by who 2011 and it is unlikely that it accounted for the positive results which were detected in the genotoxicity experiments the removal capacity of organic trace compounds by ozonation can be grouped according to the substance specific reaction rates with ozone and hydroxyl radicals for details see lee et al 2013 the concentrations of highly reactive substances such as carbamazepine diclofenac trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole were strongly reduced after ozonation and were below the loq for moderately reacting compounds e g acesulfame benzotriazole bezafibrate and metoprolol the abatement by ozonation 24 81 varied in accordance to their reactivity for these groups of chemicals it is obvious that gac filtration is beneficial as it lead to reduction of the concentrations in the range between 27 and 96 taken together gac treatment caused a total reduction of approximately 50 of the overall decrease of micro pollutants which was achieved by the multibarrier system the results which we obtained are in agreement with the findings of earlier studies see for example rizzo et al 2019 and confirm the adequate functioning of the multibarrier system however the determination of individual physico chemical parameters and micropollutants does not enable to predict the biological consequences of treatment steps on acute and genotoxic properties of the waters which are described in the following chapters 4 2 results of experiments with bacterial indicators the results of the bacterial tests show that ozonation causes mutagenic effects in treated wastewaters in specific strains which are highly sensitive towards alkylating agents yg7108 and yg7104 but not in parental strains with normal repair capacity in all three experiments the mutagenic effects were reduced after addition of metabolic activation mix s9 in a derivative which increased n acetyltransferase activity yg1024 a moderate but significant increase of his revertants was found before ozonation these findings enable to draw conclusions which compounds account for the positive results and enable to assess the efficiency of removal of mutagens by activated carbon filtration as mentioned above no ozonation effects were seen in a number of earlier investigations with standard tester strains ta98 and ta100 while experiments with the deletion mutant yg7108 detected a clear increase of the mutagenic activities after ozonation giebner et al 2018 magdeburg et al 2014 mestankova et al 2014 ternes et al 2017 our results confirm these findings the mutagenic activities decreased in our study after addition of s9 indicating that directly acting compounds which do not require metabolic activation account for these effects fig 2 an identical result was also reported in an earlier study in germany magdeburg et al 2014 a typical example for such agents are alkylating cytostatic drugs which are present in wastewaters of hospitals isidori et al 2016 it is known that nitrosamines which are a relevant group of environmental genotoxic carcinogens gushgari and halden 2018 are formed during ozonation hollender et al 2009 schmidt and brauch 2008 these compounds require metabolic activation via liver enzymes he and feng 2015 therefore it is unlikely that they account for the positive findings recently it was shown by mestankova et al 2014 that ozonation of specific nitrosamines n nitrosopyrrolidine and n propylamine leads to formation of breakdown products which are directly mutagenic in yg7108 furthermore it is also notable that aldehydes and ketones are ozonation by products and it is well documented that formaldehyde and acetaldehyde which were detected in ozonated waters chai et al 2018 richardson et al 2007 cause alkylation of dna bases cheng et al 2008 espina et al 1988 taatjes et al 1997 as described in the results section fig 4 we detected mutagenic activity in the present study in strain yg1024 this strain is highly sensitive towards nitro compounds aromatic amines and heterocyclic aromatic amines which require activation by oat watanabe et al 1993 in the present experiments we found mutagenic activity with extracts of untreated non ozonated waters without metabolic activation s9 these effects were not altered after o3 treatment since nitro compounds do not require activation by cytochrome p450 enzymes contained in liver s 9 mix they may be responsible for the effects which we detected such compounds were repeatedly found in wastewaters and aquatic sediments chen and white 2004 kataoka et al 2000 our findings allow also to draw conclusions on the impact of carbon filtration on the mutagenic activities of the ozonated waters it is evident that the substances which account for the ozonation effects in yg7108 and yg7104 are partly eliminated by activated carbon however the mutagenic activities which we detected after the filtration step were still higher than those which were found before o3 treatment fig 8 also earlier findings indicated that carbon filtration reduces the mutagenic activity in a strain yg7108 which is sensitive to alkylating compounds magdeburg et al 2014 völker et al 2019 as mentioned above we detected also reduction of the mutagenic activities which were seen with native un treated wastewaters in strain yg1024 after filtration 4 3 results of experiments with liver derived cells the results of the bacterial mutagenicity experiments depended strongly on the genetic background of the indicator strains and it is questionable if the results obtained in these tests reflect the adverse health effects in humans as mentioned above most investigations with ozonated waters were conducted with bacteria only in two studies metabolically competent liver derived cells were used which reflect the metabolism of xenobiotics better than bacterial indicators and cell lines which lack xenobiotic drug metabolising enzymes knasmüller et al 2004 misik et al 2019b itzel et al 2017 used in a previous study hepg2 cells but did not conduct parallel experiments with bacterial strains misik et al 2011 used primary rat hepatocytes but did not study the effects of the waters in highly sensitive repair deficient strains which were included in the present study furthermore they did not investigate the impact of activated carbon filtration in the present study we used both experimental models in the first primary rat hepatocytes were exposed to concentrated dmso extracts of the waters which were also used in the bacterial experiments therefore the results of these experiments can be compared in the second experimental system human hepatoma cells hepg2 were exposed to unconcentrated water samples as it is known that biologically active compounds can be lost by concentration procedures stahl 1991 in both models we found an identical pattern of genotoxic activities of the different test waters which was in strong contrast to the results obtained with the bacterial indicators the most pronounced effects were consistently observed with non ozonated samples while ozonation lead to a decrease of the genotoxic activities activated carbon filtration did not cause a substantial further decrease of the dna damaging properties of the samples it is notable that the extent of genetic damage which was observed after the filtration step was in all experimental series with both cell types still higher than the background levels indicating that the water samples after ozonation and filtration still contained compounds which cause damage of the genetic material the differences between the results of the bacterial tests and the findings with the liver derived cells may be due to differences in the metabolic capacity of the indicator cells and also to differences in their repair activities as mentioned above liver homogenate s9 is added in experiments with bacterial indicators and metabolically incompetent cells this activation mix contains only active phase i enzymes but no active phase ii enzymes which catalyse mainly detoxification reactions glatt 2009 kirkland et al 2007 phase ii enzymes are also involved in the activation of specific genotoxins for example of certain halogenated water disinfection products which are found by chlorination of waters richardson et al 2007 both types of enzymes are present in the liver derived cells which we used in the present study the discrepancies of the effects seen with ozonated waters in the repair deficient salmonella strains yg7018 and yg7104 and in the liver cells can be explained by the high sensitivity of the bacteria towards alkylating agents for example compounds like ethylmethanesulfonate ems and methylmethanesulfonate mms can be detected with extremely low concentrations 50 µm in yg7018 and yg7104 yamada et al 1997 while substantially higher concentrations 50 µm mms and 100 µm ems are required to detect dna damage in hepg2 cells elje et al 2019 kim et al 2016 valentin severin et al 2003 it is also well documented that salmonella strains lead to an overestimation of the mutagenic properties of certain groups of mutagens which are found in water for example of disinfection by products derived from humic acids brunborg et al 1991 and nitroaromatic compounds silvers et al 1994 apart from differences in biotransformation and repair also other factors may account for the divergent results for example differences in the membrane permeability and in the organisation of the genetic material several systematic evaluations of the usefulness of the salmonella microsome assay and of genotoxicity experiments with liver derived cells for the detection of dna reactive carcinogens have been published the results show that the sensitivity and specificity of the bacterial tests is relatively low i e between 58 60 and 63 70 respectively kamber et al 2009 kirkland et al 2005 a substantially better predictive value was constantly found for scge and other genotoxicity experiments with human derived liver cells and primary hepatocytes in most calculations the sensitivity specificity was above 88 hong et al 2018 le hegarat et al 2010 seo et al 2019 wang et al 2007 for review see guo et al 2020 the present results show that part of the compounds which cause the genotoxic effects in the two types of liver derived cells are destroyed by ozonation but it is still unclear which chemicals are responsible for the damage of the genetic material since addition of s9 mix in experiments with hepg2 cells led to an increase of the genotoxic activities of non ozonated water samples fig 7 it is likely that the chemicals which cause the genotoxic effects are at least partly activated by phase i enzymes potential candidates which were found earlier in waters are aromatic amines which are breakdown products of azo dyes ohe et al 2004 and heterocyclic aromatic amines that are found in fried meats and feces and were detected in urban wastewaters kataoka et al 2000 5 conclusions this is the first study in which a broad panel of bacteria tester strains was used in combination with two different models with liver derived cells to study the impact of ozonation and activated carbon filtration on genotoxic and acute toxic properties of treated wastewaters an increase of the mutagenic activities of treated wastewaters was observed in selected bacterial indicator strains after ozonation which decreased after activated carbon filtration on the contrary we found a beneficial effect of ozonation in experiments with liver derived cells i e we detected pronounced genotoxic activity in the treated wastewaters which declined after ozone treatment bacterial tests are a useful tool for the detection of mutagenic properties of individual chemicals and complex mixtures in general but may lead to an overestimation of the activities of certain groups of chemicals the sensitivity specificity of experiments with liver derived cells for the detection of genotoxic carcinogens is higher as that of salmonella microsome assays therefore also future studies concerning the impact of advanced treatment procedures on the genotoxic properties of waters should include bacterial tests as well as experiments with liver derived cell lines declaration of competing interest the authors declare
