23175,this paper presents a comparison between experimental data of a model scale 4 mw monopile offshore wind turbine subjected to extreme irregular sea states in finite water and the numerical models suggested in offshore wind energy standards to assess uls conditions the model is fully flexible with its 1st and 2nd eigenfrequencies and 1st mode shape tuned to fit those of the full scale turbine the measured and simulated bending moments at the sea bottom are decomposed around the eigenfrequencies of the structure and the morison equation with stream function wave kinematics is found to trigger transient 1st mode response so called ringing response the amplitude of the simulated 1st mode response is proportional to the incoming wave steepness such a relationship is not observed experimentally similarly 2nd mode response is triggered by wienke s slamming model but generally does not match the experimental data although the numerical models from the design standards morison s equation with stream function kinematics plus a slamming model can give conservative estimates of the extreme responses the models miss the balance between 1st and 2nd mode responses the simplification of the physics in the numerical models can thus lead to inaccuracies in response prediction such as the stress distribution along the monopile keywords offshore wind turbine ringing slamming engineering models experimental hydrodynamics modal decomposition 1 introduction offshore wind turbines mounted on monopiles are currently being built or planned in the north sea in water depths between 20 and 50 m ho et al 2016 in order to safely design the monopiles the maximum load effect that the structure will experience over its lifetime has to be assessed so called ultimate limit state uls analysis a number of standards suggest hydrodynamic load models for such a study for different situations for example dnv os j101 2014 dnv rp c205 2014a iec 61400 3 2009 these standards are mostly adapted from experience from the oil and gas industry whose structures differ from offshore wind turbines in two important aspects the depths considered for oil and gas platforms are much larger than those of offshore wind turbines enabling the simplification of infinite water depth for offshore wind turbines the displacement of the 2nd mode shape near the mean sea level is large compared to oil and gas platforms this means that the 2nd mode of the structure will be excited by breaking wave events which induce loads around the mean sea level as shown for instance by peeringa and hermans 2017 for bottom fixed oil and gas platforms breaking wave loads act close to the maximum of the 1st mode shape but are unlikely to excite global 1st mode response due to the short load duration fig 1 illustrates the concepts explained above the largest contribution from hydrodynamic loads is around the mean sea level which means that for a wind turbine it will be low in relative heights compared to an offshore oil and gas platform the main aim of this paper is to assess how well the standards used by the offshore wind industry predict the response of the support structure in uls conditions experimental data produced by the maritime research institute netherlands marin is compared to the numerical models proposed in the standards in these experiments a fully flexible model of an idling 4 mw bottom fixed offshore wind turbine mounted on a monopile was subjected to extreme weather conditions suja thauvin et al 2017 analysed these experiments and showed that the largest responses for an offshore wind turbine in the above mentioned conditions were provoked by steep and breaking waves 2nd and 3rd order hydrodynamic loads from the wave trigger the 1st mode of the structure and produce the response phenomenon known as ringing characterized by a build up of the resonant vibration over about one wave period which then slowly decays natvig 1994 and illustrated in fig 2 the bending moment in fig 2 has been filtered to show only the response of the 1st mode of the structure this procedure is explained in section 5 2 the loads due to the impact of the breaking wave on the structure so called slamming loads excite the 2nd mode of the structure which can account for up to 20 of the maximum response suja thauvin et al 2017 slamming loads excite all modes of the structure but only higher modes will be significantly excited due to i the very short slam duration compared to the 1st eigenperiod and ii the shape of the 2nd mode compared to the 1st mode a conclusion of suja thauvin et al 2017 is thus that in order to correctly depict the maximum responses experienced by the support structure of offshore wind turbines one has to account for both ringing responses and responses to breaking waves numerical models for predicting ringing gained attention in the 1990s when ringing was first observed during model tests of the hutton and heidrun tlp offshore oil and gas platforms and of the deep water concrete towers of the draugen and troll a platforms natvig and teigen 1993 for offshore wind turbines the necessity of using non linear wave kinematics when calculating hydrodynamic loads for capturing this phenomenon was shown for example by marino et al 2013a this agrees well with paulsen et al 2013 who showed by using a cfd solver that the excitation force based on linear wave kinematics does not have the frequency content necessary to excite the 1st mode of the structure bredmose et al 2012 used a simple cantilever beam numerical model to assess the importance of wave height and water depth with respect to ringing responses and to show how this phenomenon can dominate the total response due to dynamic amplification in addition to ringing responses breaking wave events have also been studied for offshore wind turbines both de ridder et al 2011 and bredmose et al 2013 carried out experiments on a bottom fixed responding structure whose characteristics were similar to those of an idling extra large wind turbine and found out that breaking waves could lead to extreme accelerations of the nacelle bredmose and jacobsen 2010 carried out a cfd analysis where focused waves were forced to break at different locations in the vicinity of the turbine in order to assess the hydrodynamic loads at different stages of the breaking process marino et al 2013a applied a fully nonlinear high order boundary element solver to a series of realistic sea states and showed that the bending moment at the tower base could be six times larger compared to a linear model the numerical models presented in the aforementioned works provide accurate predictions of the response of a bottom fixed offshore wind turbine to steep breaking waves but are too computationally expensive to be used by the industry for design where typically thousands of load cases need to be assessed the standards commonly used by the industry to calculate hydrodynamic loading under steep breaking waves dnv os j101 2014 dnv rp c205 2014a iec 61400 3 2009 suggest simpler models such as the stream function theory rienecker and fenton 1981 and wienke s slamming model wienke and oumeraci 2005 to assess the validity of these models for calculating the turbine s response under steep breaking wave loads the above mentioned models have been implemented in matlab and used to try to match the experiments carried out by marin other theories that attempt to reproduce ringing responses have been developed by faltinsen et al 1995 so called fnv model and malenica and molin 1995 so called mm model both these theories were developed based on a perturbation approach and estimate the excitation load up to third order in terms of wave steepness krokstad et al 1998 presented a validation of the response predicted by the fnv model in deep water and kristiansen and faltinsen 2017 further developed the model for finite water paulsen et al 2014 showed that the 3rd order excitation loads from both the fnv and the mm models within their range of validity match those predicted by cfd both models account for hydrodynamic structural interaction by considering the diffracted wave from the cylinder on the contrary the models presented in this paper and commonly used in design do not account for the presence of the structure and only estimate the kinematics of the undisturbed wave the paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly presents the experiments carried out by marin and in section 3 we introduce the structural model used in the paper in section 4 we use the models proposed by the standards to carry out the uls analysis under the environmental conditions of the marin experiments and section 5 compares the same models on a single event basis to assess how the models perform conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 presentation of the model test a more detailed description of the experiments is given by suja thauvin et al 2017 only the most relevant points are given here the dimensions of the experimental set up and the flexible model are given in fig 3 and fig 4 the values given in the paper are full scale unless specified otherwise the fully flexible model was held by a 6 component force frame and placed in a pit dug into the shallow water basin of marin a rigid model was also constructed and placed in the basin but is not analysed in this study the force frame was calibrated by pulling on it with known weights and showed an accuracy in measured moments of 2 3 the fore aft bending moment was measured at the sea bed and is simply referred to as response in the rest of the paper 4 wave gauges were placed in the basin the accuracy of the wave gauges was not reported but a typical value is approximately 1 mm in model scale steen 2014 or 5 cm in full scale only one wave gauge marked in fig 3 was used in this study this wave gauge was placed about 13 diameters from both models so it is expected that the diffracted and reflected waves can be neglected the elevation measured by this wave gauge is used as an input for the numerical models after linearization see appendix a the waves were generated by a piston type wave maker consisting of a flat plate forced into horizontal motion by an electrical actuator the prototype is a 1 30 6 froude scaled model of a 4 mw wind turbine the diameter at the mean sea level is 5 78 m and the water depth is 27 m special effort was put into achieving the correct 1st and 2nd eigenfrequencies and correct 1st mode shape table 1 shows the eigenfrequencies and damping ratios of the model derived from hammer tests in water see bunnik et al 2015 and fig 5 shows the mode shapes of the 1st and 2nd mode it should be noted that the damping values are low compared to idling full scale wind turbine damgaard et al 2013 damgaard and andersen 2012 shirzadeh et al 2015 report 1 7 2 8 of critical damping for the first mode depending on the wind speed considerations regarding very lightly damped systems are briefly discussed in section 5 4 the 3rd and 4th modes measured on the experimental model have not been tuned to fit those of the full scale model which implies that conclusions based on the analysis of these two modes and even higher could not be applied to a full scale wind turbine therefore these higher modes have been left out of the study all the measured data presented in this work has been low pass filtered to remove the response of the structure at these higher modes more details are given in suja thauvin et al 2017 in this paper we analyse selected sea states from the experiments summarized in table 2 and plotted in fig 6 the experimental campaign was divided into part a and part b as they were different stages of the same project but the experimental set up remained unchanged between these two parts fig 6 shows the h s t p graph of the dogger bank creyke beck b site see frimann dahl 2015 and gives an indication of the return periods of the analysed sea states it should be noted that the wind conditions for the selected sea states have not been determined under all sea states analysed in the paper the turbine is assumed idling and no aerodynamics are modelled except estimated damping from an idling turbine in reality the mildest sea states are probably associated with an operational turbine 3 structural model the numerical tool developed for modelling the response of the structure is a simple mode shape solver see for example gans 2015 the mode shapes and damping levels were provided by bunnik et al 2015 the response bending moment of the structure is calculated with the euler bernoulli beam equation assuming a slender structure in the vertical direction z 1 m z t e i 2 ψ z t z 2 where m is the response bending moment e is the young s modulus i is the area moment of inertia of the cross section and ψ is the deflection of the system the deflection is assumed to be the sum of the deflections of each individual mode 2 ψ z t i 1 n ψ i z ξ i t where ψ i is the mode shape of the i t h mode and ξ i is the modal displacement of the i t h mode the modal displacement for each mode is determined solving the simple one degree of freedom equation with matlab 3 f i m i ξ i b i ξ i c i ξ i where f i is the modal excitation for the i t h mode and m i b i and c i are respectively the modal mass including added mass the modal damping and the modal stiffness of mode i the modal excitation for each mode is obtained by integrating the product of the excitation force times the mode shape over the instantaneous wetted surface 4 f i h z 0 f z ψ i z d z where f is the hydrodynamic load calculated with one of the models described in section 4 1 4 z 0 is the instantaneous wave elevation and h is the water depth 4 standards statistical analysis 4 1 procedure to estimate uls response in this section we evaluate the characteristic response for uls design shortened to uls response of the structure using three standards commonly used in the offshore wind industry namely dnv os j101 2014 dnv rp c205 2014a iec 61400 3 2009 we investigate load case 6 1 from these standards which was established by de ridder et al 2017 as the design driver for the present experimental campaign the standards prescribe 20 realizations of the 50 year return sea state corresponding to the desired location each including a wave with the characteristics of a 50 year return wave embedded at a random time if the wave is breaking at the structure a slamming load model has to be added to account for the impact like load on the structure more details are given in section 4 1 4 each realization has a 10 min duration and corresponds to a linear superposition of regular wave components according to a jonswap spectrum see hasselmann et al 1973 as suggested in all three standards the average of the 20 maxima obtained from the simulated response time series is interpreted as the uls response this response is commonly referred to as the 50 year response even though it is rather the response to 50 year return environmental conditions in this paper in order to align with the common terminology we denote the response estimated following the aforementioned procedure the 50 year response fig 7 illustrates this procedure in this paper we assume that each of the analysed sea states given in table 2 corresponds to a 50 year return sea state at a fictitious location once the 50 year return sea state has been determined one must define the characteristics of the 50 year return wave and the wave kinematics used to model this wave the next four subsections deal respectively with determining the characteristics of the 50 year wave choosing the kinematics model used to simulate the 50 year wave the embedding procedure the hydrodynamic load models 4 1 1 50 year return wave characteristics to define the height of the 50 year return wave based on the 50 year return sea state iec 61400 3 2009 assumes that the sea state has a 3 h stationarity during which the wave elevation follows a gaussian distribution and the wave heights follow a given distribution in this paper either a rayleigh or a battjes and groenendijk distribution see battjes and groenendijk 2000 we denote hereafter h 50 the height of the 50 year return wave and h s 50 the significant wave height of the 50 year return sea state iec 61400 3 2009 shows in detail how to estimate h 50 assuming a rayleigh distribution of the wave elevation this assumption yields the classical result h 50 1 86 h s 50 the same derivation can be carried out assuming a battjes and groenendijk distribution hereafter noted bg the details of the derivation can be found in battjes and groenendijk 2000 fig 8 shows the calculated h 50 assuming the two different wave height distributions for each sea state in addition we show the significant wave height for each sea state and the maximum measured wave height in order to find the maximum wave height two maxima are measured per sea state corresponding to trough to crest and crest to trough wave heights and then the maximum of the two is taken the error bars for the measured values correspond to two standard deviations of the 3 h maximum as estimated for a rayleigh distribution of the peaks above and below the measured value see for example naess and moan 2012 the measured maximum wave height is only given as an indication since the maximum wave of a 3 h realization of the 50 year return sea state is in general not the same as the 50 year return wave the rayleigh distribution is known to be a good approximation for wave height distribution in deep water the bg distribution takes depth into consideration and converges towards the rayleigh distribution in deep waters this is confirmed by fig 8 where for lower sea states both models give similar results the method presented by battjes and groenendijk 2000 uses a look up table and does not provide an estimate for the lowest sea state hs 3 5 m tp 8 5 m for such conditions it is reasonable to assume that the wave height distribution is well represented by a rayleigh distribution in addition to determining the h 50 it is necessary to determine the period of the 50 year return wave hereafter noted t 50 t 50 can be taken within the range given by the following formula according to iec 61400 3 2009 5 11 1 h s 50 g t 50 14 3 h s 50 g for each sea state different values of t 50 varying within the range given by equation 5 were tested and the most conservative results were always obtained with the shortest t 50 corresponding to the steepest 50 year return wave only results for the steepest 50 year return wave are shown in this paper it should be noted that this equation provides t 50 depending only on h s 50 in this paper the 2 highest sea states have the same h s and will therefore have the same t 50 4 1 2 determination of the wave kinematics in order to accurately model the kinematics of a single wave different theories suggest different approaches fig 9 is common to all three standards and suggests which theory can be used to describe a given regular wave depending on the wave height wave period and water depth all these theories provide a solution for the laplace equation and boundary conditions that can be found in most text books e g faltinsen 1990 the main difference between these theories is the order to which they satisfy the dynamic and kinematic boundary condition at the free surface higher order meaning more accuracy but also higher computational time in fig 9 the x and the represent the 50 year return waves shown in fig 8 it can be seen in fig 9 that a stream function of order between 3 and 9 is required to accurately model the 50 year return waves analysed in this study for the following simulations a 9th order stream function was used to model the 50 year return waves the kinematics of the stream function waves were computed following rienecker and fenton 1981 fig 9 also shows dots which correspond to the individual events studied in section 5 4 1 3 embedding procedure for the present paper the embedding of the stream function is done following rainey and camp 2007 as shown in fig 10 this figure shows how the stream function wave is smoothly embedded into the linear irregular sea by defining two blending areas marked in grey where the linear and the stream function wave are multiplied by weighting functions these weighting functions ensure a transition without discontinuities between the stream function and the linear kinematics the weighting functions are applied to the wave elevation the particle velocity and the particle acceleration according to iec 61400 3 2009 the instant when the 50 year wave is embedded into the linear irregular sea is randomly selected for each realization of the 50 year sea state the effect of the time of embedding on the estimation of the uls load can be seen by comparing the responses of the structure to the same realization of a 10 min sea state with a stream function randomly embedded with 2 s of difference no slamming model is applied in this simulation fig 11 a shows the wave elevation of the linear realization and with the two different embeddings while fig 11b shows the response of the structure as shown in fig 11b the difference of maximum bending moments between the two embeddings is about 13 10 realizations of 2 time series with 2 s separated embeddings have been carried out and the average difference between the 2 embeddings was about 9 this is caused by the response history of the structure i e its position velocity and acceleration when the wave passes through it as well as the wave kinematics induced by sewing together the time histories since the time of embedding is random the kinematics of the structure at the time of embedding vary from one realization to the next furthermore the process of embedding introduces different wave kinematics in the overlap region by averaging the maxima over 20 realizations the result accounts for some of these uncertainties 4 1 4 hydrodynamic load models the considered 50 year return waves all have a wavelength longer than 10 times the radius of the cylinder which implies that near field first order diffraction effects from the structure can be neglected faltinsen 1990 therefore as suggested by all three standards the numerical model of the structure is vertically divided into strips of length d z and the well known morison equation morison et al 1950 is used to calculate the hydrodynamic loads d f on each strip 6 d f ρ π c m r 2 a d z ρ r c d u u d z with ρ the water density r the cylinder radius a and u the particle acceleration and velocity in the horizontal direction respectively and c m and c d the inertia and drag coefficients the particle acceleration and velocity are obtained from the kinematic model as explained above the inertia and drag coefficients are determined empirically for the reynolds and keulegan carpenter numbers relevant to this study sarpkaya 2010 recommends c m 1 8 and c d 0 8 a slamming load is added to the morison equation to account for the impact of the breaking wave on the structure this load is calculated according to wienke s model developed in wienke and oumeraci 2005 and given by the following equation 7 f s l a m c s ρ r c 2 λ η m with c s the slamming coefficient c the wave celerity λ the curling factor and η m the maximum wave elevation for the given slamming event the slamming coefficient is time dependent and is given by assuming t 0 corresponds to the time of impact c s 2 π cos γ 2 cos γ c r t tanh 1 1 1 4 1 cos γ c r t for t 1 8 r c 1 cos γ and c s π 1 6 cos γ 1 c r t 8 3 cos γ c r t 4 tanh 1 1 c r t 6 cos γ c r t 8 for 3 32 r c 1 cos γ t 12 32 r c 1 cos γ and t t 1 32 r c 1 cos γ with γ the angle between the water surface and the axis of the cylinder in the present paper the slamming load is applied when the slope of the wave elevation is maximum as this was found to fit the experimental data by comparing the excitation loads measured on some of the small sea states to the numerical models and at the free surface elevation both the duration and the amplitude of the slamming load are dependent on the celerity of the wave which in the present study is calculated with the stream function theory in another study using the same experimental data as this paper burmester et al 2017 report a curling factor of 0 28 this value is used in the present study 4 2 analysis of the statistical results in the data provided by marin we interpret each wave elevation time series as a 3 h realization of a 50 year sea state and look at the maximum response over this realization we then compare this maximum to the estimation of the 50 year response obtained following the procedure explained above and summarized in fig 7 this comparison is plotted in fig 12 the calculated 50 year responses correspond to estimations of h 50 considering the two mentioned wave height distributions rayleigh and bg as in fig 8 the error bars for the measured values correspond to two standard deviations of the 3 h maximum as estimated for a rayleigh distribution of the peaks above and below the measured value for the sea states with a large significant wave height the models suggested by the standards overpredict the responses compared to the experimental measurements the overprediction is reduced by using the bg distribution since this distribution leads to lower estimates of h 50 as seen in fig 8 for lower sea states the predicted response is closer to the measurements the overprediction is mainly related to the 2nd mode response which depends strongly on the celerity of the stream function wave in order to understand the difference of prediction between low and high sea states individual events where a large response of the structure was measured are analysed in section 5 it should be noted that the maximum response of the structure during a 50 year sea state does not generally correspond to the response of the structure to a 50 year return wave it is therefore not strictly correct to compare the measurements and the estimations however such a comparison provides an indication of whether the numerical simulations are conservative 5 single event simulation in this section we analyse how the models suggested by the industry perform when assessing extreme responses by considering individual events we focus on the events that produced the largest measured responses of part a and part b for part a that event occurred during sea state h s 5 89 m t p 10 s and for part b it occurred during sea state h s 9 m t p 13 s these events are named events a1 and b1 respectively and are simulated using the following three models m lin morison with linear kinematics the wave kinematics are obtained from a linearization of the wave elevation measured during the experiments see appendix a wheeler stretching wheeler 1969 non linear wave models and slamming models are not applied m sf morison with stream function wave kinematics the wave immediately preceding the measured large response is replaced with a 9th order stream function wave the wave height and wave period of the embedded stream function wave are taken as the measured wave height and trough to trough period as shown in fig 13 m sf w morison with stream function wave kinematics and wienke s slamming model as in m sf with the addition of wienke s slamming model at the instant where the slope of the wave elevation is maximum for the slamming model the wave celerity is obtained from the stream function theory 5 1 largest responses fig 14 shows the simulated and measured responses of events a1 and b1 the upper plot shows the time series of the response and the following plots are the continuous wavelet transforms cwt see daubechies 1992 of the measured and simulated responses the colour scale is kept the same over all events with warm colours corresponding to high energy content fig 14a and b and fig 14c and d shows that during the experiments the structure oscillates in its 1st and 2nd mode with eigenperiods of 3 44 and 0 82 s respectively this confirms what was found by suja thauvin et al 2017 i e that the passage of a steep and breaking wave triggers both 1st and 2nd mode response the time series in fig 14a and b and the cwt plots in fig 14e and f shows that for both events using the m lin model does not match the measured response neither the 1st nor the 2nd mode are triggered the limitations of using linear wave kinematics to simulate extreme waves are well known marino et al 2013a paulsen et al 2013 suja thauvin et al 2014 for event a1 it can be seen from fig 14a and the cwt plots in fig 14g that the 1st mode response is not triggered correctly using the m sf model as seen in fig 15 zoom of fig 14i adding wienke s slamming model triggers 2nd mode response but does not change the 1st mode response indeed the duration of the slamming load estimated by wienke s model is too short to significantly trigger 1st mode response see suja thauvin and krokstad 2016 for event b1 the time series in fig 14b and the cwt plot in fig 14h show that the 1st mode response is triggered by the m sf model as for event a1 fig 14j shows that the m sf w model triggers 2nd mode response fig 16 shows the modal excitation force for the first mode simulated with m sf and m l for event b1 the cwt plots show that the excitation force of the m sf model contains higher frequencies than that of the m l which explain its ability to trigger 1st mode response in the structure the trough to trough period of the wave provoking event b1 is 11 25 s which for the 9th order stream function wave gives a 9th harmonic at 0 8 hz the ability of the stream function to trigger 1st mode response is analysed in more detail in section 5 3 1 these results suggest that the studied non linear wave kinematic model can qualitatively produce 1st mode response and that wienke s model can trigger the 2nd mode of the structure a combination of the two models therefore has the potential to match the experimental data to assess the models in more detail the next section examines a larger number of events 5 2 response decomposition by modes for the 21 largest events of part a and the 30 largest events of part b in terms of measured response the responses were decomposed into quasi static 1st mode and 2nd mode response two butterworth band pass filters were applied around the 1st and 2nd eigenfrequencies of the structure to extract the 1st and 2nd mode responses and the remaining signal was taken as the quasi static response fig 17 shows the decomposition of the response for event a1 the vertical dotted line corresponds to the time t m a x where the total response is maximum by evaluating the amplitude of the responses of different modes at t m a x it is possible to determine the contribution of the different modes to the maximum response fig 18 shows the contribution of the different modes for the simulated responses and how they compare to the measured responses for part a fig 18a shows that all models reproduce the quasi static response reasonably well with m lin slightly underestimating it the differences in quasi static response between m lin and the models including stream function kinematics are due to the vertical length of integration of the loads on the structure m lin assumes loads up to the mean water level whereas m sf and m sf w assumes loads up to the measured wave elevation as noted in section 5 1 and illustrated in fig 18b c m lin does not trigger 1st or 2nd mode response and therefore underestimates the total response as shown in fig 18d and e fig 18b also shows that both models using stream function wave kinematics do trigger 1st mode response to a larger extent than m lin but still underestimate it as explained previously only the slamming model has the capability to 2nd mode response but the response from the simulations is significantly larger than the experiments it appears from fig 18 that 1st mode and quasi static response are affected by the presence of the slamming model the time of occurrence of the maxima when the slamming model is applied is slightly different than without slamming model and therefore the contributions of the different modes vary slightly there was no indication that the slamming model significantly affected the 1st mode and the quasi static response fig 18 indicates that stream function wave kinematics with wienke s slamming model have the potential to correctly predict the total response of the structure but generally do not capture the balance between 1st and 2nd mode response this leads to an inaccurate distribution of the stresses along the monopile fig 19 shows the same results as fig 18 for the largest 30 events of part b the conclusions regarding the m lin model and the quasi static and 2nd mode response drawn for part a also apply for part b when it comes to 1st mode response however there is no clear trend of how well the models using the stream function models m sf and m sf w capture it for some events they produce conservative results while for others they are non conservative fig 19e shows that the stream function with wienke s model does not give a conservative estimate of the total response of the structure when the 1st mode response is underestimated this underestimation can in some cases be compensated by an overestimation of the 2nd mode response using the slamming model but the physics of the process of maximum response are not correctly captured 5 3 analysis of the models in this part we try to explain the discrepancies observed between the models and the experimental data in the following we define the wave steepness as the steepness of the highest third of the wave equal to h 3 c t 1 3 where h 3 and t 1 3 are defined in fig 20 and c is the wave celerity taken equal to the stream function wave celerity for simulated waves and estimated with the nonlinear dispersion relationship for measured waves 5 3 1 stream function ringing response here we assess how the frequency content of the excitation affects the 1st mode response we evaluate the energy content of the modal excitation force for mode 1 obtained from equation 4 at the 1st eigenfrequency by calculating the cwt and taking its maximum along the 1st eigenfrequency of the structure indicated by a red dot in fig 16 from fig 21 to fig 26 the data points correspond to the events analysed in section 5 1 fig 21 shows the correlation between the energy content of the modal excitation force at the 1st eigenfrequency which has been normalized against its maximum value and the maximum value of the simulated 1st mode response this is different from previous figures where the contribution of the 1st mode response at the instant where the total maximum was reached was shown as expected there is a strong correlation between these parameters fig 22 shows the correlation of the stream function wave steepness and the energy content of the excitation force at the 1st eigenfrequency waves get steeper as the influence of higher harmonics gets larger therefore steeper waves have a higher energy content at high frequencies the eigenfrequency of the structure 0 29 hz corresponds to harmonics between 3 and 5 for the considered waves this explains why steeper waves produce excitation forces with larger energy content at 0 29 hz as can be seen in fig 22 in figs 21 and 22 the black line is obtained from a linear regression of the data the r2 coefficient is given in the caption fig 23 shows that there is no clear correlation between the measured wave steepness and 1st mode response fig 24 shows the same for a different definition of the wave steepness wave height over wavelength this suggests that the reason why the stream function model does not consistently capture 1st mode response is because it produces a response proportional to the wave steepness which does not correspond to what is observed in the experiments 5 3 2 slamming model 2nd mode response by definition the amplitude of the slamming load is proportional to the wave elevation times the wave celerity squared see wienke and oumeraci 2005 the impulse of the slamming load is proportional to its amplitude and classical structure dynamics see for example biggs 1964 shows that increasing impulse produces an increased response of the structure this explains the linear trend in the correlation between the simulated 2nd mode response and the wave elevation times the wave celerity squared seen in fig 25 as in the analysis of 1st mode response in section 5 3 1 the trend in the simulations does not correspond to what can be observed from the experiments fig 26 shows no apparent trend between the measured 2nd mode response and the wave elevation times the celerity squared this can be due to i physical phenomena not considered in the theory such as air entrapment asymmetry of the load imperfections on the surface ii an inaccurate estimation of the wave celerity and iii an inaccurate representation of the shape of the impact load by the slamming model given by equation 8 a detailed analysis of the effect of the shape of the slamming load is beyond the scope of this paper but classical structure dynamics biggs 1964 shows that the response of a structure to a transient load depends on the shape of the load it should be noted that the impulse could not be obtained from measurements with the given experimental setup 5 4 discussion on damping the damping of the 1st and 2nd mode was 1 1 of the critical damping research done by bachynski and moan 2014 and schløer et al 2016 suggests that damping is not critical for the maximum response but more relevant for fatigue damage this agrees with the numerical simulations reported in marino et al 2013b where it can be seen at an event level that the maximum bending moments at the tower bottom are not generally smaller in power production mode which implies larger damping compared to idling conditions however suja thauvin et al 2016 pointed out that for very lightly damped systems the 1st mode response produced by a ringing event will not decay quickly so a new event may produce 1st mode response on top of these free decay oscillations potentially increasing the maximum if the oscillations from the two events occur in phase bachynski et al 2017 explored this issue further and showed that at a statistical level increased damping would decrease the extreme bending moment at the tower bottom the present experimental set up did not enable variation of the system damping it was thus impossible to assess whether for a very lightly damped structure the response to non linear loading might be somewhat hidden by the large responses at the 1st eigenmode indeed if an event a induces a 1st mode response in the structure and that response has not dampened out by the time a later event b occurs it will be challenging to assess the contribution of each event to the 1st mode response the question of whether low damping decreases the sensitivity of the system to non linearities is left for further studies 6 conclusion experimental data of a monopile offshore wind turbine subjected to severe irregular waves has been compared to the numerical models suggested by typical standards used in the offshore wind industry namely dnv os j101 2014 dnv rp c205 2014a iec 61400 3 2009 the experimental campaign at marin consisted of a fully flexible monopile offshore wind turbine in finite water depth and subjected to extreme irregular sea states the model was built so that its dimensions its 1st and 2nd eigenfrequencies and 1st mode shape fit those of a full scale 4 mw wind turbine during the experimental campaign uls conditions were found to be the design driver for the given structure de ridder et al 2017 so this paper attempts to reproduce the characteristic response for uls design commonly referred to as the 50 year response both statistical and event based comparisons were considered several limitations to the present work should be noted this analysis is based on experimental data from a limited number of sea state realizations at 1 30 6 scale with the inherent limitations and uncertainties associated with wave generation and small scale testing in addition due to the experimental set up only one combination of 1st and 2nd eigenfrequencies was analysed as rotor size increases ho et al 2016 the mass and moment of inertia on top of the tower may increase at different rates thus changing the ratio of 1st to 2nd eigenfrequency this could potentially change the relative contributions of the 1st and 2nd mode responses to the total response and therefore modify figs 18e and 19e furthermore the wave elevation measured during the experiments is inherently nonlinear and had to be linearized to be a valid input to the hydrodynamic load models see appendix a the 3rd and 4th modes of the structure were also disregarded in this study and might be relevant when assessing maximum responses finally we did not consider memory effects i e the fact that the response to previous events influences the response to a given wave peng et al 2013 showed that it is possible to get larger responses from wave groups than from individual regular waves with the same characteristics as the largest wave of the group in order to determine the 50 year response the standards suggest simulating the response of the structure over 20 realizations of the 50 year sea state with the 50 year wave randomly embedded the 50 year wave kinematics are determined using the stream function and the hydrodynamic loads are computed with the morison equation during the experiments large responses were provoked by steep and breaking waves so wienke s slamming model see wienke and oumeraci 2005 was added on top of the morison loads the numerical model gave a conservative estimate of the 50 year response for the largest sea states studied in this paper but underpredicted the 50 year response for the milder sea states the events which produced a large response in the experiments were analysed individually and the measured and simulated responses were decomposed into contributions around the 1st and 2nd eigenfrequencies of the structure the results suggest that the numerical model does not correctly predict the relative contributions of the 1st and 2nd mode response to the total response in particular it was found that the quasi static response was in general accurately estimated by linear as well as non linear wave kinematic models the morison equation with stream function wave kinematics inconsistently predicted ringing response transient 1st mode response the amplitude of the simulated response was roughly proportional to the wave steepness but this correlation was not found in the experimentally measured response the 2nd mode of the structure was only excited by the slamming model this is consistent with the findings of suja thauvin et al 2017 who show that during the experiments 2nd mode response was triggered by waves breaking at the structure however according to the theory the amplitude of the 2nd mode response is proportional to the wave elevation times the celerity squared which was not observed in the experimental data overall the numerical model with morison s equation stream function wave kinematics and a slamming model conservatively estimated the total maximum response on 3 out of 21 events for part a and 14 out of 30 events for part b for all events where the total response was overestimated the 2nd mode response was also overestimated but there was no clear trend for the 1st mode response these findings imply that even in a situation where the models give a conservative estimate of the 50 year response the balance between 1st and 2nd mode response might not be realistic and the stress distribution along the monopile can be inaccurate it should be noted that in this paper the models were implemented to reproduce experimental data in order to allow an event based comparison in the estimation of 50 year response of offshore wind turbines rather than using experimental data the industry typically has access to metocean data to estimate the relevant extreme conditions in order to select a relevant 50 year return wave in section 4 1 1 based on iec 61400 3 2009 we assumed both rayleigh and battjes and groenendijk distributions for the wave heights for a 3 h sea state in addition several parameters required careful selection in order to provide

savannah river national laboratory siemens sirris owi lab statkraft statoil stx van oord vattenfall and volker infradesign bv appendix a wave linearization a1 filtering difference frequency waves are first removed from the measured signal using a simple high pass filter the difference frequency waves are far from the linear waves in the red circle in figure 27a making the filtering process straightforward next some of the higher order waves are removed by using a low pass filter we assume that 3rd and higher order waves have energy at frequencies that are higher than the linear wave and will therefore simply be removed by the low pass filter however removing second order sum frequency waves is more complicated because some of these waves have frequencies that lie within the range of linear waves if the cut off frequency is too low one might lose information from the linear waves on the other hand if the cut off frequency is too high part of the higher order waves will remain the explanation of how this cut off frequency is selected is given in appendix a2 once the high pass and low pass filters have been applied we obtain the initial approximation ζ i n i t 1 for the linear wave red curve in figure 27b in this initial approximation difference frequency waves have been removed but the sum frequency waves whose frequencies lie within the linear waves remain this unwanted energy is removed as follows a second order wave yellow curve in figure 27c is estimated from the initial approximation of the linear wave newman 1996 9 ζ 1 2 1 g 1 2 u 2 w 2 ζ i n i t 1 w t with g the gravitational acceleration u and w the horizontal and vertical water particle velocities respectively and with subscript indicating differentiation we then want to remove this second order wave from ζ i n i t 1 however part of ζ 1 2 is higher than the cut off frequency the region to the right of the black dotted line in figure 27c and will introduce higher frequencies into the linear wave if simply substracted therefore ζ 1 2 is first filtered in the same way as the measured wave elevation the result of this filtering is the yellow curve in figure 27d and then substracted from ζ i n i t 1 we then obtain the second approximation of the linear wave 10 ζ 2 1 ζ i n i t 1 ζ 1 2 equation 9 used to calculate ζ 1 2 requires a linear wave elevation as input however ζ i n i t 1 contains second order wave energy that was not removed by the initial filtering process as explained above this introduces an error in the second order wave ζ 1 2 and therefore in the linear wave ζ 2 1 in order to reduce this error we use ζ 2 1 to calculate a new estimation of the second order wave using equation 9 with ζ 2 1 instead of ζ i n i t 1 we then obtain ζ 2 2 we iterate this process and compare ζ i 1 1 and ζ i 1 at each step when the maximum of the difference is below a certain threshold set to h s 100 for the present study we consider that the process has converged and we use the obtained linear wave as input for the numerical models the flow chart in figure 28 describes the iterative process explained above in this flow chart the numbers of the figures illustrating the concepts are also given fig 27 spectra of the wave elevation during filtering process fig 27 a2 selection of the cut off frequency as stated above the selection of the cut off frequency for the low pass filter is not straight forward it is specified in the standard dnv rp c205 2014a that if second order loads are to be calculated from a linear wave time series a low pass filter should be applied with the following cut off frequency 11 ω d n v 2 g h s this cut off frequency developed for deep water has to be applied because some kinematic terms used in non linear hydrodynamic models can become unphysically large at the tail of the commonly used wave spectra see johannessen 2008 for intermediate water conditions the inherent non linear behaviour of the waves implies that a lower cut off frequency than the one presented in equation 11 has to be used the unwanted high frequency energy is filtered out by use of a butterworth filter this filter is defined by two parameters the cut off frequency and the order of the filter higher order meaning a sharper cut at the cut off frequency suja thauvin and krokstad 2016 varied these two parameters and a reconstructed linear wave was calculated for sea states of different severity it was found that a 4th order butterworth filter with a cut off frequency ω c u t o f f 0 8 ω d n v gives the most accurate results however as pointed out by johannessen 2011 the results are sensitive to the cut off frequency selected a careful assessment of the filter has to be carried out in order to get accurate results the linearization of the measured wave elevation introduces uncertainties into the estimation of the input to the hydrodynamic models but these do not affect the computation of the loads that determine the 50 year response in the present study for the stream function theory the wave height is taken from the unfiltered measured wave elevation and the period from the linear wave is practically the same as for the measured wave the kinematics of the stream function are only dependent on those two parameters and the water depth and therefore independent of the linearization process wienke s slamming model is only dependent on the wave elevation and the celerity of the wave which depends on the stream function its ability to trigger 1st or 2nd mode motion is therefore not dependent on the linearization process fig 28 flow chart for the linearization process fig 28 
23175,this paper presents a comparison between experimental data of a model scale 4 mw monopile offshore wind turbine subjected to extreme irregular sea states in finite water and the numerical models suggested in offshore wind energy standards to assess uls conditions the model is fully flexible with its 1st and 2nd eigenfrequencies and 1st mode shape tuned to fit those of the full scale turbine the measured and simulated bending moments at the sea bottom are decomposed around the eigenfrequencies of the structure and the morison equation with stream function wave kinematics is found to trigger transient 1st mode response so called ringing response the amplitude of the simulated 1st mode response is proportional to the incoming wave steepness such a relationship is not observed experimentally similarly 2nd mode response is triggered by wienke s slamming model but generally does not match the experimental data although the numerical models from the design standards morison s equation with stream function kinematics plus a slamming model can give conservative estimates of the extreme responses the models miss the balance between 1st and 2nd mode responses the simplification of the physics in the numerical models can thus lead to inaccuracies in response prediction such as the stress distribution along the monopile keywords offshore wind turbine ringing slamming engineering models experimental hydrodynamics modal decomposition 1 introduction offshore wind turbines mounted on monopiles are currently being built or planned in the north sea in water depths between 20 and 50 m ho et al 2016 in order to safely design the monopiles the maximum load effect that the structure will experience over its lifetime has to be assessed so called ultimate limit state uls analysis a number of standards suggest hydrodynamic load models for such a study for different situations for example dnv os j101 2014 dnv rp c205 2014a iec 61400 3 2009 these standards are mostly adapted from experience from the oil and gas industry whose structures differ from offshore wind turbines in two important aspects the depths considered for oil and gas platforms are much larger than those of offshore wind turbines enabling the simplification of infinite water depth for offshore wind turbines the displacement of the 2nd mode shape near the mean sea level is large compared to oil and gas platforms this means that the 2nd mode of the structure will be excited by breaking wave events which induce loads around the mean sea level as shown for instance by peeringa and hermans 2017 for bottom fixed oil and gas platforms breaking wave loads act close to the maximum of the 1st mode shape but are unlikely to excite global 1st mode response due to the short load duration fig 1 illustrates the concepts explained above the largest contribution from hydrodynamic loads is around the mean sea level which means that for a wind turbine it will be low in relative heights compared to an offshore oil and gas platform the main aim of this paper is to assess how well the standards used by the offshore wind industry predict the response of the support structure in uls conditions experimental data produced by the maritime research institute netherlands marin is compared to the numerical models proposed in the standards in these experiments a fully flexible model of an idling 4 mw bottom fixed offshore wind turbine mounted on a monopile was subjected to extreme weather conditions suja thauvin et al 2017 analysed these experiments and showed that the largest responses for an offshore wind turbine in the above mentioned conditions were provoked by steep and breaking waves 2nd and 3rd order hydrodynamic loads from the wave trigger the 1st mode of the structure and produce the response phenomenon known as ringing characterized by a build up of the resonant vibration over about one wave period which then slowly decays natvig 1994 and illustrated in fig 2 the bending moment in fig 2 has been filtered to show only the response of the 1st mode of the structure this procedure is explained in section 5 2 the loads due to the impact of the breaking wave on the structure so called slamming loads excite the 2nd mode of the structure which can account for up to 20 of the maximum response suja thauvin et al 2017 slamming loads excite all modes of the structure but only higher modes will be significantly excited due to i the very short slam duration compared to the 1st eigenperiod and ii the shape of the 2nd mode compared to the 1st mode a conclusion of suja thauvin et al 2017 is thus that in order to correctly depict the maximum responses experienced by the support structure of offshore wind turbines one has to account for both ringing responses and responses to breaking waves numerical models for predicting ringing gained attention in the 1990s when ringing was first observed during model tests of the hutton and heidrun tlp offshore oil and gas platforms and of the deep water concrete towers of the draugen and troll a platforms natvig and teigen 1993 for offshore wind turbines the necessity of using non linear wave kinematics when calculating hydrodynamic loads for capturing this phenomenon was shown for example by marino et al 2013a this agrees well with paulsen et al 2013 who showed by using a cfd solver that the excitation force based on linear wave kinematics does not have the frequency content necessary to excite the 1st mode of the structure bredmose et al 2012 used a simple cantilever beam numerical model to assess the importance of wave height and water depth with respect to ringing responses and to show how this phenomenon can dominate the total response due to dynamic amplification in addition to ringing responses breaking wave events have also been studied for offshore wind turbines both de ridder et al 2011 and bredmose et al 2013 carried out experiments on a bottom fixed responding structure whose characteristics were similar to those of an idling extra large wind turbine and found out that breaking waves could lead to extreme accelerations of the nacelle bredmose and jacobsen 2010 carried out a cfd analysis where focused waves were forced to break at different locations in the vicinity of the turbine in order to assess the hydrodynamic loads at different stages of the breaking process marino et al 2013a applied a fully nonlinear high order boundary element solver to a series of realistic sea states and showed that the bending moment at the tower base could be six times larger compared to a linear model the numerical models presented in the aforementioned works provide accurate predictions of the response of a bottom fixed offshore wind turbine to steep breaking waves but are too computationally expensive to be used by the industry for design where typically thousands of load cases need to be assessed the standards commonly used by the industry to calculate hydrodynamic loading under steep breaking waves dnv os j101 2014 dnv rp c205 2014a iec 61400 3 2009 suggest simpler models such as the stream function theory rienecker and fenton 1981 and wienke s slamming model wienke and oumeraci 2005 to assess the validity of these models for calculating the turbine s response under steep breaking wave loads the above mentioned models have been implemented in matlab and used to try to match the experiments carried out by marin other theories that attempt to reproduce ringing responses have been developed by faltinsen et al 1995 so called fnv model and malenica and molin 1995 so called mm model both these theories were developed based on a perturbation approach and estimate the excitation load up to third order in terms of wave steepness krokstad et al 1998 presented a validation of the response predicted by the fnv model in deep water and kristiansen and faltinsen 2017 further developed the model for finite water paulsen et al 2014 showed that the 3rd order excitation loads from both the fnv and the mm models within their range of validity match those predicted by cfd both models account for hydrodynamic structural interaction by considering the diffracted wave from the cylinder on the contrary the models presented in this paper and commonly used in design do not account for the presence of the structure and only estimate the kinematics of the undisturbed wave the paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly presents the experiments carried out by marin and in section 3 we introduce the structural model used in the paper in section 4 we use the models proposed by the standards to carry out the uls analysis under the environmental conditions of the marin experiments and section 5 compares the same models on a single event basis to assess how the models perform conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 presentation of the model test a more detailed description of the experiments is given by suja thauvin et al 2017 only the most relevant points are given here the dimensions of the experimental set up and the flexible model are given in fig 3 and fig 4 the values given in the paper are full scale unless specified otherwise the fully flexible model was held by a 6 component force frame and placed in a pit dug into the shallow water basin of marin a rigid model was also constructed and placed in the basin but is not analysed in this study the force frame was calibrated by pulling on it with known weights and showed an accuracy in measured moments of 2 3 the fore aft bending moment was measured at the sea bed and is simply referred to as response in the rest of the paper 4 wave gauges were placed in the basin the accuracy of the wave gauges was not reported but a typical value is approximately 1 mm in model scale steen 2014 or 5 cm in full scale only one wave gauge marked in fig 3 was used in this study this wave gauge was placed about 13 diameters from both models so it is expected that the diffracted and reflected waves can be neglected the elevation measured by this wave gauge is used as an input for the numerical models after linearization see appendix a the waves were generated by a piston type wave maker consisting of a flat plate forced into horizontal motion by an electrical actuator the prototype is a 1 30 6 froude scaled model of a 4 mw wind turbine the diameter at the mean sea level is 5 78 m and the water depth is 27 m special effort was put into achieving the correct 1st and 2nd eigenfrequencies and correct 1st mode shape table 1 shows the eigenfrequencies and damping ratios of the model derived from hammer tests in water see bunnik et al 2015 and fig 5 shows the mode shapes of the 1st and 2nd mode it should be noted that the damping values are low compared to idling full scale wind turbine damgaard et al 2013 damgaard and andersen 2012 shirzadeh et al 2015 report 1 7 2 8 of critical damping for the first mode depending on the wind speed considerations regarding very lightly damped systems are briefly discussed in section 5 4 the 3rd and 4th modes measured on the experimental model have not been tuned to fit those of the full scale model which implies that conclusions based on the analysis of these two modes and even higher could not be applied to a full scale wind turbine therefore these higher modes have been left out of the study all the measured data presented in this work has been low pass filtered to remove the response of the structure at these higher modes more details are given in suja thauvin et al 2017 in this paper we analyse selected sea states from the experiments summarized in table 2 and plotted in fig 6 the experimental campaign was divided into part a and part b as they were different stages of the same project but the experimental set up remained unchanged between these two parts fig 6 shows the h s t p graph of the dogger bank creyke beck b site see frimann dahl 2015 and gives an indication of the return periods of the analysed sea states it should be noted that the wind conditions for the selected sea states have not been determined under all sea states analysed in the paper the turbine is assumed idling and no aerodynamics are modelled except estimated damping from an idling turbine in reality the mildest sea states are probably associated with an operational turbine 3 structural model the numerical tool developed for modelling the response of the structure is a simple mode shape solver see for example gans 2015 the mode shapes and damping levels were provided by bunnik et al 2015 the response bending moment of the structure is calculated with the euler bernoulli beam equation assuming a slender structure in the vertical direction z 1 m z t e i 2 ψ z t z 2 where m is the response bending moment e is the young s modulus i is the area moment of inertia of the cross section and ψ is the deflection of the system the deflection is assumed to be the sum of the deflections of each individual mode 2 ψ z t i 1 n ψ i z ξ i t where ψ i is the mode shape of the i t h mode and ξ i is the modal displacement of the i t h mode the modal displacement for each mode is determined solving the simple one degree of freedom equation with matlab 3 f i m i ξ i b i ξ i c i ξ i where f i is the modal excitation for the i t h mode and m i b i and c i are respectively the modal mass including added mass the modal damping and the modal stiffness of mode i the modal excitation for each mode is obtained by integrating the product of the excitation force times the mode shape over the instantaneous wetted surface 4 f i h z 0 f z ψ i z d z where f is the hydrodynamic load calculated with one of the models described in section 4 1 4 z 0 is the instantaneous wave elevation and h is the water depth 4 standards statistical analysis 4 1 procedure to estimate uls response in this section we evaluate the characteristic response for uls design shortened to uls response of the structure using three standards commonly used in the offshore wind industry namely dnv os j101 2014 dnv rp c205 2014a iec 61400 3 2009 we investigate load case 6 1 from these standards which was established by de ridder et al 2017 as the design driver for the present experimental campaign the standards prescribe 20 realizations of the 50 year return sea state corresponding to the desired location each including a wave with the characteristics of a 50 year return wave embedded at a random time if the wave is breaking at the structure a slamming load model has to be added to account for the impact like load on the structure more details are given in section 4 1 4 each realization has a 10 min duration and corresponds to a linear superposition of regular wave components according to a jonswap spectrum see hasselmann et al 1973 as suggested in all three standards the average of the 20 maxima obtained from the simulated response time series is interpreted as the uls response this response is commonly referred to as the 50 year response even though it is rather the response to 50 year return environmental conditions in this paper in order to align with the common terminology we denote the response estimated following the aforementioned procedure the 50 year response fig 7 illustrates this procedure in this paper we assume that each of the analysed sea states given in table 2 corresponds to a 50 year return sea state at a fictitious location once the 50 year return sea state has been determined one must define the characteristics of the 50 year return wave and the wave kinematics used to model this wave the next four subsections deal respectively with determining the characteristics of the 50 year wave choosing the kinematics model used to simulate the 50 year wave the embedding procedure the hydrodynamic load models 4 1 1 50 year return wave characteristics to define the height of the 50 year return wave based on the 50 year return sea state iec 61400 3 2009 assumes that the sea state has a 3 h stationarity during which the wave elevation follows a gaussian distribution and the wave heights follow a given distribution in this paper either a rayleigh or a battjes and groenendijk distribution see battjes and groenendijk 2000 we denote hereafter h 50 the height of the 50 year return wave and h s 50 the significant wave height of the 50 year return sea state iec 61400 3 2009 shows in detail how to estimate h 50 assuming a rayleigh distribution of the wave elevation this assumption yields the classical result h 50 1 86 h s 50 the same derivation can be carried out assuming a battjes and groenendijk distribution hereafter noted bg the details of the derivation can be found in battjes and groenendijk 2000 fig 8 shows the calculated h 50 assuming the two different wave height distributions for each sea state in addition we show the significant wave height for each sea state and the maximum measured wave height in order to find the maximum wave height two maxima are measured per sea state corresponding to trough to crest and crest to trough wave heights and then the maximum of the two is taken the error bars for the measured values correspond to two standard deviations of the 3 h maximum as estimated for a rayleigh distribution of the peaks above and below the measured value see for example naess and moan 2012 the measured maximum wave height is only given as an indication since the maximum wave of a 3 h realization of the 50 year return sea state is in general not the same as the 50 year return wave the rayleigh distribution is known to be a good approximation for wave height distribution in deep water the bg distribution takes depth into consideration and converges towards the rayleigh distribution in deep waters this is confirmed by fig 8 where for lower sea states both models give similar results the method presented by battjes and groenendijk 2000 uses a look up table and does not provide an estimate for the lowest sea state hs 3 5 m tp 8 5 m for such conditions it is reasonable to assume that the wave height distribution is well represented by a rayleigh distribution in addition to determining the h 50 it is necessary to determine the period of the 50 year return wave hereafter noted t 50 t 50 can be taken within the range given by the following formula according to iec 61400 3 2009 5 11 1 h s 50 g t 50 14 3 h s 50 g for each sea state different values of t 50 varying within the range given by equation 5 were tested and the most conservative results were always obtained with the shortest t 50 corresponding to the steepest 50 year return wave only results for the steepest 50 year return wave are shown in this paper it should be noted that this equation provides t 50 depending only on h s 50 in this paper the 2 highest sea states have the same h s and will therefore have the same t 50 4 1 2 determination of the wave kinematics in order to accurately model the kinematics of a single wave different theories suggest different approaches fig 9 is common to all three standards and suggests which theory can be used to describe a given regular wave depending on the wave height wave period and water depth all these theories provide a solution for the laplace equation and boundary conditions that can be found in most text books e g faltinsen 1990 the main difference between these theories is the order to which they satisfy the dynamic and kinematic boundary condition at the free surface higher order meaning more accuracy but also higher computational time in fig 9 the x and the represent the 50 year return waves shown in fig 8 it can be seen in fig 9 that a stream function of order between 3 and 9 is required to accurately model the 50 year return waves analysed in this study for the following simulations a 9th order stream function was used to model the 50 year return waves the kinematics of the stream function waves were computed following rienecker and fenton 1981 fig 9 also shows dots which correspond to the individual events studied in section 5 4 1 3 embedding procedure for the present paper the embedding of the stream function is done following rainey and camp 2007 as shown in fig 10 this figure shows how the stream function wave is smoothly embedded into the linear irregular sea by defining two blending areas marked in grey where the linear and the stream function wave are multiplied by weighting functions these weighting functions ensure a transition without discontinuities between the stream function and the linear kinematics the weighting functions are applied to the wave elevation the particle velocity and the particle acceleration according to iec 61400 3 2009 the instant when the 50 year wave is embedded into the linear irregular sea is randomly selected for each realization of the 50 year sea state the effect of the time of embedding on the estimation of the uls load can be seen by comparing the responses of the structure to the same realization of a 10 min sea state with a stream function randomly embedded with 2 s of difference no slamming model is applied in this simulation fig 11 a shows the wave elevation of the linear realization and with the two different embeddings while fig 11b shows the response of the structure as shown in fig 11b the difference of maximum bending moments between the two embeddings is about 13 10 realizations of 2 time series with 2 s separated embeddings have been carried out and the average difference between the 2 embeddings was about 9 this is caused by the response history of the structure i e its position velocity and acceleration when the wave passes through it as well as the wave kinematics induced by sewing together the time histories since the time of embedding is random the kinematics of the structure at the time of embedding vary from one realization to the next furthermore the process of embedding introduces different wave kinematics in the overlap region by averaging the maxima over 20 realizations the result accounts for some of these uncertainties 4 1 4 hydrodynamic load models the considered 50 year return waves all have a wavelength longer than 10 times the radius of the cylinder which implies that near field first order diffraction effects from the structure can be neglected faltinsen 1990 therefore as suggested by all three standards the numerical model of the structure is vertically divided into strips of length d z and the well known morison equation morison et al 1950 is used to calculate the hydrodynamic loads d f on each strip 6 d f ρ π c m r 2 a d z ρ r c d u u d z with ρ the water density r the cylinder radius a and u the particle acceleration and velocity in the horizontal direction respectively and c m and c d the inertia and drag coefficients the particle acceleration and velocity are obtained from the kinematic model as explained above the inertia and drag coefficients are determined empirically for the reynolds and keulegan carpenter numbers relevant to this study sarpkaya 2010 recommends c m 1 8 and c d 0 8 a slamming load is added to the morison equation to account for the impact of the breaking wave on the

cos γ and t t 1 32 r c 1 cos γ with γ the angle between the water surface and the axis of the cylinder in the present paper the slamming load is applied when the slope of the wave elevation is maximum as this was found to fit the experimental data by comparing the excitation loads measured on some of the small sea states to the numerical models and at the free surface elevation both the duration and the amplitude of the slamming load are dependent on the celerity of the wave which in the present study is calculated with the stream function theory in another study using the same experimental data as this paper burmester et al 2017 report a curling factor of 0 28 this value is used in the present study 4 2 analysis of the statistical results in the data provided by marin we interpret each wave elevation time series as a 3 h realization of a 50 year sea state and look at the maximum response over this realization we then compare this maximum to the estimation of the 50 year response obtained following the procedure explained above and summarized in fig 7 this comparison is plotted in fig 12 the calculated 50 year responses correspond to estimations of h 50 considering the two mentioned wave height distributions rayleigh and bg as in fig 8 the error bars for the measured values correspond to two standard deviations of the 3 h maximum as estimated for a rayleigh distribution of the peaks above and below the measured value for the sea states with a large significant wave height the models suggested by the standards overpredict the responses compared to the experimental measurements the overprediction is reduced by using the bg distribution since this distribution leads to lower estimates of h 50 as seen in fig 8 for lower sea states the predicted response is closer to the measurements the overprediction is mainly related to the 2nd mode response which depends strongly on the celerity of the stream function wave in order to understand the difference of prediction between low and high sea states individual events where a large response of the structure was measured are analysed in section 5 it should be noted that the maximum response of the structure during a 50 year sea state does not generally correspond to the response of the structure to a 50 year return wave it is therefore not strictly correct to compare the measurements and the estimations however such a comparison provides an indication of whether the numerical simulations are conservative 5 single event simulation in this section we analyse how the models suggested by the industry perform when assessing extreme responses by considering individual events we focus on the events that produced the largest measured responses of part a and part b for part a that event occurred during sea state h s 5 89 m t p 10 s and for part b it occurred during sea state h s 9 m t p 13 s these events are named events a1 and b1 respectively and are simulated using the following three models m lin morison with linear kinematics the wave kinematics are obtained from a linearization of the wave elevation measured during the experiments see appendix a wheeler stretching wheeler 1969 non linear wave models and slamming models are not applied m sf morison with stream function wave kinematics the wave immediately preceding the measured large response is replaced with a 9th order stream function wave the wave height and wave period of the embedded stream function wave are taken as the measured wave height and trough to trough period as shown in fig 13 m sf w morison with stream function wave kinematics and wienke s slamming model as in m sf with the addition of wienke s slamming model at the instant where the slope of the wave elevation is maximum for the slamming model the wave celerity is obtained from the stream function theory 5 1 largest responses fig 14 shows the simulated and measured responses of events a1 and b1 the upper plot shows the time series of the response and the following plots are the continuous wavelet transforms cwt see daubechies 1992 of the measured and simulated responses the colour scale is kept the same over all events with warm colours corresponding to high energy content fig 14a and b and fig 14c and d shows that during the experiments the structure oscillates in its 1st and 2nd mode with eigenperiods of 3 44 and 0 82 s respectively this confirms what was found by suja thauvin et al 2017 i e that the passage of a steep and breaking wave triggers both 1st and 2nd mode response the time series in fig 14a and b and the cwt plots in fig 14e and f shows that for both events using the m lin model does not match the measured response neither the 1st nor the 2nd mode are triggered the limitations of using linear wave kinematics to simulate extreme waves are well known marino et al 2013a paulsen et al 2013 suja thauvin et al 2014 for event a1 it can be seen from fig 14a and the cwt plots in fig 14g that the 1st mode response is not triggered correctly using the m sf model as seen in fig 15 zoom of fig 14i adding wienke s slamming model triggers 2nd mode response but does not change the 1st mode response indeed the duration of the slamming load estimated by wienke s model is too short to significantly trigger 1st mode response see suja thauvin and krokstad 2016 for event b1 the time series in fig 14b and the cwt plot in fig 14h show that the 1st mode response is triggered by the m sf model as for event a1 fig 14j shows that the m sf w model triggers 2nd mode response fig 16 shows the modal excitation force for the first mode simulated with m sf and m l for event b1 the cwt plots show that the excitation force of the m sf model contains higher frequencies than that of the m l which explain its ability to trigger 1st mode response in the structure the trough to trough period of the wave provoking event b1 is 11 25 s which for the 9th order stream function wave gives a 9th harmonic at 0 8 hz the ability of the stream function to trigger 1st mode response is analysed in more detail in section 5 3 1 these results suggest that the studied non linear wave kinematic model can qualitatively produce 1st mode response and that wienke s model can trigger the 2nd mode of the structure a combination of the two models therefore has the potential to match the experimental data to assess the models in more detail the next section examines a larger number of events 5 2 response decomposition by modes for the 21 largest events of part a and the 30 largest events of part b in terms of measured response the responses were decomposed into quasi static 1st mode and 2nd mode response two butterworth band pass filters were applied around the 1st and 2nd eigenfrequencies of the structure to extract the 1st and 2nd mode responses and the remaining signal was taken as the quasi static response fig 17 shows the decomposition of the response for event a1 the vertical dotted line corresponds to the time t m a x where the total response is maximum by evaluating the amplitude of the responses of different modes at t m a x it is possible to determine the contribution of the different modes to the maximum response fig 18 shows the contribution of the different modes for the simulated responses and how they compare to the measured responses for part a fig 18a shows that all models reproduce the quasi static response reasonably well with m lin slightly underestimating it the differences in quasi static response between m lin and the models including stream function kinematics are due to the vertical length of integration of the loads on the structure m lin assumes loads up to the mean water level whereas m sf and m sf w assumes loads up to the measured wave elevation as noted in section 5 1 and illustrated in fig 18b c m lin does not trigger 1st or 2nd mode response and therefore underestimates the total response as shown in fig 18d and e fig 18b also shows that both models using stream function wave kinematics do trigger 1st mode response to a larger extent than m lin but still underestimate it as explained previously only the slamming model has the capability to 2nd mode response but the response from the simulations is significantly larger than the experiments it appears from fig 18 that 1st mode and quasi static response are affected by the presence of the slamming model the time of occurrence of the maxima when the slamming model is applied is slightly different than without slamming model and therefore the contributions of the different modes vary slightly there was no indication that the slamming model significantly affected the 1st mode and the quasi static response fig 18 indicates that stream function wave kinematics with wienke s slamming model have the potential to correctly predict the total response of the structure but generally do not capture the balance between 1st and 2nd mode response this leads to an inaccurate distribution of the stresses along the monopile fig 19 shows the same results as fig 18 for the largest 30 events of part b the conclusions regarding the m lin model and the quasi static and 2nd mode response drawn for part a also apply for part b when it comes to 1st mode response however there is no clear trend of how well the models using the stream function models m sf and m sf w capture it for some events they produce conservative results while for others they are non conservative fig 19e shows that the stream function with wienke s model does not give a conservative estimate of the total response of the structure when the 1st mode response is underestimated this underestimation can in some cases be compensated by an overestimation of the 2nd mode response using the slamming model but the physics of the process of maximum response are not correctly captured 5 3 analysis of the models in this part we try to explain the discrepancies observed between the models and the experimental data in the following we define the wave steepness as the steepness of the highest third of the wave equal to h 3 c t 1 3 where h 3 and t 1 3 are defined in fig 20 and c is the wave celerity taken equal to the stream function wave celerity for simulated waves and estimated with the nonlinear dispersion relationship for measured waves 5 3 1 stream function ringing response here we assess how the frequency content of the excitation affects the 1st mode response we evaluate the energy content of the modal excitation force for mode 1 obtained from equation 4 at the 1st eigenfrequency by calculating the cwt and taking its maximum along the 1st eigenfrequency of the structure indicated by a red dot in fig 16 from fig 21 to fig 26 the data points correspond to the events analysed in section 5 1 fig 21 shows the correlation between the energy content of the modal excitation force at the 1st eigenfrequency which has been normalized against its maximum value and the maximum value of the simulated 1st mode response this is different from previous figures where the contribution of the 1st mode response at the instant where the total maximum was reached was shown as expected there is a strong correlation between these parameters fig 22 shows the correlation of the stream function wave steepness and the energy content of the excitation force at the 1st eigenfrequency waves get steeper as the influence of higher harmonics gets larger therefore steeper waves have a higher energy content at high frequencies the eigenfrequency of the structure 0 29 hz corresponds to harmonics between 3 and 5 for the considered waves this explains why steeper waves produce excitation forces with larger energy content at 0 29 hz as can be seen in fig 22 in figs 21 and 22 the black line is obtained from a linear regression of the data the r2 coefficient is given in the caption fig 23 shows that there is no clear correlation between the measured wave steepness and 1st mode response fig 24 shows the same for a different definition of the wave steepness wave height over wavelength this suggests that the reason why the stream function model does not consistently capture 1st mode response is because it produces a response proportional to the wave steepness which does not correspond to what is observed in the experiments 5 3 2 slamming model 2nd mode response by definition the amplitude of the slamming load is proportional to the wave elevation times the wave celerity squared see wienke and oumeraci 2005 the impulse of the slamming load is proportional to its amplitude and classical structure dynamics see for example biggs 1964 shows that increasing impulse produces an increased response of the structure this explains the linear trend in the correlation between the simulated 2nd mode response and the wave elevation times the wave celerity squared seen in fig 25 as in the analysis of 1st mode response in section 5 3 1 the trend in the simulations does not correspond to what can be observed from the experiments fig 26 shows no apparent trend between the measured 2nd mode response and the wave elevation times the celerity squared this can be due to i physical phenomena not considered in the theory such as air entrapment asymmetry of the load imperfections on the surface ii an inaccurate estimation of the wave celerity and iii an inaccurate representation of the shape of the impact load by the slamming model given by equation 8 a detailed analysis of the effect of the shape of the slamming load is beyond the scope of this paper but classical structure dynamics biggs 1964 shows that the response of a structure to a transient load depends on the shape of the load it should be noted that the impulse could not be obtained from measurements with the given experimental setup 5 4 discussion on damping the damping of the 1st and 2nd mode was 1 1 of the critical damping research done by bachynski and moan 2014 and schløer et al 2016 suggests that damping is not critical for the maximum response but more relevant for fatigue damage this agrees with the numerical simulations reported in marino et al 2013b where it can be seen at an event level that the maximum bending moments at the tower bottom are not generally smaller in power production mode which implies larger damping compared to idling conditions however suja thauvin et al 2016 pointed out that for very lightly damped systems the 1st mode response produced by a ringing event will not decay quickly so a new event may produce 1st mode response on top of these free decay oscillations potentially increasing the maximum if the oscillations from the two events occur in phase bachynski et al 2017 explored this issue further and showed that at a statistical level increased damping would decrease the extreme bending moment at the tower bottom the present experimental set up did not enable variation of the system damping it was thus impossible to assess whether for a very lightly damped structure the response to non linear loading might be somewhat hidden by the large responses at the 1st eigenmode indeed if an event a induces a 1st mode response in the structure and that response has not dampened out by the time a later event b occurs it will be challenging to assess the contribution of each event to the 1st mode response the question of whether low damping decreases the sensitivity of the system to non linearities is left for further studies 6 conclusion experimental data of a monopile offshore wind turbine subjected to severe irregular waves has been compared to the numerical models suggested by typical standards used in the offshore wind industry namely dnv os j101 2014 dnv rp c205 2014a iec 61400 3 2009 the experimental campaign at marin consisted of a fully flexible monopile offshore wind turbine in finite water depth and subjected to extreme irregular sea states the model was built so that its dimensions its 1st and 2nd eigenfrequencies and 1st mode shape fit those of a full scale 4 mw wind turbine during the experimental campaign uls conditions were found to be the design driver for the given structure de ridder et al 2017 so this paper attempts to reproduce the characteristic response for uls design commonly referred to as the 50 year response both statistical and event based comparisons were considered several limitations to the present work should be noted this analysis is based on experimental data from a limited number of sea state realizations at 1 30 6 scale with the inherent limitations and uncertainties associated with wave generation and small scale testing in addition due to the experimental set up only one combination of 1st and 2nd eigenfrequencies was analysed as rotor size increases ho et al 2016 the mass and moment of inertia on top of the tower may increase at different rates thus changing the ratio of 1st to 2nd eigenfrequency this could potentially change the relative contributions of the 1st and 2nd mode responses to the total response and therefore modify figs 18e and 19e furthermore the wave elevation measured during the experiments is inherently nonlinear and had to be linearized to be a valid input to the hydrodynamic load models see appendix a the 3rd and 4th modes of the structure were also disregarded in this study and might be relevant when assessing maximum responses finally we did not consider memory effects i e the fact that the response to previous events influences the response to a given wave peng et al 2013 showed that it is possible to get larger responses from wave groups than from individual regular waves with the same characteristics as the largest wave of the group in order to determine the 50 year response the standards suggest simulating the response of the structure over 20 realizations of the 50 year sea state with the 50 year wave randomly embedded the 50 year wave kinematics are determined using the stream function and the hydrodynamic loads are computed with the morison equation during the experiments large responses were provoked by steep and breaking waves so wienke s slamming model see wienke and oumeraci 2005 was added on top of the morison loads the numerical model gave a conservative estimate of the 50 year response for the largest sea states studied in this paper but underpredicted the 50 year response for the milder sea states the events which produced a large response in the experiments were analysed individually and the measured and simulated responses were decomposed into contributions around the 1st and 2nd eigenfrequencies of the structure the results suggest that the numerical model does not correctly predict the relative contributions of the 1st and 2nd mode response to the total response in particular it was found that the quasi static response was in general accurately estimated by linear as well as non linear wave kinematic models the morison equation with stream function wave kinematics inconsistently predicted ringing response transient 1st mode response the amplitude of the simulated response was roughly proportional to the wave steepness but this correlation was not found in the experimentally measured response the 2nd mode of the structure was only excited by the slamming model this is consistent with the findings of suja thauvin et al 2017 who show that during the experiments 2nd mode response was triggered by waves breaking at the structure however according to the theory the amplitude of the 2nd mode response is proportional to the wave elevation times the celerity squared which was not observed in the experimental data overall the numerical model with morison s equation stream function wave kinematics and a slamming model conservatively estimated the total maximum response on 3 out of 21 events for part a and 14 out of 30 events for part b for all events where the total response was overestimated the 2nd mode response was also overestimated but there was no clear trend for the 1st mode response these findings imply that even in a situation where the models give a conservative estimate of the 50 year response the balance between 1st and 2nd mode response might not be realistic and the stress distribution along the monopile can be inaccurate it should be noted that in this paper the models were implemented to reproduce experimental data in order to allow an event based comparison in the estimation of 50 year response of offshore wind turbines rather than using experimental data the industry typically has access to metocean data to estimate the relevant extreme conditions in order to select a relevant 50 year return wave in section 4 1 1 based on iec 61400 3 2009 we assumed both rayleigh and battjes and groenendijk distributions for the wave heights for a 3 h sea state in addition several parameters required careful selection in order to provide

savannah river national laboratory siemens sirris owi lab statkraft statoil stx van oord vattenfall and volker infradesign bv appendix a wave linearization a1 filtering difference frequency waves are first removed from the measured signal using a simple high pass filter the difference frequency waves are far from the linear waves in the red circle in figure 27a making the filtering process straightforward next some of the higher order waves are removed by using a low pass filter we assume that 3rd and higher order waves have energy at frequencies that are higher than the linear wave and will therefore simply be removed by the low pass filter however removing second order sum frequency waves is more complicated because some of these waves have frequencies that lie within the range of linear waves if the cut off frequency is too low one might lose information from the linear waves on the other hand if the cut off frequency is too high part of the higher order waves will remain the explanation of how this cut off frequency is selected is given in appendix a2 once the high pass and low pass filters have been applied we obtain the initial approximation ζ i n i t 1 for the linear wave red curve in figure 27b in this initial approximation difference frequency waves have been removed but the sum frequency waves whose frequencies lie within the linear waves remain this unwanted energy is removed as follows a second order wave yellow curve in figure 27c is estimated from the initial approximation of the linear wave newman 1996 9 ζ 1 2 1 g 1 2 u 2 w 2 ζ i n i t 1 w t with g the gravitational acceleration u and w the horizontal and vertical water particle velocities respectively and with subscript indicating differentiation we then want to remove this second order wave from ζ i n i t 1 however part of ζ 1 2 is higher than the cut off frequency the region to the right of the black dotted line in figure 27c and will introduce higher frequencies into the linear wave if simply substracted therefore ζ 1 2 is first filtered in the same way as the measured wave elevation the result of this filtering is the yellow curve in figure 27d and then substracted from ζ i n i t 1 we then obtain the second approximation of the linear wave 10 ζ 2 1 ζ i n i t 1 ζ 1 2 equation 9 used to calculate ζ 1 2 requires a linear wave elevation as input however ζ i n i t 1 contains second order wave energy that was not removed by the initial filtering process as explained above this introduces an error in the second order wave ζ 1 2 and therefore in the linear wave ζ 2 1 in order to reduce this error we use ζ 2 1 to calculate a new estimation of the second order wave using equation 9 with ζ 2 1 instead of ζ i n i t 1 we then obtain ζ 2 2 we iterate this process and compare ζ i 1 1 and ζ i 1 at each step when the maximum of the difference is below a certain threshold set to h s 100 for the present study we consider that the process has converged and we use the obtained linear wave as input for the numerical models the flow chart in figure 28 describes the iterative process explained above in this flow chart the numbers of the figures illustrating the concepts are also given fig 27 spectra of the wave elevation during filtering process fig 27 a2 selection of the cut off frequency as stated above the selection of the cut off frequency for the low pass filter is not straight forward it is specified in the standard dnv rp c205 2014a that if second order loads are to be calculated from a linear wave time series a low pass filter should be applied with the following cut off frequency 11 ω d n v 2 g h s this cut off frequency developed for deep water has to be applied because some kinematic terms used in non linear hydrodynamic models can become unphysically large at the tail of the commonly used wave spectra see johannessen 2008 for intermediate water conditions the inherent non linear behaviour of the waves implies that a lower cut off frequency than the one presented in equation 11 has to be used the unwanted high frequency energy is filtered out by use of a butterworth filter this filter is defined by two parameters the cut off frequency and the order of the filter higher order meaning a sharper cut at the cut off frequency suja thauvin and krokstad 2016 varied these two parameters and a reconstructed linear wave was calculated for sea states of different severity it was found that a 4th order butterworth filter with a cut off frequency ω c u t o f f 0 8 ω d n v gives the most accurate results however as pointed out by johannessen 2011 the results are sensitive to the cut off frequency selected a careful assessment of the filter has to be carried out in order to get accurate results the linearization of the measured wave elevation introduces uncertainties into the estimation of the input to the hydrodynamic models but these do not affect the computation of the loads that determine the 50 year response in the present study for the stream function theory the wave height is taken from the unfiltered measured wave elevation and the period from the linear wave is practically the same as for the measured wave the kinematics of the stream function are only dependent on those two parameters and the water depth and therefore independent of the linearization process wienke s slamming model is only dependent on the wave elevation and the celerity of the wave which depends on the stream function its ability to trigger 1st or 2nd mode motion is therefore not dependent on the linearization process fig 28 flow chart for the linearization process fig 28 
23176,dynamic response of offshore structures can be influenced due to the water structure interaction the water structure interaction can be simply represented by added mass in earthquake response analysis the added mass for a circular cylinder can be obtained by analytical method however the added mass for an arbitrary shape of structure is rather difficult to be solved by analytical method in this study a substructure method for analysis of the seismic response of an arbitrary shape of structure is presented the finite element technique incorporating the exact artificial boundary condition presented for simulating the far field of the infinite water is applied to the evaluation of added mass for offshore structures where the exact added mass matrix is fully populated and symmetrical the structure is idealized as a three dimensional finite element model system firstly the presented method is to investigate the seismic response of circular tapered cylinder vibrating in water secondly a lumped added mass matrix is adopted to replace the exact added mass matrix thirdly a simplified formula is presented to evaluate the added mass of the circular tapered cylinder keywords circular tapered cylinder finite element hydrodynamic pressure simplified formula substructure 1 introduction offshore and coastal structures such as stock tanks intake towers bridge piers and offshore wind turbines may be subjected to great hydrodynamic pressures during severe earthquakes it has been demonstrated that the earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressures may have a significant influence on the dynamic response of the structures liaw and chopra 1974 interaction with water also modifies dynamic properties of the structures han and xu 1996 the experiment conducted by wei et al 2013 also indicated that water structure interaction had significant effects on the dynamic response of bridge pile foundations submerged in water therefore it is necessary to study the earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressures for the seismic design of the offshore and coastal structures many researchers have investigated earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure on a circular cylinder liaw and chopra 1974 initially investigated the significance of hydrodynamic pressure on the dynamic response of cantilever circular cylinders the authors discovered that water compressibility was negligible for slender cylinders if the water is incompressible the seismic hydrodynamic pressure is equal to a product of the constant mass of water and the acceleration of cylinder dynamic responses of circular cylinders subjected to horizontal ground excitation were also studied by williams 1986 and tanaka and hudspeth 1988 a simple formula for evaluating the natural frequencies of a flexible circular cylinder vibrating in water was presented by han and xu 1996 then chen 1997 presented a finite difference scheme to solve nonlinear hydrodynamic pressures acting on a circular cylinder recently a series of simplified formulas for evaluating the earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure on a circular cylinder were developed li and yang 2013 presented an improved method of hydrodynamic pressure calculation for circular hollow cylinders yang and li 2013 proposed the expanded morison equation to calculate the hydrodynamic force of hollow circular piers caused by inner water du et al 2014 proposed a simplified formula of hydrodynamic pressure on rigid circular cylinders considering water compressibility in the time domain wei et al 2015 developed simplified methods for efficient seismic design and analysis of water surrounded composite axisymmetric structures with uniform circular cross section for outside façade jiang et al 2017 developed a simplified formula for the hydrodynamic pressure on a circular cylinder where the main parameters were radius of the cylinder and water height in addition liao 1985 and williams 1987 investigated the hydrodynamic interactions between submerged circular cylinders however only a few studies were conducted to investigate the earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure on axisymmetric structures for an arbitrary shape of structure the earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure is rather difficult to be obtained by an analytical method liaw and chopra 1975 utilized the finite element method to compute the earthquake response of axisymmetric intake towers surrounded by water based on the use of a complete and non singular set of trefftz function sun and nogami 1991 presented a semi analytical and semi numerical approach to evaluate the hydrodynamic pressure on axisymmetric offshore structures park et al 1991 adopted the finite element technique incorporating the infinite element to evaluate the hydrodynamic pressure on offshore structures avilés and li 2001 studied the effect of the seabed flexibility on hydrodynamic pressures on axisymmetric offshore structures the substructure method is a preferable approach for analysis of structures interaction with water tsai and lee 1991 which is to consider the structure water system as composed of two substructures namely the structure and the body of water this technique avoids direct analysis of the large water structure system firstly a substructure model is developed for the earthquake response analysis of circular tapered cylinders in section 2 where the hydrodynamic terms that are the product of added mass matrix and the acceleration of the cylinder are determined by finite element analysis of the fluid system secondly a simplified model for the added mass matrix is proposed in section 3 thirdly the simplified formula for the hydrodynamic pressures acting on circular tapered cylinders is presented by curve fitting method in section 4 it should be noted that the present work can be simplified as a cylinder oscillatory in water large amount of studies has been conducted to investigate a circular cylinder oscillatory in water sarpkaya 1986 2002 meneghini and bearman 1995 and iliadis and anagnostopoulos 1998 comparing with the present work the work conducted by sarpkay corresponds to much smaller diameter condition however the present model cannot be used to predict the conditions tested by sarpkaya because the viscous of the fluid is ignored in the present study in the future work we will improve the present model to investigate the cylinder oscillatory in viscous fluid 2 substructure model of water cylinder system a circular tapered cylinder surrounded by water is shown in fig 1 which extends from the sea bottom to above the surface along the z axis the cylinder whose axis line is coinciding with the z axis is treated as a three dimensional structure and the height of the cylinder is h the water depth is h the foundation is assumed be rigid and the earthquake excitation is assumed to propagate along the x direction the water cylinder interaction system is initially at rest as shown in fig 2 to model the fluid domain efficiently the whole fluid domain is divided into two subdomains the near field ω1 surrounding the cylinder with the outer cylindrical boundary surface at finite distance r γ c from the origin and far field ω2 outside of ω1 2 1 equations of motion of cylinder substructure for the case of dynamic analysis of the water cylinder system the cylinder substructure can be discretized by using the fem in this study an eight node hexahedral element is adopted to discrete the three dimensional cylinder chandrupatla and belegundu 2012 thus the dynamic equations of motion is given by 1 m u t c u t k u t m u g t f t where u t is the vector of nodal point displacements relative to the ground u t is the vector of nodal point velocities relative to the ground u t is the vector of nodal point acceleration relative to the ground m c and k are the symmetrical mass damping and stiffness matrices for the cylinder structure respectively f t is the vector of hydrodynamic forces acting on the cylinder surface arising from the hydrodynamic pressure of the water and u g t is the acceleration of the ground motion 2 2 finite element model for the near field of the water assuming water incompressible and inviscid the hydrodynamic pressure distribution is governed by the laplacian equation in cartesian coordinate system the governed equation is expressed as 2 2 p x 2 2 p y 2 2 p z 2 0 in which p x y z t is the hydrodynamic pressure and x y z are cartesian coordinates the hydrodynamic pressure distributions can be obtained by solving eq 2 with the following boundary conditions and zero initial conditions 1 surface at the floor of the water 3 p z z 0 0 2 surface at the free surface of the water with neglecting the surface wave effect 4 p z h 0 3 surface at the interface of the water and cylinder 5 p n r a ρ u cos n x 4 the initial conditions are 6 p t 0 0 a n d p t t 0 0 where n is the vector normal to the surface of the cylinder u is the acceleration of the cylinder and ρ is the density of water using the fem to the near field of the water domain the discretized formulation for eq 2 can be expressed in the matrix form as follows 7 h p t d t in which h i j h i j e and d i j d i e t it should be noted that the water domain is also discretized with eight node hexahedral elements the coefficients h i j e and d i e for an eight node hexahedral element are 8 h i j e v e n i x n j x n i y n j y n i z n j z d v 9 d i e t s e n i p n d s where v e and s e mean the domain and interface of the water and cylinder and n i is the shape function 2 3 artificial boundary

obtained in this study the artificial boundary condition is discretized with four node quadrilateral elements chandrupatla and belegundu 2012 the impedance matrix of the water extending to infinity is then added to the discretized formulation of the near field eq 17 by matching the finite element nodes of the near field with node surface of the far field at their interface the resulting equation

nodes alone the interface of the cylinder and water domain s1 are identified by subscript 1 the remaining nodes are identified by subscript 2 and h b is the impedance matric of the far field which can be formulated as 27 h b w m 1 m t m t m t s m w where w is the shape function matrix t m is the cylinder vector of the values of the mth mode on artificial boundary nodes and the superscript t denotes the matrix transpose the hydrodynamic pressure vectors p 1 p 2 and p 3 can be obtained by solving the dynamic equation of eq 26 the results can be expressed as 28 p 1 p 2 p 3 h 11 h 12 h 13 h 21 h 22

cos n x d s u 1 t m 1 u 1 t therefore the hydrodynamic pressure vectors p 1 alone the interface of the cylinder and water domain can be written as 30 p 1 ρ g 11 m 1 u 1 t where u 1 t u t u g t the

and the acceleration of the cylinder however the added mass matrix is fully populated which is difficult to be implemented by modifying the mass matrices because the commercial software is a black box for most of the commercial software there is no interface to directly modify the mass matrix however mass blocks can be added on the nodes of the structure by mass elements for most of the commercial software that is to say a lumped added mass matrix can easy to be implemented in the commercial software 3 1 lumped added mass matrix a lumped added mass matrix is presented to represent the fully populated matrix the fully populated matrix m p and the lumped matrix m g are written as 39 m p m 1 1 m 1 2 m 1 l 1 m 1 l m 2 1 m 2 2 m 2 l 1 m 2 l m l 1 1 m l 1 2 m l 1 l 1 m l 1 l m l 1 m l 2 m l l 1 m l l 40 m g m 1 0 0 0 0 0 m 2 0 0 0 0 m l 1 0 0 0 0 m l in which m i j m j i m i m i 1 m i 2 m i l 1 m i l and l is the number of nodes on the cylinder surface the flexible circular cylinders are used to verify the proposed method of lumped added mass matrix the horizontal displacement of the ground motion of the rigid bedrock is considered as an impulse which is a finite difference approximation of dirac delta function described by zhao et al 2011 the impulse load is shown in fig 4 the depth of the water is h 40 m and its mass density and wave velocity are ρ 1000 kg m3 and c 1438 m s respectively the flexible cylinder has the elasticity modulus 30 gpa the poisson s ratio 0 2 the mass density 2500 kg m3 and the height 40 m in addition material damping is not considered in this section fig 5 a and b shows the comparison of the displacement on top of the circular cylinder between the fully added mass matrix and the lumped added mass matrix in the case of a 0 8 m and a 0 20 m it can be seen that the peak value computed by method of lumped added mass matrix is basically in an agreement with the result computed by method of fully added mass matrix however the period of the displacement computed by method of lumped added mass matrix is larger than the result computed by method of fully added mass matrix 3 2 modified lumped added mass matrix the earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressures on the cylinder contains two parts namely the hydrodynamic pressures caused by rigid motion of the ground and flexible motion of the cylinder the effects of surrounding water on the dynamic properties of the cylinder are due to the hydrodynamic pressures caused by flexible motion of the cylinder therefore a correction factor α is used to modify the lumped added mass matrix due to the flexible motion of the cylinder thus dynamic equation of eq 33 is rewritten as 41 m α m p u t c u t k u t m m p u g t the correction factor α for a flexible cylinder is obtained by using the iteration operation the implementation process is stated as follows firstly the initial value of the correction factor is determined by 1 dt t where dt and t are defined as shown in fig 5a secondly the iteration operation is conducted and the convergent condition is defined as dt t 0 01 the correction factors α for the circular tapered cylinder with different slope angles are shown in fig 6 fig 7 a and b shows the comparison of the displacement on top of the circular cylinder between the fully added mass matrix and the modified lumped added mass matrix in the case of a 0 8 m and a 0 20 m fig 8 a and b shows the comparison of the displacement on top of the circular tapered cylinder between the fully added mass matrix and the modified lumped added mass matrix in the case of a 0 8 m and a 0 20 m with θ 0 80 it can be seen that the modified lumped added mass method has a good agreement with the exact method 4 simplified formula for the added mass of the circular tapered cylinder actually the lumped added mass matrix can be directly obtained from the hydrodynamic pressure on the rigid cylinder for an axisymmetric cylinder the hydrodynamic pressure can be expressed as avilés and li 2001 42 p r θ z m a z cos θ u g where m a z denotes the added mass per unit of the cylinder fig 9 shows the added mass m a z of the circular tapered cylinder in order to provide convenience for engineering application it is extremely necessary to give the simplified formula for the added mass of the circular tapered cylinder in this section the simplified formula for the added mass of the circular tapered cylinder is proposed by elaborate data fitting a dimensionless parameter namely width depth ratio l 2 a 0 h is introduced it should be noted that the proposed simplified formula in this study is in the range of 0 2 l 2 in the range of 75 θ 0 90 it is found that added mass m a z can be well simplified as 43 m a z ρ a 0 a a 0 d 1 1 z h e d 2 z h 1 in which d 1 and d 2 for a circular tapered cylinder are obtained by the curve fitting toolbox in matlab attaway 2013 in this study parameters d 1 and d 2 can be further fitted as simple mathematical formulas which are the

fig 11 shows the comparison of eq 46 with the fitting data in eq 45 fig 12 shows the comparison of eq 48 with the fitting data in eq 47 fig 13 shows the comparison of eqs 49 and 51 with the fitting data in eq 44 fig 14 shows the comparison of eq 50 with the fitting data in eq 49 and fig 15 shows the comparison of eq 52 with the fitting data in eq 51 it can be seen that the there is a good agreement between the fitting formulas and the fitting data fig 16 presents the comparison of the added mass per unit of the cylinder obtained by the simplified formula sim and the presented finite

tapered cylinder finite element hydrodynamic pressure simplified formula substructure 1 introduction offshore and coastal structures such as stock tanks intake towers bridge piers and offshore wind turbines may be subjected to great hydrodynamic pressures during severe earthquakes it has been demonstrated that the earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressures may have a significant influence on the dynamic response of the structures liaw and chopra 1974 interaction with water also modifies dynamic properties of the structures han and xu 1996 the experiment conducted by wei et al 2013 also indicated that water structure interaction had significant effects on the dynamic response of bridge pile foundations submerged in water therefore it is necessary to study the earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressures for the seismic design of the offshore and coastal structures many researchers have investigated earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure on a circular cylinder liaw and chopra 1974 initially investigated the significance of hydrodynamic pressure on the dynamic response of cantilever circular cylinders the authors discovered that water compressibility was negligible for slender cylinders if the water is incompressible the seismic hydrodynamic pressure is equal to a product of the constant mass of water and the acceleration of cylinder dynamic responses of circular cylinders subjected to horizontal ground excitation were also studied by williams 1986 and tanaka and hudspeth 1988 a simple formula for evaluating the natural frequencies of a flexible circular cylinder vibrating in water was presented by han and xu 1996 then chen 1997 presented a finite difference scheme to solve nonlinear hydrodynamic pressures acting on a circular cylinder recently a series of simplified formulas for evaluating the earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure on a circular cylinder were developed li and yang 2013 presented an improved method of hydrodynamic pressure calculation for circular hollow cylinders yang and li 2013 proposed the expanded morison equation to calculate the hydrodynamic force of hollow circular piers caused by inner water du et al 2014 proposed a simplified formula of hydrodynamic pressure on rigid circular cylinders considering water compressibility in the time domain wei et al 2015 developed simplified methods for efficient seismic design and analysis of water surrounded composite axisymmetric structures with uniform circular cross section for outside façade jiang et al 2017 developed a simplified formula for the hydrodynamic pressure on a circular cylinder where the main parameters were radius of the cylinder and water height in addition liao 1985 and williams 1987 investigated the hydrodynamic interactions between submerged circular cylinders however only a few studies were conducted to investigate the earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure on axisymmetric structures for an arbitrary shape of structure the earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure is rather difficult to be obtained by an analytical method liaw and chopra 1975 utilized the finite element method to compute the earthquake response of axisymmetric intake towers surrounded by water based on the use of a complete and non singular set of trefftz function sun and nogami 1991 presented a semi analytical and semi numerical approach to evaluate the hydrodynamic pressure on axisymmetric offshore structures park et al 1991 adopted the finite element technique incorporating the infinite element to evaluate the hydrodynamic pressure on offshore structures avilés and li 2001 studied the effect of the seabed flexibility on hydrodynamic pressures on axisymmetric offshore structures the substructure method is a preferable approach for analysis of structures interaction with water tsai and lee 1991 which is to consider the structure water system as composed of two substructures namely the structure and the body of water this technique avoids direct analysis of the large water structure system firstly a substructure model is developed for the earthquake response analysis of circular tapered cylinders in section 2 where the hydrodynamic terms that are the product of added mass matrix and the acceleration of the cylinder are determined by finite element analysis of the fluid system secondly a simplified model for the added mass matrix is proposed in section 3 thirdly the simplified formula for the hydrodynamic pressures acting on circular tapered cylinders is presented by curve fitting method in section 4 it should be noted that the present work can be simplified as a cylinder oscillatory in water large amount of studies has been conducted to investigate a circular cylinder oscillatory in water sarpkaya 1986 2002 meneghini and bearman 1995 and iliadis and anagnostopoulos 1998 comparing with the present work the work conducted by sarpkay corresponds to much smaller diameter condition however the present model cannot be used to predict the conditions tested by sarpkaya because the viscous of the fluid is ignored in the present study in the future work we will improve the present model to investigate the cylinder oscillatory in viscous fluid 2 substructure model of water cylinder system a circular tapered cylinder surrounded by water is shown in fig 1 which extends from the sea bottom to above the surface along the z axis the cylinder whose axis line is coinciding with the z axis is treated as a three dimensional structure and the height of the cylinder is h the water depth is h the foundation is assumed be rigid and the earthquake excitation is assumed to propagate along the x direction the water cylinder interaction system is initially at rest as shown in fig 2 to model the

and the acceleration of the cylinder however the added mass matrix is fully populated which is difficult to be implemented by modifying the mass matrices because the commercial software is a black box for most of the commercial software there is no interface to directly modify the mass matrix however mass blocks can be added on the nodes of the structure by mass elements for most of the commercial software that is to say a lumped added mass matrix can easy to be implemented in the commercial software 3 1 lumped added mass matrix a lumped added mass matrix is presented to represent the fully populated matrix the fully populated matrix m p and the lumped matrix m g are written as 39 m p m 1 1 m 1 2 m 1 l 1 m 1 l m 2 1 m 2 2 m 2 l 1 m 2 l m l 1 1 m l 1 2 m l 1 l 1 m l 1 l m l 1 m l 2 m l l 1 m l l 40 m g m 1 0 0 0 0 0 m 2 0 0 0 0 m l 1 0 0 0 0 m l in which m i j m j i m i m i 1 m i 2 m i l 1 m i l and l is the number of nodes on the cylinder surface the flexible circular cylinders are used to verify the proposed method of lumped added mass matrix the horizontal displacement of the ground motion of the rigid bedrock is considered as an impulse which is a finite difference approximation of dirac delta function described by zhao et al 2011 the impulse load is shown in fig 4 the depth of the water is h 40 m and its mass density and wave velocity are ρ 1000 kg m3 and c 1438 m s respectively the flexible cylinder has the elasticity modulus 30 gpa the poisson s ratio 0 2 the mass density 2500 kg m3 and the height 40 m in addition material damping is not considered in this section fig 5 a and b shows the comparison of the displacement on top of the circular cylinder between the fully added mass matrix and the lumped added mass matrix in the case of a 0 8 m and a 0 20 m it can be seen that the peak value computed by method of lumped added mass matrix is basically in an agreement with the result computed by method of fully added mass matrix however the period of the displacement computed by method of lumped added mass matrix is larger than the result computed by method of fully added mass matrix 3 2 modified lumped added mass matrix the earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressures on the cylinder contains two parts namely the hydrodynamic pressures caused by rigid motion of the ground and flexible motion of the cylinder the effects of surrounding water on the dynamic properties of the cylinder are due to the hydrodynamic pressures caused by flexible motion of the cylinder therefore a correction factor α is used to modify the lumped added mass matrix due to the flexible motion of the cylinder thus dynamic equation of eq 33 is rewritten as 41 m α m p u t c u t k u t m m p u g t the correction factor α for a flexible cylinder is obtained by using the iteration operation the implementation process is stated as follows firstly the initial value of the correction factor is determined by 1 dt t where dt and t are defined as shown in fig 5a secondly the iteration operation is conducted and the convergent condition is defined as dt t 0 01 the correction factors α for the circular tapered cylinder with different slope angles are shown in fig 6 fig 7 a and b shows the comparison of the displacement on top of the circular cylinder between the fully added mass matrix and the modified lumped added mass matrix in the case of a 0 8 m and a 0 20 m fig 8 a and b shows the comparison of the displacement on top of the circular tapered cylinder between the fully added mass matrix and the modified lumped added mass matrix in the case of a 0 8 m and a 0 20 m with θ 0 80 it can be seen that the modified lumped added mass method has a good agreement with the exact method 4 simplified formula for the added mass of the circular tapered cylinder actually the lumped added mass matrix can be directly obtained from the hydrodynamic pressure on the rigid cylinder for an axisymmetric cylinder the hydrodynamic pressure can be expressed as avilés and li 2001 42 p r θ z m a z cos θ u g where m a z denotes the added mass per unit of the cylinder fig 9 shows the added mass m a z of the circular tapered cylinder in order to provide convenience for engineering application it is extremely necessary to give the simplified formula for the added mass of the circular tapered cylinder in this section the simplified formula for the added mass of the circular tapered cylinder is proposed by elaborate data fitting a dimensionless parameter namely width depth ratio l 2 a 0 h is introduced it should be noted that the proposed simplified formula in this study is in the range of 0 2 l 2 in the range of 75 θ 0 90 it is found that added mass m a z can be well simplified as 43 m a z ρ a 0 a a 0 d 1 1 z h e d 2 z h 1 in which d 1 and d 2 for a circular tapered cylinder are obtained by the curve fitting toolbox in matlab attaway 2013 in this study parameters d 1 and d 2 can be further fitted as simple mathematical formulas which are the functions depend on variables l and θ 0 by fitting the corresponding data in eq 43 in the range of 45 θ 0 75 it is found that added mass m a z can be well simplified as 44 m a z ρ a 0 d 3 1 z h 2 d 4 1 z h in which d 3 and d 4 are obtained by the curve fitting parameters d 3 and d 4 can be further fitted as simple mathematical formulas which are the functions depend on variables l and θ 0 by fitting the corresponding data in eq 44 the coefficient d 1 in eq 43 is simplified as 45 d 1 p 1 l p 2 p 3 46a p 1 0 887 σ 2 1 625 σ 0 0125 46b p 2 3 607 σ 2 8 951 σ 5 879 46c p 3 0 277 σ 2 0 607 σ 0

eq 44 is simplified as 49 d 3 p 4 l p 5 p 6 50a p 4 0 249 σ 6 14 1 265 50b p 5 0 177 σ 4 088 0 955 50c p 6 0 0861 σ 9 251 0 0412 and the coefficient d 4 is simplified as 51 d 4 q 4 e q 5 l q 6 e q 7 l

fig 11 shows the comparison of eq 46 with the fitting data in eq 45 fig 12 shows the comparison of eq 48 with the fitting data in eq 47 fig 13 shows the comparison of eqs 49 and 51 with the fitting data in eq 44 fig 14 shows the comparison of eq 50 with the fitting data in eq 49 and fig 15 shows the comparison of eq 52 with the fitting data in eq 51 it can be seen that the there is a good agreement between the fitting formulas and the fitting data fig 16 presents the comparison of the added mass per unit of the cylinder obtained by the simplified formula sim and the presented finite element model fem it can be seen that the simplified formulas agree well with the numerical solutions furthermore the added mass coefficient is used to verify the accuracy of the present simplified formula the error between analytical solution and simplified formula is defined as 53 error m f e m m s i m m f e m 100 in which m f e m denotes the total added mass obtained by numerical solution and m s i m denotes the total added mass by simplified formula the error at the range of 45 θ 0 90 is shown in fig 17 it can be seen that the error of the present simplified formulas is less than 10 percent which satisfy the engineering precision demand it should be noted that the applicable range of the simplified formula proposed in this study is 0 2 l 2 and 45 θ 0 90 in that range higher

23177,underwater explosives that left in ports and harbors during world war ii which may not be inspected in reconnaissance surveys could threat submerged pipelines seriously this paper developed a three dimensional numerical model for dynamic response of pipelines induced by underwater explosion both fsi fluid structure interaction and psi pipeline seabed interaction are taken into consideration simultaneously in current research the proposed integrated model has been validated against experiment data available in previous literature it has been found that the pipeline laid on the seabed tends to roll away from detonation rather than to deform in the pipeline section the semi buried pipeline is the most vulnerable due to combined action of reloading effect and trench constraint based on the numerical results shallow buried installation is an effective method to enhance the anti blast ability of submerged pipelines the stress level of the pipeline increases slightly due to enhancement of the surrounding soil for shallow buried pipelines while the integral lateral displacement and element pressure decrease with increase of burial depth keywords underwater explosion pipeline response fluid structure interaction pipeline seabed interaction 1 introduction marine pipelines are designed to bear various types of load like waves currents and seismic load due to complex marine environment underwater mines and explosives that are left in harbor ports and many other shipping routes after world war ii may pose a threat to marine structures resistance design of submerged pipelines to accidental load is also crucial for production and transportation of offshore oil in the whole service life cycle of pipelines because the accidental load like underwater explosion can lead to fatal damage to submerged pipelines many explosion experiments have been carried out to investigate dynamic response of marine structures subjected to underwater explosion kira et al 1999 conducted experiments to study underwater explosion of spherical explosives by processing photographs and validate attenuation of the underwater blast wave rajendran and narasimhan 2001 carried out underwater explosion experiments to investigate contact blast response of clamped circular plates it was highlighted that the cylindrical shell structure was deformed as a joint result of primary shock and the bubble pulsation based on a small scaled underwater explosion experiment hung et al 2009 a critical distance of 10 times the radius of the charge to cylindrical shells was identified based on the small scaled underwater explosion conducted by li and rong 2012 however the small scaled experiments of underwater explosion is incapable to simulate complete response of marine structures to blast loads moreover most of the experiments focused on blast response of structures suspending in the water without consideration of psi an analytical model of dynamic response of metal tubed subjected to explosion was proposed based on blast experiments song et al 2014 to forecast deformation distribution of cylindrical structures based on the experimental result and theoretical derivation zong and lam 2000a b proposed an analytical model to calculate plastic strain and flexural deformation of a submarine pipeline to bubble pulsation kouretzis et al 2007 derived analytical solution to strain response of flexible buried pipelines due to surface point blast in which pipeline strains resulted subjected to p and rayleigh wave were calculated separately the empirical formulas derived from explosion experiments are only capable to solving some specific engineering problems with many simplifications massive energy is released by explosive detonation the primary shock wave takes away more than half of the total energy while the left is conveyed by the following bubble pulsation keil 1961 the pressure stimulated by bubble pulsation is relatively lower only 10 20 that of primary shock but is more effective for structure deformation due to long duration li and rong 2012 the destructive power of bubble pulsation to surface ships was highlighted by numerical results zhang et al 2008 2011 while effect of bubble pulsation is much smaller for the cylindrical structure below explosion hung et al 2009 the peak pressure stimulated by bubble pulsation reaches about 15 the peak pressure of primary load for the sensor located 38 times the charge radius laterally li and rong 2012 therefore bubble pulsation which is also a kind of reloading will also affects the submerged pipeline in the near field of underwater explosion since explosion experiments are hazardous to carried out except high cost numerical methods turned out to be an excellent alternative to investigate blast response of submerged pipelines gong et al 2000 adopted the coupled finite element and boundary element codes to assess submerged pipelines exposed to far field underwater explosion neglecting the psi lam et al 2003 have investigated the dynamic response of a laminated pipeline simply supported on the rigid seabed subjected to far field underwater explosion effect of bubble pulsation and psi are certainly neglected in the above researches since reloading takes place as the water head above the charge is greater than half the stand off and the seabed is treated as a rigid boundary a structural integrity assessment of a pipeline subjected to underwater explosion was established by monti et al 2011 however psi was dismissed van den abeele and verleysen 2013 simulates blast response of subsea pipelines suspending in the water and bubble pulsation is also neglected though bubble energy is not significant for the pipeline at the same depth of underwater explosion in total many numerical simulations of underwater explosion have been carried out to investigate dynamic response of submerged pipelines to blast loads based on fsi method however the seabed is simplified as a rigid boundary in the previous studies and effect of bubble pulsation is generally neglected actually the blast wave propagating in the marine sediments also affects blast response of the submerged pipelines dynamic response of the pipelines due to underwater explosion will be underestimated neglecting interaction of seabed and pipelines in this study a comprehensive hydro mechanical model is proposed to investigate dynamic response of submerged pipelines subjected to underwater explosion in the proposed model fsi and psi are studied simultaneously and effect of bubble pulsation is taken into consideration based on numerical technique primary theory model parameters and numerical methods are introduced in the second section section 3 presents the validation procedure of the prototype model according to experimental data from previous research in section 4 a comprehensive study of dynamic response of submerged pipelines subjected to underwater explosion is carried out after sensitivity analysis of mesh size effect various motion patterns deformation distributions and stress distributions of pipelines are presented due to various installation methods 2 material models and methodologies 2 1 equations of state 2 1 1 the eos for explosives in this study the tnt explosive is modeled via the jones wilkins lee jwl equation of state eos in which the pressure p is defined as a function of the relative volume v and the initial energy per volume e by an exponential function form as follow ls dyna 2007 1 p c 1 1 ω r 1 v e r 1 v c 2 1 ω r 2 v e r 2 v ω e v where c 1 c 2 r 1 r 2 ω are material constants defined by experiments and tnt and eos parameters adopted in this paper are listed in table 1 2 1 2 the eos for seawater the gruneisen eos is adopted to simulate seawater for its excellent performance on handling the propagation of blast waves triggered by underwater explosion by incorporating a non linear shock velocity and particle velocity relationship cavitation phenomena after underwater explosion can also be captured with gruneisen eos when simulating fluids under tension and compression with cubic shock velocity u s particle velocity u p the gruneisen eos defines pressure for fluids under compression as souli 2004 2 p ρ 0 c 2 μ 1 1 γ 0 2 μ a 2 μ 2 1 s 1 1 μ s 2 μ 2 μ 1 s 3 μ 3 μ 1 2 2 γ 0 a μ e and

c 2 c 3 c 4 c 5 and c 6 are constants and μ ρ ρ 0 1 where ρ ρ 0 is the ratio of current density to initial density the parameters adopted for ideal gas are listed in table 3 2 2 soil model dynamic response of marine sediment is very complex to predict due to the interaction of soil particles and pore water an appropriate soil model is crucial for accuracy and rationality of simulation the mat 147 model developed by federal highway administration fhwa is adopted in this study lewis 2004 reid et al 2004 in the fhwa model effects of strain softening strain rate kinematic hardening and excess pore water have been taken into account moreover the model has been adopted to simulate dynamic response of soil under blast loads in previous studies lee 2006 jayasinghe et al 2013a b saleh and edwards 2015 the fhwa model is developed based on mohr coulomb criterion which is utilized to simulate behavior of soil widely for its high efficiency and concise format moreover a smooth hyperbolic surface which is taken as below was adopted to remedy numerical problems caused by the singularity at the intersection of the yield surface and pressure axis as shown in fig 1 5 f p sin φ j 2 k θ 2 a 2 sin 2 φ cos φ where a is a parameter for determining how close the modified surface is fitted to the standard mohr coulomb yield surface p is pressure and φ is the internal friction angle k θ is the function of the angle θ in the deviatoric plane c is cohesion j 2 is the second invariant of the stress deviator the strain rate effect is realized as an interpolation between the inviscid stress and elastic trial stress by the two parameter devaut lions visco plastic update algorithm the inviscid stress is presented as 6 σ v p 1 ς σ σ t r a i l where ς 1 δ t η 1 and η γ ε n 1 n the parameters λ is a viscosity parameter and n is viscosity exponent the value of the two parameters are 1 10 4 and 2 respectively the parameters adopted in this paper are based on marine sediments on the yangtze river estuary region as listed in table 4 major component of marine sediment is saturated soft muddy clay the average density is about 1 95 g cm3 special gravity is 2 75 no unit and moisture content is about 0 35 since there is a close relation between the soil strength and loading rate the strength parameters could be underestimated seriously using laboratory result the bulk modulus and shear modulus adopted in this paper is determined by the calculation formula of wave and test result other parameters adopted in this paper refer to existing studies mentioned in the previous section 2 3 constitutive model of pipelines plastic deformation of shells could be induced by blast waves in some scaled test hung et al 2009 song et al 2014 the strain rate effect is crucial for accuracy since underwater explosion is a typical non linear load an elasto visco plastic model with arbitrary strain rate dependency is adopted to simulate dynamic response of submerged pipelines for strain rate effect the cowper and symonds model cowper and symonds 1957 was utilized to calculate the dynamic yield stress σ d y as presented below 7 σ d y σ y 1 ε d 1 n where σ y is the static yield stress d and n represent strain rate parameters of the model ε is the strain rate which is calculated by ε ε i j ε i j the material parameters adopted for steel pipelines referred to hung et al 2009 as listed in table 5 2 4 methodology for fsi and contact algorithm 2 4 1 fsi methodology effect of fluid structure interaction fsi was discussed within an arbitrary lagrange euler ale framework by subramaniam et al 2009 in which structural velocity was proved to have great influence on numerical results when considering fsi it has also been highlighted that the fsi effect is more significant especially when the incident velocity of the blast wave is much larger than the structural velocity bubble dynamics produced by an underwater explosion is studied based on ale method barras et al 2012 which is also adopted to consider effect of bubble pulsation load transmission between seawater and pipelines is simulated based on penalty coupling algorithm in this paper the kinematic mechanism on the interface of seawater and the pipeline is presented as follow 8 p n f ρ f u n f 0 where p is the interface pressure n f is the exterior normal of the fluid interface ρ f is the fluid density and u is the acceleration vector the dynamic condition on the seawater pipeline interface is as follows 9 σ i j n s j τ i j n f j τ i j n s j where σ i j is the cauchy stress tensor τ i j is the fluid stress tensor and n is the exterior normal of the seawater pipeline interface 2 4 2 contact methodology a symmetric penalty based contact algorithm hallquist 2013 between seabed and the pipeline was adopted in the present study interface stiffness is set to be the same order as the stiffness of the marine sediment for numerical stability in the present model seabed surface is set as the master surface and will be inspected whether it has been penetrated by the element nodes of the pipeline slave surface the contact force in the interface of seabed and the pipeline is calculated by 10 f k δ where k is interface stiffness determined by mesh size and material characteristics and δ is the value of penetration in the present model fsi and psi are taken into consideration simultaneously the u p approximation is incorporated into ls dyna to consider pore water effect in the marine sediment meanwhile pore pressure in the seabed has been initialized to guarantee the numerical continuity between hydraulic pressure in the flow field and pore pressure in the seabed furthermore the objective of this paper is to present various motion pattern and stress state of the submerged pipeline with various burial depth due to underwater explosion the schematic diagram numerical calculation of dynamic response of submerged pipelines subjected to underwater explosion is presented in fig 2 3 model validation this section presents three verification procedures for the present model including validation of underground explosion underwater explosion and fsi 3 1 validation of underground explosion scholars have carried out a series of explosion underwater and underground to study explosion theory the valuable test data from the previous experiments were summarized in the army design manual tm 5 855 1 fundamentals of protective design for conventional weapons tm 5 855 1 1986 in order to validate the proposed model as described in section 2 2 1 a validation procedure of the present model is carried out against test data from the manual the verification model of underground explosion is presented in fig 3 a in the standard underground explosion experiment the explosive is buried at 2 5 m below the ground surface and the gauging points are installed at the same depth it has been found that the saturation degree of porous media can affect propagation of blast waves greatly wang et al 2004 blast energy attenuates slowest in the fully saturated soil leong et al 2007 yankelevsky et al 2011 which will pose a greater threat to marine structures compared with those in unsaturated soil accordingly the marine sediment is treated as fully saturated soil in this study two cases with various tnt equivalent were calculated to accomplish the validation procedure attenuation of peak pressure from 10 kg tnt case green line and 30 kg tnt case blue line are presented in fig 3b the attenuation curves coincide with the empirical formula basically though the numerical results have underestimated peak values at the gauging points slightly considering the limited output interval such deviation could be accepted moreover propagation velocity of blast wave ranges from 1000 m s to 1450 m s in fully saturated soil shim 1997 the average value of wave velocity calculated by numerical results from gauging points is about 1110 m s which is reasonable with finite output 3 2 validation of underwater explosion blast wave attenuates exponentially in the water the similar validation procedure is carried out to verified attenuation of peak pressure with test data from kira et al 1999 the verification model of underwater explosion and the comparison results are presented in fig 4 the detonation zone is modeled with a very fine mesh and gradient mesh modeling is adopted for the far field zone propagation velocity of underwater blast wave is greater than underground blast wave while blast wave attenuates slower in the water moreover the average value of wave velocity calculated by numerical results from gauging points is about 1531 m s which is a little greater than the underwater acoustic velocity mentioned in rajendran and narasimhan 2006 since propagation velocity of blast wave is greater than acoustic velocity within 10 times the charge radius such numerical result is acceptable generally the comparison of numerical results with field tests proves the capability of the hydro mechanical model and accuracy of adopted parameters a comprehensive investigation of dynamic response of submerged pipelines subjected to underwater explosion will be carried out in the next part based on the present model and parameters described in section 2 3 3 validation of fsi method fluid structure interaction is a very complex physical process fsi takes place when submerged pipelines are deformed by blast waves which alters the fluid flow as well in this paper the fsi method is validated against the test data and the numerical results from li and rong 2012 the validated model for fsi is presented in fig 5 four numerical cases with various tnt equivalent and stand off distance were carried out to verify the dynamic response of the aluminous cylinder subjected to underwater explosion the stand off distances are 200 mm 300 mm 350 mm and 400 mm corresponding to tnt explosive of 167 g 176 g 181 g and 176 g respectively as illustrated in fig 5 numerical results from the present model coincide with data from li and rong 2012 generally displacement of point a is essentially greater than test data while the displacement of point b presents a higher similarity with test data discrepancy in the 200 mm case for point a may result from neglecting cavitation loading in the solving procedure what s more the propagation velocity of blast waves is much larger than seismic velocity within 10 times the explosive radius rajendran and narasimhan 2006 which may reduce action time of explosive power displacement of point b in the case with 350 mm stand off distance is a little larger with more tnt generally the calculation results coincide with test data more with a larger stand off distance fsi of submerged pipelines and seawater will be simulated in this manuscript based on the method described in section 2 4 4 results and discussion submerged pipelines have been constructed substantially with a great development of offshore industry however the pipelines carrying crude oil could be damaged potentially by an accidental underwater explosion as there may be many explosives or mines left in the harbors and ports since world war ii an unexploded mine has already been found near submarine oil pipelines in the southeast asia waters zong et al 1999 the research topic in this study is motivated by the potential threat to pipelines caused by unexploded explosive in this section the numerical model and sensitivity analysis are introduced firstly then motion of seawater subjected to blast load is presented based on ale algorithm a comprehensive investigation of dynamic response of submerged pipelines is carried out motion pattern deformation distribution stress distribution and the time series of element stress are analyzed for the pipeline with various burial depth eventually the dynamic response mechanism of submerged pipeline is analyzed 4 1 model description the present model is illustrated in fig 6 in the prototype model 30 kg tnt is installed on the seabed surface and depth of water and air is set to 4 m and 9 m respectively water head above the explosive must be greater than half the stand off distance for reloading to occur rajendran and narasimhan 2006 hence the pipeline is installed at 8 m away from the charge horizontally to investigate blast response of the pipeline at a critical distance the one point multi material ale solver is initiated for the seabed in the vicinity of the underwater explosion and the region mentioned before for its ability to treat large deformation the constant stress solid formulation is used for the far field zone to calculate propagation of the blast wave in the seabed eventually the coupled ale lagrangian approach was utilized to simulate reloading effect and address the large deformation problem without sacrifice of efficiency and accuracy fig 7 presents gauging points for the resultant displacement of the pipeline and gauging elements for circumferential distribution of stress and deformation of the pipeline section 4 2 sensitivity analysis of mesh size reasonable mesh size is required for acceptable computational efficiency and accuracy of the attenuation of predicted peak pressure wang et al 2016 li et al 2018 therefore sensitivity analysis of mesh size is carried out in this section free field explosion is simulated to investigate the effect of mesh size on propagation of the blast wave induced by spherical explosive the explosive weighs 30 kg and detonates at centroid various mesh sizes are adopted in this section i e 15 cm 20 cm 25 cm 30 cm 35 cm 40 cm due to the research objective and limitation of computational capability the monitoring region is set from 2 m to 18 m the 3d analytical model is set to 10 m 10 m x 20 m in the sensitivity analysis effects of mesh size on wave propagation in both water and marine sediment are investigated as shown in fig 8 generally blast pressure attenuates exponentially with distance it can be found that calculated peak pressure gets larger with finer mesh although peak values at various stand off distances may be smaller than the true value considering limited output intervals it can be concluded that the mesh size has significant effects on the numerical results especially in the vicinity of detonation considering peak pressure attenuation of underwater explosion and underground explosion the verification model with mesh size less than 25 cm is able to provide reasonable decay curves finally the 20 cm mesh is adopted in the detonation region to ensure numerical accuracy and gradient mesh is utilized to enhance calculation efficiency 4 3 motion of water jets due to underwater explosion the explosive is detonated at the interface between water and seabed highly compressed explosion gas generates due to a sudden energy release of tnt along with a stimulated shock wave as shown in fig 9 a crater is produced by underwater explosion with a radius of 0 6 m and the maximum radius of the gas cavity is about 5 1 m in the x y plane in addition the seawater above the detonation region is pushed up by the rapid expansion of explosion product the water jet gets thinner as being upraised higher and splits at 400 ms 4 4 dynamic response of submerged pipeline in the cross section dynamic response of pipelines with various burial depths have been analyzed in this section submerged pipelines are generally laid on the seabed semi buried or shallow buried motion patterns and deformation of pipelines due to underwater explosion are presented in fig 10 the underwater explosive is detonated on the seabed 8 m away from the pipeline seabed surface is upraised by the extrusion effect of compressed soil in the vicinity of detonation the feature points are set in the section of pipelines at 0 90 180 and 270 it can be seen that the pipeline laid on the seabed tends to roll away from the explosion without obvious deformation in the pipeline section however excess rolling movement could lead to a rapid increase of axial force of the pipeline the semi buried pipeline moves along with the surrounding soil first and then the upper part of the structure is deformed by the interaction of high velocity flow and the pipeline results from the semi buried model indicate the reloading effect rajendran 2008 in the underwater explosion the reloading effect comprises of cavitation loading and bubble pulsation while the former one could be dismissed compared with the primary shock it can be seen that plastic deformation generates further from the existing deformation due to the primary shock while the pipeline laid on the seabed could sustain both the primary shock and bubble pulsation breezily moreover the shallow buried pipeline is only affected by propagation of blast wave in the seabed instead of bubble pulsation effect among the three typical installation conditions the shallow buried pipeline presents the least deformation and displacement subjected to underwater explosion circumferential distribution of element pressure in the pipeline section is presented in fig 11 the compression zone distributes in the segment from point a to point d in the pipeline laid on the seabed the second load due to reloading effect reached the pipeline at 150 ms after the primary shock however the plastic deformation is barely generated as for semi buried pipelines large deformation appeared in the element segment from point a to point d pipeline segments buried in the trench towards the explosion are in compressive stress state mostly and the tensile region generates along with plastic deformation in this case the plastic deformation has already taken place during the primary shock and the permanent deformation expanded rapidly by the following bubble pulsation effect the rapid transition of stress state due to reloading effect contributes to the severe deformation in the semi buried pipeline as well afterwards the evolution paths of the circumferential distribution of element pressure are similar for the shallow buried pipeline with various burial depths pipeline segments around point a stay in compression state while elements around point c are in tension first and then turns into the compression state due to passive earth pressure eventually the maximum tensile stress takes place around point b and point d element stress in the pipeline sections reduces with a deeper burial depth and it can be found that the shallowly buried pipelines are barely affected by the bubble pulsation the time series of gauging elements in the pipeline section are presented in fig 12 stress level of the pipeline laid on the seabed is relatively small due to mobility and deformability of seawater and the pipeline tends to be pushed away further due to reloading effect rather than being deformed in the cross section point b turns to the explosion subsequently and point d will be transmitted into the tensile region with rolling movement of the pipeline the time series of point a in the semi buried pipeline highlights the reloading effect arising from bubble pulsation and there is a rapid vibration of stress state in the semi buried pipeline section pipeline elements around point d are in tension and compression alternatively which may induce severe deformation in surrounding area due to the combined effect of fsi and psi pipeline section from point a to point d is deformed severely along with rapidly changing stress state obviously stress state in the shallow buried pipeline seems to be more stable and durable the shallow buried pipelines tend to be lifted and pushed away from the explosion the hemisphere sides towards the explosion sustain compressive stress yet the opposite side is in tension persistently the stress level will be decreased with the pipeline burial depth variation of peak pressure with various burial depths is presented in fig 13 peak pressure of point a increases at first and then decreases with burial depth for the pipeline laid on the seabed and semi buried pipeline which are exposed to seawater directly peak pressure of point a is decreased due to mobility and deformability of seawater however the region near point a of the shallow buried pipeline presents a higher stress level while the bottom region of the semi buried pipeline presents the highest stress level due to the combined effect of fsi and psi and the pipeline segments from point c to point d are in tension mostly for the pipelines in all cases furthermore the shallow buried installation contributes to a higher stress level for the pipeline section due to surrounding constraints and continuous movements of the pipeline and surrounding soil generally it can be deduced that the stress level of point a increases with surrounding constraints and decreases with burial depth variation of peak displacement with various burial depth is presented in fig 14 peak displacement of the gauging points is decreased with burial depth since the pipeline is protected by the embedded soil from a direct impact of the underwater blast wave effect of bubble pulsation will also be minimized at the same time however the top region of semi buried pipeline presents the greatest deformation for this region has reached the plastic phases and the pipeline segment between point a and point d has been deformed severely as shown in fig 10 overall the pipeline installed without enough constrains from surrounding soil will suffer rapidly changing stress state and severe deformation in the pipeline segment exposed to seawater due to near field underwater explosion 4 5 dynamic response of submerged pipeline in axial direction stress contours of pipelines with various burial depths are presented in fig 15 for the pipeline laid on the seabed as presented in fig 15a the pipeline segment towards the explosion is in oval compression region all along with an oval shape while the half side away from the explosion sustains tension in the whole process the durable force in the front side leads to rolling movement of the pipeline fig 15b presents the stress contours of the semi buried pipeline that tends to be pulled away from the trench at first then a severe compression deformation takes place in the upper section due to reloading effect and horizontal restraint from the seabed and the front view of the semi buried pipeline presents a symmetric distribution of the compression region and tension region alternatively in general once the pipeline segment is deformed by the primary shock of underwater explosion severe deformation and rapid vibration of stress state will be generated due to bubble pulsation stress contours of shallow buried pipelines with various burial depths is shown in fig 15c and d the stress level of the shallow buried model is larger than that installed on the seabed due to constraints and continuous passive deformation of the surrounding soil yet smaller than that of semi buried model because the pipelines are protected by the overburden soil from direct impact of underwater blast wave the final distribution of element stress varies with various burial depths the stress distribution from the case with 1 5 m burial depth is in a crescent shape however the stress distribution from the case with 2 5 m burial depth presents a fallen x shape the various shapes of compressive zone arises from the various incident angles of blast wave which results in moving up of the main stressed area simultaneously fig 16 presents the distribution of the maximum resultant displacement of pipelines with various burial depths along the axial direction i e the y direction the displacement of gauging points in the pipeline laid on the seabed is the largest for continuous scrolling which does not reach steady state by computing termination the shallow buried installation of the pipeline could reduce the displacement of the pipeline obviously and the integral displacement decreases with burial depth as for the semi buried pipeline two crests generated on the left and right sides of the pipeline centroid it can be figured out that the crest region is deformed by tension as shown in fig 15 the constructive power of bubble pulsation is magnified by the combined effect of psi and fsi in addition the tensile regions are right next to the compressive zone in which compressive force could increase the potential tensile failure of the material in the tensile zone therefore the semi buried pipeline would be damaged more severely compared with other installation methods it has been revealed that a deeper burial depth within marine sediment can enhance the resistance of the pipeline to periodic load like wave and current zhao et al 2014 meanwhile protective effect of shallow buried installation presents diminishing marginal effect of burial depth and shallow buried installation also matters for the structural resistance of submerged pipelines to underwater explosions 5 conclusion a comprehensive numerical model is proposed to investigate dynamic response of submerged pipelines subjected to underwater explosion fsi and psi are taken into consideration simultaneously a coupled ale lagrangian algorithm is utilized to address large deformation in the vicinity of the detonation and to simulate propagation of the blast wave in both marine sediment and seawater the numerical model adopted in this paper was validated against available test data in the literature dynamic responses of submerged pipelines with various burial depth have been investigated by the present model various motion patterns stress states and deformed diagrams of the pipelines were analyzed based on the numerical results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the present model in this paper is validated against experiment data from previous researches an appropriate mesh size was determined by the sensitivity analysis of mesh size propagation of the blast wave in the porous media is more sensitive than that in seawater the 20 cm mesh was utilized to simulate the detonation region 2 the pipeline laid on the seabed tends to roll away from the explosion the pipeline barely deformed in the cross section plane due to high fluidity and deformability of seawater considering the great length of submerged pipelines excessive horizontal displacement could lead to an enormous axial force in the pipeline the compressive region locates at the half side toward the explosion while the tensile zone is on the other side and the pipeline is barely deformed by bubble pulsation 3 the semi buried pipeline would be damaged seriously by underwater explosion the pipeline tends to roll out of the trench and severe deformation takes place in the upper side of the pipeline due to reloading effect resulting from bubble pulsation and the complex loading process a symmetric distribution of the compression region and tensile region which are generated alternatively is presented with the front view of the semi buried pipeline the maximum deformation takes place at the left and right sides of the compression zone simultaneously 4 shallow buried installation could enhance resistance of submerged pipelines to accidental load dynamic response would be reduced due to constraint of surrounding soil the shallow buried pipelines will be upraised and shoved by the blast wave moreover bubble pulsation does not affect the pipeline with buried installation significantly generally it s better to employ shallow buried installation for the submerged pipelines on account of lower resistance for pipelines laid on the seabed and semi buried pipelines the integrity assessment of the pipelines subjected underwater explosion could be carried out by the present model 5 structural strength in the radial direction is relatively weaker compared with that in the longitudinal and circumferential direction evolution of the stress region and extension of the plastic zone are presented in this paper variation of peak pressure and displacement in gauging points is illustrated by various embedment depths severe deformation expands rapidly due to bubble pulsation when plastic ranges have taken place during the primary shock moreover effect of bubble pulsation could be magnified for the pipeline in the interface of water and seabed the numerical results intend to be helpful in pipeline design and manufacture acknowledgements the authors are grateful for the financial support from the national natural science foundation of

23177,underwater explosives that left in ports and harbors during world war ii which may not be inspected in reconnaissance surveys could threat submerged pipelines seriously this paper developed a three dimensional numerical model for dynamic response of pipelines induced by underwater explosion both fsi fluid structure interaction and psi pipeline seabed interaction are taken into consideration simultaneously in current research the proposed integrated model has been validated against experiment data available in previous literature it has been found that the pipeline laid on the seabed tends to roll away from detonation rather than to deform in the pipeline section the semi buried pipeline is the most vulnerable due to combined action of reloading effect and trench constraint based on the numerical results shallow buried installation is an effective method to enhance the anti blast ability of submerged pipelines the stress level of the pipeline increases slightly due to enhancement of the surrounding soil for shallow buried pipelines while the integral lateral displacement and element pressure decrease with increase of burial depth keywords underwater explosion pipeline response fluid structure interaction pipeline seabed interaction 1 introduction marine pipelines are designed to bear various types of load like waves currents and seismic load due to complex marine environment underwater mines and explosives that are left in harbor ports and many other shipping routes after world war ii may pose a threat to marine structures resistance design of submerged pipelines to accidental load is also crucial for production and transportation of offshore oil in the whole service life cycle of pipelines because the accidental load like underwater explosion can lead to fatal damage to submerged pipelines many explosion experiments have been carried out to investigate dynamic response of marine structures subjected to underwater explosion kira et al 1999 conducted experiments to study underwater explosion of spherical explosives by processing photographs and validate attenuation of the underwater blast wave rajendran and narasimhan 2001 carried out underwater explosion experiments to investigate contact blast response of clamped circular plates it was highlighted that the cylindrical shell structure was deformed as a joint result of primary shock and the bubble pulsation based on a small scaled underwater explosion experiment hung et al 2009 a critical distance of 10 times the radius of the charge to cylindrical shells was identified based on the small scaled underwater explosion conducted by li and rong 2012 however the small scaled experiments of underwater explosion is incapable to simulate complete response of marine structures to blast loads moreover most of the experiments focused on blast response of structures suspending in the water without consideration of psi an analytical model of dynamic response of metal tubed subjected to explosion was proposed based on blast experiments song et al 2014 to forecast deformation distribution of cylindrical structures based on the experimental result and theoretical derivation zong and lam 2000a b proposed an analytical model to calculate plastic strain and flexural deformation of a submarine pipeline to bubble pulsation kouretzis et al 2007 derived analytical solution to strain response of flexible buried pipelines due to surface point blast in which pipeline strains resulted subjected to p and rayleigh wave were calculated separately the empirical formulas derived from explosion experiments are only capable to solving some specific engineering problems with many simplifications massive energy is released by explosive detonation the primary shock wave takes away more than half of the total energy while the left is conveyed by the following bubble pulsation keil 1961 the pressure stimulated by bubble pulsation is relatively lower only 10 20 that of primary shock but is more effective for structure deformation due to long duration li and rong 2012 the destructive power of bubble pulsation to surface ships was highlighted by numerical results zhang et al 2008 2011 while effect of bubble pulsation is much smaller for the cylindrical structure below explosion hung et al 2009 the peak pressure stimulated by bubble pulsation reaches about 15 the peak pressure of primary load for the sensor located 38 times the charge radius laterally li and rong 2012 therefore bubble pulsation which is also a kind of reloading will also affects the submerged pipeline in the near field of underwater explosion since explosion experiments are hazardous to carried out except high cost numerical methods turned out to be an excellent alternative to investigate blast response of submerged pipelines gong et al 2000 adopted the coupled finite element and boundary element codes to assess submerged pipelines exposed to far field underwater explosion neglecting the psi lam et al 2003 have investigated the dynamic response of a laminated pipeline simply supported on the rigid seabed subjected to far field underwater explosion effect of bubble pulsation and psi are certainly neglected in the above researches since reloading takes place as the water head above the charge is greater than half the stand off and the seabed is treated as a rigid boundary a structural integrity assessment of a pipeline subjected to underwater explosion was established by monti et al 2011 however psi was dismissed van den abeele and verleysen 2013 simulates blast response of subsea pipelines suspending in the water and bubble pulsation is also neglected though bubble energy is not significant for the pipeline at the same depth of underwater explosion in total many numerical simulations of underwater explosion have been carried out to investigate dynamic response of submerged pipelines to blast loads based on fsi method however the seabed is simplified as a rigid boundary in the previous studies and effect of bubble pulsation is generally neglected actually the blast wave propagating in the marine sediments also affects blast response of the submerged pipelines dynamic response of the pipelines due to underwater explosion will be underestimated neglecting interaction of seabed and pipelines in this study a comprehensive hydro mechanical model is proposed to investigate dynamic response of submerged pipelines subjected to underwater explosion in the proposed model fsi and psi are studied simultaneously and effect of bubble pulsation is taken into consideration based on numerical technique primary theory model parameters and numerical methods are introduced in the second section section 3 presents the validation procedure of the prototype model according to experimental data from previous research in section 4 a comprehensive study of dynamic response of submerged pipelines subjected to underwater explosion is carried out after sensitivity analysis of mesh size effect various motion patterns deformation distributions and stress distributions of pipelines are presented due to various installation methods 2 material models and methodologies 2 1 equations of state 2 1 1 the eos for explosives in this study the tnt explosive is modeled via the jones wilkins lee jwl equation of state

gruneisen eos is adopted to simulate seawater for its excellent performance on handling the propagation of blast waves triggered by underwater explosion by incorporating a non linear shock velocity

response of marine sediment is very complex to predict due to the interaction of soil particles and pore water an appropriate soil model is crucial for accuracy and rationality of simulation the mat 147 model developed by federal highway administration fhwa is adopted in this study lewis 2004 reid et al 2004 in the fhwa model effects of strain softening strain rate kinematic hardening and excess pore water have been taken into account moreover the model has been adopted to simulate dynamic response of soil under blast loads in previous studies lee 2006 jayasinghe et al 2013a b saleh and edwards 2015 the fhwa model is developed based on mohr coulomb criterion which is utilized to simulate behavior of soil widely for its high efficiency and concise format moreover a smooth hyperbolic

2 sin 2 φ cos φ where a is a parameter for determining how close the modified surface is fitted to the standard mohr coulomb yield surface p is pressure and φ is the internal friction angle k θ is the function of the angle θ in the deviatoric plane c is cohesion j 2 is the second invariant of the stress deviator the strain rate effect is realized as an interpolation between the inviscid stress and elastic trial stress by the two parameter devaut lions visco plastic update algorithm the inviscid stress is presented as 6 σ v p 1 ς σ σ t r a i l where ς 1 δ t η 1 and η γ ε n 1 n the parameters λ is a viscosity parameter and n is viscosity exponent the value of the two parameters are 1 10 4 and 2 respectively the parameters adopted in this paper are based on marine sediments on the yangtze river estuary region as listed in table 4 major component of marine sediment is saturated soft muddy clay the average density is about 1 95 g cm3 special gravity is 2 75 no unit and moisture content is about 0 35 since there is a close relation between the soil strength and loading rate the strength parameters could be underestimated seriously using laboratory result the bulk modulus and shear modulus adopted in this paper is determined by the calculation formula of wave and test result other parameters adopted in this paper refer to existing studies mentioned in the previous section 2 3 constitutive model of pipelines plastic deformation of shells could be induced by blast waves in some scaled test hung et al 2009 song et al 2014 the strain rate effect is crucial for accuracy since underwater explosion is a typical non linear load an elasto visco plastic model with arbitrary strain rate dependency is adopted to simulate dynamic response of submerged pipelines for strain rate effect the cowper and symonds model cowper and symonds 1957 was utilized to calculate the dynamic yield stress σ d y as presented below 7 σ d y σ y 1 ε d 1 n where σ y is the static yield stress d and n represent strain rate parameters of the model ε is the strain rate which is calculated by ε ε i j ε i j the material parameters adopted for steel pipelines referred to hung et al 2009 as listed in table 5 2 4 methodology for fsi and contact algorithm 2 4 1 fsi methodology effect of fluid structure interaction fsi was discussed within an arbitrary lagrange euler ale framework by subramaniam et al 2009 in which structural velocity was proved to have great influence on numerical results when considering fsi it has also been highlighted that the fsi effect is more significant especially when the incident velocity of the blast wave is much larger than the structural velocity bubble dynamics produced by an underwater explosion is studied based on ale method barras et al 2012 which is also adopted to consider effect of bubble pulsation load transmission between seawater and pipelines is simulated based on penalty coupling algorithm in this paper the kinematic mechanism on the interface of seawater and the pipeline is presented as follow 8 p n f ρ f u n f 0 where p is the interface pressure n f is the exterior normal of the fluid interface ρ f is the fluid density and u is the acceleration vector the dynamic condition on the seawater pipeline interface is as follows 9 σ i j n s j τ i j n f j τ i j n s j where σ i j is the cauchy stress tensor τ i j is the fluid stress tensor and n is the exterior normal of the seawater pipeline interface 2 4 2 contact methodology a symmetric penalty based contact algorithm hallquist 2013 between seabed and the pipeline was adopted in the present study interface stiffness is set to be the same order as the stiffness of the marine sediment for numerical stability in the present model seabed surface is set as the master surface and will be inspected whether it has been penetrated by the element nodes of the pipeline slave surface the contact force in the interface of seabed and the pipeline is calculated by 10 f k δ where k is interface stiffness determined by mesh size and material characteristics and δ is the value of penetration in the present model fsi and psi are taken into consideration simultaneously the u p approximation is incorporated into ls dyna to consider pore water effect in the marine sediment meanwhile pore pressure in the seabed has been initialized to guarantee the numerical continuity between hydraulic pressure in the flow field and pore pressure in the seabed furthermore the objective of this paper is to present various motion pattern and stress state of the submerged pipeline with various burial depth due to underwater explosion the schematic diagram numerical calculation of dynamic response of submerged pipelines subjected to underwater explosion is presented in fig 2 3 model validation this section presents three verification procedures for the present model including validation of underground explosion underwater explosion and fsi 3 1 validation of underground explosion scholars have carried out a series of explosion underwater and underground to study explosion theory the valuable test data from the previous experiments were summarized in the army design manual tm 5 855 1 fundamentals of protective design for conventional weapons tm 5 855 1 1986 in order to validate the proposed model as described in section 2 2 1 a validation procedure of the present model is carried out against test data from the manual the verification model of underground explosion is presented in fig 3 a in the standard underground explosion experiment the explosive is buried at 2 5 m below the ground surface and the gauging points are installed at the same depth it has been found that the saturation degree of porous media can affect propagation of blast waves greatly wang et al 2004 blast energy attenuates slowest in the fully saturated soil leong et al 2007 yankelevsky et al 2011 which will pose a greater threat to marine structures compared with those in unsaturated soil accordingly the marine sediment is treated as fully saturated soil in this study two cases with various tnt equivalent were calculated to accomplish the validation procedure attenuation of peak pressure from 10 kg tnt case green line and 30 kg tnt case blue line are presented in fig 3b the attenuation curves coincide with the empirical formula basically though the numerical results have underestimated peak values at the gauging points slightly considering the limited output interval such deviation could be accepted moreover propagation velocity of blast wave ranges from 1000 m s to 1450 m s in fully saturated soil shim 1997 the average value of wave velocity calculated by numerical results from gauging points is about 1110 m s which is reasonable with finite output 3 2 validation of underwater explosion blast wave attenuates exponentially in the water the similar validation procedure is carried out to verified attenuation of peak pressure with test data from kira et al 1999 the verification model of underwater explosion and the comparison results are presented in fig 4 the detonation zone is modeled with a very fine mesh and gradient mesh modeling is adopted for the far field zone propagation velocity of underwater blast wave is greater than underground blast wave while blast wave attenuates slower in the water moreover the average value of wave velocity calculated by numerical results from gauging points is about 1531 m s which is a little greater than the underwater acoustic velocity mentioned in rajendran and narasimhan 2006 since propagation velocity of blast wave is greater than acoustic velocity within 10 times the charge radius such numerical result is acceptable generally the comparison of numerical results with field tests proves the capability of the hydro mechanical model and accuracy of adopted parameters a comprehensive investigation of dynamic response of submerged pipelines subjected to underwater explosion will be carried out in the next part based on the present model and parameters described in section 2 3 3 validation of fsi method fluid structure interaction is a very complex physical process fsi takes place when submerged pipelines are deformed by blast waves which alters the fluid flow as well in this paper the fsi method is validated against the test data and the numerical results from li and rong 2012 the validated model for fsi is presented in fig 5 four numerical cases with various tnt equivalent and stand off distance were carried out to verify the dynamic response of the aluminous cylinder subjected to underwater explosion the stand off distances are 200 mm 300 mm 350 mm and 400 mm corresponding to tnt explosive of 167 g 176 g 181 g and 176 g respectively as illustrated in fig 5 numerical results from the present model coincide with data from li and rong 2012 generally displacement of point a is essentially greater than test data while the displacement of point b presents a higher similarity with test data discrepancy in the 200 mm case for point a may result from neglecting cavitation loading in the solving procedure what s more the propagation velocity of blast waves is much larger than seismic velocity within 10 times the explosive radius rajendran and narasimhan 2006 which may reduce action time of explosive power displacement of point b in the case with 350 mm stand off distance is a little larger with more tnt generally the calculation results coincide with test data more with a larger stand off distance fsi of submerged pipelines and seawater will be simulated in this manuscript based on the method described in section 2 4 4 results and discussion submerged pipelines have been constructed substantially with a great development of offshore industry however the pipelines carrying crude oil could be damaged potentially by an accidental underwater explosion as there may be many explosives or mines left in the harbors and ports since world war ii an unexploded mine has already been found near submarine oil pipelines in the southeast asia waters zong et al 1999 the research topic in this study is motivated by the potential threat to pipelines caused by unexploded explosive in this section the numerical model and sensitivity analysis are introduced firstly then motion of seawater subjected to blast load is presented based on ale algorithm a comprehensive investigation of dynamic response of submerged pipelines is carried out motion pattern deformation distribution stress distribution and the time series of element stress are analyzed for the pipeline with various burial depth eventually the dynamic response mechanism of submerged pipeline is analyzed 4 1 model description the present model is illustrated in fig 6 in the prototype model 30 kg tnt is installed on the seabed surface and depth of water and air is set to 4 m and 9 m respectively water head above the explosive must be greater than half the stand off distance for reloading to occur rajendran and narasimhan 2006 hence the pipeline is installed at 8 m away from the charge horizontally to investigate blast response of the pipeline at a critical distance the one point multi material ale solver is initiated for the seabed in the vicinity of the underwater explosion and the region mentioned before for its ability to treat large deformation the constant stress solid formulation is used for the far field zone to calculate propagation of the blast wave in the seabed eventually the coupled ale lagrangian approach was utilized to simulate reloading effect and address the large deformation problem without sacrifice of efficiency and accuracy fig 7 presents gauging points for the resultant displacement of the pipeline and gauging elements for circumferential distribution of stress and deformation of the pipeline section 4 2 sensitivity analysis of mesh size reasonable mesh size is required for acceptable computational efficiency and accuracy of the attenuation of predicted peak pressure wang et al 2016 li et al 2018 therefore sensitivity analysis of mesh size is carried out in this section free field explosion is simulated to investigate the effect of mesh size on propagation of the blast wave induced by spherical explosive the explosive weighs 30 kg and detonates at centroid various mesh sizes are adopted in this section i e 15 cm 20 cm 25 cm 30 cm 35 cm 40 cm due to the research objective and limitation of computational capability the monitoring region is set from 2 m to 18 m the 3d analytical model is set to 10 m 10 m x 20 m in the sensitivity analysis effects of mesh size on wave propagation in both water and marine sediment are investigated as shown in fig 8 generally blast pressure attenuates exponentially with distance it can be found that calculated peak pressure gets larger with finer mesh although peak values at various stand off distances may be smaller than the true value considering limited output intervals it can be concluded that the mesh size has significant effects on the numerical results especially in the vicinity of detonation considering peak pressure attenuation of underwater explosion and underground explosion the verification model with mesh size less than 25 cm is able to provide reasonable decay curves finally the 20 cm mesh is adopted in the detonation region to ensure numerical accuracy and gradient mesh is utilized to enhance calculation efficiency 4 3 motion of water jets due to underwater explosion the explosive is detonated at the interface between water and seabed highly compressed explosion gas generates due to a sudden energy release of tnt along with a stimulated shock wave as shown in fig 9 a crater is produced by underwater explosion with a radius of 0 6 m and the maximum radius of the gas cavity is about 5 1 m in the x y plane in addition the seawater above the detonation region is pushed up by the rapid expansion of explosion product the water jet gets thinner as being upraised higher and splits at 400 ms 4 4 dynamic response of submerged pipeline in the cross section dynamic response of pipelines with various burial depths have been analyzed in this section submerged pipelines are generally laid on the seabed semi buried or shallow buried motion patterns and deformation of pipelines due to underwater explosion are presented in fig 10 the underwater explosive is detonated on the seabed 8 m away from the pipeline seabed surface is upraised by the extrusion effect of compressed soil in the vicinity of detonation the feature points are set in the section of pipelines at 0 90 180 and 270 it can be seen that the pipeline laid on the seabed tends to roll away from the explosion without obvious deformation in the pipeline section however excess rolling movement could lead to a rapid increase of axial force of the pipeline the semi buried pipeline moves along with the surrounding soil first and then the upper part of the structure is deformed by the interaction of high velocity flow and the pipeline results from the semi buried model indicate the reloading effect rajendran 2008 in the underwater explosion the reloading effect comprises of cavitation loading and bubble pulsation while the former one could be dismissed compared with the primary shock it can be seen that plastic deformation generates further from the existing deformation due to the primary shock while the pipeline laid on the seabed could sustain both the primary shock and bubble pulsation breezily moreover the shallow buried pipeline is only affected by propagation of blast wave in the seabed instead of bubble pulsation effect among the three typical installation conditions the shallow buried pipeline presents the least deformation and displacement subjected to underwater explosion circumferential distribution of element pressure in the pipeline section is presented in fig 11 the compression zone distributes in the segment from point a to point d in the pipeline laid on the seabed the second load due to reloading effect reached the pipeline at 150 ms after the primary shock however the plastic deformation is barely generated as for semi buried pipelines large deformation appeared in the element segment from point a to point d pipeline segments buried in the trench towards the explosion are in compressive stress state mostly and the tensile region generates along with plastic deformation in this case the plastic deformation has already taken place during the primary shock and the permanent deformation expanded rapidly by the following bubble pulsation effect the rapid transition of stress state due to reloading effect contributes to the severe deformation in the semi buried pipeline as well afterwards the evolution paths of the circumferential distribution of element pressure are similar for the shallow buried pipeline with various burial depths pipeline segments around point a stay in compression state while elements around point c are in tension first and then turns into the compression state due to passive earth pressure eventually the maximum tensile stress takes place around point b and point d element stress in the pipeline sections reduces with a deeper burial depth and it can be found that the shallowly buried pipelines are barely affected by the bubble pulsation the time series of gauging elements in the pipeline section are presented in fig 12 stress level of the pipeline laid on the seabed is relatively small due to mobility and deformability of seawater and the pipeline tends to be pushed away further due to reloading effect rather than being deformed in the cross section point b turns to the explosion subsequently and point d will be transmitted into the tensile region with rolling movement of the pipeline the time series of point a in the semi buried pipeline highlights the reloading effect arising from bubble pulsation and there is a rapid vibration of stress state in the semi buried pipeline section pipeline elements around point d are in tension and compression alternatively which may induce severe deformation in surrounding area due to the combined effect of fsi and psi pipeline section from point a to point d is deformed severely along with rapidly changing stress state obviously stress state in the shallow buried pipeline seems to be more stable and durable the shallow buried pipelines tend to be lifted and pushed away from the explosion the hemisphere sides towards the explosion sustain compressive stress yet the opposite side is in tension persistently the stress level will be decreased with the pipeline burial depth variation of peak pressure with various burial depths is presented in fig 13 peak pressure of point a increases at first and then decreases with burial depth for the pipeline laid on the seabed and semi buried pipeline which are exposed to seawater directly peak pressure of point a is decreased due to mobility and deformability of seawater however the region near point a of the shallow buried pipeline presents a higher stress level while the bottom region of the semi buried pipeline presents the highest stress level due to the combined effect of fsi and psi and the pipeline segments from point c to point d are in tension mostly for the pipelines in all cases furthermore the shallow buried installation contributes to a higher stress level for the pipeline section due to surrounding constraints and continuous movements of the pipeline and surrounding soil generally it can be deduced that the stress level of point a increases with surrounding constraints and decreases with burial depth variation of peak displacement with various burial depth is presented in fig 14 peak displacement of the gauging points is decreased with burial depth since the pipeline is protected by the embedded soil from a direct impact of the underwater blast wave effect of bubble pulsation will also be minimized at the same time however the top region of semi buried pipeline presents the greatest deformation for this region has reached the plastic phases and the pipeline segment between point a and point d has been deformed severely as shown in fig 10 overall the pipeline installed without enough constrains from surrounding soil will suffer rapidly changing stress state and severe deformation in the pipeline segment exposed to seawater due to near field underwater explosion 4 5 dynamic response of submerged pipeline in axial direction stress contours of pipelines with various burial depths are presented in fig 15 for the pipeline laid on the seabed as presented in fig 15a the pipeline segment towards the explosion is in oval compression region all along with an oval shape while the half side away from the explosion sustains tension in the whole process the durable force in the front side leads to rolling movement of the pipeline fig 15b presents the stress contours of the semi buried pipeline that tends to be pulled away from the trench at first then a severe compression deformation takes place in the upper section due to reloading effect and horizontal restraint from the seabed and the front view of the semi buried pipeline presents a symmetric distribution of the compression region and tension region alternatively in general once the pipeline segment is deformed by the primary shock of underwater explosion severe deformation and rapid vibration of stress state will be generated due to bubble pulsation stress contours of shallow buried pipelines with various burial depths is shown in fig 15c and d the stress level of the shallow buried model is larger than that installed on the seabed due to constraints and continuous passive deformation of the surrounding soil yet smaller than that of semi buried model because the pipelines are protected by the overburden soil from direct impact of underwater blast wave the final distribution of element stress varies with various burial depths the stress distribution from the case with 1 5 m burial depth is in a crescent shape however the stress distribution from the case with 2 5 m burial depth presents a fallen x shape the various shapes of compressive zone arises from the various incident angles of blast wave which results in moving up of the main stressed area simultaneously fig 16 presents the distribution of the maximum resultant displacement of pipelines with various burial depths along the axial direction i e the y direction the displacement of gauging points in the pipeline laid on the seabed is the largest for continuous scrolling which does not reach steady state by computing termination the shallow buried installation of the pipeline could reduce the displacement of the pipeline obviously and the integral displacement decreases with burial depth as for the semi buried pipeline two crests generated on the left and right sides of the pipeline centroid it can be figured out that the crest region is deformed by tension as shown in fig 15 the constructive power of bubble pulsation is magnified by the combined effect of psi and fsi in addition the tensile regions are right next to the compressive zone in which compressive force could increase the potential tensile failure of the material in the tensile zone therefore the semi buried pipeline would be damaged more severely compared with other installation methods it has been revealed that a deeper burial depth within marine sediment can enhance the resistance of the pipeline to periodic load like wave and current zhao et al 2014 meanwhile protective effect of shallow buried installation presents diminishing marginal effect of burial depth and shallow buried installation also matters for the structural resistance of submerged pipelines to underwater explosions 5 conclusion a comprehensive numerical model is proposed to investigate dynamic response of submerged pipelines subjected to underwater explosion fsi and psi are taken into consideration simultaneously a coupled ale lagrangian algorithm is utilized to address large deformation in the vicinity of the detonation and to simulate propagation of the blast wave in both marine sediment and seawater the numerical model adopted in this paper was validated against available test data in the literature dynamic responses of submerged pipelines with various burial depth have been investigated by the present model various motion patterns stress states and deformed diagrams of the pipelines were analyzed based on the numerical results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the present model in this paper is validated against experiment data from previous researches an appropriate mesh size was determined by the sensitivity analysis of mesh size propagation of the blast wave in the porous media is more sensitive than that in seawater the 20 cm mesh was utilized to simulate the detonation region 2 the pipeline laid on the seabed tends to roll away from the explosion the pipeline barely deformed in the cross section plane due to high fluidity and deformability of seawater considering the great length of submerged pipelines excessive horizontal displacement could lead to an enormous axial force in the pipeline the compressive region locates at the half side toward the explosion while the tensile zone is on the other side and the pipeline is barely deformed by bubble pulsation 3 the semi buried pipeline would be damaged seriously by underwater explosion the pipeline tends to roll out of the trench and severe deformation takes place in the upper side of the pipeline due to reloading effect resulting from bubble pulsation and the complex loading process a symmetric distribution of the compression region and tensile region which are generated alternatively is presented with the front view of the semi buried pipeline the maximum deformation takes place at the left and right sides of the compression zone simultaneously 4 shallow buried installation could enhance resistance of submerged pipelines to accidental load dynamic response would be reduced due to constraint of surrounding soil the shallow buried pipelines will be upraised and shoved by the blast wave moreover bubble pulsation does not affect the pipeline with buried installation significantly generally it s better to employ shallow buried installation for the submerged pipelines on account of lower resistance for pipelines laid on the seabed and semi buried pipelines the integrity assessment of the pipelines subjected underwater explosion could be carried out by the present model 5 structural strength in the radial direction is relatively weaker compared with that in the longitudinal and circumferential direction evolution of the stress region and extension of the plastic zone are presented in this paper variation of peak pressure and displacement in gauging points is illustrated by various embedment depths severe deformation expands rapidly due to bubble pulsation when plastic ranges have taken place during the primary shock moreover effect of bubble pulsation could be magnified for the pipeline in the interface of water and

23178,in this study three semi empirical equations are developed to quantify the wave effect on the initial dilution of wastewater discharge which usually forms a turbulent jet to develop the equations data from a non buoyant jet in a wave following current environment which is realised using a three dimensional large eddy simulation model are used with 27 cases in total the effects of the wave to current velocity ratio jet to current velocity ratio and strouhal number are considered in the equations the initial dilution equations which focused on the jet visual area cross sectional minimum dilution and vertical location of the cross sectional minimum dilution have vital relationships with the characteristic length scale the reliability of the present equations is discussed by comparing them with existing equations for a jet in a crossflow only environment the applicability range of the present equations is illustrated by comparing them with data for a jet in a crossflow only environment and data for other cases of a jet in a wave following current environment the three equations provide references for the conceptual design of wastewater discharge this study reveals that a surface wave with low energy has a positive effect on the initial dilution of wastewater discharge keywords semi empirical equation initial dilution jet wave following current 1 introduction wastewater including domestic waste streams and brine from desalination plants is continually discharged into coastal communities such pollutants are potential threats to local marine environmental and ecological systems roberts et al 2010 stark et al 2016a their disposal which usually forms a jet discharge should be managed in a manner that local concentration levels are reduced to the lowest possible extent and the adverse effects are minimised the mixing process of jet is divided into the near field dilution initial dilution hereafter and far field dispersion according to different spatial and temporal scales roberts 1999 choi and lee 2007 because the initial dilution has a major effect on the prediction accuracy it has been studied extensively in the modelling of wastewater transport especially in the last decade zhao et al 2011 muhammetoglu et al 2012 chan et al 2013 local hydrodynamics which is related to the discharge site is one of the primary factors that determine the jet dilution voutchkov 2011 marti et al 2011 purnama and shao 2015 stark et al 2016b in coastal areas tidal currents and surface waves are the dominating hydrodynamic factors previous studies lee and neville jones 1987 yuan et al 1999 muppidi and mahesh 2005 cavar and meyer 2012 have mainly focused on the effects of currents on the initial dilution of wastewater simplified as a turbulent jet in crossflow four largescale coherent structures can be identified from a turbulent jet in crossflow namely jet shear layer vortices horseshoe vortices wake vortices and counter rotating vortex pair cvp kelso et al 1996 among these cvp is a salient feature of the jet which mainly contributes to the deformation and periodic roll up of the shear layer kelso et al 1996 marzouk and ghoniem 2007 because of the existence of the cvp structure the concentration distribution at the downstream cross section follows the pattern shown in fig 1 this pattern indicates that the cross sectional maximum concentration or cross sectional minimum dilution is not located on the centreline the ratio of the cross sectional maximum concentration to the centreline maximum concentration is in the range of 1 0 1 5 with an average value of 1 2 chu 1996 in addition owing to the limitations of experimental measurement the centreline maximum concentration and its location defined as the jet trajectory are usually chosen to represent the characteristic behaviour of dilution lee and chu 2003 summarised the equations developed by different researchers as follows 1 s c 0 d l m 0 c 1 x l m 0 c 2 2 z m 0 l m 0 c 3 x l m 0 c 4 3 l m 0 m 0 1 2 u 0 π 2 d w 0 u 0 π 2 d r j c where s c0 is the centreline minimum dilution z m0 represents the vertical location of the centreline maximum concentration x is the downstream distance from the jet orifice l m0 is the characteristic length scale of the jet in crossflow m 0 is the initial momentum flux u 0 is the crossflow velocity w 0 is the initial velocity of the jet r jc is the jet to current velocity ratio d is the jet diameter and c 1 c 4 are constants the values of c 2 and c 4 are approximately 0 66 and 0 33 respectively whereas the values of c 1 and c 3 are in the ranges of 1 0 1 27 and 1 51 1 77 respectively lee and chu 2003 it should be noted that the above equations are not applicable to cases in which the dilution is very close to the jet orifice x l m0 0 5 based on these equations we can intuitively understand the effect of the current on the initial dilution unlike tidal currents surface waves have temporal scales of several seconds which lead to swaying of the jet trajectory several researchers have investigated the interaction of surface waves with non buoyant jets mossa 2004 xu et al 2014 negatively buoyant jets ferrari and querzoli 2015 and positively buoyant jets chin 1987 hwung et al 1994 lin et al 2013 a consistent conclusion is that the surface waves enhance the interaction between the jet and the ambient water and serves as an additional source of mixing thus the surface wave may have a positive effect on the initial dilution of the jet discharge ryu et al 2005 and hsiao et al 2011 found that the wave to jet momentum or velocity ratio is a key factor that describes jet wave interaction sharp et al 2014 investigated the turbulent buoyant plumes discharged into a wave environment and obtained the average increase in the dilution between wave and no wave cases which is expressed as 4 s 1 s 0 1 6 u w w 0 where s 1 and s 0 are the centreline dilution with waves present and under stagnant conditions respectively and u w is the maximum wave induced horizontal velocity at the jet orifice which is related to the wave height h wave period t and water depth h according to the linear wave theory u w is defined as 5 u w π h t cosh k h 0 sinh k h where k is the wave number and h 0 is the height of the jet orifice the above semi empirical equations for the initial dilution eqs 1 4 only consider current or wave effects and therefore should be modified for discharge sites in wave current environments such as coastal waters relevant studies conducted so far have been limited to the characteristics of the velocity and concentration distribution of a non buoyant jet under the combined effect of waves and current abdel rahman 2004 xia and lam 2004 xu et al 2016 2017 a quantitative analysis of the initial dilution of the jet discharge in a wave current environment is still lacking following the work of xu et al 2017 this study aims to extend the semi empirical equations for crossflow jet dilution to a wave following current environment and quantise the effect of surface waves on jet discharge it should be noted that a wave current environment means that the wave and the current propagate in the same direction considering the complexity of negatively buoyant discharges this study focused on a vertical non buoyant jet we believe that a detailed study of the initial dilution of a non buoyant vertical round jet in a wave current environment would serve as a useful reference for future studies on the corresponding buoyant cases 2 methodology 2 1 dimensional analysis the initial dilution s of a non buoyant vertical round jet in a wave current environment can be expressed in the following functional form 6 s f 1 d w 0 h 0 h h t u 0 the wave force near the jet orifice has a critical influence on the swaying of the jet body and the average dilution hence the maximum wave induced horizontal velocity at the jet orifice position is usually selected as the wave characteristic velocity in previous studies chin 1987 sharp et al 2014 xu et al 2017 in addition the wave frequency ω ω 2π t is another characteristic parameter that can affect the jet initial dilution therefore eq 6 can be expressed as 7 s f 2 d w 0 u w ω u 0 xu et al 2017 expressed eq 7 as follows using three dimensionless parameters 8 s f 3 r j c r w c s t where r wc and st are the wave to current velocity ratio and strouhal number respectively they are expressed as 9 r j c w 0 u 0 10 r w c u w u 0 11 s t d ω 2 π u 0 the jet initial flow flux q 0 and the jet initial momentum flux m 0 are expressed as 12 q 0 1 4 π d 2 w 0 13 m 0 1 4 π d 2 w 0 2 the jet body in the wave current environment is deflected by the current and simultaneously the body sways because of the wave induced oscillating flow xu et al 2016 this implies that the initial dilution is dominated by both current flow and wave flow hence the characteristic velocity of such flow should combine the effects of current and wave the time averaged velocity u 0 is distinctly chosen to represent the current effect considering periodic variation the mean value of the wave induced horizontal velocity magnitude at the jet orifice in one wave period u w0 is used to characterize the integral effect of the wave the expression for u w0 is given as 14 u w 0 1 t 0 t u w cos ω t d t α w c u w where α wc 0 637 in this study the characteristic velocity of wave current flow u ch is considered as a linear superposition of u 0 and u w0 15 u c h u 0 u w 0 u 0 α w c u w u 0 1 α w c r w c that is 16 u c h u 0 1 α w c r w c similar to the case of a jet in crossflow the jet characteristic length scale in a wave current environment l m is defined as 17 l m m 0 1 2 u c h for z l m 1 the jet induced velocity is significantly larger than the ambient velocity and the jet is only slightly affected by the wave current flow the mixing is similar to that of a jet in stagnant water for z l m 1 the jet is bent over and simultaneously moves back and forth the mixing is significantly affected by the wave current flow considering the above length scale the function for the initial dilution can be modified as 18 s f 4 l m u c h u 0 r j c s t where u ch u 0 represents the effect of the wave to current velocity ratio r wc 2 2 numerical model xu et al 2016 2017 developed a large eddy simulation model to investigate the three dimensional flow structure and three dimensional concentration distribution behaviour of jet in a wave current environment the governing equations include the spatially filtered navier stokes equations and the tracer mass conservation equation 19 u i s l x i 0 20 u i s l t u j s l u i s l x j 1 ρ p s l x i g i ν ν t 2 u i s l x j x j 21 c s l t u j s l c s l x j x j ν pr ν t pr t c s l x j 22 ν t c s δ 2 2 s i j s i j where the subscript sl denotes the spatially filtered operation x i i 1 2 3 are the spatial coordinates x y z in horizontal transverse and vertical directions respectively t is the time u i i 1 2 3 p and c are the velocity pressure and concentration respectively ρ is the water density g i is the acceleration due to gravity ν is the kinematic viscosity ν t is the eddy viscosity s ij is the resolved strain rate tensor δ is the grid spacing c s is the smagorinsky constant pr is the prandtl number which represents the relationship between the momentum diffusivity and the mass diffusivity and pr t is the turbulent prandtl number c s pr and pr t are set as 0 2 0 7 and 0 53 respectively xu et al 2017 the σ coordinate system is introduced to solve the problem of the moving free surface the operator splitting method lin and li 2002 which splits the solution procedure into advection diffusion and pressure propagation steps was adopted to numerically solve the governing equations the computational domain is a cubic region with length width and depth of 4 50 m 0 50 m and 0 50 m respectively and a non uniform grid system with 205 99 126 nodes to track the movement of water particles the lagrange euler method chen et al 2004 was applied to update the free surface elevation at every new time step the wave surface elevation wave induced velocity and current velocity profile with a logarithmic distribution were specified at the inflow boundary at the outflow boundary a radiation condition combined with a damping zone was imposed to reduce numerical reflection in addition to the mean values of the velocity and the concentration the perturbations generated by the azimuthal forcing method zhou et al 2001 were specified at the jet inlet boundary more details about the boundary conditions are available in the papers by xu et al 2016 2017 the model has been thoroughly validated using experimental data for a jet in a wave current environment xu et al 2017 in this study a series of numerical cases were tested using this model xu et al 2017 considered one value of the jet to current velocity ratio r jc 10 three values of the strouhal number st 0 1 0 133 0 2 and a range of values of the wave to current velocity ratio r wc 0 2 1 4 in the present study three values of the jet to current velocity ratio r jc 8 10 12 and the same values of the strouhal number used by xu et al 2017 were used the jet dilution is enhanced with increasing wave to current velocity ratio under the condition that the velocity ratio is not larger than 0 6 if the velocity ratio continues to increase jet dilution may decrease xu et al 2017 a possible reason is that the adjacent effluent clouds overlap with each other due to their large horizontal lengths and this has adverse effects on jet dilution it indicates that the law of jet dilution will be different if the wave to current velocity ratio is too large in this study cases with wave to current velocity ratio not greater than 0 6 were considered and the ratio was set to 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 in summary 27 runs of a jet in a wave current environment were carried out details of the numerical runs are listed in table 1 2 3 definition of characteristic dilution parameters as illustrated by xu et al 2017 the vertical jet is deflected along the current and simultaneously sways back and forth under the combined effect of waves and current the phenomenon of an effluent cloud is clearly observed at the upper part of the jet body therefore the time averaged scalar field of the jet in different transverse planes may exhibit another peak above the original cvp structure effluent cloud peak op and original cvp peak cp shown in fig 2 it should be noted that the peak is not always the maximum the maximum occurs either on the cvp part or on the effluent cloud part depending on the downstream locations and the corresponding wave conditions for the case r wc 0 2 ep is insignificant and op gives the maximum at all downstream locations for the case r wc 0 6 ep is almost on a par with op at the downstream distance close to the jet orifice x d 10 op is the maximum at the downstream distance a bit far from the jet orifice x d 15 ep could be the maximum instead a jump can occur on the vertical location of the maximum e g case j17 however the evolution of the maximum along the downstream will still follow a certain regular pattern the empirical equations in previous studies focused on the following parameters that could represent jet dilution i e the trajectory or the vertical location of maximum concentration the minimum dilution or the maximum concentration and the spread width they offer specific information on the adverse effects of wastewater on local ambience lee and chu 2003 recommended using four parameters to describe the characteristics of jet dilution in crossflow fig 3 a the time averaged maximum scalar concentration in the transverse planes c m vertical location of the concentration maximum z m and vertical and horizontal half widths of the concentration contour of c 0 25c m r v and r h the cross sectional minimum dilution s c has the following relationship with c m 23 s c c 0 c m these parameters are of great reference value and are very important to scientists and engineers in the field of wastewater or brine disposal lee and chu 2003 in this study we combined the two half widths into one parameter namely the area of the concentration contour of c 0 25c m hereafter called the jet visual area a 25 as shown in fig 3b sub sections 3 1 3 3 present the development of equations for the parameters s c z m and a 25 against the downstream distance x for equations of the parameter z m the case with r wc 0 6 was not considered due to the jump of the vertical location of the concentration maximum 3 results 3 1 equation for cross sectional minimum dilution fig 4 shows the development of the semi empirical equation for the cross sectional minimum dilution in state 1 the effects of three parameters r jc r wc and st on the minimum dilution along the downstream distance are illustrated the minimum dilution increases as the jet to current velocity ratio fig 4c or the wave to current velocity ratio increases fig 4a in contrast the effect of st is quite minimal fig 4b thus it can be omitted in the equation for the minimum dilution next the variable on each axis is multiplied by the dimensionless parameter d l m which yields state 2 the coordinate system is changed to the logarithmic form the length scale l m can accurately represent the influence of r jc on the minimum dilution fig 4f however the influence of r wc cannot be characterised properly fig 4d the variables on the y axis are sequentially multiplied by the parameter u 0 2 u ch 2 in state 3 the effects of the three dimensionless parameters r jc r wc and st are normalised fig 4g i using the least square fitting method the equation for the cross sectional minimum dilution along the downstream distance is expressed as 24 s c d u 0 2 l m u c h 2 0 80 x l m 0 58 0 5 x l m 6 the 95 confidence bounds of free coefficients are 0 79 0 81 and 0 57 0 59 respectively 3 2 equation for vertical location of cross sectional minimum dilution fig 5 shows the development of the semi empirical equation for the vertical location of the cross sectional minimum dilution in state 1 the effects of three parameters r jc r wc and st on the vertical location along the downstream distance are illustrated the vertical location becomes higher with an increase in r jc fig 5c or a decrease in r wc fig 5a when the wave to current velocity ratio is large say r wc 0 6 the vertical location of the minimum dilution jumps from a lower position to a higher one which indicates that at the downstream section the maximum concentration is in the effluent cloud part instead of the cvp part the two parts are marked in fig 2 consequently the equation for the vertical location of the minimum dilution does not consider cases where r wc is large e g r wc 0 6 next the variable on each axis is multiplied by the dimensionless parameter d l m which yields state 2 as in the case for the equation of the cross sectional minimum dilution the coordinate system is changed to the logarithmic form the length scale l m can accurately represent the influence of both r jc and r wc on the vertical location fig 5d and f using the least square fitting method the equation for the vertical location of the cross sectional minimum dilution along the downstream distance is expressed as 25 z m l m 1 42 x l m 0 35 0 5 x l m 6 the 95 confidence bounds of free coefficients are 1 40 1 43 and 0 34 0 36 respectively 3 3 equation for jet visual area fig 6 shows the development of the semi empirical equation for the jet visual area in state 1 the effects of three parameters r jc r wc and st on the visual area along the downstream distance are illustrated a positive correlation can be found between the visual area and each velocity ratio fig 6a and c while the visual area increases as the strouhal number decreases fig 6b similar to the scenarios shown in figs 4 and 5 the length scale l m and the logarithmic coordinates are considered which yields state 2 this state indicates that the length scale alone cannot represent the influences of r wc and st fig 6d and e hence the variables on the y axis are multiplied by the dimensionless parameter u 2 5 0 u 2 5 ch and st 0 2 sequentially in state 4 the data points for each case lie in the same line which indicates that the considered combination of the parameters can properly represent their influences on the jet visual area fig 6j l using the least square fitting method the equation for the jet visual area along the downstream distance is expressed as 26 a 25 s t 0 2 u 0 2 5 d 0 5 l m 1 5 u c h 2 5 1 65 x l m 0 42 0 5 x l m 6 the 95 confidence bounds of free coefficients are 1 64 1 67 and 0 41 0 43 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with other semi empirical equations in this study the semi empirical equations were obtained by analysing the concentration data in three dimensions whereas in previous studies equations were obtained based on data in the vertical symmetrical plane the equations for the centreline minimum dilution and its vertical location have been regularly reported in previous studies and summarised by lee and chu 2003 table 2 presents a comparison between the present equations and those reported by lee and chu 2003 for the minimum dilution the structures of the two equations are quite similar in the case where the wave effect is not considered the equation structure is the same as that of eq 1 the coefficients c 1 and c 2 in the two equations are not the same because of the use of different data sets for example c 1 in the present equation is smaller than that in the equation by lee and chu 2003 and this is partly attributed to the difference between s c0 and s c s c0 and s c were calculated using the maximum concentration in the vertical centreline of the transverse plane c m0 and the maximum concentration in the transverse plane c m respectively chu 1996 found that the ratio of s c0 to s c for a jet in crossflow is in the range of 1 0 1 5 average value 1 2 and the ratio varies along different transverse planes for the vertical location of the minimum dilution the structures of the two equations are the same as described in eq 2 the values of c 4 in the two sets of equations are very close to each other while the value of c 3 in the present equation is smaller than the value reported by lee and chu 2003 one reason for this is that the location of the maximum concentration in the transverse plane is lower than that of the maximum concentration in the vertical centreline of the transverse plane which can be clearly observed in fig 3a the comparison indicates that the present equations are reasonable 4 2 applicable range of present semi empirical equations first the present semi empirical equations are compared with the corresponding data for a jet in crossflow cases j28 j30 table 3 as shown in fig 7 the empirical equations in a wave current environment undoubtedly depend on st and r wc while those in a crossflow have no relationship with st and r wc hence st and r wc should not be included in the no wave cases if the empirical equations in a wave current environment are applied to the no wave cases the wave related dimensionless parameters st and r wc in the equations should be set reasonably the wave to current velocity ratio r wc should be set to 0 such that u ch is equal to u 0 while st should be set to a constant value st 1 in this study then the results of the present equations and the data for a jet in crossflow were found to be in good agreement this indicates that the present equations can be applied to cases of a jet in crossflow when u ch is set to u 0 and st is set to 1 the equations for the cross sectional minimum dilution and the jet visual area were developed using data of cases with r wc 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 whereas the equation for the vertical location of the cross sectional minimum dilution was developed using data of cases with r wc 0 2 and 0 4 hence the limits of the corresponding equations relative to r wc are 0 6 and 0 4 respectively to further check the applicability of these semi empirical equations nine numerical cases with a different value of the current velocity u 0 0 06 m s were run the detailed parameters are listed in table 4 then the data for these nine cases were added to the data shown in fig 7 the performance of the three semi empirical equations is quite satisfactory 4 3 application of semi empirical equations the present semi empirical equations were developed based on data from the large eddy simulation model where the jet is a laboratory scale jet the laboratory scale jet and field jet which are fully turbulent reynolds number larger than 2000 were observed to spread at the same rate despite the enormous difference in their scale lee and chu 2003 this indicates that the effect of the reynolds number on applicability to the ocean is insignificant as a result the laboratory scale jet in this study was scaled down by applying the froude similarity criterion instead of the reynolds similarity criterion to ensure possible application in the field the length scale ratio is the square of the time or velocity scale ratio further the semi empirical equation should be thoroughly tested using field data from wastewater discharge which is more complicated than a laboratory jet nevertheless an artificial case in the field was setup to explicitly quantify the wave effect on jet dilution consider a single vertical discharge at a distance of 8 0 m from the surface the total water depth is 10 0 m the initial velocity of the discharge is 1 20 m s with a diameter of 0 20 m the initial flow flux q 0 and the initial momentum flux m 0 were calculated as 0 038 m3 s and 0 045 m4 s2 respectively the ambient current speed is 0 25 m s surface waves with wave heights ranging from 0 to 0 45 m and a period of 6 0 s were selected the length scale can be obtained by using eqs 14 17 the different dilution scenarios are illustrated in fig 8 at a downstream distance closer to the discharge point say x 6 0 m the differences among the different scenarios were quite minimal with an increase in the downstream distance the differences became larger as an example consider the dilution at x 20 0 m the minimum dilution is 0 20 larger and the jet visual area is 0 30 larger if the wave effects are considered for a dilution of 30 times the downstream distance to the discharge point in crossflow may reach 1 4 times that in the wave current flow it should also be noted that the vertical location of the minimum dilution is considerably closer to the discharge point in the scenarios with wave effects this indicates that the wave effects enhance the initial dilution hence the effect of the surface wave should be considered in the design of a real wastewater discharge 5 conclusion in this study three semi empirical equations for the initial dilution of crossflow jet were extended to a wave current coexisting environment considering the effects of the wave to current velocity ratio r wc jet to current velocity ratio r jc and strouhal number st the effect of surface waves on the jet discharge was also quantised the initial dilution equations namely the jet visual area a 25 cross sectional minimum dilution s c and vertical location of the minimum dilution z m are summarised as follows s c d u 0 2 l m u c h 2 0 80 x l m 0 58 0 5 x l m 6 z m l m 1 42 x l m 0 35 0 5 x l m 6 a 25 s t 0 2 u 0 2 5 d 0 5 l m 1 5 u c h 2 5 1 65 x l m 0 42 0 5 x l m 6 the performance of these equations was satisfactory the equations for s c and a 25 were determined to be suitable for cases where the wave to current velocity ratio was not larger than 0 6 whereas the equation for z m was determined to be suitable for cases where the wave to current velocity ratio was not larger than 0 4 the application of the semi empirical equations showed that an increase in the wave height r wc 0 6 could lead to an enhancement in the initial dilution of the vertical discharges it should be noted that the present equations were obtained using data for the non buoyant cases thus further study is recommended for the buoyant cases acknowledgement the authors wish to thank the reviewers for their constructive

transport especially in the last decade zhao et al 2011 muhammetoglu et al 2012 chan et al 2013 local hydrodynamics which is related to the discharge site is one of the primary factors that determine the jet dilution voutchkov 2011 marti et al 2011 purnama and shao 2015 stark et al 2016b in coastal areas tidal currents and surface waves are the dominating hydrodynamic factors previous studies lee and neville jones 1987 yuan et al 1999 muppidi and mahesh 2005 cavar and meyer 2012 have mainly focused on the effects of currents on the initial dilution of wastewater simplified as a turbulent jet in crossflow four largescale coherent structures can be identified from a turbulent jet in crossflow namely jet shear layer vortices horseshoe vortices wake vortices and counter rotating vortex pair cvp kelso et al 1996 among these cvp is a salient feature of the jet which mainly contributes to the deformation and periodic roll up of the shear layer kelso et al 1996 marzouk and ghoniem 2007 because of the existence of the cvp structure the concentration distribution at the downstream cross section follows the pattern shown in fig 1 this pattern indicates that the cross sectional maximum concentration or cross sectional minimum dilution is not located on the centreline the ratio of the cross sectional maximum concentration to the centreline maximum concentration is in the range of 1 0 1 5 with an average value of 1 2 chu 1996 in addition owing to the limitations of experimental measurement the centreline maximum concentration and its location defined as the jet trajectory are usually chosen to represent the characteristic behaviour of dilution lee and chu 2003 summarised the equations developed by different researchers as follows 1 s c 0 d l m 0 c 1 x l m 0 c 2 2 z m 0 l m 0 c 3 x l m 0 c 4 3 l m 0 m 0 1 2 u 0 π 2 d w 0 u 0 π 2 d r j c where s c0 is the centreline minimum dilution z m0 represents the vertical location of the centreline maximum concentration x is the downstream distance from the jet orifice l m0 is the characteristic length scale of the jet in crossflow m 0 is the initial momentum flux u 0 is the crossflow velocity w 0 is the initial velocity of the jet r jc is the jet to current velocity ratio d is the jet diameter and c 1 c 4 are constants the values of c 2 and c 4 are approximately 0 66 and 0 33 respectively whereas the values of c 1 and c 3 are in the ranges of 1 0 1 27 and 1 51 1 77 respectively lee and chu 2003 it should be noted that the above equations are not applicable to cases in which the dilution is very close to the jet orifice x l m0 0 5 based on these equations we can intuitively understand the effect of the current on the initial dilution unlike tidal currents surface waves have temporal scales of several seconds which lead to swaying of the jet trajectory several researchers have investigated the interaction of surface waves with non buoyant jets mossa 2004 xu et al 2014 negatively buoyant jets ferrari and querzoli 2015 and positively buoyant jets chin 1987 hwung et al 1994 lin et al 2013 a consistent conclusion is that the surface waves enhance the interaction between the jet and the ambient water and serves as an additional source of mixing thus the surface wave may have a positive effect on the initial dilution of the jet discharge ryu et al 2005 and hsiao et al 2011 found that the wave to jet momentum or velocity ratio is a key factor that describes jet wave interaction sharp et al 2014 investigated the turbulent buoyant plumes discharged into a wave environment and obtained the average increase in the dilution between wave and no wave cases which is expressed as 4 s 1 s 0 1 6 u w w 0 where s 1 and s 0 are the centreline dilution with waves present and under stagnant conditions respectively and u w is the maximum wave induced horizontal velocity at the jet orifice which is related to the wave height h wave period t and water depth h according to the linear wave theory u w is defined as 5 u w π h t cosh k h 0 sinh k h where k is the wave number and h 0 is the height of the jet orifice the above semi empirical equations for the initial dilution eqs 1 4 only consider current or wave effects and therefore should be modified for discharge sites in wave current environments such as coastal waters relevant studies conducted so far have been limited to the characteristics of the velocity and concentration distribution of a non buoyant jet under the combined effect of waves and current abdel rahman 2004 xia and lam 2004 xu et al 2016 2017 a quantitative analysis of the initial dilution of the jet discharge in a wave current environment is still lacking following the work of xu et al 2017 this study aims to extend the semi empirical equations for crossflow jet dilution to a wave following current environment and quantise the effect of surface waves on jet discharge it should be noted that a wave current environment means that the wave and the current propagate in the same direction considering the complexity of negatively buoyant discharges this study focused on a vertical non buoyant jet we believe that a detailed study of the initial dilution of a non buoyant vertical round jet in a wave current environment would serve as a useful reference for future studies on the corresponding buoyant cases 2 methodology 2 1 dimensional analysis the initial dilution s of a non buoyant vertical round jet in a wave current environment can be expressed in the following functional form 6 s f 1 d w 0 h 0 h h t u 0 the wave force near the jet orifice has a critical influence on the swaying of the jet body and the average dilution hence the maximum wave induced horizontal velocity at the jet orifice position is usually selected as the wave characteristic velocity in previous studies chin 1987 sharp et al 2014 xu et al 2017 in addition the wave frequency ω ω 2π t is another characteristic parameter that can affect the jet initial dilution therefore eq 6 can be expressed as 7 s f 2 d w 0 u w ω u 0 xu et al 2017 expressed eq 7 as follows using three dimensionless parameters 8 s f 3 r j c r w c s t where r wc and st are the wave to current velocity ratio and strouhal number respectively they are expressed as 9 r j c w 0 u 0 10 r w c u w u 0 11 s t d ω 2 π u 0 the jet initial flow flux q 0 and the jet initial momentum flux m 0 are expressed as 12 q 0 1 4 π d 2 w 0 13 m 0 1 4 π d 2 w 0 2 the jet body in the wave current environment is deflected by the current and simultaneously the body sways because of the wave induced oscillating flow xu et al 2016 this implies that the initial dilution is dominated by both current flow and wave flow hence the characteristic velocity of such flow should combine the effects of current and wave the time averaged velocity u 0 is distinctly chosen to represent the current effect considering periodic variation the mean value of the wave induced horizontal velocity magnitude at the jet orifice in one wave period u w0 is used to characterize the integral effect of the wave the expression for u w0 is given as 14 u w 0 1 t 0 t u w cos ω t d t α w c u w where α wc 0 637 in this study the characteristic velocity of wave current flow u ch is considered as a linear superposition of u 0 and u w0 15 u c h u 0 u w 0 u 0 α w c u w u 0 1 α w c r w c that is 16 u c h u 0 1 α w c r w c similar to the case of a jet in crossflow the jet characteristic length scale in a wave current environment l m is defined as 17 l m m 0 1 2 u c h for z l m 1 the jet induced velocity is significantly larger than the ambient velocity and the jet is only slightly affected by the wave current flow the mixing is similar to that of a jet in stagnant water for z l m 1 the jet is bent over and simultaneously moves back and forth the mixing is significantly affected by the wave current flow considering the above length scale the function for the initial dilution can be modified as 18 s f 4 l m u c h u 0 r j c s t where u ch u 0 represents the effect of the wave to current velocity ratio r wc 2 2 numerical model xu et al 2016 2017 developed a large eddy simulation model to investigate the three dimensional flow structure and three dimensional concentration distribution behaviour of jet in a wave current environment the governing equations include the spatially filtered navier stokes equations and the tracer mass conservation equation 19 u i s l x i 0 20 u i s l t u j s l u i s l x j 1 ρ p s l x i g i ν ν t 2 u i s l x j x j 21 c s l t u j s l c s l x j x j ν pr ν t pr t c s l x j 22 ν t c s δ 2 2 s i j s i j where the subscript sl denotes the spatially filtered operation x i i 1 2 3 are the spatial coordinates x y z in horizontal transverse and vertical directions respectively t is the time u i i 1 2 3 p and c are the velocity pressure and concentration respectively ρ is the water density g i is the acceleration due to gravity ν is the kinematic viscosity ν t is the eddy viscosity s ij is the resolved strain rate tensor δ is the grid spacing c s is the smagorinsky constant pr is the prandtl number which represents the relationship between the momentum diffusivity and the mass diffusivity and pr t is the turbulent prandtl number c s pr and pr t are set as 0 2 0 7 and 0 53 respectively xu et al 2017 the σ coordinate system is introduced to solve the problem of the moving free surface the operator splitting method lin and li 2002 which splits the solution procedure into advection diffusion and pressure propagation steps was adopted to numerically solve the governing equations the computational domain is a cubic region with length width and depth of 4 50 m 0 50 m and 0 50 m respectively and a non uniform grid system with 205 99 126 nodes to track the movement of water particles the lagrange euler method chen et al 2004 was applied to update the free surface elevation at every new time step the wave surface elevation wave induced velocity and current velocity profile with a logarithmic distribution were specified at the inflow boundary at the outflow boundary a radiation condition combined with a damping zone was imposed to reduce numerical reflection in addition to the mean values of the velocity and the concentration the perturbations generated by the azimuthal forcing method zhou et al 2001 were specified at the jet inlet boundary more details about the boundary conditions are available in the papers by xu et al 2016 2017 the model has been thoroughly validated using experimental data for a jet in a wave current environment xu et al 2017 in this study a series of numerical cases were tested using this model xu et al 2017 considered one value of the jet to current velocity ratio r jc 10 three values of the strouhal number st 0 1 0 133 0 2 and a range of values of the wave to current velocity ratio r wc 0 2 1 4 in the present study three values of the jet to current velocity ratio r jc 8 10 12 and the same values of the strouhal number used by xu et al 2017 were used the jet dilution is enhanced with increasing wave to current velocity ratio under the condition that the velocity ratio is not larger than 0 6 if the velocity ratio continues to increase jet dilution may decrease xu et al 2017 a possible reason is that the adjacent effluent clouds overlap with each other due to their large horizontal lengths and this has adverse effects on jet dilution it indicates that the law of jet dilution will be different if the wave to current velocity ratio is too large in this study cases with wave to current velocity ratio not greater than 0 6 were considered and the ratio was set to 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 in summary 27 runs of a jet in a wave current environment were carried out details of the numerical runs are listed in table 1 2 3 definition of characteristic dilution parameters as illustrated by xu et al 2017 the vertical jet is deflected along the current and simultaneously sways back and forth under the combined effect of waves and current the phenomenon of an effluent cloud is clearly observed at the upper part of the jet body therefore the time averaged scalar field of the jet in different transverse planes may exhibit another peak above the original cvp structure effluent cloud peak op and original cvp peak cp shown in fig 2 it should be noted that the peak is not always the maximum the maximum occurs either on the cvp part or on the effluent cloud part depending on the downstream locations and the corresponding wave conditions for the case r wc 0 2 ep is insignificant and op gives the maximum at all downstream locations for the case r wc 0 6 ep is almost on a par with op at the downstream distance close to the jet orifice x d 10 op is the maximum at the downstream distance a bit far from the jet orifice x d 15 ep could be the maximum instead a jump can occur on the vertical location of the maximum e g case j17 however the evolution of the maximum along the downstream will still follow a certain regular pattern the empirical equations in previous studies focused on the following parameters that could represent jet dilution i e the trajectory or the vertical location of maximum concentration the minimum dilution or the maximum concentration and the spread width they offer specific information on the adverse effects of wastewater on local ambience lee and chu 2003 recommended using four parameters to describe the characteristics of jet dilution in crossflow fig 3 a the time averaged maximum scalar concentration in the transverse planes c m vertical location of the concentration maximum z m and vertical and horizontal half widths of the concentration contour of c 0 25c m r v and r h the cross sectional minimum dilution s c has the following relationship with c m 23 s c c 0 c m these parameters are of great reference value and are very important to scientists and engineers in the field of wastewater or brine disposal lee and chu 2003 in this study we combined the two half widths into one parameter namely the area of the concentration contour of c 0 25c m hereafter called the jet visual area a 25 as shown in fig 3b sub sections 3 1 3 3 present the development of equations for the parameters s c z m and a 25 against the downstream distance x for equations of the parameter z m the case with r wc 0 6 was not considered due to the jump of the vertical location of the concentration maximum 3 results 3 1 equation for cross sectional minimum dilution fig 4 shows the development of the semi empirical equation for the cross sectional minimum dilution in state 1 the effects of three parameters r jc r wc and st on the minimum dilution along the downstream distance are illustrated the minimum dilution increases as the jet to current velocity ratio fig 4c or the wave to current velocity ratio increases fig 4a in contrast the effect of st is quite minimal fig 4b thus it can be omitted in the equation for the minimum dilution next the variable on each axis is multiplied by the dimensionless parameter d l m which yields state 2 the coordinate system is changed to the logarithmic form the length scale l m can accurately represent the influence of r jc on the minimum dilution fig 4f however the influence of r wc cannot be characterised properly fig 4d the variables on the y axis are sequentially multiplied by the parameter u 0 2 u ch 2 in state 3 the effects of the three dimensionless parameters r jc r wc and st are normalised fig 4g i using the least square fitting method the equation for the cross sectional minimum dilution along the downstream distance is expressed as 24 s c d u 0 2 l m u c h 2 0 80 x l m 0 58 0 5 x l m 6 the 95 confidence bounds of free coefficients are 0 79 0 81 and 0 57 0 59 respectively 3 2 equation for vertical location of cross sectional minimum dilution fig 5 shows the development of the semi empirical equation for the vertical location of the cross sectional minimum dilution in state 1 the effects of three parameters r jc r wc and st on the vertical location along the downstream distance are illustrated the vertical location becomes higher with an increase in r jc fig 5c or a decrease in r wc fig 5a when the wave to current velocity ratio is large say r wc 0 6 the vertical location of the minimum dilution jumps from a lower position to a higher one which indicates that at the downstream section the maximum concentration is in the effluent cloud part instead of the cvp part the two parts are marked in fig 2 consequently the equation for the vertical location of the minimum dilution does not consider cases where r wc is large e g r wc 0 6 next the variable on each axis is multiplied by the dimensionless parameter d l m which yields state 2 as in the case for the equation of the cross sectional minimum dilution the coordinate system is changed to the logarithmic form the length scale l m can accurately represent the influence of both r jc and r wc on the vertical location fig 5d and f using the least square fitting method the equation for the vertical location of the cross sectional minimum dilution along the downstream distance is expressed as 25 z m l m 1 42 x l m 0 35 0 5 x l m 6 the 95 confidence bounds of free coefficients are 1 40 1 43 and 0 34 0 36 respectively 3 3 equation for jet visual area fig 6 shows the development of the semi empirical equation for the jet visual area in state 1 the effects of three parameters r jc r wc and st on the visual area along the downstream distance are illustrated a positive correlation can be found between the visual area and each velocity ratio fig 6a and c while the visual area increases as the strouhal number decreases fig 6b similar to the scenarios shown in figs 4 and 5 the length scale l m and the logarithmic coordinates are considered which yields state 2 this state indicates that the length scale alone cannot represent the influences of r wc and st fig 6d and e hence the variables on the y axis are multiplied by the dimensionless parameter u 2 5 0 u 2 5 ch and st 0 2 sequentially in state 4 the data points for each case lie in the same line which indicates that the considered combination of the parameters can properly represent their influences on the jet visual area fig 6j l using the least square fitting method the equation for the jet visual area along the downstream distance is expressed as 26 a 25 s t 0 2 u 0 2 5 d 0 5 l m 1 5 u c h 2 5 1 65 x l m 0 42 0 5 x l m 6 the 95 confidence bounds of free coefficients are 1 64 1 67 and 0 41 0 43 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with other semi empirical equations in this study the semi empirical equations were obtained by analysing the concentration data in three dimensions whereas in previous studies equations were obtained based on data in the vertical symmetrical plane the equations for the centreline minimum dilution and its vertical location have been regularly reported in previous studies and summarised by lee and chu 2003 table 2 presents a comparison between the present equations and those reported by lee and chu 2003 for the minimum dilution the structures of the two equations are quite similar in the case where the wave effect is not considered the equation structure is the same as that of eq 1 the coefficients c 1 and c 2 in the two equations are not the same because of the use of different data sets for example c 1 in the present equation is smaller than that in the equation by lee and chu 2003 and this is partly attributed to the difference between s c0 and s c s c0 and s c were calculated using the maximum concentration in the vertical centreline of the transverse plane c m0 and the maximum concentration in the transverse plane c m respectively chu 1996 found that the ratio of s c0 to s c for a jet in crossflow is in the range of 1 0 1 5 average value 1 2 and the ratio varies along different transverse planes for the vertical location of the minimum dilution the structures of the two equations are the same as described in eq 2 the values of c 4 in the two sets of equations are very close to each other while the value of c 3 in the present equation is smaller than the value reported by lee and chu 2003 one reason for this is that the location of the maximum concentration in the transverse plane is lower than that of the maximum concentration in the vertical centreline of the transverse plane which can be clearly observed in fig 3a the comparison indicates that the present equations are reasonable 4 2 applicable range of present semi empirical equations first the present semi empirical equations are compared with the corresponding data for a jet in crossflow cases j28 j30 table 3 as shown in fig 7 the empirical equations in a wave current environment undoubtedly depend on st and r wc while those in a crossflow have no relationship with st and r wc hence st and r wc should not be included in the no wave cases if the empirical equations in a wave current environment are applied to the no wave cases the wave related dimensionless parameters st and r wc in the equations should be set reasonably the wave to current velocity ratio r wc should be set to 0 such that u ch is equal to u 0 while st should be set to a constant value st 1 in this study then the results of the present equations and the data for a jet in crossflow were found to be in good agreement this indicates that the present equations can be applied to cases of a jet in crossflow when u ch is set to u 0 and st is set to 1 the equations for the cross sectional minimum dilution and the jet visual area were developed using data of cases with r wc 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 whereas the equation for the vertical location of the cross sectional minimum dilution was developed using data of cases with r wc 0 2 and 0 4 hence the limits of the corresponding equations relative to r wc are 0 6 and 0 4 respectively to further check the applicability of these semi empirical equations nine numerical cases with a different value of the current velocity u 0 0 06 m s were run the detailed parameters are listed in table 4 then the data for these nine cases were added to the data shown in fig 7 the performance of the three semi empirical equations is quite satisfactory 4 3 application of semi empirical equations the present semi empirical equations were developed based on data from the large eddy simulation model where the jet is a laboratory scale jet the laboratory scale jet and field jet which are fully turbulent reynolds number larger than 2000 were observed to spread at the same rate despite the enormous difference in their scale lee and chu 2003 this indicates that the effect of the reynolds number on applicability to the ocean is insignificant as a result the laboratory scale jet in this study was scaled down by applying the froude similarity criterion instead of the reynolds similarity criterion to ensure possible application in the field the length scale ratio is the square of the time or velocity scale ratio further the semi empirical equation should be thoroughly tested using field data from wastewater discharge which is more complicated than a laboratory jet nevertheless an artificial case in the field was setup to explicitly quantify the wave effect on jet dilution consider a single vertical discharge at a distance of 8 0 m from the surface the total water depth is 10 0 m the initial velocity of the discharge is 1 20 m s with a diameter of 0 20 m the initial flow flux q 0 and the initial momentum flux m 0 were calculated as 0 038 m3 s and 0 045 m4 s2 respectively the ambient current speed is 0 25 m s surface waves with wave heights ranging from 0 to 0 45 m and a period of 6 0 s were selected the length scale can be obtained by using eqs 14 17 the different dilution scenarios are illustrated in fig 8 at a downstream distance closer to the discharge point say x 6 0 m the differences among the different scenarios were quite minimal with an increase in the downstream distance the differences became larger as an example consider the dilution at x 20 0 m the minimum dilution is 0 20 larger and the jet visual area is 0 30 larger if the wave effects are considered for a dilution of 30 times the downstream distance to the discharge point in crossflow may reach 1 4 times that in the wave current flow it should also be noted that the vertical location of the minimum dilution is considerably closer to the discharge point in the scenarios with wave effects this indicates that the wave effects enhance the initial dilution hence the effect of the surface wave should be considered in the design of a real wastewater discharge 5 conclusion in this study three semi empirical equations for the initial dilution of crossflow jet were extended to a wave current coexisting environment considering the effects of the wave to current velocity ratio r wc jet to current velocity ratio r jc and strouhal number st the effect of surface waves on the jet discharge was also quantised the initial dilution equations namely the jet visual area a 25 cross sectional minimum dilution s c and vertical location of the minimum dilution z m are summarised as follows s c d u 0 2 l m u c h 2 0 80 x l m 0 58 0 5 x l m 6 z m l m 1 42 x l m 0 35 0 5 x l m 6 a 25 s t 0 2 u 0 2 5 d 0 5 l m 1 5 u c h 2 5 1 65 x l m 0 42 0 5 x l m 6 the performance of these equations was satisfactory the equations for s c and a 25 were determined to be suitable for cases where the wave to current velocity ratio was not larger than 0 6 whereas the equation for z m was determined to be suitable for cases where the wave to current velocity ratio was not larger than 0 4 the application of the semi empirical equations showed that an increase in the wave height r wc 0 6 could lead to an enhancement in the initial dilution of the vertical discharges it should be noted that the present equations were obtained using data for the non buoyant cases thus further study is recommended for the buoyant cases acknowledgement the authors wish to thank the reviewers for their constructive

23179,the aim of this work was to quantify the physical conditions required for the mobilisation of unexploded ordnance devices uxo on the sea floor as a basis for this the hydrodynamic processes around uxo were measured in the wind tunnel and the flume tank in terms of conditions especially reynolds numbers from these experiments the typical shape of a sandy sea floor in the close vicinity of an object due to current induced burial was determined knowing this the model for current induced mobilisation of objects was developed the model assumes a critical dimensionless moment factor m f a r e b where the parameters a and b had to be investigated this was accomplished by performing a total number of 287 numerical simulations wind tunnel testings and flume tank experiments at different geometric scale factors 1 10 1 5 1 2 and 1 1 with the parameter values so determined the model describes the critical situation of an arbitrary shaped cylinder like object regarding the incident flow velocity the immersed mass and the burial depth as well as the length and the volume averaged diameter of the object keywords mobility scour burial uxo piv lda cta light field camera sediment loads wind tunnel water channel cfd 1 introduction in many sea areas numerous unexploded ordnance devices uxo from previous wars contaminate sea floor they can be found buried in and on the sea bed these objects represent a major risk for life and equipment for all marine activities touching the sea bed such as fishery offshore installation effort mining and naval activities particularly the routes for subsea cables and pipelines are recommended to be surveyed and cleared of potentially dangerous objects prior to any installation effort to establish a safe working environment since the number of potential objects to be investigated is unknown time and cost for these campaigns cannot be quantified accurately this uncertainty can delay the subsequent installation effort and therefore increases the overall project risk this also applies for repair and maintenance activities as a route is assumed to be free of uxo only for a limited amount of time therefore a good knowledge about the physical requirements for the initial mobilisation of objects on the sea floor is needed to decide whether a previously cleared corridor can be assumed to be unchanged in this paper the requirements to mobilise uxo on the sea floor by currents are thus quantified this approach moves away from a temporal sign off to a physical event driven and quantifiable approach by understanding and describing the processes that make objects migrate on the sea floor according to wilkens and richardson 2007 cylindrical objects bedded on a sandy sea floor can be buried or partially buried by a series of different processes the burial process depends on a large number of variables as shown in jenkins et al 2007 within this context we distinguish between processes in the close vicinity of the object and those that also occur in the far field according to catano lopera et al 2007 jenkins et al 2007 and wilkens and richardson 2007 the far field processes like the bottom slope and the change due to dunes and ripples as well as the change of the structure of the seabed are independent of the presence of objects on the sea floor in contrast to this the near field processes depend on the presence of an object itself and variations in the fluid flow around it in particular the erosion of sediment the formation of scour and the accumulation of sediment depend on a large number of different parameters and boundary conditions which was described in wilkens and richardson 2007 jenkins et al 2007 shields 1936 and guyonic et al 2007 a model for the self burial of small objects was published in whitehouse 1998 which gives the burial depth of a cylinder of unknown size by time this model however requires the knowledge of the maximum burial depth due to scour induced self burial which is also given in whitehouse 1998 the maximum burial depths for small objects with diameters of up to d 10 5 c m and lengths of up to l 32 c m can be found in rennie et al 2017 a description of the physical processes for scour induced self burial of a cylindrical object on a sandy sea floor will be given in section 3 1 here a fully developed interaction between the object its environment and the fluid is found extensive investigations on the self burial and the mobilisation of small objects on the sea floor have been examined during the strategic environmental research and development program serdp models for the mobilisation of uxo have already been published in rennie et al 2017 for small objects in accelerating currents they assume a relatively small object size and thus may not necessarily be applied to larger objects besides this several models for the mobilisation of different objects on the sea floor were published by e g wiberg and smith 1985 nott 1997 nandasena and tanaka 2013 and noormets et al 2004 in contrast to the existing approaches that are restricted to small ranges of sizes and incident velocities in this study a general model was developed the mobilisation is described by a force balance model as the driving hydrodynamic loads can be scaled by the dimensionless reynolds number this was used to scale the objects sizes and the incident velocities thus the model was calibrated by experiments and numerical simulations within a range of 4 orders of magnitude of the reynolds number the model is therefore applicable at least within this range furthermore the exact shape of the individual object does not have to be known the general model requires only a few characteristic measures like the length the average diameter and the weight of the object consequently this approach is useful in a very wide range of applications and for unfamiliar objects 2 methods the transferability of the results from experimental analysis on small scale models to full scale is subject to numerous uncertainties with respect to this the conceptional preparation of the relevant laboratory tests is a considerable scientific challenge the choice of geometric kinematic and dynamic parameters of the down scaled model the sediment and the fluid flow plays a decisive role for the vortex and turbulence structures as well as for the characteristics of the wake of an object and the separation of the flow which all affect force loads on the object the reynolds number 1 r e u d ν with the incident velocity u the characteristic length scale d and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ν is the relevant dimensionless number for the initiation of sediment transport the particle froude number 2 f r p u ρ p ρ w ρ w g d p and the shields parameter 3 s h τ w ρ p ρ w g d p defined by shields 1936 with the densities of water ρ w and the particle ρ p the particle diameter d p the gravitational acceleration g and the wall shear stress τ w are the relevant numbers the critical shields parameter s h c is defined by the initial movement of the individual sediment from their definitions it is obvious that these numbers cannot all be conserved at the same time when scaling an object due to this it is necessary to prove that the results from the scaled water flume experiments can be transferred to the ocean the concept for this was to guarantee that the scaling of the sediment transport continues to be done by s h and f r p even though the reynolds number is much higher in the ocean than in the flume experiments extensive measurements of the ruling vortex structures like the horseshoe vortex and the recirculation vortex whose horizontal length again is a good measure for the separation at the object have been done in the water flume and in the wind tunnel the measurements in the wind tunnel were conducted at the same reynolds numbers as it can be found in the ocean 2 1 experimental facilities and techniques the near scale scour and mobilisation experiments were carried out in the flumetank of the university of rostock and for larger scale in the fast flow facility fff at hr wallingford 1 1 in cooperation with prof richard whitehouse at hydraulic research wallingford howbery park wallingford oxfordshire ox10 8ba united kingdom the goal was to determine the maximum burial depth of the objects the scour pattern due to a constant

first approach for the current induced mobilisation model was shown in menzel et al 2017 the basic equations will also be shown here for a better understanding of the newest approach the basic idea is that objects on the sea floor become partially buried see section 1 in menzel et al 2012 it was shown that cylindrical objects tend to orientate with their cylinder axis normal to the mean incident velocity direction due to the munk moment due to this the basic approach of the current induced mobilisation model is that the object has to be lifted up or tilted to leave this position to simplify the model the static pressure difference between the upper side of the object and the bottom side of the object are neglected thus the force that is necessary to lift or tilt the object will be underestimated a simplified model of the acting loads on a cylindrical object is shown in fig 2 the gravitational force on the object with a dry mass m and the volume v is 4 f g m g v ρ obj g and the

from those for objects in a free flow as the objects are located on the sea floor and partially buried due to this their values will not be used in the following analysis seeking an approach that tends to overestimate the mobility of the object these loads are assumed to appear at a maximum lever and induce the worst case moment 10 m dl r d f d r l f l although this worst case scenario with the maximum lever is used for the wind tunnel experiments it is just an approach and does not consider the correct pressure distribution on the object s surface during the numerical simulations the pressure distribution on the object s surface is known thus the moment can be derived by summation of the moments induced by the pressure induced loads on the surface for each grid cell as 11 m dl n r n f n which is illustrated schematically in fig 3 thus the flow induced loads can generate a moment which may lead to a destabilisation of the body s original equilibrium during the experiments the shapes of the models often differed strongly from an idealised cylinder with respect to the different shapes the characteristic geometrical parameters were determined by using the characteristic length scale 12 d avg 4 v π l with l being the length of the object for practical reasons the absolute burial depth z b which is related to the maximum diameter of the object d max can be converted into the relative burial depth 13 z b z b d max to unify all results for the different burial depths and objects it makes sense to find a dimensionless form for the moment m dl from the general definition of the moment we know that this can be written in a simplified form as 14 m dl f s with a load f and a length scale s according to eqs 8 and 9 the load can be expressed as 15 f ρ w 2 u 2 c

quadratically proportional to the incident velocity u 0 which again can be described by r e this was already shown in menzel et al 2017 by plotting the loads on the objects in dependency of the reynolds number there it was also shown that a power law is able to describe the relationship between the loads and r e assuming a power law also for the relationship between m f and r e and noting that the exponent will not be exactly two because the drag and lift coefficients c d and c l themselves will not be constant with r e this relation can be defined as 25 m f a r e b using eq 1 for the

will be shown in section 3 2 3 numerical simulations to compute the exact loads on the objects numerical simulations were performed with a commercial cfd solver by using rans with the k ω sst model in addition to simulations with truncated objects on a flat sea floor which are used for comparison with the wind tunnel experiments simulations with real scour patterns have been undertaken the scour patterns were taken from the bathymetric measurements in the water channel at hr wallingford a typical mesh and zoom into the simulation domain is shown in fig 4 whereas the color scale indicates the dimensionless magnitude of the velocity 2 4 objects during previous wars many different objects were dumped into the oceans due to the strong variability of the shapes and sizes of these objects this study will focus on the most frequently encountered and most dangerous objects in the north sea the shapes of the objects often contain a number of small contour details but generally they will not have a significant influence on the flow induced loads thus the geometries of the investigated objects have been simplified as shown in fig 5 which was adapted from menzel et al 2017 these simplified objects were analysed in the numerical simulations by varying the burial depth in 1 1 1 5 and 1 10 scale with a measured scour structure and with a flat seabed in the wind tunnel experiments geometrically similar models of the british 250lb general purpose bomb with a scale factor of 1 5 and the german mine type gu with a scale factor of 1 10 were tested to validate the results of the numerical simulations these objects are similar to the british depth bomb mark 1 and the german mine type gy and can stand in for other types of bomb and mine shape objects additionally to these realistic objects a simple cylinder was used as an idealised representative for arbitrary objects to validate the geometry of the particular scour and the burial of the objects analysed flow induced effects were explored for the cylinder in 1 10 scale and shape of the british 250lb general purpose bomb and the german mine type gu in the water flume of the university of rostock the measurements in the wind tunnel were performed for 10 different incident velocities at 5 different burial depths whereas the numerical simulations cover 5 different incident velocities and 5 burial depths the experiments at hr wallingford were run with surrogates for the british 250lb general purpose bomb at 1 1 scale and the cylinder at 1 2 scale the weights of both objects were strongly reduced to guarantee their mobilisation within the limitations of the flume s maximum velocity in order to account for the burial depth of the objects the corresponding reynolds numbers were computed as 28 r e u

1 current induced self burial the current induced scour and burial of cylindrical objects on the sea floor has been investigated for 1 10 scale and was published in menzel et al 2014 menzel et al 2013 menzel and leder 2014 and menzel et al 2015 to predict the mobilisation of objects on the sea floor a cylindrical object is the simplest case and can be used for generalisation as the processes are better defined and comparable results from international publications are available e g whitehouse 1998 mazumder et al 2011 fig 6 shows the scour structure close to the cylindrical model it is obvious that the typical scour trough in front of the cylinder the scour around and under the ends and a small accumulation area in the wake of the object are formed due to the low incident velocity in the experiment the amount of suspended sediment is small compared to the experiments of menzel and leder 2014 thus the accumulation is a bit smaller because it depends on suspended sediment that enters the recirculation area by overflowing the object nevertheless the results are in accordance to the scour structure published in menzel et al 2015 which is shown in fig 7 to confirm that the scour and burial of the individual objects are quite similar to those of a simple cylinder as shown in fig 7 experiments in the water flume were also carried out for realistic objects in small scale and in real scale the experiments started under clear water conditions in clear water conditions s h s h c 1 the sediment is nearly stable in the far field of the object hence only the sediment close to the object is moved and the areas of erosion can be precisely detected after some time the experimental conditions were changed to live bed conditions here the sediment within the whole channel is moving and ripples are formed due to this the scour proceeds much faster and the realistic scenario with suspended particles can be reproduced the converged state of scour and partial burial is shown in fig 8 for the 1 5 model of the british 250lb general purpose bomb it is obvious that the scour structure and the burial depth are very similar to the corresponding results with a simple cylinder a scour trough is formed in front of the object and the accumulation area in the wake is connected directly to the object regarding the results for the original scale model of the 250lb general purpose bomb in fig 9 it is also shown that the scour structures can be transferred into original scale only the size of the overlaying ripples compared to the objects size differs from small scale 1 5 to original scale which is not significant for the burial process and the mobilisation of the objects the geometry and size of the mine shape objects differs significantly from the bomb shape objects and an ideal cylinder the shape of the mines is rather similar to a sphere it should be assumed that the scour structure and the burial may differ fig 10 shows the results from the flume tank experiments with a model of the german mine type gu in conjunction to the bomb shapes an ideal cylinder or a monopile a scour hole is formed in front of the object due to the presence of the horseshoe vortex however the accumulation area in the wake is slightly smaller for the mine than for the bombs or a cylinder nevertheless the accumulation can be seen as the mine shape also gets partially buried this accumulation area forms a barrier behind the object which is important for initial movement thus the model for initial movement described in section 2 2 is valid and can be used 3 2 mobilisation the current induced mobilisation has already been investigated by a large number of numerical simulations with and without scour and by laboratory experiments in the wind tunnel and in the small water channel of the university of rostock additionally an experimental calibration and validation of the models was done in original scale at the fast flow facility of hr wallingford for the wallingford experiments two different cylinder models and a model of the british 250lb general purpose bomb were used the results for the mobilisation tests at hr wallingford are shown in table 1 for the different object shapes with different masses all 287 experimental and numerical results are plotted in fig 11 the color of the symbols displays the type of object whereas the shape represents the different methods that were used remarkably all results are concentrated to the linear fit line in the plot whereas the black dashed line shows the best fit and the red and green lines show the upper and lower limits from the upper limit of the fit functions in fig 11 the parameters a 0 23 and b 2 1 are determined thus the overall final equation for the worst case critical incident velocity based on eq 27 can be written as 29 u crit ρ w g d avg v ρ obj ρ w 2 0 2315 μ 2 l 2 1137 μ ρ w 1 z b d avg 4 summary and discussion the behaviour of large uxo on the sea floor is strongly driven by hydrodynamic loads on these objects and the bed structure around them to understand the processes of mobilisation and migration a good knowledge of the predominant effects is needed to understand the hydrodynamic processes in the vicinity of such objects wind tunnel testings have been performed under conservation of the reynolds number experiments in the water channel at the university of rostock have been performed with sediment to observe the scour and burial of the same objects by knowing the scour and burial structures a mechanical model was developed to describe the current induced mobilisation of a cylindrical object by the moment factor m f in dependency of the reynolds number r e in fig 11 from this model the critical incident velocity on the object in dependency of few geometrical parameters was derived and shown in eq 27 the main task of all experiments and simulations was to quantify the parameters a and b from a fit function in fig 11 this was again done in the wind tunnel at real reynolds numbers by measuring the loads on the objects at different burial depths and incident velocities numerical simulations have been performed in the scale of the wind tunnel tests and the water channel experiments as well as in real scale to quantify the hydrodynamic loads on the objects mobilisation experiments in the small flume tank at the university of rostock and in the fff at hr wallingford were performed to determine the critical velocities for different objects in different scale and at different burial depths from the fit function in fig 11 the parameters a and b have been determined whereas the upper limit was chosen as a worst case scenario the final equation for the critical velocity on an arbitrary shaped cylinder like object is given in eq 29 the basic assumptions and requirements for the use and the limits of the model are a sandy non cohesive seabed the objects have to be at least partially buried an accumulation area is formed in the wake of the object flow through the sediment is neglected the influence of surface waves is neglected and the model cannot be applied to wave induced fluid velocities ripples dunes and the overall shape and slope of the seabed remain constant the influence of the water column above the object is neglected for practical application the model can be used to quantify the critical fluid velocity that is needed to mobilise objects on the sea floor by currents by monitoring or modelling the current an indication for a possible migration of uxo into an already cleared sea area can be given this can help to

23179,the aim of this work was to quantify the physical conditions required for the mobilisation of unexploded ordnance devices uxo on the sea floor as a basis for this the hydrodynamic processes around uxo were measured in the wind tunnel and the flume tank in terms of conditions especially reynolds numbers from these experiments the typical shape of a sandy sea floor in the close vicinity of an object due to current induced burial was determined knowing this the model for current induced mobilisation of objects was developed the model assumes a critical dimensionless moment factor m f a r e b where the parameters a and b had to be investigated this was accomplished by performing a total number of 287 numerical simulations wind tunnel testings and flume tank experiments at different geometric scale factors 1 10 1 5 1 2 and 1 1 with the parameter values so determined the model describes the critical situation of an arbitrary shaped cylinder like object regarding the incident flow velocity the immersed mass and the burial depth as well as the length and the volume averaged diameter of the object keywords mobility scour burial uxo piv lda cta light field camera sediment loads wind tunnel water channel cfd 1 introduction in many sea areas numerous unexploded ordnance devices uxo from previous wars contaminate sea floor they can be found buried in and on the sea bed these objects represent a major risk for life and equipment for all marine activities touching the sea bed such as fishery offshore installation effort mining and naval activities particularly the routes for subsea cables and pipelines are recommended to be surveyed and cleared of potentially dangerous objects prior to any installation effort to establish a safe working environment since the number of potential objects to be investigated is unknown time and cost for these campaigns cannot be quantified accurately this uncertainty can delay the subsequent installation effort and therefore increases the overall project risk this also applies for repair and maintenance activities as a route is assumed to be free of uxo only for a limited amount of time therefore a good knowledge about the physical requirements for the initial mobilisation of objects on the sea floor is needed to decide whether a previously cleared corridor can be assumed to be unchanged in this paper the requirements to mobilise uxo on the sea floor by currents are thus quantified this approach moves away from a temporal sign off to a physical event driven and quantifiable approach by understanding and describing the processes that make objects migrate on the sea floor according to wilkens and richardson 2007 cylindrical objects bedded on a sandy sea floor can be buried or partially buried by a series of different processes the burial process depends on a large number of variables as shown in jenkins et al 2007 within this context we distinguish between processes in the close vicinity of the object and those that also occur in the far field according to catano lopera et al 2007 jenkins et al 2007 and wilkens and richardson 2007 the far field processes like the bottom slope and the change due to dunes and ripples as well as the change of the structure of the seabed are independent of the presence of objects on the sea floor in contrast to this the near field processes depend on the presence of an object itself and variations in the fluid flow around it in particular the erosion of sediment the formation of scour and the accumulation of sediment depend on a large number of different parameters and boundary conditions which was described in wilkens and richardson 2007 jenkins et al 2007 shields 1936 and guyonic et al 2007 a model for the self burial of small objects was published in whitehouse 1998 which gives the burial depth of a cylinder of unknown size by time this model however requires the knowledge of the maximum burial depth due to scour induced self burial which is also given in whitehouse 1998 the maximum burial depths for small objects with diameters of up to d 10 5 c m and lengths of up to l 32 c m can be found in rennie et al 2017 a description of the physical processes for scour induced self burial of a cylindrical object on a sandy sea floor will be given in section 3 1 here a fully developed interaction between the object its environment and the fluid is found extensive investigations on the self burial and the mobilisation of small objects on the sea floor have been examined during the strategic environmental research and development program serdp models for the mobilisation of uxo have already been published in rennie et al 2017 for small objects in accelerating currents they assume a relatively small object size and thus may not necessarily be applied to larger objects besides this several models for the mobilisation of different objects on the sea floor were published by e g wiberg and smith 1985 nott 1997 nandasena and tanaka 2013 and noormets et al 2004 in contrast to the existing approaches that are restricted to small ranges of sizes and incident velocities in this study a general model was developed the mobilisation is described by a force balance model as the driving hydrodynamic loads can be scaled by the dimensionless reynolds number this was used to scale the objects sizes and the incident velocities thus the model was calibrated by experiments and numerical simulations within a range of 4 orders of magnitude of the reynolds number the model is therefore applicable at least within this range furthermore the exact shape of the individual object does not have to be known the general model requires only a few characteristic measures like the length the average diameter and the weight of the object consequently this approach is useful in a very wide range of applications and for unfamiliar objects 2 methods the transferability of the results from experimental analysis on small scale models to full scale is subject to numerous uncertainties with respect to this the conceptional preparation of the relevant laboratory tests is a considerable scientific challenge the choice of geometric kinematic and dynamic parameters of the down scaled model the sediment and the fluid flow plays a decisive role for the vortex and turbulence structures as well as for the characteristics of the wake of an object and the separation of the flow which all affect force loads on the object the reynolds number 1 r e u d ν with the incident velocity u the characteristic length scale d and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ν is the relevant dimensionless number for the initiation of sediment transport the particle froude number 2 f r p u ρ p ρ w ρ w g d p and the shields parameter 3 s h τ w ρ p ρ w g d p defined by shields 1936 with the densities of water ρ w and the particle ρ p the particle diameter d p the gravitational acceleration g and the wall shear stress τ w are the relevant numbers the critical shields parameter s h c is defined by the initial movement of the individual sediment from their definitions it is obvious that these numbers cannot all be conserved at the same time when scaling an object due to this it is necessary to prove that the results from the scaled water flume experiments can be transferred to the ocean the concept for this was to guarantee that the scaling of the sediment transport continues to be done by s h and f r p even though the reynolds number is much higher in the ocean than in the flume experiments extensive measurements of the ruling vortex structures like the horseshoe vortex and the recirculation vortex whose horizontal length again is a good measure for the separation at the object have been done in the water flume and in the wind tunnel the measurements in the wind tunnel were conducted at the same reynolds numbers as it can be found in the ocean 2 1 experimental facilities and techniques the near scale scour and mobilisation experiments were carried out in the flumetank of the university of rostock and for larger scale in the fast flow facility fff at hr wallingford 1 1 in cooperation with prof richard whitehouse at hydraulic research wallingford howbery park wallingford oxfordshire ox10 8ba united kingdom the goal was to determine the maximum burial depth of the objects the scour pattern due to a constant

1 current induced self burial the current induced scour and burial of cylindrical objects on the sea floor has been investigated for 1 10 scale and was published in menzel et al 2014 menzel et al 2013 menzel and leder 2014 and menzel et al 2015 to predict the mobilisation of objects on the sea floor a cylindrical object is the simplest case and can be used for generalisation as the processes are better defined and comparable results from international publications are available e g whitehouse 1998 mazumder et al 2011 fig 6 shows the scour structure close to the cylindrical model it is obvious that the typical scour trough in front of the cylinder the scour around and under the ends and a small accumulation area in the wake of the object are formed due to the low incident velocity in the experiment the amount of suspended sediment is small compared to the experiments of menzel and leder 2014 thus the accumulation is a bit smaller because it depends on suspended sediment that enters the recirculation area by overflowing the object nevertheless the results are in accordance to the scour structure published in menzel et al 2015 which is shown in fig 7 to confirm that the scour and burial of the individual objects are quite similar to those of a simple cylinder as shown in fig 7 experiments in the water flume were also carried out for realistic objects in small scale and in real scale the experiments started under clear water conditions in clear water conditions s h s h c 1 the sediment is nearly stable in the far field of the object hence only the sediment close to the object is moved and the areas of erosion can be precisely detected after some time the experimental conditions were changed to live bed conditions here the sediment within the whole channel is moving and ripples are formed due to this the scour proceeds much faster and the realistic scenario with suspended particles can be reproduced the converged state of scour and partial burial is shown in fig 8 for the 1 5 model of the british 250lb general purpose bomb it is obvious that the scour structure and the burial depth are very similar to the corresponding results with a simple cylinder a scour trough is formed in front of the object and the accumulation area in the wake is connected directly to the object regarding the results for the original scale model of the 250lb general purpose bomb in fig 9 it is also shown that the scour structures can be transferred into original scale only the size of the overlaying ripples compared to the objects size differs from small scale 1 5 to original scale which is not significant for the burial process and the mobilisation of the objects the geometry and size of the mine shape objects differs significantly from the bomb shape objects and an ideal cylinder the shape of the mines is rather similar to a sphere it should be assumed that the scour structure and the burial may differ fig 10 shows the results from the flume tank experiments with a model of the german mine type gu in conjunction to the bomb shapes an ideal cylinder or a monopile a scour hole is formed in front of the object due to the presence of the horseshoe vortex however the accumulation area in the wake is slightly smaller for the mine than for the bombs or a cylinder nevertheless the accumulation can be seen as the mine shape also gets partially buried this accumulation area forms a barrier behind the object which is important for initial movement thus the model for initial movement described in section 2 2 is valid and can be used 3 2 mobilisation the current induced mobilisation has already been investigated by a large number of numerical simulations with and without scour and by laboratory experiments in the wind tunnel and in the small water channel of the university of rostock additionally an experimental calibration and validation of the models was done in original scale at the fast flow facility of hr wallingford for the wallingford experiments two different cylinder models and a model of the british 250lb general purpose bomb were used the results for the mobilisation tests at hr wallingford are shown in table 1 for the different object shapes with different masses all 287 experimental and numerical results are plotted in fig 11 the color of the symbols displays the type of object whereas the shape represents the different methods that were used remarkably all results are concentrated to the linear fit line in the plot whereas the black dashed line shows the best fit and the red and green lines show the upper and lower limits from the upper limit of the fit functions in fig 11 the parameters a 0 23 and b 2 1 are determined thus the overall final equation for the worst case critical incident velocity based on eq 27 can be written as 29 u crit ρ w g d avg v ρ obj ρ w 2 0 2315 μ 2 l 2 1137 μ ρ w 1 z b d avg 4 summary and discussion the behaviour of large uxo on the sea floor is strongly driven by hydrodynamic loads on these objects and the bed structure around them to understand the processes of mobilisation and migration a good knowledge of the predominant effects is needed to understand the hydrodynamic processes in the vicinity of such objects wind tunnel testings have been performed under conservation of the reynolds number experiments in the water channel at the university of rostock have been performed with sediment to observe the scour and burial of the same objects by knowing the scour and burial structures a mechanical model was developed to describe the current induced mobilisation of a cylindrical object by the moment factor m f in dependency of the reynolds number r e in fig 11 from this model the critical incident velocity on the object in dependency of few geometrical parameters was derived and shown in eq 27 the main task of all experiments and simulations was to quantify the parameters a and b from a fit function in fig 11 this was again done in the wind tunnel at real reynolds numbers by measuring the loads on the objects at different burial depths and incident velocities numerical simulations have been performed in the scale of the wind tunnel tests and the water channel experiments as well as in real scale to quantify the hydrodynamic loads on the objects mobilisation experiments in the small flume tank at the university of rostock and in the fff at hr wallingford were performed to determine the critical velocities for different objects in different scale and at different burial depths from the fit function in fig 11 the parameters a and b have been determined whereas the upper limit was chosen as a worst case scenario the final equation for the critical velocity on an arbitrary shaped cylinder like object is given in eq 29 the basic assumptions and requirements for the use and the limits of the model are a sandy non cohesive seabed the objects have to be at least partially buried an accumulation area is formed in the wake of the object flow through the sediment is neglected the influence of surface waves is neglected and the model cannot be applied to wave induced fluid velocities ripples dunes and the overall shape and slope of the seabed remain constant the influence of the water column above the object is neglected for practical application the model can be used to quantify the critical fluid velocity that is needed to mobilise objects on the sea floor by currents by monitoring or modelling the current an indication for a possible migration of uxo into an already cleared sea area can be given this can help to
