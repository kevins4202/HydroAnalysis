19910,gravity driven membrane gdm filtration is a strategic alternative to conventional ultrafiltration uf for the resilient production of drinking water via ultrafiltration when resources become scarce given the low dependency on energy and chemicals and longer membrane lifetime implementation at large scale requires the use of compact and low cost membrane modules with high biopolymer removal capacity we therefore evaluated 1 to what extent stable flux can be obtained with compact membrane modules i e inside out hollow fiber membranes and frequent gravity driven backwash 2 whether we can reduce membrane expenses by effectively utilizing second life uf modules i e modules that have been discarded by treatment plant operators because they are no longer under warranty 3 if biopolymer removal could be maintained when applying a frequent backwash and with second life modules and 4 which gdm filtration scenarios are economically viable compared to conventional uf when considering the influence of new or second life modules membrane lifetime stable flux value and energy pricing our findings showed that it was possible to maintain stable fluxes around 10 l m2 h with both new and second life modules for 142 days but a daily gravity driven backwash was necessary and sufficient to compensate the continuous flux drop observed with compact modules in addition the backwash did not affect the biopolymer removal costs calculations revealed two significant findings 1 using second life modules made gdm filtration membrane investment less expensive than conventional uf despite the higher module requirements for gdm filtration and 2 overall costs of gdm filtration with a gravity driven backwash were unaffected by energy prices rise while conventional uf costs rose significantly the later increased the number of economically viable gdm filtration scenarios including scenarios with new modules in summary we proposed an approach that could make gdm filtration in centralized facilities feasible and increase the range of uf operating conditions to better adapt to increasing environmental and societal constraints graphical abstract image graphical abstract

the doi of the data package is provided in the manuscript 1 introduction in a context of energy constraints and issues with chemical or membrane supply the implementation of gravity driven membrane gdm filtration as an alternative to conventional ultrafiltration uf is particularly relevant conventional uf consumes 0 01 0 07 kwh m3 representing considerable annual costs for a treatment plants when uf is the main treatment especially given the current rise in energy prices hawari et al 2020 santos et al 2021 also in a context of electricity shortage the energy requirements for conventional uf could constraint drinking water production mišík 2022 instead gdm filtration eliminates the need for filtration pumps and chemicals and extends membrane lifetime significantly reducing filtration energy demand and securing operation in the event of resource scarcity pronk et al 2019 however gdm filtration is still regarded as an approach only relevant for decentralized facilities due to 1 the low compactness of gdm systems which are frequently implemented with flat sheet modules or outside in hollow fiber hf modules with low packing density and 2 low steady flux values resulting in higher membrane investment costs compared to conventional uf pronk et al 2019 stoffel et al 2022 investigating how to achieve high flux values with compact membrane geometry modules while identifying a suitable approach to make the process economically viable compared to conventional uf is crucial to move toward the implementation of gdm filtration at centralized facilities applying gdm filtration with highly compact membrane modules results in a significant flux reduction making the process irrelevant for centralized facilities stoffel et al 2022 for instance flux was reduced from 15 2 to 8 5 l m2 h when increasing the packing density of modules with outside in hf membranes from 352 m2 m3 to 2151 m2 m3 wu et al 2017 in another study highly compact spiral wound reverse osmosis ro modules that had undergone chemical conversion into uf like modules had a flux of 1 5 l m2 h when filtering deionized water at a transmembrane pressure tmp of 0 16 bar garcía pacheco et al 2021 this stable flux value is insufficient for centralized facilities furthermore the filtration tests conducted by garcía pacheco et al 2021 may not be long enough to estimate the real stable flux of spiral wound modules operated in gdm filtration the tests only lasted 360 min while the characteristic time to reach a stable flux during gdm filtration is usually of 5 7 days pronk et al 2019 additionally spiral wounded modules are rather compact in design membrane layers are separated by a distance of about 1 mm and even after 5 days of operation the flux will likely continue to decline indeed in a recent work we showed that for modules equipped with inside out hf having an inner diameter of 0 9 mm and operated with relaxation and forward flush the flux constantly decreased at a rate of 0 16 l m2 h d during the 125 days of the experiment and the final flux was between 0 and 2 l m2 h stoffel et al 2022 by applying a one time gravity driven backwash we were however able to temporarily increase the flux and therefore suggested intermittent backwash might be effective to operate gdm systems with inside out hf membranes at a stable flux nonetheless it is yet unknown if frequent backwash can successfully balance the continuous flux decline observed for compact membrane modules such as for modules with inside out hf membranes if membranes with more compact geometries can be successfully operated at a high stable flux for gdm filtration around 10 l m2 h such flux will remain significantly smaller than the flux of conventional uf in centralized facilities the rise in membrane investment costs would have severe adverse economic effects on the drinking water treatment plant pronk et al 2019 a relevant strategy to lower membrane investment costs is to refurbished uf modules refurbishing modules is being researched in the context of conventional uf but using ro and nanofiltration modules chemically converted into uf like modules lawler et al 2013 senán salinas et al 2019 the use of recycled spiral wound ro modules for gdm filtration did however result in low flux values as previously discussed garcía pacheco et al 2021 therefore refurbished ro and nanofiltration modules would be difficult to use for gdm filtration in centralized facilities using decommissioned uf modules recovered from the drinking water industry that passed the membrane integrity test or second life modules is an unexplored possibility to lower the membrane investment costs of gdm filtration the uf modules are frequently discarded not because of any notable problems with their integrity but mainly because they have reached the end of their warranty period or because their permeability has decreased consequently discarded uf modules represent a significant resource of good quality modules for recycling the question that this innovative approach poses is whether or not membrane aging results in lower fluxes than new membranes when used in gdm filtration mode because initial permeability could be reduced robinson et al 2016 it is essential to ensure that performing repeated backwashes and employing second life modules do not adversely affect the biopolymer removal compared to gdm filtration with no maintenance and new modules as it is a main asset of gdm filtration ranieri et al 2023 biopolymer retention is partly due to the membrane retention in gdm filtration between 20 and 40 of the biopolymers are removed by the membrane stoffel et al 2022 however major part of the removal is due to the biofilm establishment at the surface of the membrane derlon et al 2014 pronk et al 2019 the biofilm acts as a secondary biologically active barrier that can better retain and biodegrade biopolymers chomiak et al 2015 park et al 2016 the enhanced biopolymer removal reported for in presence of biofilm compared to virgin membrane therefore helps improving the permeate biological stability such enhanced biopolymer removal by gdm systems also has the potential to increase the efficiency of post treatment such as reverse osmosis or photocatalysis as biopolymers are major membrane foulants and phototacalysis quenchers akhondi et al 2015 maghsoodi et al 2019 yin et al 2020 from one hand applying a frequent backwash could affect the biofilm thickness and membrane coverage biofilm instability brought by the backwash has been observed with optical coherence tomography oct by shao et al 2018 oct images showed exposed virgin membrane or areas deprived of a biofilm which may lead to lower biopolymer removal following backwash in contrast wu et al 2019 found no relationship between the length of the backwash and the removal of the biopolymers therefore it is unknown how a regular backwash might impact gdm filtration s ability to remove biopolymers on the other hand it is unclear if biopolymer removal would be adversely impacted by the usage of second life modules as extensive chemical cleaning of conventional uf modules could result in decreased dissolved organic removal compared to new membrane due to membrane aging which manifests through material elongation pore expansion and the occurrence of breaches regula et al 2014 in definitive it is crucial to further research on the potential impacts of these maintenance and cost reduction practices on gdm filtration s ability to remove biopolymers the main purpose of this study was to evaluate how to tackle the main challenges associated with the implementation of gdm filtration in centralized drinking water facilities 1 maintain a stable flux with membranes having a compact geometry 2 decrease membrane investment costs and 3 ensure high biopolymer removal for this purpose we first investigated the effect of gravity driven backwash frequency on the flux of modules equipped with 7 capillaries inside out hollow fiber hf membranes having an inner diameter of 0 9 mm to reduce membrane investment costs of gdm filtration we examined whether second life membranes performed similarly to new membranes using the optimal backwash frequency identified based on filtration flux values in addition to flux measurements we assessed the impact of backwash frequency and module type on the permeate quality when measuring the removal of biopolymers afterwards we compared the costs of conventional uf gdm filtration with new membranes and gdm filtration with second life membranes in various scenarios more particularly we calculated the membrane investment costs and the operating expenditures opex corresponding to energy requirements and chemical cleaning considering several factors membrane types membrane lifetime stable flux and energy prices 2 material and methods 2 1 new and second life uf modules characteristics modules equipped with 0 9 mm multibore membranes from dupont were used in this study table 1 multibore membranes are modified polyether sulfone pes hollow fiber membranes with a pore size of 20 nm one fiber consists of seven separate capillaries with an inner capillary diameter of 0 9 mm we prepared two types of lab scale modules containing 0 9 mm 7 capillaries hf membranes in a polyvinyl chloride pvc shelf for our experiments 1 modules equipped with new membranes and 2 modules equipped with second life membranes collected from a dizzer xl 0 9 mb 80 wt module taken from a drinking water treatment which is not named here for privacy concerns table 1 the dizzer xl 0 9 mb 80 wt module had been in operation for five years to treat reservoir water and was replaced because its warranty had expired to ensure reproducibility of the experiment we chemically cleaned the second life modules before use following the procedure described in supplementary data section 1 2 2 experimental set up the experimental set up is described in fig 1 the feed water was river water pumped from the river chriesbach dübendorf switzerland into a sedimentation tank with a volume and a residence time of 155 l and 100 min respectively the supernatant of the sedimentation tank flowed into the raw water channel volume of 240 l the raw water channel level was adjusted to 80 cm to reach an average tmp of 150 mbar given that modules are 140 cm long as chosen previously stoffel et al 2022 table 2 presents the characteristics of the raw water after the sedimentation tank the inflow and outflow pipes of the installed modules were equipped with magnetic 3 way valves connected to timers to apply programmed maintenances since the backwash was conducted with permeate the produced permeate was collected and pumped to the backwash channel volume of 80 l the water level of the backwash tank was set to 280 cm to reach an average tmp of 350 mbar given that modules are 140 cm long 2 3 operating strategies different backwash frequencies were studied i no backwash nbw ii backwash every two weeks 2wbw iii weekly backwash wbw and iv daily backwash dbw the backwash procedure was established based on previous study and consisted of two sequential backflushes with a water head of 280 cm with a 1 min break in between stoffel et al 2022 each backflush lasted 2 min to ensure a sufficient flushing of the biofilm debris during the first minute of the backflush the upper backwash line was opened to remove particulate matter accumulated on top of the module during the second minute the lower backwash line was additionally opened based on the results from our previous study we also applied a daily relaxation 55 min followed by a forward flush 5 min r ff to all modules oka et al 2017 stoffel et al 2022 2 4 backwash with increased pressures at the end of the experiment we designed a one time backwash experiment to determine whether higher biofilm removal resulted in a lower biopolymer elimination on the short term using the backwash procedure described in section 2 3 1 the experiment was conducted on dbw1 new 2wbw1 new and dbw1 sl at day 142 it consisted in three sequential backwash procedures at different tmp 350 400 and 600 mbar the backwash at 350 mbar was gravity driven and we used a pump to apply a tmp of 400 and 600 mbar the tss collected during each backflush were measured as indicator of biofilm removal after each backwash procedure we waited three hydraulic retention times hrt of each module to sample raw water and permeate and measured their respective biopolymer concentrations calculations explanations in section 2 of supplementary data for this experiment we enriched the river water in the feed water canal with secondary effluent of the wastewater treatment plant of eawag dübendorf switzerland to enhance the biopolymer concentration and increase the removal calculation accuracy given the lcocd detection limit during the experiment the dissolved organic carbon and biopolymer concentrations in the feed water tank were equal to 3 5 mgc l and 222 μg l respectively all experiments and maintenances applied in the current study are listed in table 3 2 5 measurements and calculations daily flux measurements were taken to evaluate the productivity of each module the produced permeate was collected twice a day for 3 h before and after the maintenance and weighted on a scale the flux was calculated using the darcy law and normalized at 20 c using the temperature in the raw water channel measured with a portable device wtw multi 3630 ids set ks2 field case w o sensor tss amount in backflush water was used as an indicator for biofilm removal during the backwash procedure as in situ observation of the biofilm in the lumen was not possible without module sacrifice the tss were measured once per week for one module per backwash frequency and module type using the apha standard method apha 2005 every two weeks we monitored influent and permeate quality for one module per frequency and module type using liquid chromatography coupled with organic carbon detection lcocd to quantify the biopolymer removal this method separates the dissolved organic carbon into five different fractions and quantifies them i e biopolymers 20 kda humics 1 2 kda building blocks 0 5 1 kda low molecular weight organic acids and neutrals 0 35 0 5 kda the separation is based on the molecular size and occurs in the chromatographic column monnot et al 2016 more details on the instrument and method are available elsewhere huber et al 2011 jacquin et al 2020 the samples were taken around 2 h after the maintenance 2 6 statistical analysis the average values and standard deviations of the stable flux and biopolymer removal were calculated based on visual observation and selection of the stabilized period values were compared using wilcoxon test given that the data were independent and not normally distributed see section 4 in supplementary data outliers were not considered in the calculation using the procedure described in stoffel et al 2022 specifically the value below q1 1 5 iqr and above q3 1 5 iqr were not considered for calculation q1 and q3 correspond to the 25th quantile and 75th quantile respectively iqr is the interquantile range i e the difference between q3 and q1 2 7 costs calculations we evaluated the cost of membranes and the opex for several energy costs to generate 1000 m3 h over a 25 year period costs in order to compare them and assess the economic viability of gdm filtration compared to conventional uf all calculations were made with a membrane surface of 80 m2 as it is the membrane surface of dizzer xl 0 9 mb 80 wt modules equipped with the membrane tested in the present study the number of modules for each scenario was calculated

inge dupont is submitted to confidentiality the membrane costs scenarios using second life modules were estimated as 5 5 times lower than new modules this price includes the cleaning and quality check

different energy costs given that europe is facing unprecedent energy costs increase which might continue in the future as a consequence we considered three energetic scenarios i e different costs per

s2 in supplementary data section 5 we compared the scenarios listed in table 4 we set the lifetime of conventional uf modules to 8 years based on inge dupont expertise reflecting typical replacement rate in drinking water treatment plants this lifetime can be explained by membrane aging leading to permeability reduction and or integrity loss due to pressure rating and chemical stress zondervan and roffel 2008 verrecht et al 2010 for the gdm modules there are no references on membrane lifetime since that this approach has only been used in practice for a decade in the present study we hypothesized that the gdm modules would have a longer lifetime than conventional uf modules due to the absence of chemical cleaning and pressure rating pronk et al 2019 in particular we set membrane lifetimes of 15 and 25 years to discuss the impact of this parameter on the membrane investment costs in addition to evaluate the lifetime effect on the membrane investment costs we proceeded to calculations with different stable flux values to evaluate the effect of feed water quality on the membrane investment costs as the stable flux is dependent on the dissolved organic composition of the feed water pronk et al 2019 we used the 10 l m2 h as a reference value for values obtained in the present study with river water i e daily backwash new and second life membranes the other flux values used for calculations are in line with what might be possible using different feed waters peter varbanets et al 2010 all raw data collected for the study are available at https doi org 10 25678 000830 3 results and discussion 3 1 intermittent gravity driven backwash as a strategy to use inside out hollow fiber membranes for gdm filtration 3 1 1 effect of gravity driven backwash on the flux and productivity gravity driven backwash is a relevant strategy to compensate the continuous flux drop observed during the operation without backwash and leading to a low stable flux as observed in fig 2 a in the present study the flux of never backwashed modules dropped to 1 4 0 6 l m2 h at day 142 which is comparable to the flux measured by stoffel et al 2022 after 125 days of operation between 0 and 2 l m2 h the higher the backwash frequency the more stable and the higher the flux specifically application of a daily gravity driven backwash helped stabilizing the flux at 10 6 2 0 l m2 h after 20 days of operation at a tmp of 150 mbar fig 2d this stable flux value was within the same range as what was observed when flat sheet membranes i e low compactness were utilized in dead end to filter the same type of water as in the present investigation peter varbanets et al 2010 desmond et al 2018a when the backwash was applied every two weeks or weekly the flux was improved but then dropped at a similar rate for both backwash frequencies p value 0 5 equal to 0 63 0 30 l m2 h d and 0 58 0 32 l m2 h d respectively fig 2b and 2c our results demonstrate that the use of compact membrane geometries such as hollow fibers for gdm filtration is possible only if a backwash is applied at a frequency that balances the continuous flux drop triggered by high module compactness the implementation of a membrane module with compact geometry comes with additional costs related to the daily backwash compared to gdm filtration without maintenance oka et al 2017 however since we showed that the daily backwash could be gravity driven backwash costs could be minimized the energy to pump the permeate to the backwash tank is height time lower than the energy required for a pressurized backwash the consumption of permeate for backwash is another crucial factor to consider in order to evaluate the approach discussed in our study because it lowers plant productivity gdm filtration gravity driven backwash would require 3 of the daily production against 7 and 4 with a pressurized backwash of gdm filtration and conventional uf based on calculations with values from table s1 respectively therefore the permeate requirements for gravity driven backwash gdm filtration are on level with those for conventional uf these requirements are even lower than requirements found in literature conventional uf pressurized backwash can consume up to 10 of permeate given that modules are backwashed every 30 min to 4 h for 1 to 5 min brügger et al 2001 chang et al 2017 3 1 2 link between flux recovery and tss removal from the lumen through gravity driven backwash in parallel to flux measurements we systematically evaluated the link between flux recovery after each backwash and the amount of tss collected in the backwash water to understand the flux dynamic observed for the different backwash frequencies fig 3 the flux recovery triggered by the backwash was linked to the removal of tss from the hf lumen fig 3 the higher the amount of tss removed the higher the flux recovery r2 of 0 646 p value 1 10 7 for weekly and every two weeks backwash conditions the removal of tss was around 6 times higher than for the daily backwash however removing less tss at once by increasing backwash frequency was more strategic to maintain a stable flux these results highlight that the accumulation of tss in the lumen triggers the continuous flux drop observed with compact membrane geometries in our study the accumulation of tss was likely linked to biofilm growth given the low turbidity in the feed water and the small size of particles compared to the lumen table 2 for low backwash frequencies the fiber lumen was progressively obstructed as the biofilm grew reducing water flow in the lumen and causing flux drop we expect that organics causing irreversible membrane fouling i e that cannot be eliminated by the backwash e g humic substances played a limited role on the flux drop compared to the biofilm previous studies reported that 80 to 90 of the resistance in gdm systems equipped with flat sheet membranes is due to biofilm and depends on biofilm physico chemical properties desmond et al 2018c jafari et al 2018 in the context of compact membranes the proportion of the biofilm resistance could even be higher due to lumen blockage the limited role of organics in flux drop is also supported by the fact that the mean hydraulic resistances at the beginning and end of the period of stable flux first and last 20d of the daily backwashed modules are similar 2 9 1012 0 5 1012 1 m and 2 8 1012 0 6 1012 1 m respectively p value 0 07 significant irreversible fouling would have gradually increased the hydraulic resistance as observed in conventional uf gao et al 2011 zheng et al 2014 similar hydraulic resistance at the start and end of the steady flux period further demonstrates that the daily backwash has no detrimental effects on the biofilm over the 142 days of the study the flux was improved by the gravity driven backwash without having triggered biofilm acclimation which would have gradually decreased the flux wu et al 2019 observed that membrane resistance increased from 3 5 1012 1 m to 5 1012 1 m between modules operated without backwash and modules operated with a 2 min backwash applied at different intervals respectively the increase of resistance could be explained by biofilm adaptation to the shear stress which enhances the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances and promotes self reorganization derlon et al 2016 de vries et al 2021 for instance derlon et al 2022 showed that the biofilm became more cohesive and elastic as a result of surface shear stress brought on by cross flow maintenance the absence of hydraulic resistance increase in our study might be due to the fact that hydraulic resistance of compact modules might be more dependent on fiber blockage than on the characteristics of the biofilm to better understand the cause of the continuous flux drop more studies of biofilm characteristics using methods like oct would be particularly interesting desmond et al 2018a 2018b 2018c fortunato et al 2020 as the biofilm develops in the fibers lumen this would necessitate the sacrifice of the modules in conclusion we successfully demonstrated that maintaining high stable flux values 10 l m2 h with compact membrane geometry i e inside out hf with an inner diameter of 0 9 mm is possible with a daily gravity driven backwash implemented to control biofilm growth in the fiber s lumen 3 2 potential of second life modules as an alternative for new modules in gdm filtration systems 3 2 1 comparison of second life and new membrane properties before gdm filtration experiments to compensate the cost increase linked to lower flux compared to conventional uf we assessed if modules with second life membranes had similar filtration performance than modules with new membranes beforehand we compared their permeability and noticed that the permeability of second life modules was 19 lower in average than the permeability of new modules table 1 we then proceeded to sem imaging of the inside and outside of new and second life membranes fig 4 the sem images revealed that there were distinct surface properties between new and second life membranes despite identical membrane elaboration process the inside surface of the new membrane appeared smoother than that of the second life membrane except for some visible gray spots in fig 4a however these spots were likely artifacts caused by the sample preparation process on the other hand the inside surface of the second life membrane displayed more visible pores which may be due to frequent chemical cleaning that enlarges the pores as reported in previous studies regula et al 2014 li et al 2021 changes of surface properties were also visible on the outside of the membrane the outside surface of the second life membrane was found to be rougher than the outside of the new membrane with a higher pore density like for the inside this could be also be due to aging of the membrane linked to chemical cleaning in addition deposits and blocked particles were observed in the outside pores of the second life membrane see fig s5 in supplementary data which could explain the differences in permeability between the new and second life membranes the changes observed between new and second life membranes are consistent with literature where membrane properties change when soaking them in naocl robinson and bérubé 2021 finally these findings confirm that new and second life membranes have noticeable surface physical differences which could affect the gdm filtration performance in terms of flux and biopolymer removal 3 2 2 flux of second life modules operated in gdm filtration mode we monitored the permeate flux over several weeks of modules equipped with second life 0 9 mm inside out 7 capillaries hf operated in gdm filtration with a daily gravity driven backwash fig 5 after 20 days of operation we observed that the flux of modules with second life membranes stabilized at 9 2 1 4 l m2 h until day 142 i e 13 lower than the flux value measured for modules with new membranes wilcoxon test p value 2 10 16 fig 2d this value remains close to the value obtained with modules with new membranes and is comparable to the flux of other gdm systems run with new membranes and river water as feed peter varbanets et al 2010 in addition second life membranes allowed us to achieve a stable flux value that was significantly larger than the flux that was measured by garcía pacheco et al 2021 with reconditioned ro modules a lower permeability for second life modules than for new modules at the start of the experiment could account for this minor stable flux difference over long term between new and second life modules table 1 this flux difference was however minimal and could quickly be reduced over time with a decrease of new membranes permeability during operation regula et al 2013 studied the aging of hollow fiber membranes in pure water with and without sodium bisulfite the authors showed no decrease of permeability after 30 days of aging while it was reduced by 26 after 180 days of operation irrespective the presence of biocide as observed for modules with new membranes the hydraulic resistance measured for modules with second life membranes daily backwashed was similar in the first and last 20 days operation it was equal to 3 2 1012 0 6 1011 1 m and 3 0 1012 0 5 1011 respectively wilcoxon test p value 7 3 10 7 it demonstrates that daily gravity backwash is effective at improving the flux of modules with second life membranes without having an adverse long term effect on resistance as observed for modules equipped with new membranes finally the permeate consumption was similar to gdm filtration with new modules representing only 2 of the daily production when considering an average backwash flux of 74 l m2 h contrary to what was observed by cogan et al 2022 the authors reported that membrane aging induces higher backwash frequency and duration last but not least comparable to gdm filtration with new membranes we did not notice biofilm adaptation to the backwash as indicated by the similar hydraulic resistance at the beginning end of the period of stable flux in conclusion modules with second life modules perform as well as modules with new membranes in terms of filtration the initial membrane properties have a limited effect on the flux given that most of the resistance is due to the biofilm independently of the type of membranes pronk et al 2019 3 3 impact of the gravity driven backwash frequency and use of second life membranes on the biopolymer removal 3 3 1 long term biopolymer removal trends throughout the entire experiment we monitored biopolymer removal over time for the modules with new membranes backwashed at different frequencies and for the modules with second life modules exposed to daily backwash conditions fig 6 the first key result is that the initial removal of the modules equipped with new membranes and with second life membranes equal to 21 dbw1 new and 11 dbw1 sl respectively this means that membrane aging impacted the membrane retention of biopolymers similar result was observed for aged pes membranes expose to chlorine pes membranes used in the milk industry has been reported to lead to milk protein leakage regula et al 2014 this difference in retention performance could be explained by the increased pore density observed by sem and decreased retention due to pore widening li et al 2021 then all modules showed an increase in biopolymer removal with time until reaching a plateau after 20 days of operation this trend is typical from gdm filtration systems and is explained by the progressive establishment of the biofilm at the membrane surface until the biofilm reaches equilibrium state corresponding to a stable biopolymer removal stoffel et al 2022 when the plateau was reached we observed two points corresponding to a biopolymer removal of 50 5 and 35 5 for the never backwashed new module and daily backwashed second life module respectively we however ruled these values outliers as they were lower than the q1 1 5 iqr calculated with all removal values of the plateau period fig 6 without the outliers the biopolymer removal average was statistically identical for all modules irrespective the backwash frequency and the module type table s5 in supplementation data the mean biopolymer removal of all modules was equal to 81 8 8 6 which is similar to the removal observed for gdm systems equipped with flat sheet membranes never backwashed chomiak et al 2015 pronk et al 2019 it means that even if biofilm is removed from the lumen during the backwash as we observed through tss removal the biopolymer removal remained at high level another important result is that the biopolymer removal trend and values for modules equipped with both new and second life membranes was similar despite different initial removal values this confirms that the presence of biofilm is the primary factor driving biopolymer removal even if membrane aging results in lower initial removal 3 3 2 short term effect of increased tss removal by gravity driven backwash on the biopolymer elimination the backwash may have a negative effect on biopolymer removal on the short term since it could destabilize the biofilm as observed by shao et al 2018 we noticed that increasing the amount of biofilm tss removed from the lumen through successive backwashes at higher tmp had a slight impact on the short term removal of biopolymers fig 7 we found a significant linear relationship between the biopolymer removal and the amount of tss removed by the backwash which increased with the backwash tmp p value 2 10 4 r2 0 764 consequently the higher the tss removed the lower the biopolymer removal in addition fig 7 shows three key results 1 the daily gravity driven backwash 350 mbar had no short term negative consequences on the biopolymer removal 2 backwash at higher pressure only slightly decreased the biopolymer removal but it remained above 67 which is 47 to 57 higher than the initial removal obtained for modules with new and second life membranes respectively and 3 the performance of new membrane modules and second life modules were similar as observed for the long term biopolymer removal and for the flux these results mean that in practice it would be possible to use modules with second life membranes and increase the backwash tmp without negatively affecting the permeate quality therefore a significant conclusion of our study is that gdm filtration could be carried out with second life modules without affecting the filtration performance due to high stable flux and biopolymer removal values which were likewise found for gdm filtration with new modules 3 4 gdm filtration scenarios economically viable compared to conventional uf our experimental results demonstrated that modules with second life membranes have comparable performance than modules with new membranes in terms of both stable flux and biopolymer removal the next step was to identify under which scenario gdm filtration could represent a relevant alternative to conventional uf for centralized facilities rather than a niche application for decentralized facilities only pronk et al 2019 indeed stated that gdm filtration is confined to decentralized systems given the high membrane investment costs compared to conventional uf in a recent study calculating the membrane investment costs and operating costs of a gdm filtration home system using refurbished ro modules the authors estimated that the costs of gdm filtration and uf systems could be equivalent garcía pacheco et al 2021 however these data were provided for decentralized facilities and the stable flux values are noticeably low and may have been overstated due the extremely short filtration test duration as previously mentioned fig 8 compares the membrane costs for membrane and the opex per m3 of conventional uf gdm with new membranes and gdm filtration with second life membranes for different stable flux values and membrane lifetime in this figure we also compared the impact of different energy pricing on the opex the membrane costs of uf was equal to 0 54 cents m3 when considering a membrane lifetime of 8 years and a stable flux of 70 l m2 h to be competitive in terms of membrane investment costs gdm filtration costs should therefore be lower than 0 54 cents m3 when considering a gdm filtration stable flux of 10 l m2 h as observed in our study the membrane costs of gdm filtration with second life modules was 14 and 57 lower than for conventional uf when considering a membrane lifetime of 15 and 25 years respectively other scenarios had lower membrane investments costs such as gdm filtration with second life modules at a stable flux of 7 5 and 5 0 l m2 h and a membrane lifetime of 25 years these findings show that there are cases where gdm filtration could be less expensive than conventional uf despite higher surface membrane requirements for gdm filtration the significant difference in membrane prices between gdm filtration using second life modules and conventional uf is explained by reduced module costs 5 5 times lower and a lower replacement rate for the gdm membranes over a period of 25 years conventional uf modules were replaced three times versus twice and once for gdm membranes replaced after 25 and 15 years of operation however we confirmed that regardless of the lifespan of gdm membranes membrane investment costs of new modules remained greater than with conventional uf as reported by pronk et al 2019 nevertheless extending gdm membrane lifetime of new modules from 15 to 25 years made gdm filtration more appealing by lowering membrane costs across all scenarios for instance the membrane costs of gdm filtration with new modules having a stable flux of 10 l m2 h were reduced from 2 59 to 1 29 cents m3 when considering a lifetime extension from 15 to 25 years conducting further research on how to accurately estimate the lifespan of modules used in gdm filtration new and second life could assist in determining the actual cost benefits as compared to conventional uf the stable flux value also played a significant role in the membrane investment costs given that the lower the stable flux the higher the required number of modules for instance at a stable flux of 2 5 l m2 h and a lifetime of 15 years membrane investment costs of gdm filtration with new and second life modules were equal to 12 and 2 cents m3 respectively these costs are considerably higher than membrane investment costs of conventional uf to evaluate the economic viability of gdm filtration scenarios we then considered the impact of opex changes due to energy pricing evolution at an energy pricing of 50 mwh price in 2020 we could observe that the determinant factor for the total costs was membrane investment costs for both conventional uf and gdm filtration as the opex was equal to 0 13 cents m3 for conventional uf and 1 6 10 3 cents m3 for gdm filtration costs not visible with the scale chosen for fig 8 the opex only accounted for 19 in the case of conventional uf while for gdm filtration it was less than 0 3 depending on the scenario however in a situation where energy pricing skyrocketed because of lack of energy autonomy in europe 500 mwh august 2022 the opex accounted for 70 of the total costs of conventional uf and therefore became a determinant cost factor gdm filtration on the other hand was unaffected by the rise in energy prices despite the use of a pump to increase the permeate water head for the gravity driven backwash in the event that the energy situation worsens in the future and prices reach values as high as 1000 mwh other new gdm filtration scenarios would be advantageous compared to conventional uf gdm filtration operating at stable flux of 7 5 and 5 0 l m2 h gdm filtration using new membrane modules with a stable flux of 10 0 l m2 h would even be less expensive than conventional uf such scenarios are relevant to consider as a projected energy cost of 1000 mwh may become a reality in the future given the other factors that are currently threatening non carbonated energy self sufficiency such as droughts that decrease the electricity generation of hydropower plants thaler and hofmann 2022 turner et al 2022 our results showed that it was crucial to consider the opex to evaluate economic viability of gdm filtration compared to conventional uf energy price increases that were seen in europe over the past two years had no influence on overall gdm filtration costs but had a negative impact on conventional uf this observation demonstrates that 1 gdm filtration is a process that can enable more resilient drinking water production in centralized facilities in the event of an energy crisis and even in the event of an electricity outage and 2 gdm filtration is more economically viable than conventional uf the higher the energy costs between august 2020 and august 2022 the factor 10 energy cost increase boosted the membrane cost to opex ratio of conventional uf for from 1 2 to 3 3 as a result the majority of gdm filtration scenarios with second life modules considered for our analysis were less expensive than conventional uf after the energy pricing skyrocketed for a membrane lifetime of 25 years even the scenario with a stable flux of 2 5 l m2 h was economically viable which could correspond to the flux obtained with a feed water with high organic contents this means that gdm filtration could be used to produce drinking water from sources of various quality levels since the stable flux value is greatly influenced by the toc content of the input water peter varbanets et al 2010 furthermore if energy costs continue to rise in the future there could be a growing economic incentive to use gdm filtration the opex could gradually become the main expense of conventional uf making gdm filtration economically viable even with new membrane modules as we started to observe for energy cost of 500 mwh and higher and membrane lifetime of 25 years in conclusion our study permitted to give a first estimation of the economic interest of using gdm filtration as an alternative to conventional uf in centralized drinking water treatment facilities in multiple scenarios these scenarios depend on the stable flux membrane lifetime and energy costs and gdm filtration the decision of where to implement gdm filtration should be made on a case by case basis considering these factors for a better estimation of the optimal implementation of gdm filtration in centralized systems it would be strategic to develop a business model considering other factors including the number of modules that would be disposed by drinking water treatment plants currently data on uf waste production are scarce in literature but there are several detailed reports for ro modules garcía pacheco et al 2015 lawler et al 2015 senán salinas et al 2019 according to landaburu aguirre et al 2016 spain annually discards more than 1000 tons of modules in landfills we could expect that the amount of decommissioned uf modules is in the same order of magnitude and would tendentially increase in the future due to increased water contamination and more stringent regulations al aani et al 2020 the business model should also consider factors such as recycling and transport procedures and their impact on second life module costs the water source considered for treatment the benefits of recycling the modules based on life cycle assessment need for resilience as well as the space requirements and space constraints conclusions we demonstrated that gdm filtration in centralized facilities is technically and economically feasible in a variety of scenarios that depend on stable flux membrane lifetime and energy costs in these scenarios replace conventional uf by gdm filtration would increase the resilience of the drinking water supply at centralized facilities given that gdm filtration has a reduced reliance on energy chemicals and membrane modules we demonstrated that it is technically possible to obtain stable fluxes around 10 l m2 h with compact modules operated in gdm filtration mode i e modules equipped with inside out hollow fibers having an inner diameter of 0 9 mm with a daily gravity driven backwash in terms of permeate quality the daily backwash had no negative effect on the biopolymer removal compared to modules that were maintained with relaxation and forward flush modules with second life membranes had stable flux in a comparable range than modules with new membranes and performed similarly in terms of biopolymer removal even if initial permeability and biopolymer removal was lower this shows that using refurbished uf modules for gdm filtration is a feasible and strategic gdm filtration membrane investment costs were significantly lowered by using modules with second life membranes even if modules requirements were minimum 2 3 times higher than for conventional uf with this strategy we identified a scenario in which gdm filtration was less expensive than conventional uf at low energy pricing for the first time with second life modules having a stable flux of 10 0 l m2 h and a membrane lifetime of 25 years gdm filtration s membrane investment costs were 14 lower than those of conventional uf when considering fluctuation of energy costs to evaluate the economic viability of gdm filtration we highlighted two key results 1 gdm filtration overall costs were not affected by changes in energy pricing contrary to conventional uf and 2 energy costs increase made several scenarios for the deployment of gdm filtration in centralized facilities economically viable including scenarios with new membrane modules and scenarios with stable flux values as low as 5 0 l m2 h declaration of competing interest the

19910,gravity driven membrane gdm filtration is a strategic alternative to conventional ultrafiltration uf for the resilient production of drinking water via ultrafiltration when resources become scarce given the low dependency on energy and chemicals and longer membrane lifetime implementation at large scale requires the use of compact and low cost membrane modules with high biopolymer removal capacity we therefore evaluated 1 to what extent stable flux can be obtained with compact membrane modules i e inside out hollow fiber membranes and frequent gravity driven backwash 2 whether we can reduce membrane expenses by effectively utilizing second life uf modules i e modules that have been discarded by treatment plant operators because they are no longer under warranty 3 if biopolymer removal could be maintained when applying a frequent backwash and with second life modules and 4 which gdm filtration scenarios are economically viable compared to conventional uf when considering the influence of new or second life modules membrane lifetime stable flux value and energy pricing our findings showed that it was possible to maintain stable fluxes around 10 l m2 h with both new and second life modules for 142 days but a daily gravity driven backwash was necessary and sufficient to compensate the continuous flux drop observed with compact modules in addition the backwash did not affect the biopolymer removal costs calculations revealed two significant findings 1 using second life modules made gdm filtration membrane investment less expensive than conventional uf despite the higher module requirements for gdm filtration and 2 overall costs of gdm filtration with a gravity driven backwash were unaffected by energy prices rise while conventional uf costs rose significantly the later increased the number of economically viable gdm filtration scenarios including scenarios with new modules in summary we proposed an approach that could make gdm filtration in centralized facilities feasible and increase the range of uf operating conditions to better adapt to increasing environmental and societal constraints graphical abstract image graphical abstract

the doi of the data package is provided in the manuscript 1 introduction in a context of energy constraints and issues with chemical or membrane supply the implementation of gravity driven membrane gdm filtration as an alternative to conventional ultrafiltration uf is particularly relevant conventional uf consumes 0 01 0 07 kwh m3 representing considerable annual costs for a treatment plants when uf is the main treatment especially given the current rise in energy prices hawari et al 2020 santos et al 2021 also in a context of electricity shortage the energy requirements for conventional uf could constraint drinking water production mišík 2022 instead gdm filtration eliminates the need for filtration pumps and chemicals and extends membrane lifetime significantly reducing filtration energy demand and securing operation in the event of resource scarcity pronk et al 2019 however gdm filtration is still regarded as an approach only relevant for decentralized facilities due to 1 the low compactness of gdm systems which are frequently implemented with flat sheet modules or outside in hollow fiber hf modules with low packing density and 2 low steady flux values resulting in higher membrane investment costs compared to conventional uf pronk et al 2019 stoffel et al 2022 investigating how to achieve high flux values with compact membrane geometry modules while identifying a suitable approach to make the process economically viable compared to conventional uf is crucial to move toward the implementation of gdm filtration at centralized facilities applying gdm filtration with highly compact membrane modules results in a significant flux reduction making the process irrelevant for centralized facilities stoffel et al 2022 for instance flux was reduced from 15 2 to 8 5 l m2 h when increasing the packing density of modules with outside in hf membranes from 352 m2 m3 to 2151 m2 m3 wu et al 2017 in another study highly compact spiral wound reverse osmosis ro modules that had undergone chemical conversion into uf like modules had a flux of 1 5 l m2 h when filtering deionized water at a transmembrane pressure tmp of 0 16 bar garcía pacheco et al 2021 this stable flux value is insufficient for centralized facilities furthermore the filtration tests conducted by garcía pacheco et al 2021 may not be long enough to estimate the real stable flux of spiral wound modules operated in gdm filtration the tests only lasted 360 min while the characteristic time to reach a stable flux during gdm filtration is usually of 5 7 days pronk et al 2019 additionally spiral wounded modules are rather compact in design membrane layers are separated by a distance of about 1 mm and even after 5 days of operation the flux will likely continue to decline indeed in a recent work we showed that for modules equipped with inside out hf having an inner diameter of 0 9 mm and operated with relaxation and forward flush the flux constantly decreased at a rate of 0 16 l m2 h d during the 125 days of the experiment and the final flux was between 0 and 2 l m2 h stoffel et al 2022 by applying a one time gravity driven backwash we were however able to temporarily increase the flux and therefore suggested intermittent backwash might be effective to operate gdm systems with inside out hf membranes at a stable flux nonetheless it is yet unknown if frequent backwash can successfully balance the continuous flux decline observed for compact membrane modules such as for modules with inside out hf membranes if membranes with more compact geometries can be successfully operated at a high stable flux for gdm filtration around 10 l m2 h such flux will remain significantly smaller than the flux of conventional uf in centralized facilities the rise in membrane investment costs would have severe adverse economic effects on the drinking water treatment plant pronk et al 2019 a relevant strategy to lower membrane investment costs is to refurbished uf modules refurbishing modules is being researched in the context of conventional uf but using ro and nanofiltration modules chemically converted into uf like modules lawler et al 2013 senán salinas et al 2019 the use of recycled spiral wound ro modules for gdm filtration did however result in low flux values as previously discussed garcía pacheco et al 2021 therefore refurbished ro and nanofiltration modules would be difficult to use for gdm filtration in centralized facilities using decommissioned uf modules recovered from the drinking water industry that passed the membrane integrity test or second life modules is an unexplored possibility to lower the membrane investment costs of gdm filtration the uf modules are frequently discarded not because of any notable problems with their integrity but mainly because they have reached the end of their warranty period or because their permeability has decreased consequently discarded uf modules represent a significant resource of good quality modules for recycling the question that this innovative approach poses is whether or not membrane aging results in lower fluxes than new membranes when used in gdm filtration mode because initial permeability could be reduced robinson et al 2016 it is essential to ensure that performing repeated backwashes and employing second life modules do not adversely affect the biopolymer removal compared to gdm filtration with no maintenance and new modules as it is a main asset of gdm filtration ranieri et al 2023 biopolymer retention is partly due to the membrane retention in gdm filtration between 20 and 40 of the biopolymers are removed by the membrane stoffel et al 2022 however major part of the removal is due to the biofilm establishment at the surface of the membrane derlon et al 2014 pronk et al 2019 the biofilm acts as a secondary biologically active barrier that can better retain and biodegrade biopolymers chomiak et al 2015 park et al 2016 the enhanced biopolymer removal reported for in presence of biofilm compared to virgin membrane therefore helps improving the permeate biological stability such enhanced biopolymer removal by gdm systems also has the potential to increase the efficiency of post treatment such as reverse osmosis or photocatalysis as biopolymers are major membrane foulants and phototacalysis quenchers akhondi et al 2015 maghsoodi et al 2019 yin et al 2020 from one hand applying a frequent backwash could affect the biofilm thickness and membrane coverage biofilm instability brought by the backwash has been observed with optical coherence tomography oct by shao et al 2018 oct images showed exposed virgin membrane or areas deprived of a biofilm which may lead to lower biopolymer removal following backwash in contrast wu et al 2019 found no relationship between the length of the backwash and the removal of the biopolymers therefore it is unknown how a regular backwash might impact gdm filtration s ability to remove biopolymers on the other hand it is unclear if biopolymer removal would be adversely impacted by the usage of second life modules as extensive chemical cleaning of conventional uf modules could result in decreased dissolved organic removal compared to new membrane due to membrane aging which manifests through material elongation pore expansion and the occurrence of breaches regula et al 2014 in definitive it is crucial to further research on the potential impacts of these maintenance and cost reduction practices on gdm filtration s ability to remove biopolymers the main purpose of this study was to evaluate how to tackle the main challenges associated with the implementation of gdm filtration in centralized drinking water facilities 1 maintain a stable flux with membranes having a compact geometry 2 decrease membrane investment costs and 3 ensure high biopolymer removal for this purpose we first investigated the effect of gravity driven backwash frequency on the flux of modules equipped with 7 capillaries inside out hollow fiber hf membranes having an inner diameter of 0 9 mm to reduce membrane investment costs of gdm filtration we examined whether second life membranes performed similarly to new membranes using the optimal backwash frequency identified based on filtration flux values in addition to flux measurements we assessed the impact of backwash frequency and module type on the permeate quality when measuring the removal of biopolymers afterwards we compared the costs of conventional uf gdm filtration with new membranes and gdm filtration with second life membranes in various scenarios more particularly we calculated the membrane investment costs and the operating expenditures opex corresponding to energy requirements and chemical cleaning considering several factors membrane types membrane lifetime stable flux and energy prices 2 material and methods 2 1 new and second life uf modules characteristics modules equipped with 0 9 mm multibore membranes from dupont were used in this study table 1 multibore membranes are modified polyether sulfone pes hollow fiber membranes with a pore size of 20 nm one fiber consists of seven separate capillaries with an inner capillary diameter of 0 9 mm we prepared two types of lab scale modules containing 0 9 mm 7 capillaries hf membranes in a polyvinyl chloride pvc shelf for our experiments 1 modules equipped with new membranes and 2 modules equipped with second life membranes collected from a dizzer xl 0 9 mb 80 wt module taken from a drinking water treatment which is not named here for privacy concerns table 1 the dizzer xl 0 9 mb 80 wt module had been in operation for five years to treat reservoir water and was replaced because its warranty had expired to ensure reproducibility of the experiment we chemically cleaned the second life modules before use following the procedure described in supplementary data section 1 2 2 experimental set up the experimental set up is described in fig 1 the feed water was river water pumped from the river chriesbach dübendorf switzerland into a sedimentation tank with a volume and a residence time of 155 l and 100 min respectively the supernatant of the sedimentation tank flowed into the raw water channel volume of 240 l the raw water channel level was adjusted to 80 cm to reach an average tmp of 150 mbar given that modules are 140 cm long as chosen previously stoffel et al 2022 table 2 presents the characteristics of the raw water after the sedimentation tank the inflow and outflow pipes of the installed modules were equipped with magnetic 3 way valves connected to timers to apply programmed maintenances since the backwash was conducted with permeate the produced permeate was collected and pumped to the backwash channel volume of 80 l the water level of the backwash tank was set to 280 cm to reach an average tmp of 350 mbar given that modules are 140 cm long 2 3 operating strategies different backwash frequencies were studied i no backwash nbw ii backwash every two weeks 2wbw iii weekly backwash wbw and iv daily backwash dbw the backwash procedure was established based on previous study and consisted of two sequential backflushes with a water head of 280 cm with a 1 min break in between stoffel et al 2022 each backflush lasted 2 min to ensure a sufficient flushing of the biofilm debris during the first minute of the backflush the upper backwash line was opened to remove particulate matter accumulated on top of the module during the second minute the lower backwash line was additionally opened based on the results from our previous study we also applied a daily relaxation 55 min followed by a forward flush 5 min r ff to all modules oka et al 2017 stoffel et al 2022 2 4 backwash with increased pressures at the end of the experiment we designed a one time backwash experiment to determine whether higher biofilm removal resulted in a lower biopolymer elimination on the short term using the backwash procedure described in section 2 3 1 the experiment was conducted on dbw1 new 2wbw1 new and dbw1 sl at day 142 it consisted in three sequential backwash procedures at different tmp 350 400 and 600 mbar the backwash at 350 mbar was gravity driven and we used a pump to apply a tmp of 400 and 600 mbar the tss collected during each backflush were measured as indicator of biofilm removal after each backwash procedure we waited three hydraulic retention times hrt of each module to sample raw water and permeate and measured their respective biopolymer concentrations calculations explanations in section 2 of supplementary data for this experiment we enriched the river water in the feed water canal with secondary effluent of the wastewater treatment plant of eawag dübendorf switzerland to enhance the biopolymer concentration and increase the removal calculation accuracy given the lcocd detection limit during the experiment the dissolved organic carbon and biopolymer concentrations in the feed water tank were equal to 3 5 mgc l and 222 μg l respectively all experiments and maintenances applied in the current study are listed in table 3 2 5 measurements and calculations daily flux measurements were taken to evaluate the productivity of each module the produced permeate was collected twice a day for 3 h before and after the maintenance and weighted on a scale the flux was calculated using the darcy law and normalized at 20 c using the temperature in the raw water channel measured with a portable device wtw multi 3630 ids set ks2 field case w o sensor tss amount in backflush water was used as an indicator for biofilm removal during the backwash procedure as in situ observation of the biofilm in the lumen was not possible without module sacrifice the tss were measured once per week for one module per backwash frequency and module type using the apha standard method apha 2005 every two weeks we monitored influent and permeate quality for one module per frequency and module type using liquid chromatography coupled with organic carbon detection lcocd to quantify the biopolymer removal this method separates the dissolved organic carbon into five different fractions and quantifies them i e biopolymers 20 kda humics 1 2 kda building blocks 0 5 1 kda low molecular weight organic acids and neutrals 0 35 0 5 kda the separation is based on the molecular size and occurs in the chromatographic column monnot et al 2016 more details on the instrument and method are available elsewhere huber et al 2011 jacquin et al 2020 the samples were taken around 2 h after the maintenance 2 6 statistical analysis the average values and standard deviations of the stable flux and biopolymer removal were calculated based on visual observation and selection of the stabilized period values were compared using wilcoxon test given that the data were independent and not normally distributed see section 4 in supplementary data outliers were not considered in the calculation using the procedure described in stoffel et al 2022 specifically the value below q1 1 5 iqr and above q3 1 5 iqr were not considered for calculation q1 and q3 correspond to the 25th quantile and 75th quantile respectively iqr is the interquantile range i e the difference between q3 and q1 2 7 costs calculations we evaluated the cost of membranes and the opex for several energy costs to generate 1000 m3 h over a 25 year period costs in order to compare them and assess the economic viability of gdm filtration compared to conventional uf all calculations were made with a membrane surface of 80 m2 as it is the membrane surface of dizzer xl 0 9 mb 80 wt modules equipped with the membrane tested in the present study the number of modules for each scenario was calculated

different energy costs given that europe is facing unprecedent energy costs increase which might continue in the future as a consequence we considered three energetic scenarios i e different costs per

s2 in supplementary data section 5 we compared the scenarios listed in table 4 we set the lifetime of conventional uf modules to 8 years based on inge dupont expertise reflecting typical replacement rate in drinking water treatment plants this lifetime can be explained by membrane aging leading to permeability reduction and or integrity loss due to pressure rating and chemical stress zondervan and roffel 2008 verrecht et al 2010 for the gdm modules there are no references on membrane lifetime since that this approach has only been used in practice for a decade in the present study we hypothesized that the gdm modules would have a longer lifetime than conventional uf modules due to the absence of chemical cleaning and pressure rating pronk et al 2019 in particular we set membrane lifetimes of 15 and 25 years to discuss the impact of this parameter on the membrane investment costs in addition to evaluate the lifetime effect on the membrane investment costs we proceeded to calculations with different stable flux values to evaluate the effect of feed water quality on the membrane investment costs as the stable flux is dependent on the dissolved organic composition of the feed water pronk et al 2019 we used the 10 l m2 h as a reference value for values obtained in the present study with river water i e daily backwash new and second life membranes the other flux values used for calculations are in line with what might be possible using different feed waters peter varbanets et al 2010 all raw data collected for the study are available at https doi org 10 25678 000830 3 results and discussion 3 1 intermittent gravity driven backwash as a strategy to use inside out hollow fiber membranes for gdm filtration 3 1 1 effect of gravity driven backwash on the flux and productivity gravity driven backwash is a relevant strategy to compensate the continuous flux drop observed during the operation without backwash and leading to a low stable flux as observed in fig 2 a in the present study the flux of never backwashed modules dropped to 1 4 0 6 l m2 h at day 142 which is comparable to the flux measured by stoffel et al 2022 after 125 days of operation between 0 and 2 l m2 h the higher the backwash frequency the more stable and the higher the flux specifically application of a daily gravity driven backwash helped stabilizing the flux at 10 6 2 0 l m2 h after 20 days of operation at a tmp of 150 mbar fig 2d this stable flux value was within the same range as what was observed when flat sheet membranes i e low compactness were utilized in dead end to filter the same type of water as in the present investigation peter varbanets et al 2010 desmond et al 2018a when the backwash was applied every two weeks or weekly the flux was improved but then dropped at a similar rate for both backwash frequencies p value 0 5 equal to 0 63 0 30 l m2 h d and 0 58 0 32 l m2 h d respectively fig 2b and 2c our results demonstrate that the use of compact membrane geometries such as hollow fibers for gdm filtration is possible only if a backwash is applied at a frequency that balances the continuous flux drop triggered by high module compactness the implementation of a membrane module with compact geometry comes with additional costs related to the daily backwash compared to gdm filtration without maintenance oka et al 2017 however since we showed that the daily backwash could be gravity driven backwash costs could be minimized the energy to pump the permeate to the backwash tank is height time lower than the energy required for a pressurized backwash the consumption of permeate for backwash is another crucial factor to consider in order to evaluate the approach discussed in our study because it lowers plant productivity gdm filtration gravity driven backwash would require 3 of the daily production against 7 and 4 with a pressurized backwash of gdm filtration and conventional uf based on calculations with values from table s1 respectively therefore the permeate requirements for gravity driven backwash gdm filtration are on level with those for conventional uf these requirements are even lower than requirements found in literature conventional uf pressurized backwash can consume up to 10 of permeate given that modules are backwashed every 30 min to 4 h for 1 to 5 min brügger et al 2001 chang et al 2017 3 1 2 link between flux recovery and tss removal from the lumen through gravity driven backwash in parallel to flux measurements we systematically evaluated the link between flux recovery after each backwash and the amount of tss collected in the backwash water to understand the flux dynamic observed for the different backwash frequencies fig 3 the flux recovery triggered by the backwash was linked to the removal of tss from the hf lumen fig 3 the higher the amount of tss removed the higher the flux recovery r2 of 0 646 p value 1 10 7 for weekly and every two weeks backwash conditions the removal of tss was around 6 times higher than for the daily backwash however removing less tss at once by increasing backwash frequency was more strategic to maintain a stable flux these results highlight that the accumulation of tss in the lumen triggers the continuous flux drop observed with compact membrane geometries in our study the accumulation of tss was likely linked to biofilm growth given the low turbidity in the feed water and the small size of particles compared to the lumen table 2 for low backwash frequencies the fiber lumen was progressively obstructed as the biofilm grew reducing water flow in the lumen and causing flux drop we expect that organics causing irreversible membrane fouling i e that cannot be eliminated by the backwash e g humic substances played a limited role on the flux drop compared to the biofilm previous studies reported that 80 to 90 of the resistance in gdm systems equipped with flat sheet membranes is due to biofilm and depends on biofilm physico chemical properties desmond et al 2018c jafari et al 2018 in the context of compact membranes the proportion of the biofilm resistance could even be higher due to lumen blockage the limited role of organics in flux drop is also supported by the fact that the mean hydraulic resistances at the beginning and end of the period of stable flux first and last 20d of the daily backwashed modules are similar 2 9 1012 0 5 1012 1 m and 2 8 1012 0 6 1012 1 m respectively p value 0 07 significant irreversible fouling would have gradually increased the hydraulic resistance as observed in conventional uf gao et al 2011 zheng et al 2014 similar hydraulic resistance at the start and end of the steady flux period further demonstrates that the daily backwash has no detrimental effects on the biofilm over the 142 days of the study the flux was improved by the gravity driven backwash without having triggered biofilm acclimation which would have gradually decreased the flux wu et al 2019 observed that membrane resistance increased from 3 5 1012 1 m to 5 1012 1 m between modules operated without backwash and modules operated with a 2 min backwash applied at different intervals respectively the increase of resistance could be explained by biofilm adaptation to the shear stress which enhances the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances and promotes self reorganization derlon et al 2016 de vries et al 2021 for instance derlon et al 2022 showed that the biofilm became more cohesive and elastic as a result of surface shear stress brought on by cross flow maintenance the absence of hydraulic resistance increase in our study might be due to the fact that hydraulic resistance of compact modules might be more dependent on fiber blockage than on the characteristics of the biofilm to better understand the cause of the continuous flux drop more studies of biofilm characteristics using methods like oct would be particularly interesting desmond et al 2018a 2018b 2018c fortunato et al 2020 as the biofilm develops in the fibers lumen this would necessitate the sacrifice of the modules in conclusion we successfully demonstrated that maintaining high stable flux values 10 l m2 h with compact membrane geometry i e inside out hf with an inner diameter of 0 9 mm is possible with a daily gravity driven backwash implemented to control biofilm growth in the fiber s lumen 3 2 potential of second life modules as an alternative for new modules in gdm filtration systems 3 2 1 comparison of second life and new membrane properties before gdm filtration experiments to compensate the cost increase linked to lower flux compared to conventional uf we assessed if modules with second life membranes had similar filtration performance than modules with new membranes beforehand we compared their permeability and noticed that the permeability of second life modules was 19 lower in average than the permeability of new modules table 1 we then proceeded to sem imaging of the inside and outside of new and second life membranes fig 4 the sem images revealed that there were distinct surface properties between new and second life membranes despite identical membrane elaboration process the inside surface of the new membrane appeared smoother than that of the second life membrane except for some visible gray spots in fig 4a however these spots were likely artifacts caused by the sample preparation process on the other hand the inside surface of the second life membrane displayed more visible pores which may be due to frequent chemical cleaning that enlarges the pores as reported in previous studies regula et al 2014 li et al 2021 changes of surface properties were also visible on the outside of the membrane the outside surface of the second life membrane was found to be rougher than the outside of the new membrane with a higher pore density like for the inside this could be also be due to aging of the membrane linked to chemical cleaning in addition deposits and blocked particles were observed in the outside pores of the second life membrane see fig s5 in supplementary data which could explain the differences in permeability between the new and second life membranes the changes observed between new and second life membranes are consistent with literature where membrane properties change when soaking them in naocl robinson and bérubé 2021 finally these findings confirm that new and second life membranes have noticeable surface physical differences which could affect the gdm filtration performance in terms of flux and biopolymer removal 3 2 2 flux of second life modules operated in gdm filtration mode we monitored the permeate flux over several weeks of modules equipped with second life 0 9 mm inside out 7 capillaries hf operated in gdm filtration with a daily gravity driven backwash fig 5 after 20 days of operation we observed that the flux of modules with second life membranes stabilized at 9 2 1 4 l m2 h until day 142 i e 13 lower than the flux value measured for modules with new membranes wilcoxon test p value 2 10 16 fig 2d this value remains close to the value obtained with modules with new membranes and is comparable to the flux of other gdm systems run with new membranes and river water as feed peter varbanets et al 2010 in addition second life membranes allowed us to achieve a stable flux value that was significantly larger than the flux that was measured by garcía pacheco et al 2021 with reconditioned ro modules a lower permeability for second life modules than for new modules at the start of the experiment could account for this minor stable flux difference over long term between new and second life modules table 1 this flux difference was however minimal and could quickly be reduced over time with a decrease of new membranes permeability during operation regula et al 2013 studied the aging of hollow fiber membranes in pure water with and without sodium bisulfite the authors showed no decrease of permeability after 30 days of aging while it was reduced by 26 after 180 days of operation irrespective the presence of biocide as observed for modules with new membranes the hydraulic resistance measured for modules with second life membranes daily backwashed was similar in the first and last 20 days operation it was equal to 3 2 1012 0 6 1011 1 m and 3 0 1012 0 5 1011 respectively wilcoxon test p value 7 3 10 7 it demonstrates that daily gravity backwash is effective at improving the flux of modules with second life membranes without having an adverse long term effect on resistance as observed for modules equipped with new membranes finally the permeate consumption was similar to gdm filtration with new modules representing only 2 of the daily production when considering an average backwash flux of 74 l m2 h contrary to what was observed by cogan et al 2022 the authors reported that membrane aging induces higher backwash frequency and duration last but not least comparable to gdm filtration with new membranes we did not notice biofilm adaptation to the backwash as indicated by the similar hydraulic resistance at the beginning end of the period of stable flux in conclusion modules with second life modules perform as well as modules with new membranes in terms of filtration the initial membrane properties have a limited effect on the flux given that most of the resistance is due to the biofilm independently of the type of membranes pronk et al 2019 3 3 impact of the gravity driven backwash frequency and use of second life membranes on the biopolymer removal 3 3 1 long term biopolymer removal trends throughout the entire experiment we monitored biopolymer removal over time for the modules with new membranes backwashed at different frequencies and for the modules with second life modules exposed to daily backwash conditions fig 6 the first key result is that the initial removal of the modules equipped with new membranes and with second life membranes equal to 21 dbw1 new and 11 dbw1 sl respectively this means that membrane aging impacted the membrane retention of biopolymers similar result was observed for aged pes membranes expose to chlorine pes membranes used in the milk industry has been reported to lead to milk protein leakage regula et al 2014 this difference in retention performance could be explained by the increased pore density observed by sem and decreased retention due to pore widening li et al 2021 then all modules showed an increase in biopolymer removal with time until reaching a plateau after 20 days of operation this trend is typical from gdm filtration systems and is explained by the progressive establishment of the biofilm at the membrane surface until the biofilm reaches equilibrium state corresponding to a stable biopolymer removal stoffel et al 2022 when the plateau was reached we observed two points corresponding to a biopolymer removal of 50 5 and 35 5 for the never backwashed new module and daily backwashed second life module respectively we however ruled these values outliers as they were lower than the q1 1 5 iqr calculated with all removal values of the plateau period fig 6 without the outliers the biopolymer removal average was statistically identical for all modules irrespective the backwash frequency and the module type table s5 in supplementation data the mean biopolymer removal of all modules was equal to 81 8 8 6 which is similar to the removal observed for gdm systems equipped with flat sheet membranes never backwashed chomiak et al 2015 pronk et al 2019 it means that even if biofilm is removed from the lumen during the backwash as we observed through tss removal the biopolymer removal remained at high level another important result is that the biopolymer removal trend and values for modules equipped with both new and second life membranes was similar despite different initial removal values this confirms that the presence of biofilm is the primary factor driving biopolymer removal even if membrane aging results in lower initial removal 3 3 2 short term effect of increased tss removal by gravity driven backwash on the biopolymer elimination the backwash may have a negative effect on biopolymer removal on the short term since it could destabilize the biofilm as observed by shao et al 2018 we noticed that increasing the amount of biofilm tss removed from the lumen through successive backwashes at higher tmp had a slight impact on the short term removal of biopolymers fig 7 we found a significant linear relationship between the biopolymer removal and the amount of tss removed by the backwash which increased with the backwash tmp p value 2 10 4 r2 0 764 consequently the higher the tss removed the lower the biopolymer removal in addition fig 7 shows three key results 1 the daily gravity driven backwash 350 mbar had no short term negative consequences on the biopolymer removal 2 backwash at higher pressure only slightly decreased the biopolymer removal but it remained above 67 which is 47 to 57 higher than the initial removal obtained for modules with new and second life membranes respectively and 3 the performance of new membrane modules and second life modules were similar as observed for the long term biopolymer removal and for the flux these results mean that in practice it would be possible to use modules with second life membranes and increase the backwash tmp without negatively affecting the permeate quality therefore a significant conclusion of our study is that gdm filtration could be carried out with second life modules without affecting the filtration performance due to high stable flux and biopolymer removal values which were likewise found for gdm filtration with new modules 3 4 gdm filtration scenarios economically viable compared to conventional uf our experimental results demonstrated that modules with second life membranes have comparable performance than modules with new membranes in terms of both stable flux and biopolymer removal the next step was to identify under which scenario gdm filtration could represent a relevant alternative to conventional uf for centralized facilities rather than a niche application for decentralized facilities only pronk et al 2019 indeed stated that gdm filtration is confined to decentralized systems given the high membrane investment costs compared to conventional uf in a recent study calculating the membrane investment costs and operating costs of a gdm filtration home system using refurbished ro modules the authors estimated that the costs of gdm filtration and uf systems could be equivalent garcía pacheco et al 2021 however these data were provided for decentralized facilities and the stable flux values are noticeably low and may have been overstated due the extremely short filtration test duration as previously mentioned fig 8 compares the membrane costs for membrane and the opex per m3 of conventional uf gdm with new membranes and gdm filtration with second life membranes for different stable flux values and membrane lifetime in this figure we also compared the impact of different energy pricing on the opex the membrane costs of uf was equal to 0 54 cents m3 when considering a membrane lifetime of 8 years and a stable flux of 70 l m2 h to be competitive in terms of membrane investment costs gdm filtration costs should therefore be lower than 0 54 cents m3 when considering a gdm filtration stable flux of 10 l m2 h as observed in our study the membrane costs of gdm filtration with second life modules was 14 and 57 lower than for conventional uf when considering a membrane lifetime of 15 and 25 years respectively other scenarios had lower membrane investments costs such as gdm filtration with second life modules at a stable flux of 7 5 and 5 0 l m2 h and a membrane lifetime of 25 years these findings show that there are cases where gdm filtration could be less expensive than conventional uf despite higher surface membrane requirements for gdm filtration the significant difference in membrane prices between gdm filtration using second life modules and conventional uf is explained by reduced module costs 5 5 times lower and a lower replacement rate for the gdm membranes over a period of 25 years conventional uf modules were replaced three times versus twice and once for gdm membranes replaced after 25 and 15 years of operation however we confirmed that regardless of the lifespan of gdm membranes membrane investment costs of new modules remained greater than with conventional uf as reported by pronk et al 2019 nevertheless extending gdm membrane lifetime of new modules from 15 to 25 years made gdm filtration more appealing by lowering membrane costs across all scenarios for instance the membrane costs of gdm filtration with new modules having a stable flux of 10 l m2 h were reduced from 2 59 to 1 29 cents m3 when considering a lifetime extension from 15 to 25 years conducting further research on how to accurately estimate the lifespan of modules used in gdm filtration new and second life could assist in determining the actual cost benefits as compared to conventional uf the stable flux value also played a significant role in the membrane investment costs given that the lower the stable flux the higher the required number of modules for instance at a stable flux of 2 5 l m2 h and a lifetime of 15 years membrane investment costs of gdm filtration with new and second life modules were equal to 12 and 2 cents m3 respectively these costs are considerably higher than membrane investment costs of conventional uf to evaluate the economic viability of gdm filtration scenarios we then considered the impact of opex changes due to energy pricing evolution at an energy pricing of 50 mwh price in 2020 we could observe that the determinant factor for the total costs was membrane investment costs for both conventional uf and gdm filtration as the opex was equal to 0 13 cents m3 for conventional uf and 1 6 10 3 cents m3 for gdm filtration costs not visible with the scale chosen for fig 8 the opex only accounted for 19 in the case of conventional uf while for gdm filtration it was less than 0 3 depending on the scenario however in a situation where energy pricing skyrocketed because of lack of energy autonomy in europe 500 mwh august 2022 the opex accounted for 70 of the total costs of conventional uf and therefore became a determinant cost factor gdm filtration on the other hand was unaffected by the rise in energy prices despite the use of a pump to increase the permeate water head for the gravity driven backwash in the event that the energy situation worsens in the future and prices reach values as high as 1000 mwh other new gdm filtration scenarios would be advantageous compared to conventional uf gdm filtration operating at stable flux of 7 5 and 5 0 l m2 h gdm filtration using new membrane modules with a stable flux of 10 0 l m2 h would even be less expensive than conventional uf such scenarios are relevant to consider as a projected energy cost of 1000 mwh may become a reality in the future given the other factors that are currently threatening non carbonated energy self sufficiency such as droughts that decrease the electricity generation of hydropower plants thaler and hofmann 2022 turner et al 2022 our results showed that it was crucial to consider the opex to evaluate economic viability of gdm filtration compared to conventional uf energy price increases that were seen in europe over the past two years had no influence on overall gdm filtration costs but had a negative impact on conventional uf this observation demonstrates that 1 gdm filtration is a process that can enable more resilient drinking water production in centralized facilities in the event of an energy crisis and even in the event of an electricity outage and 2 gdm filtration is more economically viable than conventional uf the higher the energy costs between august 2020 and august 2022 the factor 10 energy cost increase boosted the membrane cost to opex ratio of conventional uf for from 1 2 to 3 3 as a result the majority of gdm filtration scenarios with second life modules considered for our analysis were less expensive than conventional uf after the energy pricing skyrocketed for a membrane lifetime of 25 years even the scenario with a stable flux of 2 5 l m2 h was economically viable which could correspond to the flux obtained with a feed water with high organic contents this means that gdm filtration could be used to produce drinking water from sources of various quality levels since the stable flux value is greatly influenced by the toc content of the input water peter varbanets et al 2010 furthermore if energy costs continue to rise in the future there could be a growing economic incentive to use gdm filtration the opex could gradually become the main expense of conventional uf making gdm filtration economically viable even with new membrane modules as we started to observe for energy cost of 500 mwh and higher and membrane lifetime of 25 years in conclusion our study permitted to give a first estimation of the economic interest of using gdm filtration as an alternative to conventional uf in centralized drinking water treatment facilities in multiple scenarios these scenarios depend on the stable flux membrane lifetime and energy costs and gdm filtration the decision of where to implement gdm filtration should be made on a case by case basis considering these factors for a better estimation of the optimal implementation of gdm filtration in centralized systems it would be strategic to develop a business model considering other factors including the number of modules that would be disposed by drinking water treatment plants currently data on uf waste production are scarce in literature but there are several detailed reports for ro modules garcía pacheco et al 2015 lawler et al 2015 senán salinas et al 2019 according to landaburu aguirre et al 2016 spain annually discards more than 1000 tons of modules in landfills we could expect that the amount of decommissioned uf modules is in the same order of magnitude and would tendentially increase in the future due to increased water contamination and more stringent regulations al aani et al 2020 the business model should also consider factors such as recycling and transport procedures and their impact on second life module costs the water source considered for treatment the benefits of recycling the modules based on life cycle assessment need for resilience as well as the space requirements and space constraints conclusions we demonstrated that gdm filtration in centralized facilities is technically and economically feasible in a variety of scenarios that depend on stable flux membrane lifetime and energy costs in these scenarios replace conventional uf by gdm filtration would increase the resilience of the drinking water supply at centralized facilities given that gdm filtration has a reduced reliance on energy chemicals and membrane modules we demonstrated that it is technically possible to obtain stable fluxes around 10 l m2 h with compact modules operated in gdm filtration mode i e modules equipped with inside out hollow fibers having an inner diameter of 0 9 mm with a daily gravity driven backwash in terms of permeate quality the daily backwash had no negative effect on the biopolymer removal compared to modules that were maintained with relaxation and forward flush modules with second life membranes had stable flux in a comparable range than modules with new membranes and performed similarly in terms of biopolymer removal even if initial permeability and biopolymer removal was lower this shows that using refurbished uf modules for gdm filtration is a feasible and strategic gdm filtration membrane investment costs were significantly lowered by using modules with second life membranes even if modules requirements were minimum 2 3 times higher than for conventional uf with this strategy we identified a scenario in which gdm filtration was less expensive than conventional uf at low energy pricing for the first time with second life modules having a stable flux of 10 0 l m2 h and a membrane lifetime of 25 years gdm filtration s membrane investment costs were 14 lower than those of conventional uf when considering fluctuation of energy costs to evaluate the economic viability of gdm filtration we highlighted two key results 1 gdm filtration overall costs were not affected by changes in energy pricing contrary to conventional uf and 2 energy costs increase made several scenarios for the deployment of gdm filtration in centralized facilities economically viable including scenarios with new membrane modules and scenarios with stable flux values as low as 5 0 l m2 h declaration of competing interest the

efficient environmental improvement were highlighted including biochar modification co pyrolysis feedstock selection and pretreatment the insights offered in this review will facilitate further development of sewage sludge derived biochar towards addressing the obstacles in its application in environmental improvement and global environmental crisis graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sludge biochar environmental improvement application barriers strategies and prospects data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the advancement in the world s economy and urbanization sewage sludge as the main solid waste of urban sewage treatment plants has been increasing on a yearly basis for example in 2021 alone the total amount of sludge in china reached 80 6 million tons china 2021 it is estimated that the annual amount of sludge may be higher than 90 million tons by 2025 zhang et al 2020d according to the definition of the u s environmental protection agency epa usepa 2007 sewage sludge is reusable as it is rich in organic matter nutrients and various waste biomass materials containing trace elements yet on the other hand sewage sludge contains pathogens and heavy metal pollutants as well as a large multitude of toxic organic chemicals that are harmful to humans and the ecological system if treated improperly it can cause serious secondary pollution to the environment presently the most widely used sludge treatment methods include biological technologies anaerobic digestion aerobic composting dewatering and drying the final destinations of disposed sludge were agricultural use landfill and construction materials table 1 shows how sewage sludge is disposed of in europe america and japan as can be seen turning sludge into resources is a future trend in these areas and all over the world biochar is an easy to prepare porous material with an aromatic compound structure compared to traditional incineration combustion which requires higher temperature 300 c 1000 c and significant energy input hydrothermally treated sludge is preferable due to the lower energy consumption higher yield and oxygen containing functional group content chen et al 2021 previous studies have also found that sludge pyrolysis has great advantages over incineration in reducing heavy metal pollution at a pyrolysis temperature lower than 600 c chen et al 2020 the properties of sludge derived biochar are usually affected by factors such as moisture content pyrolysis temperature residence time heating rate etc han et al 2022 hu et al 2022 sun et al 2022b gaur et al 2020 observed the carbon content decreased significantly with the increase of retention time at each tested temperature zheng et al 2019a showed that with the increase in reaction temperature volatile matter decreased obviously for example when the pyrolysis temperature increased from 300 c to 700 c the yield of sludge biochar decreased from 91 1 to 81 2 zhang et al 2022b in addition recent researches reveal that improving pyrolysis temperature usually results in a larger biochar surface area when the pyrolysis temperature rises from 500 c to 900 c the porosity of the biochar increases from 0 056 cm3 g to 0 099 cm3 g while the specific surface area increases from 25 4 cm2 g to 67 6 cm2 g patel et al 2020 this phenomenon should be attributed to that the tar produced at low temperatures adheres to the surface of biochar and blocks the pores while the tar gradually decomposes when the temperature rises thus accelerating the formation speed of pores and increasing the specific surface area zhang et al 2022a while in some cases the specific surface area and porosity decrease when the pyrolysis temperature rises it may be due to the melting and collapse of the pore wall at excessively high temperatures similar to specific surface area and porosity the ph of biochar also changes with variations in pyrolysis temperature and materials the ph value of biochar has a significant effect on its function as an adsorbent to remove pollutants when biochar is used to remove pollutants from water the ph value of the solution significantly affects the surface charges of biochar at higher pyrolysis temperatures the alkali in sewage sludges is released from the structure and the oxygen containing functional groups decompose resulting in a decrease in the number of acidic functional groups wang et al 2019 it is also reported that the ph value of biochar is more significantly affected by its aromatization degree khan et al 2020 with a rise in pyrolysis temperature the alkalinity of organic anions in biochar also increases the above changes in the properties of biochar also affect the high adsorption of biochar for example he et al 2022 found that fine biochar with a large specific surface area has significantly higher nh4 n adsorption capacity than medium and coarse biochar however lee et al 2022 found that the adsorption capacity of anions decreases with the increase of ph while the adsorption capacity of cations increases with the increase of ph with the advantages of high absorbability stable chemical properties large specific surface area rich porous structure and numerous surface functional groups sludge derived biochar has a wide prospect of application despite numerous studies published on the production and properties of biochar to the best of our knowledge no extensive review is available on the application of sludge derived biochar on environmental improvement therefore the objective of this paper is aimed to in brief provide a state of the art review of current and emerging sludge biochar application fields that were effective in water pollution control soil remediation carbon sink and carbon emission reduction as shown in fig 1 emphasis is put on the key challenges and new strategies for overcoming sludge biochar application barriers to realizing highly efficient pollutants removal soil conditioning and carbon dioxide mitigation 2 application of sludge biochar in water contaminants removal the multifunctional characteristics of biochar show a very effective potential in the field of water environment remediation ahmad et al 2014 recent studies showed that biochar can be used as an adsorbent to remove a number of organic pollutants in water table 2 generally the absorption process and types of pollutants that can be absorbed by biochar depend on the physical and chemical structures of the biochar surface the absorption mechanisms mainly include hydrophobic interaction pore filling electrostatic adsorption and hydrogen bond qiu et al 2022 as provided in fig 2 2 1 hydrophobic interaction relevant studies show that if a pollutant has hydrophobic functional groups such as the methyl group then it can be removed by biochar through hydrophobic interaction dai et al 2019 theoretically the higher the pyrolysis temperature 500 c the higher the hydrophobicity and aromaticity of biochar the larger the specific surface area and thus the easier it is to absorb hydrophobic and nonpolar organic pollutants for example when the pyrolysis temperature is increased from 350 c to 750 c the surface functional groups hydrophobicity and crystallinity of biochar are increased making it more effective to remove tetracycline choi et al 2020 compared with low temperature pyrolyzed biochar high temperature biochar 700 c with high aromaticity enhanced its antibiotic adsorption capacity premarathna et al 2019 in particular a high dose of biochar will produce more active sites which will further enhance the adsorption of tetracycline kang et al 2023 but excessive active substances may also cause self quenching leading to the removal rate of tetracycline decreases zhu et al 2019 2 2 pore filling pore filling is considered another main mechanism by which biochar absorbs organic matter based on pore sizes pores can be structurally divided into micropores 2 nm medium pores 2 50 nm and large pores 50 nm studies found that pore structures have a significant effect on pollutant absorption in water generally biochar with medium pores is more effective in absorbing organic matter while larger pores help increase water permeability the pore size increases with the increase of pyrolysis temperature and the pores are easily filled with organic pollutants to achieve a high removal rate xu et al 2022 found that the larger the void volume of biochar the larger the specific surface area the smaller the average pore diameter the stronger the pore filling effect and thus the better the removal of organic pollutants during the pollutant removal in the liquid phase the absorption of organic pollutants is related to the micro and medium pores on biochar when removing microplastics larger microplastics are stuck in the gap of biochar and others are trapped in the pore of biochar the colloidal property of biochar winds the microplastics to increase their size so as to fix the microplastics for removal wang et al 2020d moreover the interaction between medium pores and hydrophobic pore walls also plays a significant role in removing pollutants 2 3 electrostatic adsorption electrostatic adsorption is also one of the mechanisms for pollutant removal which mainly rely on charges of the biochar surface and the electrical property of pollutants there are clay minerals with high ion exchange capacity on the surface of biochar which stimulate the adsorption of organic dyes antibiotics and other pollutants through the ion exchange premarathna et al 2019 recent studies showed that the functional groups on the surface of sludge biochar could affect the removal rate of anionic and cationic dyes wang et al 2020a demonstrated that electrostatic adsorption was the main driving force for the adsorption of acridine orange ao by biochar wang et al 2021a also concluded that the electrostatic interaction between biochar and microplastics dominates the removal of microplastics to improve the removal of organic pollutants the surface of biochar needs to be modified by functional groups with different electrical properties in addition given the charges on biochar surface are significantly affected by ph the absorption of organic pollutants is also related to variations in ph when ph 7 95 the surface of sludge biochar activated by peroxydisulfate pds is negatively charged resulting in electrostatic repulsion between pds and tetracycline which reduces the removal rate of tetracycline the degradation rate of tetracycline is the highest when ph is 5 kang et al 2023 it is generally believed that low ph i e 3 is essential for the dissolution of heavy metals yu et al 2022 moreover it should be noted that the electrostatic adsorption effect is mainly related to charges on the biochar surface and the electrical properties of heavy metal ions as the biochar surface is largely negatively charged positively charged ions such as pb2 cd2 and cu2 can be easily absorbed onto biochar due to electrostatic interaction lima et al 2022 found that the maximum absorption of cd2 and zn2 by sludge biochar was 56 9 mg g and 26 1 mg g respectively 2 4 hydrogen bonding hydrogen bonding represents another mechanism by which biochar absorbs organic matter the ability of biochar to form hydrogen bonds with hydrogen atoms on pollutants except heavy metals is related to the existence of functional groups in biochar rangabhashiyam et al 2022 zhang et al 2022b found that when the pyrolysis temperature of biochar is lower than 350 c more hydrogen bonds on the material surface can effectively interact with polar organic pollutants similarly biochar prepared at a temperature lower than 500 c has more c o groups leading to a higher degradation of sulfamethoxazole wang and wang 2021 in addition the removal performance of biochar against organic pollutants can also be improved by modification xu et al 2022 prepared biochar from sludge and modified sludge biochar with montmorillonite and nano zero valent iron nzvi which produced more effective and stable functional groups on the surface of biochar promoted the aggregation of free radical cations and improved the adsorption capacity of nitrogen and phosphorus to 34 8 mg g and 294 1 mg g respectively the adsorption mechanism is related to ligand exchange electrostatic attraction and ionic bonds in addition phosphorus p can be removed by chemical precipitation and co precipitation of iron corrosion products by nzvi modification liu et al 2021 activated sludge with sodium hydroxide and prepared sludge biochar by dry mixing method the results showed that the biochar has good tetracycline adsorption performance and the maximum adsorption capacity can reach 379 8 mg g further the biochar prepared from fe mn activated sludge has good absorptivity and biodegradability for orange g 75 2 hao et al 2020 for example zhang et al 2021b formed fe0 fe3o4 biochar composite by pyrolysis of sludge and walnut shell the composite has a porous structure and a large specific surface area 109 9 m2 g and more oh is produced on the surface which can promote the degradation of methylene blue hung et al 2022 also found that the oxidation of electron transfer hydroxyl addition free radicals ho and non free radicals in the system was enhanced after the use of biochar which improved the degradation rate of phthalate esters 90 indicating that the redox property of biochar and chemical structures of pollutants have a certain effect on the redox process of organic pollutants mian et al 2020 found that n doped sludge biochar can be used as a non metal activator to effectively activate peroxymonosulfate pms and thus oxidize and remove organic matter further given the complicated composition of biochar biochar materials may contain redox active metals e g cu fe and mn which can experience certain morphological changes in the biomass pyrolysis process and participate in the reaction in the activation of oxidant thereby promoting degradation of organic matters therefore biochar is a superior absorbent for organic pollutants and can effectively activate a number of oxidants to oxidize and decompose organic pollutants in view of the influence of the synthesis method and substrates of biochar on its application we summarized the elemental composition and characteristics of biochar in order to analyze its application value it can be seen from table 3 that sludge biochar produces more ash which can be used as a biostimulator to remediate the environment zhang et al 2020a therefore sludge biochar has advantages in promoting pollutant remediation 3 application of sludge biochar in soil remediation from the analysis of heavy metal content and leachable amount in biochar it is believed that sewage sludge biochar might be also suitable for soil improvement phoungthong et al 2016 biochar can be stored in the soil for a long time due to its chemical and thermal stability shen et al 2021 the inherent characteristics of biochar have a positive impact on the physical chemical and biological characteristics of the soil amendments including soil aggregation ph regulation nutrient retention etc and lead to changes in microbial community structure he et al 2021 its adsorption mechanism diagram is shown in fig 3 meanwhile by virtue of more adsorption active sites and functional groups of biochar itself it can be used to remove and immobilize pollutants in the soil to achieve the purpose of soil remediation 3 1 physical modification the improvement of soil by adding biochar is mainly reflected in the following aspects generally the porous structure and large specific surface area of biochar reduce the soil bulk density increase the porosity and aggregate structure and improve the water retention and supply capacities and hydrophobicity adhikari et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 tokova et al 2020 added 20 t ha biochar to a silver loam haplic luvisol which significantly reduced the bulk density to 12 and increased the soil porosity to 12 zhang et al 2020c showed that biochar improved the soil aggregates the micro aggregates and large aggregates in the soil increased by 65 86 and 67 89 respectively compared with the control this led to an increase in soil physical structure accelerated the growth of crop roots and increased the total crop yield 10 16 recent studies have shown that the effect of biochar on improving water retention capacity is related to the biochar particle size and concentration mao et al 2019 showed that adding 5 biochar can significantly improve the water holding capacity and hydrophobicity of red and yellow soils vilas boas et al 2021 added 10 biochar to sandy soil to achieve 345 g kg water retention capacity as a carbon rich material biochar can improve the organic carbon content in the soil additionally the mineral elements rich in biochar can improve the soil nutrient content and effectively regulate the circulation of nutrients in the soil zhang et al 2020c added 20 40 t ha biochar in the rice wheat rotation field the organic carbon content in the soil increased by 26 53 and the content of other nutrients in the soil such as total nitrogen and phosphorus increased by 14 16 and 6 19 respectively fang et al 2020 used mg ca modified biochar to absorb phosphorus in the acid extract of incineration sewage sludge ash for fertilization further research suggested that the modified biochar enhanced soil nutrient circulation and organic matter decomposition improved the germination index of plant seeds and promoted plant growth and development ahmad et al 2022 it was found that the presence of mineral elements and functional groups in biochar promotes the alkali exchange capacity thereby increasing the ph of the soil wu et al 2020 in addition the presence of a large number of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups and aromatic ring structures provides exchange sites for ions on biochar thus improving the cation exchange capacity cec of soil and affecting the absorption of nutrients by crops alves et al 2021 added sludge biochar to the sandy loam and increased the cec value from 3 04 to 6 34 finally a beet yield of 7 17 times higher than that without biochar was obtained biochar can be used as a slow nutrient release fertilizer for soil remediation and crop growth because biochar can reduce the migration of water soluble ions nutrient loss through leaching and use of soluble mineral sources luo et al 2021 therefore the nutrient can be slowly released into the soil for a long time thus contributing to improving nutrient absorption and crop productivity fachini et al 2022 studied the release of potassium k from the sewage sludge biochar based fertilizer rich in potassium chloride to the natural silica sand the biochar reduced the potassium release rate by 77 improved the potassium utilization efficiency reduced the leaching amount of potassium and reduced the risk of this nutrient polluting the groundwater 3 2 chemical sorption in recent years the application of biochar to remove various pollutants from soil has received extensive attention and has been considered an environmentally friendly and cost effective curing agent which can directly remove pollutants from the soil by adsorption of available active sites on the surface of materials el naggar et al 2021 el naggar et al 2020 wang et al 2021b studied the use of pb adsorption sites composed of phosphorus compounds on the surface of sewage sludge cotton straw biochar to fix the pb in the soil in addition biochar increased the content of total organic carbon in the soil and formed more pb complexes thus further improving the stabilization efficiency of pb the application of biochar can also reduce the content of exchangeable heavy metals and their biological effects improve nutrient utilization and promote crop growth hale et al 2020 reduced the content of al3 significantly after adding biochar to aluminum rich soil furthermore it is worth noting that the metal is concentrated during the preparation of biochar the number of metals in biochar introduced into the soil is therefore presumed to be much more than that in the original sludge however in the study of zhang et al 2021a the use of biochar can significantly reduce the accumulation of metals in the edible part of crops corn and radish making it meet the edible content standard hazard index 1 the formation of oxygen containing functional groups c o c oh and c o and the change of ph in the soil after adding biochar can realize the adsorption and removal of heavy metals aihemaiti et al 2022 used ferrous sulfate modified sludge biochar to migrate vanadium v in the contaminated soil of the mining area the iron modified biochar provides an amorphous iron oxide with high adsorption capacity thus further fixing v in the soil the results showed that the water extractability and acid solubility of vanadium in the contaminated soil was reduced by 99 and 95 respectively and the concentration of vanadium was reduced from 340 mg kg to 14 2 mg kg for the degradation of ppcps in soil the effect of biochar has also been studied chang et al 2021 used iron manganese oxide modified biochar to increase the residual amount of phthalate in the soil which is related to the improvement of bacterial community structure by biochar it has also been confirmed that the removal of polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas from the soil by sewage sludge biochar is also an economic and environmentally sustainable waste management option krahn et al 2022 3 3 biological changes biochar can provide shelter nutrition and a comfortable living environment for soil microorganisms zheng et al 2022 the porous structure and high specific surface area of biochar can protect the attachment and growth of soil microorganisms from the impact of external adverse conditions such as soil pollutants in addition nutrient elements c n p k ash and minerals are additional nutrient sources to promote microbial growth the addition of sludge biochar can improve the state of microorganisms to achieve the degradation and fixation of pollutants in soil for example aihemaiti et al 2022 have proved that adding biochar can promote the abundance of preoteobacteria and significantly reduce the migration of v v v and v iv in soil diao et al 2022 added sludge biochar to paddy soil which affected the diversity and species of soil microorganisms actinobacteriota pontibacter and alkaliphilus and reduced the bioavailability of cd and pb ali et al 2019 found that the addition of sludge biochar to the soil had a strong impact on the accessibility of organochlorine pesticides ocps 8 69 and enriched the soil microbial community proteobateria firmitutes gemmatimonades and actinobacia the improvement of enzyme activity also proves the efficiency of biochar paz ferreiro et al 2012 monitored the activity of several enzymes that can reflect the soil quality index such as dehydrogenase beta glucosidase phytoestrase and arylsulphatase and found that the enzyme activity was promoted after the addition of sludge biochar du et al 2019 also confirmed that the addition of sludge biochar can improve the activity of aryl sulfase beta glucosidase and dehydrogenase enzymes thereby improving the removal efficiency of total carbon n and s in addition to improving microbial activity and enzyme activity biochar with its redox active functional groups graphitized structure and redox active metals can also be used as an electronic medium to promote the electron transfer process so as to achieve microbial degradation of pollutants in soil an et al 2022 found that the addition of biochar improved the electron transfer ability of microorganisms and concluded that the electrochemical properties of biochar were important factors affecting the microbial community structure tan et al 2019 used iron containing biochar to significantly accelerate the electron transfer from microbial cells to orange g thereby increasing the reduction removal rate 72 97 it is proposed that the conductive domain and the charge discharge of surface functional groups in the biochar are the key points for microorganisms to reduce orange g 4 application of sludge biochar in carbon dioxide mitigation 4 1 carbon sink with increasing greenhouse gas emissions and climate change the question of how to control the emissions of greenhouse gases has been a worldwide crucial problem research shows that the continuously increasing carbon content in the atmosphere is mainly caused by the loss of soil carbon sink during large scale land use wani et al 2022 as a stable carbon rich substance biochar can fix carbon elements in both preparation and storage processes to prevent carbon from entering the atmosphere thereby effectively improving soil carbon sink adding biochar to the soil will reduce methane and carbon dioxide emissions and fix carbon in the soil but this is limited to soil with only low organic carbon schimmelpfennig et al 2014 in the study of hu et al 2023 the fixed amount of co2 in soil increased by 50 after adding biochar because the carbon in biochar is difficult to be degraded the mechanism behind the carbon change remains to be solved meanwhile adding biochar to soil has a significant impact on the decomposition of organic matter in the soil and further improves the storage of soil organic carbon this can be confirmed by several aspects 1 compared with organic carbon in natural soil unstable carbon remaining in biochar obtained under incomplete pyrolysis is preferentially used 2 biochar induced the change of microbial community related to soil organic carbon degradation yang et al 2022 3 biochar promotes soil aggregation and reduces enzyme activities related to carbon degradation gross et al 2022 4 2 carbon emission reduction co2 capture is considered a potential strategy to reduce the amount of co2 released into the atmosphere guo et al 2022 sludge is converted into biochar through pyrolysis rather than being directly burned or mineralized which also substantially reduces carbon dioxide emissions additionally biochar is a kind of renewable resource with favorable adsorption performance as an efficient and environment friendly co2 adsorbent it has many advantages such as low energy demand low cost multi porous structure and high wide availability qiao and wu 2022 compared with other adsorbents such as amine supported silica carbonaceous materials zeolites and metal organic frameworks biochar is more stable highly aromatized and carbon rich lee et al 2020 and is expected to become an economically and environmentally friendly substitute guo et al 2022 the adsorption of carbon dioxide co2 by biochar is classified as physical adsorption and chemical adsorption the adsorption mechanism diagram of biochar in co2 mitigation is shown in fig 4 1 co2 physisorption the excellent pore structure of biochar play an important role in the physical adsorption of co2 the pore structure especially the micropores with a diameter of less than 1 nm is closer to the dynamic diameter of co2 molecules moreover because of the overlapping adsorption force and potential field of adjacent pore walls it has a stronger attraction to co2 guo et al 2016 therefore the physical adsorption can be enhanced by adjusting the pore distribution of biochar guo et al 2022 serafin et al 2017 found that by adjusting the pyrolysis temperature and pressure the biochar showed different micropore sizes resulting in different sensitivity of carbon dioxide adsorption at 0 c and 1 atm only the micropores within the range of 0 30 0 86 nm are most effective for carbon dioxide capture when the temperature rises to 25 c the optimum pore size is 0 30 0 33 nm in the study of igalavithana et al 2020b the sludge posed a more microporous structure of 0 5 nm after pyrolysis at 550 c and steam activation for 45 min achieving a co2 adsorption capacity of 2 5 mol kg according to the adsorption kinetics test the co2 adsorption is finally in equilibrium indicating that the physical adsorption of biochar is stable liu et al 2022 prepared sludge biochar at the pyrolysis temperature of 600 c the micropore volume was 0 019 cm3 g respectively and the co2 adsorption capacity reached 28 4 mg g proper adjustment of sewage sludge can promote biochar utilization as an adsorbent liu et al 2022 selected two commonly used dehydration regulators cationic polyacrylamide and polymer aluminum chloride to treat raw sludge the results showed that the micropore volume and micropore surface area of biochar were significantly increased reaching 0 025 cm3 g and 41 2 m2 g 0 022 cm3 g and 40 1 m2 g respectively meanwhile the co2 adsorption capacity of 48 5 mg g and 31 9 mg g were achieved the co2 absorbed into the pores of biochar can be released through desorption for further utilization such as direct utilization fire extinguishing cooling indirect utilization carbonation curing of cement and conversion into value added compounds in addition the recyclability of carbon dioxide can be improved through multiple adsorption desorption cycles 99 igalavithana et al 2020a 2 co2 chemisorption the co2 chemisorption depends on the surface chemical properties of biochar such as alkaline earth metals surface functional groups alkalinity hydrophobicity non polarity and aromaticity igalavithana et al 2020b shafawi et al 2021 and co2 is adsorbed by the heterogeneous interaction between co2 and the biochar surface however it is worth noting that the interaction between co2 and adsorbent decreases with the increase of co2 load therefore the adsorption capacity of biochar for co2 will get a discount when over co2 volume is loaded serafin et al 2017 increasing the surface alkalinity will change the surface functional groups to improve the interaction with co2 the co2 can be converted into carbonaceous compounds while reducing the oxygen and hydrogen content the hydrophobicity and low polarity of biochar were greatly improved which in turn improved the co2 adsorption capacity of biochar in addition the larger specific surface area provides more active sites for co2 adsorption which is conducive to co2 reduction the lewis acid base interaction and condensation between nitrogen containing and oxygen containing functional groups on biochar and co2 is the most important chemisorption interaction shafawi et al 2021 alkali elements and alkaline earth metals ca mg k na etc can improve the alkalinity of biochar thereby improving the affinity for acidic co2 and enhancing the adsorption capacity for co2 xu et al 2016 pyrolyzed sludge to produce alkaline biochar in which fe k na and other mineral components can induce chemical adsorption of co2 through mineral reaction for example feooh in biochar adsorbs co2 and converts it into fe oh 2co3 and its adsorption capacity can reach 18 2 34 4 mg g different materials and pyrolysis conditions determine the existence or types of functional groups in biochar basic functional groups and oxygen rich functional groups play a role in promoting the co2 adsorption capacity of biochar in addition common nitrogen containing functional groups amide imine pyridine pyrrole and lactam groups in biochar can also be used to improve its co2 adsorption capacity li et al 2022a reported that more nitrogen content was detected on the surface of biochar produced by sludge pyrolyzed at 700 c forming more nitrogen containing functional groups and strengthening its adsorption of co2 after koh modification the adsorption rate of biochar on co2 is faster and the adsorption capacity almost increases vertically with time finally reaching a plateau xu et al 2020 found the maximum co2 adsorption capacity of n doped biochar was 49 2 mg g which was 55 2 higher than that of original biochar the presence of heteroatoms o k n and s in biochar also plays a positive role in co2 adsorption li et al 2022b in which the presence of n and s on the surface of the biochar plays a greater role igalavithana et al 2020a this is mainly because heteroatoms can further modify the surface area and pore structure of biochar enhance the hydrophobicity of biochar and improve the electron transfer rate ochedi et al 2020 petrovic et al 2022 5 key barriers of sludge derived biochar on environmental improvement 5 1 limited adsorption capacity of sludge derived biochar the pollutants in soil and water and the co2 emissions are typically in the range of 791 71 2071 31 kg ha 7 27 42 76 t day 13 3 16 2 kt song and pang 2021 tian et al 2022 yirong 2022 respectively while the adsorption capacity of sludge derived biochar is generally less than 379 8 mg g table 2 a higher adsorption rate is required to make the industrial application of sludge derived biochar more economically viable and technically feasible therefore one of the major challenges for sludge derived biochar on environmental improvement is the poor adsorption performance from the target compounds to the biochar caused by the limited adsorption capacity this issue is particularly serious for a large number of pollutants due to the limited biochar preparation even massive sludge derived biochar is introduced into systems biochar is only available to superficial margins of the target compounds due to limited binding sites in the biochar matrix the typical equation for describing the rate of biochar adsorption is shown in eq 1 1 q e c 0 c e v m where qe represents the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g c0 and ce represent the initial and equilibrium pollutant concentrations respectively mg l v represents the solution volume ml m represents the mass of the added biochar g chen et al 2022 moreover proper biochar recycling equipment is needed since unused biochar is easily left in the system the resultant low biochar adsorption capacity will significantly increase the cost of biochar supply therefore decreasing the economic benefits 5 2 application restrictions in sludge derived biochar on environmental improvement the sludge derived biochar on environmental improvement has the advantage of simplicity however restrictions associated with possible toxicity energy consumption and cost input are big issues in sludge derived biochar applications the possible toxicity of biochar on the environment and human health is necessary to determine whether biochar can be applied on a large scale as given in table 4 the presence of pollutants and toxic substances in biochar such as volatile organic compounds vocs heavy metals potentially toxic elements ptes environmentally persistent free radicals epfrs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and dioxins depend on the source of raw sludge and pyrolysis conditions zheng et al 2019b in particular the biochar pyrolyzed from sludge also contains heavy metals toxic substances and a large amount of nitrogen and phosphorus which is easy to cause water eutrophication and soil contamination resulting in threats to the safety of animals plants or human beings he et al 2019 hu et al 2022 qian et al 2022 therefore when using sludge biochar for pollutant removal soil remediation or carbon emission reduction the composition and quantity of pollutants should be thoroughly determined the cost and energy consumption of sludge biochar pyrolysis is a significant part of the application the preparation of biochar from sludge pyrolysis are multiple processes such as feedstock supply biochar pyrolysis transportation maintenance storage and even regeneration for instance it was found that the lower raw material input is beneficial for transportation and storage and is more conducive to achieving higher pyrolysis energy efficiency li et al 2023 moreover the pyrolysis temperature largely determines the output of biochar zhang et al 2020e this phenomenon means how to balance energy consumption biochar output and biochar application efficiency is also an issue that needs to be considered in the biochar application 6 potential solutions for overcoming barriers 6 1 strategies for enhanced sludge derived biochar adsorption capacity 1 biochar modification original biochar can be directly used to adsorb pollutants heavy metals and co2 but it usually shows poor adsorption performance which limits the large scale application of biochar for adsorption therefore in practical application it is necessary to modify biochar to improve its physical and chemical properties such as improving the specific surface area increasing pore structure and embellishing surface functional groups serafin et al 2021 shafawi et al 2021 at present biochar modification includes physical modification acid modification alkali modification mineral modification nitrogen doping modification etc hu et al 2022 in the study of beckinghausen et al 2020 the sludge biochar was steam activated and the results showed that the specific surface area increased by nearly 2 5 times ma et al 2020 modified sludge biochar with phosphoric acid its specific surface area increased from 14 0 m2 g to 41 6 m2 g and its adsorption capacity for ciprofloxacin increased from 11 2 mg g to 15 0 mg g koh modification could increase the porous characteristics of biochar including both surface area and porosity it was found by li et al 2022b that the co2 adsorption capacity of the original biochar is 35 5 42 9 mg g while the value increased to 136 7 182 0 mg g after koh activation the specific surface area of the biochar is 3 9 14 5 times increased and the micropores formed also assist in enhancing the adsorption capacity of co2 another study used 4 mol l naoh solution to modify sludge biochar the specific surface area was increased from 10 9 m2 g to 135 6 m2 g and its maximum cd2 adsorption capacity reached to 5 8 mg g wang et al 2020b demonstrated that sulfur doping can promote the formation of metastable biochar persulfate complex and enhance the degradation of bisphenol a 2 co pyrolysis the effect of biochar is dependent on the type of contaminants therefore it is also worth mixing the sludge with other catalysts or co pyrolysis with multiple substrates to produce biochar for example zero valent iron zvi can be used as a filler to eliminate heavy metals due to its excellent reduction and adsorption properties song et al 2021 studies have shown that mixing biochar with zvi can remediate polluted paddy soil mildly and moderately qiao et al 2019 the combination of composite materials can change biochar into different shapes such as porous biochar biochar based beads and biochar based hydrogels so as to adapt to special environments that may lead to the loss of biochar sun et al 2022b the separate pyrolysis of sewage sludge has the disadvantages of low energy efficiency and high nitrogen content while the co pyrolysis of sewage sludge and biomass can eliminate these problems by virtue of the synergy effect qiu et al 2020 in the study of naqvi et al 2019 the co pyrolysis of sewage sludge and rice husk showed lower activation energy 45 1 kj mol 65 8 kj mol that is the biochar can be synthesized faster with lower energy consumption additionally synergistic pyrolysis could also recover organic components more effectively zhang et al 2020b found that the co pyrolysis of sludge and rice husk is more suitable for immobilization with metals and the co pyrolysis of sludge and bamboo sawdust is conducive to the increase of the aromatization of biochar furthermore the co pyrolysis of sewage sludge and other biomass can achieve more carbon fixation improve carbon storage and reduce carbon emissions into the environment sun et al 2022a igalavithana et al 2020b co pyrolyzed the sludge and pine sawdust at 550 c gave the pore diameter of 0 4 0 5 nm and surface area of 581 7 m2 g which resulted in the co2 adsorption capacity increased to 0 7 mmol g konczak et al 2020 produced biochar by co pyrolysis of sludge and co2 which can effectively reduce the toxicity of biochar and alleviate the greenhouse effect caused by co2 although modification methods can greatly improve the feasibility and effectiveness of biochar application these strategies mean additional process and resource consumption therefore developing more economical and feasible sludge biochar modification methods is an important development direction in the future 6 2 relieve sludge biochar application restrictions on environmental improvement the major challenge for the application of sludge derived biochar is the generation of toxic compounds the toxic compounds are generally produced through the following two pathways surface reactions that occur between biochar and the target compounds may lead to the release of harmful substances xiang et al 2021 which further cause potential risks to the ecological environment the free radicals of biochar itself may also induce reactive o2 species that are toxic to aquatic plants released into the water to solve the above issues several strategies can be addressed i pretreatment of sludge prior to pyrolysis such as acid elutriation yu et al 2022 advanced oxidation wen et al 2022 hydroxylamine enhanced fenton oxidation yu et al 2020 sun et al 2022b ii using aging and thermal post treated biochar to remove polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds han et al 2022 iii choosing precursors with fewer pollutants for pyrolysis in general proper pyrolysis unit design can also reduce the content of pahs vocs dioxins and persistent free radicals pfrs so as to produce biochar safely guo et al 2022 han et al 2022 the key factors to evaluate the feasibility of biochar application are the environmental impact energy consumption and economic analysis involved in the sludge derived biochar pyrolysis with the characteristics of no gas turbine and no reagent cleaning sludge biochar greatly reduces the emissions of greenhouse gases ozone and high concentrations of zn and cl thus showing lower environmental impact than most traditional sewage sludge treatments huang et al 2022 it should be noteworthy that the market price of biochar is still not comparable to the production price 0 78 cad kg biochar huang et al 2022 therefore the economic benefits and energy recovery benefits of biochar production from sewage sludge can be improved by introducing bio oil natural gas and other sewage sludge by products into the pyrolysis process you et al 2020 7 conclusion and prospects pyrolyzing sewage sludge to biochar improves the physicochemical properties of sewage sludge and broadens the range of applications compared to the challenges of traditional methods that need expensive catalysts or intensive energy sewage sludge derived biochar is promising particularly from a long term perspective considering that the input to output ratio is continuing to decline technical bottlenecks for implementing large scale sewage derived biochar for environmental improvement include adsorption capacity and application limitations in order to address these issues improved biochar modification and appropriate co pyrolysis are necessary to enable biochar adsorption capacity improvement and pollutants removal selectivity moreover integrating pretreatments and post treatments with biochar preparation is a promising strategy to avoid toxic compound contamination during environmental improvement finally the whole life cycle assessment of the aforementioned biochar preparation and application process is required to further evaluate its economics and environmental feasibility this review summarizes recent trends in the research on sewage sludge biochar it is concluded that sludge biochar has high efficiency strong applicability and environment friendly significance in the field of environmental improvements such as water pollution control soil remediation and carbon emission reduction in view of the challenges in applying biochar new strategies such as feedstock selection and pretreatment co pyrolysis and biochar modification are proposed it is expected that the insights given in this review will promote more efforts contributed to sludge biochar preparation and modification thus boosting

19911,with the rapid growth yield of global sewage sludge rational and effective treatment and disposal methods are becoming increasingly needed biochar preparation is an attractive option for sewage sludge treatment the excellent physical and chemical properties of sludge derived biochar make it an attractive option for environmental improvement here the current application state of sludge derived biochar was comprehensively reviewed and the advances in the mechanism and capacity of sludge biochar in water contaminant removal soil remediation and carbon emission reduction were described with particular attention to the key challenges involved e g possible environmental risks and low efficiency several new strategies for overcoming sludge biochar application barriers to realize highly efficient environmental improvement were highlighted including biochar modification co pyrolysis feedstock selection and pretreatment the insights offered in this review will facilitate further development of sewage sludge derived biochar towards addressing the obstacles in its application in environmental improvement and global environmental crisis graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sludge biochar environmental improvement application barriers strategies and prospects data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the advancement in the world s economy and urbanization sewage sludge as the main solid waste of urban sewage treatment plants has been increasing on a yearly basis for example in 2021 alone the total amount of sludge in china reached 80 6 million tons china 2021 it is estimated that the annual amount of sludge may be higher than 90 million tons by 2025 zhang et al 2020d according to the definition of the u s environmental protection agency epa usepa 2007 sewage sludge is reusable as it is rich in organic matter nutrients and various waste biomass materials containing trace elements yet on the other hand sewage sludge contains pathogens and heavy metal pollutants as well as a large multitude of toxic organic chemicals that are harmful to humans and the ecological system if treated improperly it can cause serious secondary pollution to the environment presently the most widely used sludge treatment methods include biological technologies anaerobic digestion aerobic composting dewatering and drying the final destinations of disposed sludge were agricultural use landfill and construction materials table 1 shows how sewage sludge is disposed of in europe america and japan as can be seen turning sludge into resources is a future trend in these areas and all over the world biochar is an easy to prepare porous material with an aromatic compound structure compared to traditional incineration combustion which requires higher temperature 300 c 1000 c and significant energy input hydrothermally treated sludge is preferable due to the lower energy consumption higher yield and oxygen containing functional group content chen et al 2021 previous studies have also found that sludge pyrolysis has great advantages over incineration in reducing heavy metal pollution at a pyrolysis temperature lower than 600 c chen et al 2020 the properties of sludge derived biochar are usually affected by factors such as moisture content pyrolysis temperature residence time heating rate etc han et al 2022 hu et al 2022 sun et al 2022b gaur et al 2020 observed the carbon content decreased significantly with the increase of retention time at each tested temperature zheng et al 2019a showed that with the increase in reaction temperature volatile matter decreased obviously for example when the pyrolysis temperature increased from 300 c to 700 c the yield of sludge biochar decreased from 91 1 to 81 2 zhang et al 2022b in addition recent researches reveal that improving pyrolysis temperature usually results in a larger biochar surface area when the pyrolysis temperature rises from 500 c to 900 c the porosity of the biochar increases from 0 056 cm3 g to 0 099 cm3 g while the specific surface area increases from 25 4 cm2 g to 67 6 cm2 g patel et al 2020 this phenomenon should be attributed to that the tar produced at low temperatures adheres to the surface of biochar and blocks the pores while the tar gradually decomposes when the temperature rises thus accelerating the formation speed of pores and increasing the specific surface area zhang et al 2022a while in some cases the specific surface area and porosity decrease when the pyrolysis temperature rises it may be due to the melting and collapse of the pore wall at excessively high temperatures similar to specific surface area and porosity the ph of biochar also changes with variations in pyrolysis temperature and materials the ph value of biochar has a significant effect on its function as an adsorbent to remove pollutants when biochar is used to remove pollutants from water the ph value of the solution significantly affects the surface charges of biochar at higher pyrolysis temperatures the alkali in sewage sludges is released from the structure and the oxygen containing functional groups decompose resulting in a decrease in the number of acidic functional groups wang et al 2019 it is also reported that the ph value of biochar is more significantly affected by its aromatization degree khan et al 2020 with a rise in pyrolysis temperature the alkalinity of organic anions in biochar also increases the above changes in the properties of biochar also affect the high adsorption of biochar for example he et al 2022 found that fine biochar with a large specific surface area has significantly higher nh4 n adsorption capacity than medium and coarse biochar however lee et al 2022 found that the adsorption capacity of anions decreases with the increase of ph while the adsorption capacity of cations increases with the increase of ph with the advantages of high absorbability stable chemical properties large specific surface area rich porous structure and numerous surface functional groups sludge derived biochar has a wide prospect of application despite numerous studies published on the production and properties of biochar to the best of our knowledge no extensive review is available on the application of sludge derived biochar on environmental improvement therefore the objective of this paper is aimed to in brief provide a state of the art review of current and emerging sludge biochar application fields that were effective in water pollution control soil remediation carbon sink and carbon emission reduction as shown in fig 1 emphasis is put on the key challenges and new strategies for overcoming sludge biochar application barriers to realizing highly efficient pollutants removal soil conditioning and carbon dioxide mitigation 2 application of sludge biochar in water contaminants removal the multifunctional characteristics of biochar show a very effective potential in the field of water environment remediation ahmad et al 2014 recent studies showed that biochar can be used as an adsorbent to remove a number of organic pollutants in water table 2 generally the absorption process and types of pollutants that can be absorbed by biochar depend on the physical and chemical structures of the biochar surface the absorption mechanisms mainly include hydrophobic interaction pore filling electrostatic adsorption and hydrogen bond qiu et al 2022 as provided in fig 2 2 1 hydrophobic interaction relevant studies show that if a pollutant has hydrophobic functional groups such as the methyl group then it can be removed by biochar through hydrophobic interaction dai et al 2019 theoretically the higher the pyrolysis temperature 500 c the higher the hydrophobicity and aromaticity of biochar the larger the specific surface area and thus the easier it is to absorb hydrophobic and nonpolar organic pollutants for example when the pyrolysis temperature is increased from 350 c to 750 c the surface functional groups hydrophobicity and crystallinity of biochar are increased making it more effective to remove tetracycline choi et al 2020 compared with low temperature pyrolyzed biochar high temperature biochar 700 c with high aromaticity enhanced its antibiotic adsorption capacity premarathna et al 2019 in particular a high dose of biochar will produce more active sites which will further enhance the adsorption of tetracycline kang et al 2023 but excessive active substances may also cause self quenching leading to the removal rate of tetracycline decreases zhu et al 2019 2 2 pore filling pore filling is considered another main mechanism by which biochar absorbs organic matter based on pore sizes pores can be structurally divided into micropores 2 nm medium pores 2 50 nm and large pores 50 nm studies found that pore structures have a significant effect on pollutant absorption in water generally biochar with medium pores is more effective in absorbing organic matter while larger pores help increase water permeability the pore size increases with the increase of pyrolysis temperature and the pores are easily filled with organic pollutants to achieve a high removal rate xu et al 2022 found that the larger the void volume of biochar the larger the specific surface area the smaller the average pore diameter the stronger the pore filling effect and thus the better the removal of organic pollutants during the pollutant removal in the liquid phase the absorption of organic pollutants is related to the micro and medium pores on biochar when removing microplastics larger microplastics are stuck in the gap of biochar and others are trapped in the pore of biochar the colloidal property of biochar winds the microplastics to increase their size so as to fix the microplastics for removal wang et al 2020d moreover the interaction between medium pores and hydrophobic pore walls also plays a significant role in removing pollutants 2 3 electrostatic adsorption electrostatic adsorption is also one of the mechanisms for pollutant removal which mainly rely on charges of the biochar surface and the electrical property of pollutants there are clay minerals with high ion exchange capacity on the surface of biochar which stimulate the adsorption of organic dyes antibiotics and other pollutants through the ion exchange premarathna et al 2019 recent studies showed that the functional groups on the surface of sludge biochar could affect the removal rate of anionic and cationic dyes wang et al 2020a demonstrated that electrostatic adsorption was the main driving force for the adsorption of acridine orange ao by biochar wang et al 2021a also concluded that the electrostatic interaction between biochar and microplastics dominates the removal of microplastics to improve the removal of organic pollutants the surface of biochar needs to be modified by functional groups with different electrical properties in addition given the charges on biochar surface are significantly affected by ph the absorption of organic pollutants is also related to variations in ph when ph 7 95 the surface of sludge biochar activated by peroxydisulfate pds is negatively charged resulting in electrostatic repulsion between pds and tetracycline which reduces the removal rate of tetracycline the degradation rate of tetracycline is the highest when ph is 5 kang et al 2023 it is generally believed that low ph i e 3 is essential for the dissolution of heavy metals yu et al 2022 moreover it should be noted that the electrostatic adsorption effect is mainly related to charges on the biochar surface and the electrical properties of heavy metal ions as the biochar surface is largely negatively charged positively charged ions such as pb2 cd2 and cu2 can be easily absorbed onto biochar due to electrostatic interaction lima et al 2022 found that the maximum absorption of cd2 and zn2 by sludge biochar was 56 9 mg g and 26 1 mg g respectively 2 4 hydrogen bonding hydrogen bonding represents another mechanism by which biochar absorbs organic matter the ability of biochar to form hydrogen bonds with hydrogen atoms on pollutants except heavy metals is related to the existence of functional groups in biochar rangabhashiyam et al 2022 zhang et al 2022b found that when the pyrolysis temperature of biochar is lower than 350 c more hydrogen bonds on the material surface can effectively interact with polar organic pollutants similarly biochar prepared at a temperature lower than 500 c has more c o groups leading to a higher degradation of sulfamethoxazole wang and wang 2021 in addition the removal performance of biochar against organic pollutants can also be improved by modification xu et al 2022 prepared biochar from sludge and modified sludge biochar with montmorillonite and nano zero valent iron nzvi which produced more effective and stable functional groups on the surface of biochar promoted the aggregation of free radical cations and improved the adsorption capacity of nitrogen and phosphorus to 34 8 mg g and 294 1 mg g respectively the adsorption mechanism is related to ligand exchange electrostatic attraction and ionic bonds in addition phosphorus p can be removed by chemical precipitation and co precipitation of iron corrosion products by nzvi modification liu et al 2021 activated sludge with sodium hydroxide and prepared sludge biochar by dry mixing method the results showed that the biochar has good tetracycline adsorption performance and the maximum adsorption capacity can reach 379 8 mg g further the biochar prepared from fe mn activated sludge has good absorptivity and biodegradability for orange g 75 2 hao et al 2020 for example zhang et al 2021b formed fe0 fe3o4 biochar composite by pyrolysis of sludge and walnut shell the composite has a porous structure and a large specific surface area 109 9 m2 g and more oh is produced on the surface which can promote the degradation of methylene blue hung et al 2022 also found that the oxidation of electron transfer hydroxyl addition free radicals ho and non free radicals in the system was enhanced after the use of biochar which improved the degradation rate of phthalate esters 90 indicating that the redox property of biochar and chemical structures of pollutants have a certain effect on the redox process of organic pollutants mian et al 2020 found that n doped sludge biochar can be used as a non metal activator to effectively activate peroxymonosulfate pms and thus oxidize and remove organic matter further given the complicated composition of biochar biochar materials may contain redox active metals e g cu fe and mn which can experience certain morphological changes in the biomass pyrolysis process and participate in the reaction in the activation of oxidant thereby promoting degradation of organic matters therefore biochar is a superior absorbent for organic pollutants and can effectively activate a number of oxidants to oxidize and decompose organic pollutants in view of the influence of the synthesis method and substrates of biochar on its application we summarized the elemental composition and characteristics of biochar in order to analyze its application value it can be seen from table 3 that sludge biochar produces more ash which can be used as a biostimulator to remediate the environment zhang et al 2020a therefore sludge biochar has advantages in promoting pollutant remediation 3 application of sludge biochar in soil remediation from the analysis of heavy metal content and leachable amount in biochar it is believed that sewage sludge biochar might be also suitable for soil improvement phoungthong et al 2016 biochar can be stored in the soil for a long time due to its chemical and thermal stability shen et al 2021 the inherent characteristics of biochar have a positive impact on the physical chemical and biological characteristics of the soil amendments including soil aggregation ph regulation nutrient retention etc and lead to changes in microbial community structure he et al 2021 its adsorption mechanism diagram is shown in fig 3 meanwhile by virtue of more adsorption active sites and functional groups of biochar itself it can be used to remove and immobilize pollutants in the soil to achieve the purpose of soil remediation 3 1 physical modification the improvement of soil by adding biochar is mainly reflected in the following aspects generally the porous structure and large specific surface area of biochar reduce the soil bulk density increase the porosity and aggregate structure and improve the water retention and supply capacities and hydrophobicity adhikari et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 tokova et al 2020 added 20 t ha biochar to a silver loam haplic luvisol which significantly reduced the bulk density to 12 and increased the soil porosity to 12 zhang et al 2020c showed that biochar improved the soil aggregates the micro aggregates and large aggregates in the soil increased by 65 86 and 67 89 respectively compared with the control this led to an increase in soil physical structure accelerated the growth of crop roots and increased the total crop yield 10 16 recent studies have shown that the effect of biochar on improving water retention capacity is related to the biochar particle size and concentration mao et al 2019 showed that adding 5 biochar can significantly improve the water holding capacity and hydrophobicity of red and yellow soils vilas boas et al 2021 added 10 biochar to sandy soil to achieve 345 g kg water retention capacity as a carbon rich material biochar can improve the organic carbon content in the soil additionally the mineral elements rich in biochar can improve the soil nutrient content and effectively regulate the circulation of nutrients in the soil zhang et al 2020c added 20 40 t ha biochar in the rice wheat rotation field the organic carbon content in the soil increased by 26 53 and the content of other nutrients in the soil such as total nitrogen and phosphorus increased by 14 16 and 6 19 respectively fang et al 2020 used mg ca modified biochar to absorb phosphorus in the acid extract of incineration sewage sludge ash for fertilization further research suggested that the modified biochar enhanced soil nutrient circulation and organic matter decomposition improved the germination index of plant seeds and promoted plant growth and development ahmad et al 2022 it was found that the presence of mineral elements and functional groups in biochar promotes the alkali exchange capacity thereby increasing the ph of the soil wu et al 2020 in addition the presence of a large number of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups and aromatic ring structures provides exchange sites for ions on biochar thus improving the cation exchange capacity cec of soil and affecting the absorption of nutrients by crops alves et al 2021 added sludge biochar to the sandy loam and increased the cec value from 3 04 to 6 34 finally a beet yield of 7 17 times higher than that without biochar was obtained biochar can be used as a slow nutrient release fertilizer for soil remediation and crop growth because biochar can reduce the migration of water soluble ions nutrient loss through leaching and use of soluble mineral sources luo et al 2021 therefore the nutrient can be slowly released into the soil for a long time thus contributing to improving nutrient absorption and crop productivity fachini et al 2022 studied the release of potassium k from the sewage sludge biochar based fertilizer rich in potassium chloride to the natural silica sand the biochar reduced the potassium release rate by 77 improved the potassium utilization efficiency reduced the leaching amount of potassium and reduced the risk of this nutrient polluting the groundwater 3 2 chemical sorption in recent years the application of biochar to remove various pollutants from soil has received extensive attention and has been considered an environmentally friendly and cost effective curing agent which can directly remove pollutants from the soil by adsorption of available active sites on the surface of materials el naggar et al 2021 el naggar et al 2020 wang et al 2021b studied the use of pb adsorption sites composed of phosphorus compounds on the surface of sewage sludge cotton straw biochar to fix the pb in the soil in addition biochar increased the content of total organic carbon in the soil and formed more pb complexes thus further improving the stabilization efficiency of pb the application of biochar can also reduce the content of exchangeable heavy metals and their biological effects improve nutrient utilization and promote crop growth hale et al 2020 reduced the content of al3 significantly after adding biochar to aluminum rich soil furthermore it is worth noting that the metal is concentrated during the preparation of biochar the number of metals in biochar introduced into the soil is therefore presumed to be much more than that in the original sludge however in the study of zhang et al 2021a the use of biochar can significantly reduce the accumulation of metals in the edible part of crops corn and radish making it meet the edible content standard hazard index 1 the formation of oxygen containing functional groups c o c oh and c o and the change of ph in the soil after adding biochar can realize the adsorption and removal of heavy metals aihemaiti et al 2022 used ferrous sulfate modified sludge biochar to migrate vanadium v in the contaminated soil of the mining area the iron modified biochar provides an amorphous iron oxide with high adsorption capacity thus further fixing v in the soil the results showed that the water extractability and acid solubility of vanadium in the contaminated soil was reduced by 99 and 95 respectively and the concentration of vanadium was reduced from 340 mg kg to 14 2 mg kg for the degradation of ppcps in soil the effect of biochar has also been studied chang et al 2021 used iron manganese oxide modified biochar to increase the residual amount of phthalate in the soil which is related to the improvement of bacterial community structure by biochar it has also been confirmed that the removal of polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas from the soil by sewage sludge biochar is also an economic and environmentally sustainable waste management option krahn et al 2022 3 3 biological changes biochar can provide shelter nutrition and a comfortable living environment for soil microorganisms zheng et al 2022 the porous structure and high specific surface area of biochar can protect the attachment and growth of soil microorganisms from the impact of external adverse conditions such as soil pollutants in addition nutrient elements c n p k ash and minerals are additional nutrient sources to promote microbial growth the addition of sludge biochar can improve the state of microorganisms to achieve the degradation and fixation of pollutants in soil for example aihemaiti et al 2022 have proved that adding biochar can promote the abundance of preoteobacteria and significantly reduce the migration of v v v and v iv in soil diao et al 2022 added sludge biochar to paddy soil which affected the diversity and species of soil microorganisms actinobacteriota pontibacter and alkaliphilus and reduced the bioavailability of cd and pb ali et al 2019 found that the addition of sludge biochar to the soil had a strong impact on the accessibility of organochlorine pesticides ocps 8 69 and enriched the soil microbial community proteobateria firmitutes gemmatimonades and actinobacia the improvement of enzyme activity also proves the efficiency of biochar paz ferreiro et al 2012 monitored the activity of several enzymes that can reflect the soil quality index such as dehydrogenase beta glucosidase phytoestrase and arylsulphatase and found that the enzyme activity was promoted after the addition of sludge biochar du et al 2019 also confirmed that the addition of sludge biochar can improve the activity of aryl sulfase beta glucosidase and dehydrogenase enzymes thereby improving the removal efficiency of total carbon n and s in addition to improving microbial activity and enzyme activity biochar with its redox active functional groups graphitized structure and redox active metals can also be used as an electronic medium to promote the electron transfer process so as to achieve microbial degradation of pollutants in soil an et al 2022 found that the addition of biochar improved the electron transfer ability of microorganisms and concluded that the electrochemical properties of biochar were important factors affecting the microbial community structure tan et al 2019 used iron containing biochar to significantly accelerate the electron transfer from microbial cells to orange g thereby increasing the reduction removal rate 72 97 it is proposed that the conductive domain and the charge discharge of surface functional groups in the biochar are the key points for microorganisms to reduce orange g 4 application of sludge biochar in carbon dioxide mitigation 4 1 carbon sink with increasing greenhouse gas emissions and climate change the question of how to control the emissions of greenhouse gases has been a worldwide crucial problem research shows that the continuously increasing carbon content in the atmosphere is mainly caused by the loss of soil carbon sink during large scale land use wani et al 2022 as a stable carbon rich substance biochar can fix carbon elements in both preparation and storage processes to prevent carbon from entering the atmosphere thereby effectively improving soil carbon sink adding biochar to the soil will reduce methane and carbon dioxide emissions and fix carbon in the soil but this is limited to soil with only low organic carbon schimmelpfennig et al 2014 in the study of hu et al 2023 the fixed amount of co2 in soil increased by 50 after adding biochar because the carbon in biochar is difficult to be degraded the mechanism behind the carbon change remains to be solved meanwhile adding biochar to soil has a significant impact on the decomposition of organic matter in the soil and further improves the storage of soil organic carbon this can be confirmed by several aspects 1 compared with organic carbon in natural soil unstable carbon remaining in biochar obtained under incomplete pyrolysis is preferentially used 2 biochar induced the change of microbial community related to soil organic carbon degradation yang et al 2022 3 biochar promotes soil aggregation and reduces enzyme activities related to carbon degradation gross et al 2022 4 2 carbon emission reduction co2 capture is considered a potential strategy to reduce the amount of co2 released into the atmosphere guo et al 2022 sludge is converted into biochar through pyrolysis rather than being directly burned or mineralized which also substantially reduces carbon dioxide emissions additionally biochar is a kind of renewable resource with favorable adsorption performance as an efficient and environment friendly co2 adsorbent it has many advantages such as low energy demand low cost multi porous structure and high wide availability qiao and wu 2022 compared with other adsorbents such as amine supported silica carbonaceous materials zeolites and metal organic frameworks biochar is more stable highly aromatized and carbon rich lee et al 2020 and is expected to become an economically and environmentally friendly substitute guo et al 2022 the adsorption of carbon dioxide co2 by biochar is classified as physical adsorption and chemical adsorption the adsorption mechanism diagram of biochar in co2 mitigation is shown in fig 4 1 co2 physisorption the excellent pore structure of biochar play an important role in the physical adsorption of co2 the pore structure especially the micropores with a diameter of less than 1 nm is closer to the dynamic diameter of co2 molecules moreover because of the overlapping adsorption force and potential field of adjacent pore walls it has a stronger attraction to co2 guo et al 2016 therefore the physical adsorption can be enhanced by adjusting the pore distribution of biochar guo et al 2022 serafin et al 2017 found that by adjusting the pyrolysis temperature and pressure the biochar showed different micropore sizes resulting in different sensitivity of carbon dioxide adsorption at 0 c and 1 atm only the micropores within the range of 0 30 0 86 nm are most effective for carbon dioxide capture when the temperature rises to 25 c the optimum pore size is 0 30 0 33 nm in the study of igalavithana et al 2020b the sludge posed a more microporous structure of 0 5 nm after pyrolysis at 550 c and steam activation for 45 min achieving a co2 adsorption capacity of 2 5 mol kg according to the adsorption kinetics test the co2 adsorption is finally in equilibrium indicating that the physical adsorption of biochar is stable liu et al 2022 prepared sludge biochar at the pyrolysis temperature of 600 c the micropore volume was 0 019 cm3 g respectively and the co2 adsorption capacity reached 28 4 mg g proper adjustment of sewage sludge can promote biochar utilization as an adsorbent liu et al 2022 selected two commonly used dehydration regulators cationic polyacrylamide and polymer aluminum chloride to treat raw sludge the results showed that the micropore volume and micropore surface area of biochar were significantly increased reaching 0 025 cm3 g and 41 2 m2 g 0 022 cm3 g and 40 1 m2 g respectively meanwhile the co2 adsorption capacity of 48 5 mg g and 31 9 mg g were achieved the co2 absorbed into the pores of biochar can be released through desorption for further utilization such as direct utilization fire extinguishing cooling indirect utilization carbonation curing of cement and conversion into value added compounds in addition the recyclability of carbon dioxide can be improved through multiple adsorption desorption cycles 99 igalavithana et al 2020a 2 co2 chemisorption the co2 chemisorption depends on the surface chemical properties of biochar such as alkaline earth metals surface functional groups alkalinity hydrophobicity non polarity and aromaticity igalavithana et al 2020b shafawi et al 2021 and co2 is adsorbed by the heterogeneous interaction between co2 and the biochar surface however it is worth noting that the interaction between co2 and adsorbent decreases with the increase of co2 load therefore the adsorption capacity of biochar for co2 will get a discount when over co2 volume is loaded serafin et al 2017 increasing the surface alkalinity will change the surface functional groups to improve the interaction with co2 the co2 can be converted into carbonaceous compounds while reducing the oxygen and hydrogen content the hydrophobicity and low polarity of biochar were greatly improved which in turn improved the co2 adsorption capacity of biochar in addition the larger specific surface area provides more active sites for co2 adsorption which is conducive to co2 reduction the lewis acid base interaction and condensation between nitrogen containing and oxygen containing functional groups on biochar and co2 is the most important chemisorption interaction shafawi et al 2021 alkali elements and alkaline earth metals ca mg k na etc can improve the alkalinity of biochar thereby improving the affinity for acidic co2 and enhancing the adsorption capacity for co2 xu et al 2016 pyrolyzed sludge to produce alkaline biochar in which fe k na and other mineral components can induce chemical adsorption of co2 through mineral reaction for example feooh in biochar adsorbs co2 and converts it into fe oh 2co3 and its adsorption capacity can reach 18 2 34 4 mg g different materials and pyrolysis conditions determine the existence or types of functional groups in biochar basic functional groups and oxygen rich functional groups play a role in promoting the co2 adsorption capacity of biochar in addition common nitrogen containing functional groups amide imine pyridine pyrrole and lactam groups in biochar can also be used to improve its co2 adsorption capacity li et al 2022a reported that more nitrogen content was detected on the surface of biochar produced by sludge pyrolyzed at 700 c forming more nitrogen containing functional groups and strengthening its adsorption of co2 after koh modification the adsorption rate of biochar on co2 is faster and the adsorption capacity almost increases vertically with time finally reaching a plateau xu et al 2020 found the maximum co2 adsorption capacity of n doped biochar was 49 2 mg g which was 55 2 higher than that of original biochar the presence of heteroatoms o k n and s in biochar also plays a positive role in co2 adsorption li et al 2022b in which the presence of n and s on the surface of the biochar plays a greater role igalavithana et al 2020a this is mainly because heteroatoms can further modify the surface area and pore structure of biochar enhance the hydrophobicity of biochar and improve the electron transfer rate ochedi et al 2020 petrovic et al 2022 5 key barriers of sludge derived biochar on environmental improvement 5 1 limited adsorption capacity of sludge derived biochar the pollutants in soil and water and the co2 emissions are typically in the range of 791 71 2071 31 kg ha 7 27 42 76 t day 13 3 16 2 kt song and pang 2021 tian et al 2022 yirong 2022 respectively while the adsorption capacity of sludge derived biochar is generally less than 379 8 mg g table 2 a higher adsorption rate is required to make the industrial application of sludge derived biochar more economically viable and technically feasible therefore one of the major challenges for sludge derived biochar on environmental improvement is the poor adsorption performance from the target compounds to the biochar caused by the limited adsorption capacity this issue is particularly serious for a large number of pollutants due to the limited biochar preparation even massive sludge derived biochar is introduced into systems biochar is only available to superficial margins of the target compounds due to limited binding sites in the biochar matrix the typical equation for describing the rate of biochar adsorption is shown in eq 1 1 q e c 0 c e v m where qe represents the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g c0 and ce represent the initial and equilibrium pollutant concentrations respectively mg l v represents the solution volume ml m represents the mass of the added biochar g chen et al 2022 moreover proper biochar recycling equipment is needed since unused biochar is easily left in the system the resultant low biochar adsorption capacity will significantly increase the cost of biochar supply therefore decreasing the economic benefits 5 2 application restrictions in sludge derived biochar on environmental improvement the sludge derived biochar on environmental improvement has the advantage of simplicity however restrictions associated with possible toxicity energy consumption and cost input are big issues in sludge derived biochar applications the possible toxicity of biochar on the environment and human health is necessary to determine whether biochar can be applied on a large scale as given in table 4 the presence of pollutants and toxic substances in biochar such as volatile organic compounds vocs heavy metals potentially toxic elements ptes environmentally persistent free radicals epfrs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and dioxins depend on the source of raw sludge and pyrolysis conditions zheng et al 2019b in particular the biochar pyrolyzed from sludge also contains heavy metals toxic substances and a large amount of nitrogen and phosphorus which is easy to cause water eutrophication and soil contamination resulting in threats to the safety of animals plants or human beings he et al 2019 hu et al 2022 qian et al 2022 therefore when using sludge biochar for pollutant removal soil remediation or carbon emission reduction the composition and quantity of pollutants should be thoroughly determined the cost and energy consumption of sludge biochar pyrolysis is a significant part of the application the preparation of biochar from sludge pyrolysis are multiple processes such as feedstock supply biochar pyrolysis transportation maintenance storage and even regeneration for instance it was found that the lower raw material input is beneficial for transportation and storage and is more conducive to achieving higher pyrolysis energy efficiency li et al 2023 moreover the pyrolysis temperature largely determines the output of biochar zhang et al 2020e this phenomenon means how to balance energy consumption biochar output and biochar application efficiency is also an issue that needs to be considered in the biochar application 6 potential solutions for overcoming barriers 6 1 strategies for enhanced sludge derived biochar adsorption capacity 1 biochar modification original biochar can be directly used to adsorb pollutants heavy metals and co2 but it usually shows poor adsorption performance which limits the large scale application of biochar for adsorption therefore in practical application it is necessary to modify biochar to improve its physical and chemical properties such as improving the specific surface area increasing pore structure and embellishing surface functional groups serafin et al 2021 shafawi et al 2021 at present biochar modification includes physical modification acid modification alkali modification mineral modification nitrogen doping modification etc hu et al 2022 in the study of beckinghausen et al 2020 the sludge biochar was steam activated and the results showed that the specific surface area increased by nearly 2 5 times ma et al 2020 modified sludge biochar with phosphoric acid its specific surface area increased from 14 0 m2 g to 41 6 m2 g and its adsorption capacity for ciprofloxacin increased from 11 2 mg g to 15 0 mg g koh modification could increase the porous characteristics of biochar including both surface area and porosity it was found by li et al 2022b that the co2 adsorption capacity of the original biochar is 35 5 42 9 mg g while the value increased to 136 7 182 0 mg g after koh activation the specific surface area of the biochar is 3 9 14 5 times increased and the micropores formed also assist in enhancing the adsorption capacity of co2 another study used 4 mol l naoh solution to modify sludge biochar the specific surface area was increased from 10 9 m2 g to 135 6 m2 g and its maximum cd2 adsorption capacity reached to 5 8 mg g wang et al 2020b demonstrated that sulfur doping can promote the formation of metastable biochar persulfate complex and enhance the degradation of bisphenol a 2 co pyrolysis the effect of biochar is dependent on the type of contaminants therefore it is also worth mixing the sludge with other catalysts or co pyrolysis with multiple substrates to produce biochar for example zero valent iron zvi can be used as a filler to eliminate heavy metals due to its excellent reduction and adsorption properties song et al 2021 studies have shown that mixing biochar with zvi can remediate polluted paddy soil mildly and moderately qiao et al 2019 the combination of composite materials can change biochar into different shapes such as porous biochar biochar based beads and biochar based hydrogels so as to adapt to special environments that may lead to the loss of biochar sun et al 2022b the separate pyrolysis of sewage sludge has the disadvantages of low energy efficiency and high nitrogen content while the co pyrolysis of sewage sludge and biomass can eliminate these problems by virtue of the synergy effect qiu et al 2020 in the study of naqvi et al 2019 the co pyrolysis of sewage sludge and rice husk showed lower activation energy 45 1 kj mol 65 8 kj mol that is the biochar can be synthesized faster with lower energy consumption additionally synergistic pyrolysis could also recover organic components more effectively zhang et al 2020b found that the co pyrolysis of sludge and rice husk is more suitable for immobilization with metals and the co pyrolysis of sludge and bamboo sawdust is conducive to the increase of the aromatization of biochar furthermore the co pyrolysis of sewage sludge and other biomass can achieve more carbon fixation improve carbon storage and reduce carbon emissions into the environment sun et al 2022a igalavithana et al 2020b co pyrolyzed the sludge and pine sawdust at 550 c gave the pore diameter of 0 4 0 5 nm and surface area of 581 7 m2 g which resulted in the co2 adsorption capacity increased to 0 7 mmol g konczak et al 2020 produced biochar by co pyrolysis of sludge and co2 which can effectively reduce the toxicity of biochar and alleviate the greenhouse effect caused by co2 although modification methods can greatly improve the feasibility and effectiveness of biochar application these strategies mean additional process and resource consumption therefore developing more economical and feasible sludge biochar modification methods is an important development direction in the future 6 2 relieve sludge biochar application restrictions on environmental improvement the major challenge for the application of sludge derived biochar is the generation of toxic compounds the toxic compounds are generally produced through the following two pathways surface reactions that occur between biochar and the target compounds may lead to the release of harmful substances xiang et al 2021 which further cause potential risks to the ecological environment the free radicals of biochar itself may also induce reactive o2 species that are toxic to aquatic plants released into the water to solve the above issues several strategies can be addressed i pretreatment of sludge prior to pyrolysis such as acid elutriation yu et al 2022 advanced oxidation wen et al 2022 hydroxylamine enhanced fenton oxidation yu et al 2020 sun et al 2022b ii using aging and thermal post treated biochar to remove polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds han et al 2022 iii choosing precursors with fewer pollutants for pyrolysis in general proper pyrolysis unit design can also reduce the content of pahs vocs dioxins and persistent free radicals pfrs so as to produce biochar safely guo et al 2022 han et al 2022 the key factors to evaluate the feasibility of biochar application are the environmental impact energy consumption and economic analysis involved in the sludge derived biochar pyrolysis with the characteristics of no gas turbine and no reagent cleaning sludge biochar greatly reduces the emissions of greenhouse gases ozone and high concentrations of zn and cl thus showing lower environmental impact than most traditional sewage sludge treatments huang et al 2022 it should be noteworthy that the market price of biochar is still not comparable to the production price 0 78 cad kg biochar huang et al 2022 therefore the economic benefits and energy recovery benefits of biochar production from sewage sludge can be improved by introducing bio oil natural gas and other sewage sludge by products into the pyrolysis process you et al 2020 7 conclusion and prospects pyrolyzing sewage sludge to biochar improves the physicochemical properties of sewage sludge and broadens the range of applications compared to the challenges of traditional methods that need expensive catalysts or intensive energy sewage sludge derived biochar is promising particularly from a long term perspective considering that the input to output ratio is continuing to decline technical bottlenecks for implementing large scale sewage derived biochar for environmental improvement include adsorption capacity and application limitations in order to address these issues improved biochar modification and appropriate co pyrolysis are necessary to enable biochar adsorption capacity improvement and pollutants removal selectivity moreover integrating pretreatments and post treatments with biochar preparation is a promising strategy to avoid toxic compound contamination during environmental improvement finally the whole life cycle assessment of the aforementioned biochar preparation and application process is required to further evaluate its economics and environmental feasibility this review summarizes recent trends in the research on sewage sludge biochar it is concluded that sludge biochar has high efficiency strong applicability and environment friendly significance in the field of environmental improvements such as water pollution control soil remediation and carbon emission reduction in view of the challenges in applying biochar new strategies such as feedstock selection and pretreatment co pyrolysis and biochar modification are proposed it is expected that the insights given in this review will promote more efforts contributed to sludge biochar preparation and modification thus boosting

19912,the safe management of fecal sludge from the 3 4 billion people worldwide that use onsite sanitation systems can greatly reduce the global infectious disease burden however there is limited knowledge about the role of design operational and environmental factors on pathogen survival in pit latrines urine diverting desiccation toilets and other types of onsite toilets we conducted a systematic literature review and meta analysis to characterize pathogen reduction rates in fecal sludge feces and human excreta with respect to ph temperature moisture content and the use of additives for desiccation alkalinization or disinfection a meta analysis of 1 382 data points extracted from 243 experiments described in 26 articles revealed significant differences between the decay rates and t99 values of pathogens and indicators from different microbial groups the overall median t99 values were 4 8 days 29 days 341 days and 429 days for bacteria viruses protozoan oo cysts and ascaris eggs respectively as expected higher ph values higher temperatures and the application of lime all significantly predicted greater pathogen reduction rates but the use of lime by itself was more effective for bacteria and viruses than for ascaris eggs unless urea was also added in multiple lab scale experiments the application of urea with enough lime or ash to reach a ph of 10 12 and a sustained concentration of 2 000 6 000 mg l of non protonated nh3 n reduced ascaris eggs more rapidly than without urea in general the storage of fecal sludge for 6 months adequately controls hazards from viruses and bacteria but much longer storage times or alkaline treatment with urea and low moisture or heat is needed to control hazards from protozoa and helminths more research is needed to demonstrate the efficacy of lime ash and urea in the field more studies of protozoan pathogens are also needed as very few qualifying experiments were found for this group graphical abstract image

to the environment rose and jiménez cisneros 2020 globally 3 4 billion people 31 of urban residents and 58 of rural residents utilize onsite sanitation technologies such as pit latrines composting

safely managed sanitation who unicef 2020 in 2017 diarrheal diseases attributed to enteric bacterial and viral pathogens caused 1 6 million deaths globally with children being the most affected dadonaite et al 2018 onsite sanitation can provide an effective barrier to pathogen transmission mehl et al 2011 however when pits and tanks fill up with sludge their contents must be emptied and conveyed to a treatment facility unless there is room to excavate a new pit or tank and cover bury the old one manual pit emptiers often experience skin infections and gastrointestinal diseases farling et al 2019 chumo et al 2021 there is a need to provide risk based recommendations for storage times in onsite sanitation facilities to protect the health of pit emptiers and other people who are exposed to fecal sludge e g from illegal dumping in pit latrines composting toilets and septic tanks fecal sludge is stored onsite often for years before the pits tanks fill up during this time if the toilet is still in use newer pathogens may be added but older pathogens die off or decay the survival of different pathogens in fecal sludge varies greatly austin and cloete 2008 chien et al 2001 jensen et al 2009 magri et al 2013 mensah et al 2013 helminths and protozoa generally survive longer than bacteria and viruses jimenez 2007 nevertheless there is a lack of understanding about the decay rates of different pathogens in fecal sludge and about the impact of design operational and environmental factors on pathogen survival pathogen decay is often assumed to follow pseudo first order kinetics based on chick s law chick 1908 while biphasic and other decay models have also been considered fidjeland et al 2013 niwagaba et al 2009 mitchell and akram 2019 found that the nonlinear jm2 model juneja et al 2006 which allows for shouldering initial delay in decay and tailing decay slowing with time provided the best fit for modeling the decay of pathogens and fecal indicators in wastewater manure and biosolids the design operation and maintenance of onsite sanitation systems directly influences the characteristics of the fecal sludge which subsequently influences pathogen survival for example toilet type flush vs dry vs urine diversion toilets influences moisture content which affects pathogen survival mehl et al 2011 temperature moisture and ph also affect the rate of pathogen decay koné et al 2007 darimani et al 2015 chien et al 2001 and can be controlled by applying additives for desiccation and or alkalinization such as soil ash or quicklime there have been inconsistent recommendations about what fecal sludge characteristics should be achieved to promote faster pathogen decay for example some authors have recommended moisture levels below 25 to achieve rapid pathogen decay in pit latrines mehl et al 2011 while others have recommended lower moisture levels of 3 5 dey et al 2016 endale et al 2012 nordin 2010 pathogens decay more rapidly at higher temperatures and the temperature of fecal sludge can be increased through composting or solar heating however the efficacy of thermal disinfection is dependent on pathogen type and influenced by matrix effects espinosa et al 2020 for viruses heat treatment causes nonoxidative denaturation of capsid proteins affecting host cell binding and resulting in a loss of viability wigginton et al 2012 for protozoan pathogens such as cryptosporidium exposure to elevated temperatures depletes carbohydrate energy reserves preventing excystation peng et al 2008 better knowledge about pathogen decay rates can help ensure safely managed sanitation systems rose et al 2019 mraz et al 2021 there have been inconsistent recommendations and unanswered questions about the hazards associated with fecal sludge emptying for example some toilets are designed with dual pits to allow for stabilization and treatment prior to removal but there are inconsistent recommendations about the storage time required before fecal sludge can be safely removed and reused e g for land application austin and cloete 2008 promoted storage for 9 to 12 months to treat fecal sludge in urine diversion toilets kumwenda et al 2019 recommended a storage time of one year or more for ecological sanitation systems in malawi others have suggested six months chien et al 2001 or even as low as three to four months jensen et al 2009 but e coli and a lumbricoides have been detected in composting latrine contents even after 14 months of undisturbed storage dey et al 2016 the recommended storage times and conditions to produce fecal sludge that can be safely reused can be improved with a better understanding about the kinetics of pathogen inactivation other factors that influence risk are the number of users of the sanitation facility and the prevalence of disease among the users for example if the contents of the pit or tank are well mixed then any pathogens present in the fresh feces will be diluted out with older material that has already experienced more decay fleming 2017 predictive microbiology involves forecasting pathogen survival using models that predict inactivation based on influencing factors e g temperature and time this approach has been previously used in the food industry kadoya et al 2019 and has also been applied for waste stabilization ponds verbyla et al 2017 sunlight mediated pathogen decay nelson et al 2018 and for free chlorine disinfection kadoya et al 2019 to our knowledge predictive microbiology has not yet been successfully applied for the management of onsite sanitation systems sherpa et al 2009 there would be great value in the development of a predictive model for pathogen decay in onsite sanitation systems which could be combined with dynamic temporal and spatial pathogen flow models to better quantify risks associated with emptying or discharging fecal sludge and excreta to the environment e g hofstra et al 2013 hofstra and vermeulen 2016 fleming 2017 kiulia et al 2015 mills et al 2018 2019 foster et al 2021 previous reviews of pathogen survival in onsite sanitation systems e g bicudo and goyal 2003 feachem et al 1983 dumontet et al 1999 sidhu and toze 2009 rudolfs et al 1950a 1950b are either outdated focused on matrices other than fecal sludge e g manure compost did not include all pathogen groups viruses bacteria protozoa and helminths did not consider design operational and environmental factors and or were not done systematically therefore the purpose of this study was to use systematic literature review and meta analysis to quantify the decay rates of pathogens in fecal sludge and to determine the extent to which pathogen decay is influenced by parameters such as ph temperature moisture content and additives for desiccation alkalinization and disinfection this research is novel because while there has been guidance from united nations sustainable development goal 6 to provide safely managed sanitation for all by 2030 there is no clear evidence for recommendations about how long fecal waste from onsite sanitation systems should be stored and under what conditions it should be stored before it can be safely emptied handled and discharged or reused this research helps answer that question by quantifying pathogen decay patterns and decay rates in fecal sludge with respect to design operational and environmental factors the following questions were addressed in this review 1 which model between the log linear regression model and the non linear jm2 model juneja et al 2006 mitchell and akram 2019 best represents the decay of viruses bacteria protozoa and helminth eggs in fecal sludge 2 how do decay rate coefficients and t99 values compare between viruses bacteria protozoa and helminths 3 to what extent do design operational and environmental factors such as ph temperature moisture content the use of additives such as urea lime and ash and the separation of urine from excreta influence pathogen inactivation rates in fecal sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 search strategy prisma guidelines moher et al 2016 were followed table s3 and a protocol was registered and published in prospero musaazi et al 2020 before the review began studies were identified from peer reviewed literature using the following boolean search string sanitation or latrines or toilets or septic tanks and pathogens or bacteria or helminth or protozoa or indicator or virus and fecal sludge or feces or excreta or compost and persistence or die off or survival or decay or inactivation or removal or treatment results were not restricted by date the following databases were consulted in february 2020 pubmed web of science and scopus an additional search was made on the bibliographies of studies identified in the first round 2 2 study selection and eligibility results from the search were imported into mendeley and duplicate entries were removed remaining articles were exported to a spreadsheet for the primary review titles and abstracts were screened independently by two co authors using the inclusion criteria described in musaazi et al 2020 briefly studies needed to include a persistence or survival with a time component b individual quantitative measurements of human pathogens or fecal indicators at each time point c fecal sludge feces or human excreta abstracts that described studies of occurrence only without a time and decay component were excluded similarly studies of microorganisms that are neither human pathogens nor fecal indicators were excluded studies of the decay of antibiotic or antimicrobial resistance genes were not included studies of persistence in non target matrices e g soils fomites non human fecal or organic waste sludge from centralized sewage systems freshwater marine waters were also excluded for the secondary review full texts were read by the lead author and another co author all studies that did not meet the aforementioned criteria were excluded as well as studies where 1 the physical and chemical nature of the fecal sludge was not well described 2 experiments took place with exposure to natural or simulated sunlight 3 primary data such as exposure times and corresponding log10 reduction could not be determined 4 methods used for enumerating microorganisms were not well described 2 3 data extraction the following data were extracted from eligible studies author publication year study location sanitation technology name of microorganism or microbial group and the method used to quantify microorganisms for studies of viruses and bacteria only data from experiments using culture based methods were included all experiments with protozoa even those that did not assess viability were included in the meta analysis since the assessment of viability is not part of standardized methods for protozoan pathogens pathogen concentrations and corresponding storage times were recorded as well as information about fecal sludge conditions under which these changes in concentrations were observed e g temperature ph moisture content unique ids were created to differentiate each experiment data collection forms were not used if the moisture content was not reported it was calculated from the percent total solids dry weight per total weight rarely the ph 5 8 of experiments temperature 2 5 of experiments or moisture content 3 3 of experiments of the fecal sludge was not reported in these cases values were imputed using the multivariate imputation by chained equations mice package in r van buuren 2021 data presented graphically were digitized using webplotdigitizer v4 1 drevon et al 2017 rohatgi et al 2019 extracted data from all papers were compiled by a single author and data from a randomly selected subset of studies 10 were independently extracted by a second author for quality control discrepancies found 5 were corrected all data were compiled into a csv file which was uploaded to the global water pathogen project gwpp k2p data portal https data waterpathogens org dataset persistence treatment quality of reported values and risk of bias was assessed based on the level of detail provided for the laboratory methods papers were qualitatively assigned a score based on 1 sufficient description of the methodology or reference to a document with sufficient description to repeat the experiment and understand what strain group of microorganisms was measured up to 1 point 2 use of internal controls to determine percent recovery up to 1 point and 3 reporting the limit of detection up to 1 point papers of all quality scores were used in the meta analysis but the quality scores were used to provide context about the limitations associated with some of the findings 2 4 model comparison all data analysis was done using r r core team 2017 the code can be found in supporting information the log linear decay model chick 1908 and the jm2 model juneja et al 2006 were compared for goodness of fit the log linear model was chosen for its simplicity and broad applicability to pathogen decay in multiple matrices the jm2 model was chosen because it was previously reported as the best model for pathogen survival in sewage sludge biosolids and manure mitchell and akram 2019 for the log linear model first order decay rate coefficients k were calculated as the slope of the natural log change in pathogen concentrations ln ct c0 with respect to time in days where ct is the pathogen concentration at time t and c0 is the concentration at time zero 1 c t c o e k t the jm2 model is represented by the following equation where c t is the concentration at time t c 0 is the concentration at time zero and k 1 and k 2 are coefficients juneja et al 2006 2 c t c o 1 1 e k 1 k 2 ln t maximum likelihood estimation was used with unbounded optimization to find the best fit parameters k1 and k2 based on data from each experiment portable fortran programs for numerical computation port routines were used for function minimization fox et al 1978 implemented via the nlminb function and the bbmle package in r bolker 2020 data from experiments with fewer than four timepoints and from experiments where concentrations were reduced by less than 90 were not used for model selection the former group was not used because it is not enough timepoints to properly fit the jm2 model the latter group was not used because the variability and uncertainty associated with pathogen measurements was similar to the variation associated with decay producing erratic estimates for model parameters many of these experiments were the control groups in studies that evaluated different treatment methods e g mckinley et al 2012 ogunyoku et al 2016 pompeo et al 2016 it was likely the authors intent to have low reduction in these control groups compared to the treatment group s nevertheless data from these experiments were still used to estimate the upper limits of t99 values and to evaluate the influence of design operational and environmental factors on log linear decay rate coefficients since omitting them from this analysis could have skewed the results the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 was used to assess the relative quality of both models for all experiments with at least four timepoints and a maximum reduction of at least 90 2 5 estimation of t99 values t99 values time required for 2 log10 reduction were estimated by algebraically rearranging eqs 1 and 2 to solve for the time that corresponded with a value of ct c0 0 01 t99 is commonly used to describe pathogen persistence mitchell and akram 2019 so it allows for comparison with other studies ideally the t99 values should be interpolated from the models however many experiments did not reach 99 reduction therefore the decay models were used to extrapolate for some experiments but only up to a distance equal to twice the maximum timepoint from the dataset if extrapolation of t99 was not possible within these limits then the t99 value was considered to be censored and was reported to be greater than 2x the maximum timepoint in the dataset for example in one of the experiments by nordin et al 2009a measurements of ascaris eggs were taken at five timepoints with a maximum time point of 22 days resulting in a maximum reduction of 0 86 log10 units extrapolation using the best fit model jm2 produced a t99 estimate of 67 2 days however since the maximum timepoint was only 22 days we reported the t99 value to be censored at 44 days summary statistics for t99 were calculated using the cenfit command from the nada package lee 2020 which implements the nonparametric kaplan meier km method this method is considered the standard approach for estimating summary statistics of censored data helsel 2012 the censoring level was assumed to be equal to twice the maximum timepoint from the dataset since the dataset was right censored data values were flipped prior to implementing the km method as described by helsel 2012 the peto prentice version of the generalized wilcoxon test helsel 2012 was used to test for significant differences between t99 values from different microbial groups using the cendiff command from the nada package lee 2020 2 6 influence of design operational and environmental factors pearson s correlation was used to understand the degree to which the decay rate coefficients moved in coordination with the design operational and environmental factors i e pathogen group ph moisture content temperature use of urea or use of desiccating alkalinizing agents analysis of variance anova and multiple linear regression von sperling et al 2020 were used to assess the influence of design operational and environmental factors as independent variables on the log linear decay rate prior to completing these analyses the distributions of decay rate coefficients were checked and log or box cox transformations were applied to make distributions more symmetrical the application of additives for desiccation alkalinization or disinfection were treated as categorical because the concentrations applied were not always reported in studies where urea was added to fecal sludge the concentration when reported was usually at least 0 5 on a wet mass basis 3 results and discussion 3 1 search results of the 479 articles identified in the search 292 18 and 42 articles were excluded based on the review of the title abstract and full text respectively fig 1 a full list of the 26 articles that met the inclusion criteria table s4 as well as articles that appeared to meet the criteria but were excluded after reviewing the full text table s5 can be found in supporting information a total of 1382 data points were extracted from 243 experiments described in the 26 articles anderson et al 2015 berendes et al 2015 chien et al 2001 darimani et al 2015 decrey and kohn 2017 endale et al 2012 fidjeland et al 2013 2016 graham et al 2003 hashemi et al 2019 jensen et al 2009 magri et al 2013 mckinley et al 2012 moe and shirley 1982 nakamura and taylor 1965 niwagaba et al 2009 nordin et al 2009a 2009b odey et

and 304 data points were extracted from 53 field based experiments of the 243 experiments 32 were performed with viruses 147 with bacteria 8 with protozoa and 56 with helminth eggs in 23 of the 32 experiments with viruses 72 bacteriophages were used ms2 phix174 t4 and salmonella 28b phages animal viruses rotavirus and adenovirus were used in the other nine experiments 28 experiments with bacteria included both indicators and pathogens total coliforms fecal coliforms streptococcus spp e coli enterococcus spp salmonella spp shigella spp and clostridia spp qualifying experiments with protozoa included cryptosporidium giardia and entamoeba ascaris eggs a suum or a lumbricoides were the only type of helminth in qualifying experiments 3 2 experimental design viruses were quantified as plaque forming units pfus in 75 of the experiments and as fluorescent cell forming units fcfus in 25 of the experiments bacteria were quantified as colony forming units cfus in 92 of the experiments and most probable number mpn in 8 of the experiments half of the experiments of protozoa assessed viability using stains e g propidium iodide and the other half only counted total oo cysts using immunofluorescence microscopy the viability of helminth eggs ascaris was assessed in all experiments with 89 based on morphology after incubation e g us epa 2003 or similar and the other 11 based on the use of stains such as safranin o sossou et al 2014 2016b in 144 of the 243 experiments 59 fresh stool feces or the contents of dry desiccation toilets e g with urine diversion were used in the other 99 experiments 41 the matrix included feces and fresh urine and of those 58 also included flushing water e g sampling from pour flush toilets cesspits septic tanks mixing feces and urine with water the three most common locations for experiments were in sweden 40 of 243 experiments burkina faso 39 of 243 experiments and china 21 of 243 experiments other experiments were performed in bolivia brazil burkina faso china great britain ethiopia haiti japan korea malawi mexico scotland sweden switzerland uganda united states and vietnam about half 50 6 of the experiments used fecal sludge with temperatures between 22 c and 34 c in 16 of the experiments the temperature was above 50 c and in 3 of experiments the temperature was below 10 c the interquartile ranges of ph and moisture content were 7 2 to 9 0 and 40 to 90 respectively the ph of the fecal sludge was below 6 in 8 of the experiments and above 9 in 24 of the experiments the moisture content was below 10 in 7 of the experiments and above 90 in 25 of experiments in 87 of 243 experiments alkalinizing or desiccating agents were added to modify the ph or moisture content lime and ash were used in 28 experiments each and organic materials sugarcane husks rice husks shea nut shells etc were added for co composting in 23 experiments urea was applied in 57 experiments of the 243 experiments 96 40 originated from studies with the maximum quality score of 3 0 47 19 originated from studies with quality scores of at least 2 0 66 27 originated from studies with quality scores of at least 1 0 and the other 34 14 originated from studies with quality scores of less than 1 0 the most common reasons for low quality ratings were the lack of recovery controls during sample concentration and not reporting limits of detection except for protozoa there were no major differences between quality ratings of papers with experiments using different microbial groups 63 of virus experiments 53 of bacteria experiments and 83 of helminth experiments received a score of 2 or higher for the 8 experiments with protozoa the scores were all between 1 and 2 mostly due to the lack of process recovery controls and the lack of reporting the method detection limits for additional statistics about the experimental conditions and the quality control scores see tables s1 and s2 3 3 model selection fig 2 shows log10 reductions with respect to time for all experiments reductions were lower for ascaris and protozoa than they were for viruses and bacteria which is consistent with a previous review of pathogen decay in sewage urine manure and surface waters mitchell and akram 2019 the reduction of bacteria was more variable than other microbial groups in most experiments bacteria were reduced by at least 2 log10 within 50 days but the same reduction took longer for viruses protozoa and ascaris eggs most experiments 53 had 4 5 6 or 7 timepoints and 22 of the experiments had more than 7 timepoints in 38 16 of the experiments there were only three timepoints with concentrations above the lod which is too few to fit the jm2 model similarly 23 9 of the experiments had only two timepoints with concentrations above the lod these experiments were not used for model selection but they were used to estimate t99 values using the log linear model the justification was that these experiments had rapid decay rates e g concentrations fell below the lod after the first or second timepoint and not including them would have skewed the results by preferentially eliminating experiments with conditions that promoted rapid pathogen decay in 65 of the 243 experiments 27 microbial reduction never reached 90 these data were not used for model selection in 11 experiments 5 there were fewer than four timepoints and maximum reduction was less than 90 meaning that 115 of 243 experiments 47 either had too few timepoints or the reduction was too low to be used for model selection of the experiments that qualified for model selection the jm2 model had lower aic values than the log linear model for 81 experiments 63 indicating that jm2 generally provided a better fit the r2 values for the log linear model were generally greater than 0 5 fig s3 but data from experiments that displayed characteristic tailing effects e g niwagaba et al 2009 hashemi et al 2019 were better modeled using the jm2 equation fig s1 experiments 292 299 323 325 some experiments with ascaris eggs e g fidjeland et al 2016 mckinley et al 2012 displayed a characteristic shouldering effect which was modeled well using the jm2 equation fig s1 experiments 192 195 262 263 some experiments with bacteria magri et al 2013 nakamura and taylor 1965 niwagaba et al 2009 nordin et al 2009b tønner klank et al 2007 showed erratic patterns of decay and apparent regrowth which could have resulted from true regrowth random sampling or large variabilities associated with recovery isolation quantification and enumeration of microorganisms in fecal sludge for slightly more than half of the 31 qualifying experiments with viruses the jm2 model had lower aic values log linear had lower aic in 15 experiments jm2 had lower aic in 16 experiments the jm2 model was also the best model for 48 of 76 qualifying experiments with bacteria two of three qualifying experiments with protozoa and for 15 of 18 qualifying experiments with ascaris 3 4 decay rate coefficients the estimated k values and standard errors and k 1 and k 2 values and sigma values for all experiments are presented in table s6 table 1 shows summary statistics of the calculated decay rate coefficients for the log linear and jm2 models also see fig s5 protozoan oo cysts had the lowest log linear decay rates with a median k value of 0 0095 days 1 decay rates for ascaris were only slightly higher with a median k value of 0 0042 days 1 the protozoa decay rates are based on an extremely limited set of experiments originating from only three papers graham et al 2003 robertson et al 1992 sossou et al 2014 where viability was only assessed in 3 of 4 experiments using dye stains these experiments were also done with lower moisture levels and higher temperatures than most experiments done with ascaris eggs table s1 the median decay rates for viruses and bacteria were 0 19 days 1 and 0 93 days 1 respectively this is consistent with previous publications that have shown that protozoan cysts and helminth eggs persist longer in the environment than viruses and bacteria since they possess durable cell walls that enhance survival peng et al 2008 ben ayed and sabbahi 2019 it is also consistent with the findings of mitchell and akram 2019 who reported higher t90 and t99 values for viruses than for bacteria in sewage urine manure and surface waters uncertainty in estimated decay rate coefficients was also larger for bacteria and viruses than it was for ascaris and protozoa as evidenced by average standard errors for decay rate coefficients of 0 92 1 04 0 13 and 0 33 for viruses bacteria protozoa and ascaris respectively uncertainty in jm2 model parameters was larger for bacteria and viruses than it was for ascaris and protozoa the average values of σ see supplemental information were 1 12 1 63 0 12 and 0 21 for viruses bacteria protozoa and ascaris respectively the k 1 value controls the amount of shouldering and the general slope of the curve at the beginning of decay with more negative values consistent with flat curves with longer shoulders median k 1 values were generally found to be negative except for bacteria ascaris and protozoa had the most negative k 1 values indicating that shouldering may be more prevalent for the decay of these pathogens in fecal sludge compared to viruses and bacteria the k 2 value controls the tail and the flatness toward the end of the curve with lower values consistent with curves that flatten out earlier and higher values consistent with curves that flatten out later the median k 2 values for bacteria protozoa and ascaris ranged from 3 1 to 3 8 and viruses had the highest median k 2 value of 4 9 the higher k 2 and less negative k 1 value for viruses reflects quicker decay with less tailing compared with ascaris and protozoa 3 5 t99 values there were 74 experiments where t99 values were censored i e microbial reduction never reached 99 and t99 could not be estimated using the best fit model without extrapolating more than twice the maximum timepoint as described in the methods section table 2 shows summary statistics of estimated t99 values for both models independently and using whichever model provided the best fit there was a significant difference between the t99 values for the different microbial groups based on the generalized wilcoxon test χ2 79 8 on 3 degrees of freedom when the best fit models were used p 0 0001 see fig s10 predicted t99 values for viruses were similar for both models with median values of 1 month with the upper 95th percentile equal to 140 days when the best fit models were used there were divergences in the predicted t99 values of bacteria and ascaris eggs depending on which model was used for instance median t99 values for bacteria ranged from slightly less than one week to slightly more than two weeks for the log linear and jm2 models respectively with a median value of just under 5 days when the best fit models were used for ascaris median predicted t99 values ranged from 260 days for the log linear model to 429 days when the best fit models were used due to higher censoring when the jm2 model was used the median t99 value could only be determined to be greater than 67 days the divergence between summary statistics computed based on the different models can be explained by tailing patterns that are represented with the jm2 model but not the log linear model of the eight qualifying experiments with protozoa none achieved more than 99 reduction so all t99 values are based on model extrapolations despite this limitation the median t99 value was still estimated to be greater than 341 days graham et al 2003 reported a 83 and a 67 decrease in the number of giardia cysts in fecal sludge from biodegrading and dehydrating toilets respectively after a storage period of 6 months however the authors did not measure viability the estimated t99 value for cryptosporidium was 221 days or more and the estimated t99 value for entamoeba was 109 days or more depending on which models were used these t99 values are much longer than 86 days and 70 days which is what has been previously reported for cryptosporidium in swine waste jenkins et al 2013 and groundwater sidhu and toze 2012 respectively more research is needed to better understand the persistence of protozoan pathogens in fecal sludge matrices as the findings presented here are based on limited data 3 6 influence of ph temperature moisture urine diversion and additives the distribution of estimated log linear decay rate coefficients k was highly skewed natural logarithm transformations made the distribution more symmetrical fig s4 likewise the distribution of jm2 model coefficient k 2 was skewed and a box cox transformation ln k 2 made the distribution more symmetrical the distribution of k 1 values was already relatively symmetrical but had very long tails 3 6 1 ph the ph of fecal sludge had no significant correlation with ln k pearson

1999 the presence of free ammonia at high ph levels may drive inactivation more than ph alone kohn et al 2017 unless very high ph levels are reached e g 12 ghiglietti et al 1997 1995 reported that ascaris eggs treated with ammonia at ph 11 9 and a temperature of 30 c were inactivated and that thermal treatment at 40 c impeded the eggs development even in the absence of ammonia mehl et al 2011 suggested that a ph of 9 or above will inactivate pathogens including helminth eggs after six months if temperatures are above 40 c 3 6 2 temperature temperature correlated significantly with ln k pearson s r 0 52 p 0 0001 k 1 pearson s r 0 55 p 0 001 and ln k 2 pearson s r 0 42 p 0 001 this is consistent with a review by espinosa et al 2020 which indicated that temperatures above 50 c yielded reductions of 3 log10 or greater within a few hours for many pathogens and within a month for the most resistant pathogens however the correlation was strongly influenced by 35 experiments at extreme temperatures above 50 c or below freezing and fecal sludge in onsite toilets rarely reaches these temperatures data from experiments performed at temperatures above 50 c or below 0 c were removed for subsequent meta analysis after removing these data temperature did not correlate significantly with ln k pearson s r 0 10 p 0 15 or ln k 2 pearson s r 0 13 p 0 1154 but it did correlate significantly with k 1 pearson s r 0 20 p 0 0134 fig s7b this indicates that extreme temperatures can influence pathogen decay in fecal sludge but for systems operating at ambient temperatures the influence may be minimal the limited impact of temperature within the ambient range could also be attributed to the heterogeneous distribution of temperature in fecal sludge preneta et al 2013 tønner klank et al 2007 which can be addressed by mixing e g turning compost piles in summary temperatures needed to achieve rapid pathogen decay i e above 50 c were not achieved in most of the experiments and might be difficult to obtain in a real world setting unless designs are modified such as toilets with solar heated chambers cruz espinosa et al 2012 sossou et al 2016a koottatep et al 2020 3 6 3 moisture interestingly higher moisture correlated significantly with higher ln k values pearson s r 0 28 p 0 001 higher k 1 values pearson s r 0 20 p 0 0059 and higher ln k 2 values pearson s r 0 17 p 0 0195 this was counterintuitive since desiccation should increase pathogen inactivation king and monis 2007 himathongkham and riemann 1999 in general ascaris eggs were subjected to higher moisture conditions than other pathogen groups in the experiments and experiments with ascaris eggs made up nearly one fourth of the data set which could be one explanation for the findings lower moisture should cause more rapid inactivation but there is no consensus in the literature about how dry fecal sludge must be to experience this effect it likely differs for different pathogens ascaris and entamoeba persisted in pit latrines after 7 months storage at a moisture content of 29 gibson 2014 mehl et al 2011 recommended less than 25 moisture for pathogen inactivation in pit latrines however others have noted that ascaris eggs possess a multi layered wall composed of chitin and lipids which makes them tolerant to desiccation thus moisture levels below 5 may be needed for their inactivation nordin 2010 in 199 of the 243 experiments from this review fecal sludge moisture levels were above 25 except for the experiments done by endale et al 2012 where the moisture content got as low as 3 after a month of storage the lowest moisture in any other experiment was 7 8 magri et al 2013 which may not be low enough to induce rapid inactivation as such observed decay rates from this review might be confounded by factors other than moisture more research is needed to better understand the role of moisture on pathogen inactivation in fecal sludge 3 6 4 sanitation technology fecal sludge matrix fig 3 shows log transformed k values for the log linear model from experiments performed with different fecal sludge matrices conventional vs urine diverting toilets the use of urea for disinfection and the use of additives for desiccation or alkalinization e g ash lime soil etc fig s6 shows similar box plots for k 1 and k 2 values obtained from the jm2 model for ascaris eggs and protozoan pathogens ln k values from experiments with matrices consistent with fecal sludge from urine diversion toilets feces only were significantly greater p 0 009 than the ln k values from experiments with fecal sludge consistent with conventional pit toilets excreta i e feces and urine for bacteria and viruses the opposite was true p 0 0001 this suggests that the type of toilet may influence decay rates of different pathogen groups in different ways 3 6 5 urea on average for experiments where urea or stored urine was added as a source of ammonia for disinfection decay rates of ascaris eggs and protozoan pathogens were significantly higher p 0 018 than they were when urea was not added this effect was more pronounced in fecal sludge for urine diverting dry toilets uddts than it was in conventional toilets where fresh urine was mixed with fecal matter perhaps due to ph differences fresh urine has a ph between 6 and 7 while the ph of commercial urea and stored urine is often as high as 9 hoglund 2001 ammonia produced from the hydrolysis of urea in stored urine acts as a disinfectant since it is in the nh3 form instead of the protonated form which happens above ph 9 kohn et al 2017 nh3 can diffuse through microbial cell membranes raising the internal ph and reducing viability nelson and pecson 2005 through protein denaturation and the cleavage of nucleic acids nordin 2010 in urine the viability of protozoa is affected by natural ammonia hoglund 2001 but the effects of ammonia sanitization may be minimal in pit latrines and other onsite toilets because of unfavorable ph conditions and the lack of airtight storage which permits ammonia loss to the atmosphere fidjeland et al 2015 in experiments where urea or stored urine was added to fecal sludge anderson et al 2015 fidjeland et al 2016 nordin et al 2009a 2009b magri et al 2013 mckinley et al 2012 ogunyoku et al 2016 sossou et al 2016b concentrations of non protonated nh3 ranged from 14 mg l nh3 n to above 4000 mg l nh3 n but were above 100 mg l nh3 n in most experiments 70 the concentration of non protonated ammonia nh3 n correlated strongly with the amount of urea applied and the ph of the fecal sludge fig s2 unlike ascaris and protozoa there was no significant difference for viruses and bacteria between experiments done with vs without urea p 0 891 3 6 6 alkalinizing and desiccating additives lime was the only additive that caused significantly higher decay rates compared to the control no additives and compared to all other additives p 0 0001 however this was only true for experiments with viruses and bacteria pairwise comparisons revealed that the application of organic materials resulted in significantly lower decay rates of viruses and bacteria compared to the control group for ascaris eggs and protozoan pathogens there were no significant differences between the different additive groups p 0 707 however significant effects of additives have been reported in individual studies but there may have been confounding factors graham et al 2003 compared giardia and cryptosporidium in the contents of uddts with lime addition vs non flush vault toilets without urine diversion finding more rapid reduction in the uddt with lime however the authors did not assess viability endale et al 2012 studied the decay of ascaris eggs in feces no urine after adding lime soil ash or nothing experiments 128 131 fig s1 reporting that experiments with lime and ash produced similar decay rates that were only slightly faster than the control no additives mckinley et al 2012 found that the application of ash to excreta without fresh urine experiment 193 provided more rapid inactivation of ascaris eggs relative to the control experiment 191 but the use of ash for excreta mixed with fresh urine experiment 194 had much more rapid decay and decay was even faster when excreta was mixed with stored urine experiment 195 ogunyoku et al 2016 reported more rapid inactivation of ascaris eggs when lime and urea were added compared to a lower decay rate in feces with lime but without urea experiments 179 181 the latter group had similar decay compared to the control feces plus urea but without lime nordin et al 2009a reported a reduction of 1 log10 after 35 days of storage with ash experiment 187 with much faster reduction when urea was also added at a concentration of 1 by weight experiment 189 this indicates that the effect on ascaris eggs may be derived more from the disinfection properties of nh3 rather than the addition of just ash or lime the addition of 20 quicklime dry mass basis can raise the ph of sludge from ph 6 5 to ph 12 north et al 2008 as mentioned above ph alone did not correlate with decay rates and the use of ash did not have as much of an impact as lime on the decay of bacteria and viruses endale et al 2012 reported that ash treatment of fecal sludge in an eco sanitation system took one month to achieve the same reduction of fecal coliforms as lime treatment achieved in one day like lime ash can also increase the ph of fecal sludge but larger doses are required for example monney and awuah 2016 found that the addition of 180 g of wood ash per liter of sludge produced ph levels of 11 but only 21 3 g of lime per liter of sludge increased the ph to above 12 endale et al 2012 and mckinley et al 2012 raised the ph of fecal sludge to 9 with ash but when they used lime the ph reached 11 or 12 in summary ash does not appear to have the same level of disinfection efficacy as lime for the treatment of fecal sludge also there is not enough evidence to suggest that the decay of ascaris eggs in fecal sludge is significantly increased by only adding lime e g without also adding urea 3 7 multiple linear regression table 3 shows the coefficients standard errors and significance levels for the regression that predicts ln k using the independent variables microbial group temperature moisture ph addition of urea or stored urine use of uddts and use of additives for desiccation or alkalinization the intercept includes bacterial decay in fecal sludge with a ph of 8 a temperature of 20 c a moisture content of 60 without urine diversion and with no urea or other additives added which are typical conditions for a pit latrine bakare et al 2012 nabateesa et al 2017 zuma et al 2015 the model was significant with a residual standard error of 1 669 an f statistic of 23 52 on 15 and 177 degrees of freedom p 0 0001 standardized residuals were randomly distributed with limited deviations from normality fig s8 the r2 value was 0 6659 adjusted r2 0 6376 so the model accounted for two thirds of the variability in decay rates the coefficients for ph and temperature were positive and significant indicating that higher ph and higher temperatures caused more rapid pathogen decay the coefficient for uddt was positive and significant indicating the benefits of urine diversion on decay rates the coefficient for urea addition was positive but not significant this suggests that the use of urea alone may not significantly improve pathogen decay in onsite toilets perhaps unless ph is also increased all additives except for lime and organics had non significant coefficients implying a limited effect on pathogen decay lime had a significant positive coefficient implying that it increased decay rates organic materials for co composting such as sugarcane husks berendes et al 2015 rice husks hashemi et al 2019 or shea nut shells sossou et al 2014 had a significant negative coefficient p 0 003 indicating a potential protective effect on pathogen survival there have been mixed results about the impact of composting processes on pathogen reduction for instance bustamante et al 2008 reported that bacterial indicators and pathogens e g e coli salmonella were not completely eliminated during the co composting of winery and distillery wastes and that the regrowth of bacterial pathogens was influenced by humidity nutrient availability and the presence of competitive microbiota manga et al 2016 found that the use of chicken feathers for co composting fecal sludge instead of organic market waste significantly impacted temperatures which sped up the decay of helminth eggs the estimated intercept was 1 974 which equates to a k value of 0 139 days 1 this produces a t99 value of 33 days implying that on average approximately one month is required for a 2 log10 reduction of bacterial pathogens under the conditions typical of a pit latrine ph 8 20 c 60 moisture no additives the regression coefficients for viruses protozoa and ascaris eggs were negative and significant implying that these pathogen groups decay at slower rates relative to bacteria for viruses under the conditions typical of a pit latrine the estimated k value of 0 056 days 1 produced a t99 of 82 days for protozoan oo cysts and ascaris eggs the estimated k values under the same conditions typical of a pit latrine lead to predicted t99 values of more than a year the regression also indicates that pathogens in fecal sludge at 20 c survive 1 8 times longer on average than they do at 30 c which supports a recommendation that storage times should be twice as long in colder climates 3 8 policy implications the findings from this study have broader policy implications for more than 3 billion people worldwide who use onsite sanitation systems who unicef 2020 recommendations for the storage and treatment of fecal sludge have been made but with limited supporting evidence the who 2006 recommended storage times of 6 months with ph of 9 or more temperature above 35 c and moisture below 25 p 69 without alkaline treatment they recommended storage of at least 1 year for temperatures of 20 35 c and 1 5 2 years for temperatures of 2 20 c stating that higher temperatures provide more or less complete inactivation of ascaris eggs within 1 year and substantial to total inactivation of viruses bacteria and protozoa and that at the lower temperatures viruses and parasitic protozoa would be reduced below risk levels but that some soil borne ova may persist in low numbers after 1 5 2 years who 2006 these recommendations were based on the works of austin 2001 carlander and westrell 1999 chien et al 2001 lan et al 2001 moe and izurieta 2004 peasey 2000 phi et al 2004 strauss 1985 and wang 1999 which are all either technical reports conference proceedings or conference abstracts except for chien et al 2001 all other cited works were either not accessible or did not meet the inclusion criteria for this systematic review and meta analysis stenström et al 2011 made slightly different recommendations for the storage of fecal sludge from uddts when wood ash or lime was added claiming that 6 12 months of storage would provide reductions of up to 4 log units for viruses 6 logs for bacteria and a total reduction of viable protozoa and helminths tilley et al 2014 and the who 2018 repeated these recommendations for alkaline treatment of fecal sludge from uddts suggesting a minimum storage time of 6 months if ash or lime are used more recently the who 2022 stated that more than 2 log10 reduction of pathogens except for ascaris eggs is achieved after the fecal sludge from dry toilets with twin pits fossa alterna is stored for at least 2 years for flush toilets with alternating pits they suggested a similar reduction would be achieved after at least 1 year storage at 20 c or storage of at least 6 months if ph is adjusted to 9 e g with lime or ash who 2022 for regions where helminth infections are prevalent they recommended 1 5 2 years of storage at 2 20 c who 2022 but did not cite any other new sources besides who 2006 stenström et al 2011 and tilley et al 2014 results from our meta analysis provide a more expansive evidence base for recommendations about fecal sludge storage times our findings indicate that the use of lime and ash alone may not effectively inactivate ascaris eggs unless urea is also added without urea storage times for alkalinized fecal sludge from uddts should be longer than 6 months due to risks presented not only from ascaris eggs but potentially also from protozoan pathogens although more research is needed on protozoan pathogen viability under these conditions also the storage of non alkalinized fecal sludge for 1 year at temperatures of 20 35 c does not provide more or less complete inactivation of ascaris eggs as originally suggested by who 2006 for all experiments with ascaris eggs from this meta analysis where lime ash or urea were not added to the fecal sludge and where the ph was less than 9 the maximum reductions were all less than or equal to 1 5 log10 3 9 limitations there are several limitations to the findings from this study first only english language publications in three databases pubmed web of science and scopus were consulted second the data used originated from articles that used different methods and potentially different levels of quality control we qualitatively assigned a score to each paper based on the description of the methods used and the use of process controls but all data were still used in the meta analysis nevertheless the potential bias created by experiments using different quality control methods was likely minimal except for the experiments done with protozoa since none of these experiments used process recovery controls and viability was not assessed in some of the experiments a third limitation is that the data for helminth eggs was entirely based on experiments done with ascaris and may not be representative of other helminths also there were only eight experiments from three qualifying publications for protozoan pathogens only four of these experiments qualified for the calculation of decay rates and in one of them graham et al 2003 oocyst viability was not assessed which could have led to underestimated decay rates and overestimated t99 values for the regression there were some scenarios for which very few experiments were performed for example there were 25 experiments where lime was added to fecal sludge 19 of them measured concentrations of bacteria but only two measured viruses there were no experiments with viruses or protozoa where urea was added to the fecal sludge and the ph was greater than 9 all data produced under those experimental conditions were for ascaris salmonella or fecal indicator bacteria another limitation of the findings from the regression analysis is that with all the factors involved in the model the coefficients may not always reflect the true impact of the factor on pathogen decay dropping some factors could change the magnitude of coefficients for other factors another limitation is that most experiments were lab based a comparison of the results from field based and lab based studies for ascaris eggs found slower decay and higher t99 values in the field based studies which may reflect differences between design user habits or other potential socioeconomic differences in field systems compared to controlled laboratory studies more field based research is needed to confirm trends that have been reported in laboratory settings 4 conclusions we used systematic review and meta analysis to draw insights about pathogen survival in fecal sludge from onsite toilets with respect to design operational and environmental factors the jm2 model provided a better fit to experimental data than the log linear chick model for all pathogen groups the rate of pathogen decay in fecal sludge was significantly different for different pathogen types bacteria died off the fastest followed by viruses then protozoa and helminths the overall median t99 values were 4 8 days 29 days 341 days and 429 days for bacteria viruses protozoan oo cysts and ascaris eggs respectively using the best fit models microbial group ph temperature moisture toilet design e g urine diversion and the use of additives explained two thirds of the variability in decay rate coefficients as expected higher ph values higher temperatures and the application of lime all significantly predicted greater decay rates however lime was more effective for bacteria and viruses than it was for ascaris eggs and protozoan pathogens fecal sludge stored for six months without treatment adequately controls hazards from viruses and bacteria but much longer storage times or alkaline treatment with urea and low moisture or heat is needed to control hazards from protozoan oo cysts and

19912,the safe management of fecal sludge from the 3 4 billion people worldwide that use onsite sanitation systems can greatly reduce the global infectious disease burden however there is limited knowledge about the role of design operational and environmental factors on pathogen survival in pit latrines urine diverting desiccation toilets and other types of onsite toilets we conducted a systematic literature review and meta analysis to characterize pathogen reduction rates in fecal sludge feces and human excreta with respect to ph temperature moisture content and the use of additives for desiccation alkalinization or disinfection a meta analysis of 1 382 data points extracted from 243 experiments described in 26 articles revealed significant differences between the decay rates and t99 values of pathogens and indicators from different microbial groups the overall median t99 values were 4 8 days 29 days 341 days and 429 days for bacteria viruses protozoan oo cysts and ascaris eggs respectively as expected higher ph values higher temperatures and the application of lime all significantly predicted greater pathogen reduction rates but the use of lime by itself was more effective for bacteria and viruses than for ascaris eggs unless urea was also added in multiple lab scale experiments the application of urea with enough lime or ash to reach a ph of 10 12 and a sustained concentration of 2 000 6 000 mg l of non protonated nh3 n reduced ascaris eggs more rapidly than without urea in general the storage of fecal sludge for 6 months adequately controls hazards from viruses and bacteria but much longer storage times or alkaline treatment with urea and low moisture or heat is needed to control hazards from protozoa and helminths more research is needed to demonstrate the efficacy of lime ash and urea in the field more studies of protozoan pathogens are also needed as very few qualifying experiments were found for this group graphical abstract image

dadonaite et al 2018 onsite sanitation can provide an effective barrier to pathogen transmission mehl et al 2011 however when pits and tanks fill up with sludge their contents must be emptied and conveyed to a treatment facility unless there is room to excavate a new pit or tank and cover bury the old one manual pit emptiers often experience skin infections and gastrointestinal diseases farling et al 2019 chumo et al 2021 there is a need to provide risk based recommendations for storage times in onsite sanitation facilities to protect the health of pit emptiers and other people who are exposed to fecal sludge e g from illegal dumping in pit latrines composting toilets and septic tanks fecal sludge is stored onsite often for years before the pits tanks fill up during this time if the toilet is still in use newer pathogens may be added but older pathogens die off or decay the survival of different pathogens in fecal sludge varies greatly austin and cloete 2008 chien et al 2001 jensen et al 2009 magri et al 2013 mensah et al 2013 helminths and protozoa generally survive longer than bacteria and viruses jimenez 2007 nevertheless there is a lack of understanding about the decay rates of different pathogens in fecal sludge and about the impact of design operational and environmental factors on pathogen survival pathogen decay is often assumed to follow pseudo first order kinetics based on chick s law chick 1908 while biphasic and other decay models have also been considered fidjeland et al 2013 niwagaba et al 2009 mitchell and akram 2019 found that the nonlinear jm2 model juneja et al 2006 which allows for shouldering initial delay in decay and tailing decay slowing with time provided the best fit for modeling the decay of pathogens and fecal indicators in wastewater manure and biosolids the design operation and maintenance of onsite sanitation systems directly influences the characteristics of the fecal sludge which subsequently influences pathogen survival for example toilet type flush vs dry vs urine diversion toilets influences moisture content which affects pathogen survival mehl et al 2011 temperature moisture and ph also affect the rate of pathogen decay koné et al 2007 darimani et al 2015 chien et al 2001 and can be controlled by applying additives for desiccation and or alkalinization such as soil ash or quicklime there have been inconsistent recommendations about what fecal sludge characteristics should be achieved to promote faster pathogen decay for example some authors have recommended moisture levels below 25 to achieve rapid pathogen decay in pit latrines mehl et al 2011 while others have recommended lower moisture levels of 3 5 dey et al 2016 endale et al 2012 nordin 2010 pathogens decay more rapidly at higher temperatures and the temperature of fecal sludge can be increased through composting or solar heating however the efficacy of thermal disinfection is dependent on pathogen type and influenced by matrix effects espinosa et al 2020 for viruses heat treatment causes nonoxidative denaturation of capsid proteins affecting host cell binding and resulting in a loss of viability wigginton et al 2012 for protozoan pathogens such as cryptosporidium exposure to elevated temperatures depletes carbohydrate energy reserves preventing excystation peng et al 2008 better knowledge about pathogen decay rates can help ensure safely managed sanitation systems rose et al 2019 mraz et al 2021 there have been inconsistent recommendations and unanswered questions about the hazards associated with fecal sludge emptying for example some toilets are designed with dual pits to allow for stabilization and treatment prior to removal but there are inconsistent recommendations about the storage time required before fecal sludge can be safely removed and reused e g for land application austin and cloete 2008 promoted storage for 9 to 12 months to treat fecal sludge in urine diversion toilets kumwenda et al 2019 recommended a storage time of one year or more for ecological sanitation systems in malawi others have suggested six months chien et al 2001 or even as low as three to four months jensen et al 2009 but e coli and a lumbricoides have been detected in composting latrine contents even after 14 months of undisturbed storage dey et al 2016 the recommended storage times and conditions to produce fecal sludge that can be safely reused can be improved with a better understanding about the kinetics of pathogen inactivation other factors that influence risk are the number of users of the sanitation facility and the prevalence of disease among the users for example if the contents of the pit or tank are well mixed then any pathogens present in the fresh feces will be diluted out with older material that has already experienced more decay fleming 2017 predictive microbiology involves forecasting pathogen survival using models that predict inactivation based on influencing factors e g temperature and time this approach has been previously used in the food industry kadoya et al 2019 and has also been applied for waste stabilization ponds verbyla et al 2017 sunlight mediated pathogen decay nelson et al 2018 and for free chlorine disinfection kadoya et al 2019 to our knowledge predictive microbiology has not yet been successfully applied for the management of onsite sanitation systems sherpa et al 2009 there would be great value in the development of a predictive model for pathogen decay in onsite sanitation systems which could be combined with dynamic temporal and spatial pathogen flow models to better quantify risks associated with emptying or discharging fecal sludge and excreta to the environment e g hofstra et al 2013 hofstra and vermeulen 2016 fleming 2017 kiulia et al 2015 mills et al 2018 2019 foster et al 2021 previous reviews of pathogen survival in onsite sanitation systems e g bicudo and goyal 2003 feachem et al 1983 dumontet et al 1999 sidhu and toze 2009 rudolfs et al 1950a 1950b are either outdated focused on matrices other than fecal sludge e g manure compost did not include all pathogen groups viruses bacteria protozoa and helminths did not consider design operational and environmental factors and or were not done systematically therefore the purpose of this study was to use systematic literature review and meta analysis to quantify the decay rates of pathogens in fecal sludge and to determine the extent to which pathogen decay is influenced by parameters such as ph temperature moisture content and additives for desiccation alkalinization and disinfection this research is novel because while there has been guidance from united nations sustainable development goal 6 to provide safely managed sanitation for all by 2030 there is no clear evidence for recommendations about how long fecal waste from onsite sanitation systems should be stored and under what conditions it should be stored before it can be safely emptied handled and discharged or reused this research helps answer that question by quantifying pathogen decay patterns and decay rates in fecal sludge with respect to design operational and environmental factors the following questions were addressed in this review 1 which model between the log linear regression model and the non linear jm2 model juneja et al 2006 mitchell and akram 2019 best represents the decay of viruses bacteria protozoa and helminth eggs in fecal sludge 2 how do decay rate coefficients and t99 values compare between viruses bacteria protozoa and helminths 3 to what extent do design operational and environmental factors such as ph temperature moisture content the use of additives such as urea lime and ash and the separation of urine from excreta influence pathogen inactivation rates in fecal sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 search strategy prisma guidelines moher et al 2016 were followed table s3 and a protocol was registered and published in prospero musaazi et al 2020 before the review began studies were identified from peer reviewed literature using the following boolean search string sanitation or latrines or toilets or septic tanks and pathogens or bacteria or helminth or protozoa or indicator or virus and fecal sludge or feces or excreta or compost and persistence or die off or survival or decay or inactivation or removal or treatment results were not restricted by date the following databases were consulted in february 2020 pubmed web of science and scopus an additional search was made on the bibliographies of studies identified in the first round 2 2 study selection and eligibility results from the search were imported into mendeley and duplicate entries were removed remaining articles were exported to a spreadsheet for the primary review titles and abstracts were screened independently by two co authors using the inclusion criteria described in musaazi et al 2020 briefly studies needed to include a persistence or survival with a time component b individual quantitative measurements of human pathogens or fecal indicators at each time point c fecal sludge feces or human excreta

description to repeat the experiment and understand what strain group of microorganisms was measured up to 1 point 2 use of internal controls to determine percent recovery up to 1 point and 3 reporting the limit of detection up to 1 point papers of all quality scores were used in the meta analysis but the quality scores were used to provide context about the limitations associated with some of the findings 2 4 model comparison all data analysis was done using r r core team 2017 the code can be found in supporting information the log linear decay model chick 1908 and the jm2 model juneja et al 2006 were compared for goodness of fit the log linear model was chosen for its simplicity and broad applicability to pathogen decay in multiple matrices the jm2 model was chosen because it was previously reported as the best model for pathogen survival in sewage sludge biosolids and manure mitchell and akram 2019 for the log linear model first order decay rate coefficients k were calculated as the slope of the natural log change in pathogen concentrations ln ct c0 with respect to time in days where ct is the pathogen concentration at time t and c0 is the concentration at time zero 1 c t c o e k t the jm2 model is represented by the following equation where c t is the concentration at time t c 0 is the concentration at time zero and k 1 and k 2 are coefficients juneja et al 2006 2 c t c o 1 1 e k 1 k 2 ln t maximum likelihood estimation was used with unbounded optimization to find the best fit parameters k1 and k2 based on data from each experiment portable fortran programs for numerical computation port routines were used for function minimization fox et al 1978 implemented via the nlminb function and the bbmle package in r bolker 2020 data from experiments with fewer than four timepoints and from experiments where concentrations were reduced by less than 90 were not used for model selection the former group was not used because it is not enough timepoints to properly fit the jm2 model the latter group was not used because the variability and uncertainty associated with pathogen measurements was similar to the variation associated with decay producing erratic estimates for model parameters many of these experiments were the control groups in studies that evaluated different treatment methods e g mckinley et al 2012 ogunyoku et al 2016 pompeo et al 2016 it was likely the authors intent to have low reduction in these control groups compared to the treatment group s nevertheless data from these experiments were still used to estimate the upper limits of t99 values and to evaluate the influence of design operational and environmental factors on log linear decay rate coefficients since omitting them from this analysis could have skewed the results the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 was used to assess the relative quality of both models for all experiments with at least four timepoints and a maximum reduction of at least 90 2 5 estimation of t99 values t99 values time required for 2 log10 reduction were estimated by algebraically rearranging eqs 1 and 2 to solve for the time that corresponded with a value of ct c0 0 01 t99 is commonly used to describe pathogen persistence mitchell and akram 2019 so it allows for comparison with other studies ideally the t99 values should be interpolated from the models however many experiments did not reach 99 reduction therefore the decay models were used to extrapolate for some experiments but only up to a distance equal to twice the maximum timepoint from the dataset if extrapolation of t99 was not possible within these limits then the t99 value was considered to be censored and was reported to be greater than 2x the maximum timepoint in the dataset for example in one of the experiments by nordin et al 2009a measurements of ascaris eggs were taken at five timepoints with a maximum time point of 22 days resulting in a maximum reduction of 0 86 log10 units extrapolation using the best fit model jm2 produced a t99 estimate of 67 2 days however since the maximum timepoint was only 22 days we reported the t99 value to be censored at 44 days summary statistics for t99 were calculated using the cenfit command from the nada package lee 2020 which implements the nonparametric kaplan meier km method this method is considered the standard approach for estimating summary statistics of censored data helsel 2012 the censoring level was assumed to be equal to twice the maximum timepoint from the dataset since the dataset was right censored data values were flipped prior to implementing the km method as described by helsel 2012 the peto prentice version of the generalized wilcoxon test helsel 2012 was used to test for significant differences between t99 values from different microbial groups using the cendiff command from the nada package lee 2020 2 6 influence of design operational and environmental factors pearson s correlation was used to understand the degree to which the decay rate coefficients moved in coordination with the design operational and environmental factors i e pathogen group ph moisture content temperature use of urea or use of desiccating alkalinizing agents analysis of variance anova and multiple linear regression von sperling et al 2020 were used to assess the influence of design operational and environmental factors as independent variables on the log linear decay rate prior to completing these analyses the distributions of decay rate coefficients were checked and log or box cox transformations were applied to make distributions more symmetrical the application of additives for desiccation alkalinization or disinfection were treated as categorical because the concentrations applied were not always reported in studies where urea was added to fecal sludge the concentration when reported was usually at least 0 5 on a wet mass basis 3 results and discussion 3 1 search results of the 479

and 304 data points were extracted from 53 field based experiments of the 243 experiments 32 were performed with viruses 147 with bacteria 8 with protozoa and 56 with helminth eggs in 23 of the 32 experiments with viruses 72 bacteriophages were used ms2 phix174 t4 and salmonella 28b phages animal viruses rotavirus and adenovirus were used in the other nine experiments 28 experiments with bacteria included both indicators and pathogens total coliforms fecal coliforms streptococcus spp e coli enterococcus spp salmonella spp shigella spp and clostridia spp qualifying experiments with protozoa included cryptosporidium giardia and entamoeba ascaris eggs a suum or a lumbricoides were the only type of helminth in qualifying experiments 3 2 experimental design viruses were quantified as plaque forming units pfus in 75 of the experiments and as fluorescent cell forming units fcfus in 25 of the experiments bacteria were quantified as colony forming units cfus in 92 of the experiments and most probable number mpn in 8 of the experiments half of the experiments of protozoa assessed viability using stains e g propidium iodide and the other half only counted total oo cysts using immunofluorescence microscopy the viability of helminth eggs ascaris was assessed in all experiments with 89 based on morphology after incubation e g us epa 2003 or similar and the other 11 based on the use of stains such as safranin o sossou et al 2014 2016b in 144 of the 243 experiments 59 fresh stool feces or the contents of dry desiccation toilets e g with urine diversion were used in the other 99 experiments 41 the matrix included feces and fresh urine and of those 58 also included flushing water e g sampling from pour flush toilets cesspits septic tanks mixing feces and urine with water the three most common locations for experiments were in sweden 40 of 243 experiments burkina faso 39 of 243 experiments and china 21 of 243 experiments other experiments were performed in bolivia brazil burkina faso china great britain ethiopia haiti japan korea malawi mexico scotland sweden switzerland uganda united states and vietnam about half 50 6 of the experiments used fecal sludge with temperatures between 22 c and 34 c in 16 of the experiments the temperature was above 50 c and in 3 of experiments the temperature was below 10 c the interquartile ranges of ph and moisture content were 7 2 to 9 0 and 40 to 90 respectively the ph of the fecal sludge was below 6 in 8 of the experiments and above 9 in 24 of the experiments the moisture content was below 10 in 7 of the experiments and above 90 in 25 of experiments in 87 of 243 experiments alkalinizing or desiccating agents were added to modify the ph or moisture content lime and ash were used in 28 experiments each and organic materials sugarcane husks rice husks shea nut shells etc were added for co composting in 23 experiments urea was applied in 57 experiments of the 243 experiments 96 40 originated from studies with the maximum quality score of 3 0 47 19 originated from studies with quality scores of at least 2 0 66 27 originated from studies with quality scores of at least 1 0 and the other 34 14 originated from studies with quality scores of less than 1 0 the most common reasons for low quality ratings were the lack of recovery controls during sample concentration and not reporting limits of detection except for protozoa there were no major differences between quality ratings of papers with experiments using different microbial groups 63 of virus experiments 53 of bacteria experiments and 83 of helminth experiments received a score of 2 or higher for the 8 experiments with protozoa the scores were all between 1 and 2 mostly due to the lack of process recovery controls and the lack of reporting the method detection limits for additional statistics about the experimental conditions and the quality control scores see tables s1 and s2 3 3 model selection fig 2 shows log10 reductions with respect to time for all experiments reductions were lower for ascaris and protozoa than they were for viruses and bacteria which is consistent with a previous review of pathogen decay in sewage urine manure and surface waters mitchell and akram 2019 the reduction of bacteria was more variable than other microbial groups in most experiments bacteria were reduced by at least 2 log10 within 50 days but the same reduction took longer for viruses protozoa and ascaris eggs most experiments 53 had 4 5 6 or 7 timepoints and 22 of the experiments had more than 7 timepoints in 38 16 of the experiments there were only three timepoints with concentrations above the lod which is too few to fit the jm2 model similarly 23 9 of the experiments had only two timepoints with concentrations above the lod these experiments were not used for model selection but they were used to estimate t99 values using the log linear model the justification was that these experiments had rapid decay rates e g concentrations fell below the lod after the first or second timepoint and not including them would have skewed the results by preferentially eliminating experiments with conditions that promoted rapid pathogen decay in 65 of the 243 experiments 27 microbial reduction never reached 90 these data were not used for model selection in 11 experiments 5 there were fewer than four timepoints and maximum reduction was less than 90 meaning that 115 of 243 experiments 47 either had too few timepoints or the reduction was too low to be used for model selection of the experiments that qualified for model selection the jm2 model had lower aic values than the log linear model for 81 experiments 63 indicating that jm2 generally provided a better fit the r2 values for the log linear model were generally greater than 0 5 fig s3 but data from experiments that displayed characteristic tailing effects e g niwagaba et al 2009 hashemi et al 2019 were better modeled using the jm2 equation fig s1 experiments 292 299 323 325 some experiments with ascaris eggs e g fidjeland et al 2016 mckinley et al 2012 displayed a characteristic shouldering effect which was modeled well using the jm2 equation fig s1 experiments 192 195 262 263 some experiments with bacteria magri et al 2013 nakamura and taylor 1965 niwagaba et al 2009 nordin et al 2009b tønner klank et al 2007 showed erratic patterns of decay and apparent regrowth which could have resulted from true regrowth random sampling or large variabilities associated with recovery isolation quantification and enumeration of microorganisms in fecal sludge for slightly more than half of the 31 qualifying experiments with viruses the jm2 model had lower aic values log linear had lower aic in 15 experiments jm2 had lower aic in 16 experiments the jm2 model was also the best model for 48 of 76 qualifying experiments with bacteria two of three qualifying experiments with protozoa and for 15 of 18 qualifying experiments with ascaris 3 4 decay rate coefficients the estimated k values and standard errors and k 1 and k 2 values and sigma values for all experiments are presented in table s6 table 1 shows summary statistics of the calculated decay rate coefficients for the log linear and jm2 models also see fig s5 protozoan oo cysts had the lowest log linear decay rates with a median k value of 0 0095 days 1 decay rates for ascaris were only slightly higher with a median k value of 0 0042 days 1 the protozoa decay rates are based on an extremely limited set of experiments originating from only three papers graham et al 2003 robertson et al 1992 sossou et al 2014 where viability was only assessed in 3 of 4 experiments using dye stains these experiments were also done with lower moisture levels and higher temperatures than most experiments done with ascaris eggs table s1 the median decay rates for viruses and bacteria were 0 19 days 1 and 0 93 days 1 respectively this is consistent with previous publications that have shown that protozoan cysts and helminth eggs persist longer in the environment than viruses and bacteria since they possess durable cell walls that enhance survival peng et al 2008 ben ayed and sabbahi 2019 it is also consistent with the findings of mitchell and akram 2019 who reported higher t90 and t99 values for viruses than for bacteria in sewage urine manure and surface waters uncertainty in estimated decay rate coefficients was also larger for bacteria and viruses than it was for ascaris and protozoa as evidenced by average standard errors for decay rate coefficients of 0 92 1 04 0 13 and 0 33 for viruses bacteria protozoa and ascaris respectively uncertainty in jm2 model parameters was larger for bacteria and viruses than it was for ascaris and protozoa the average values of σ see supplemental information were 1 12 1 63 0 12 and 0 21 for viruses bacteria protozoa and ascaris respectively the k 1 value controls the amount of shouldering and the general slope of the curve at the beginning of decay with more negative values consistent with flat curves with longer shoulders median k 1 values were generally found to be negative except for bacteria ascaris and protozoa had the most negative k 1 values indicating that shouldering may be more prevalent for the decay of these pathogens in fecal sludge compared to viruses and bacteria the k 2 value controls the tail and the flatness toward the end of the curve with lower values consistent with curves that flatten out earlier and higher values consistent with curves that flatten out later the median k 2 values for bacteria protozoa and ascaris ranged from 3 1 to 3 8 and viruses had the highest median k 2 value of 4 9 the higher k 2 and less negative k 1 value for viruses reflects quicker decay with less tailing compared with ascaris and protozoa 3 5 t99 values there were 74 experiments where t99 values were censored i e microbial reduction never reached 99 and t99 could not be estimated using the best fit model without extrapolating more than twice the maximum timepoint as described in the methods section table 2 shows summary statistics of estimated t99 values for both models independently and using whichever model provided the best fit there was a significant difference between the t99 values for the different microbial groups based on the generalized wilcoxon test χ2 79 8 on 3 degrees of freedom when the best fit models were used p 0 0001 see fig s10 predicted t99 values for viruses were similar for both models with median values of 1 month with the upper 95th percentile equal to 140 days when the best fit models were used there were divergences in the predicted t99 values of bacteria and ascaris eggs depending on which model was used for instance median t99 values for bacteria ranged from slightly less than one week to slightly more than two weeks for the log linear and jm2 models respectively with a median value of just under 5 days when the best fit models were used for ascaris median predicted t99 values ranged from 260 days for the log linear model to 429 days when the best fit models were used due to higher censoring when the jm2 model was used the median t99 value could only be determined to be greater than 67 days the divergence between summary statistics computed based on the different models can be explained by tailing patterns that are represented with the jm2 model but not the log linear model of the eight qualifying experiments with protozoa none achieved more than 99 reduction so all t99 values are based on model extrapolations despite this limitation the median t99 value was still estimated to be greater than 341 days graham et al 2003 reported a 83 and a 67 decrease in the number of giardia cysts in fecal sludge from biodegrading and dehydrating toilets respectively after a storage period of 6 months however the authors did not measure viability the estimated t99 value for cryptosporidium was 221 days or more and the estimated t99 value for entamoeba was 109 days or more depending on which models were used these t99 values are much longer than 86 days and 70 days which is what has been previously reported for cryptosporidium in swine waste jenkins et al 2013 and groundwater sidhu and toze 2012 respectively more research is needed to better understand the persistence of protozoan pathogens in fecal sludge matrices as the findings presented here are based on limited data 3 6 influence of ph temperature moisture urine diversion and additives the distribution of estimated log linear decay rate coefficients k was highly skewed natural logarithm transformations made the distribution more symmetrical fig s4 likewise the distribution of jm2 model coefficient k 2 was skewed and a box cox transformation ln k 2 made the distribution more symmetrical the distribution of k 1 values was already relatively symmetrical but had very long tails 3 6 1 ph the ph of fecal sludge had no significant correlation with ln k pearson s r 0 10 p 0 109 k 1 pearson s r 0 14 p 0 067 or ln k 2 pearson s r 0 023 p 0 76 fig s7a which is consistent with previous studies of pathogen persistence in animal manure himathongkham and riemann 1999 the presence of free ammonia at high ph levels may drive inactivation more than ph alone kohn et al 2017 unless very high ph levels are reached e g 12 ghiglietti et al 1997 1995 reported that ascaris eggs treated with ammonia at ph 11 9 and a temperature of 30 c were inactivated and that thermal treatment at 40 c impeded the eggs development even in the absence of ammonia mehl et al 2011 suggested that a ph of 9 or above will inactivate pathogens including helminth eggs after six months if temperatures are above 40 c 3 6 2 temperature temperature correlated significantly with ln k pearson s r 0 52 p 0 0001 k 1 pearson s r 0 55 p 0 001 and ln k 2 pearson s r 0 42 p 0 001 this is consistent with a review by espinosa et al 2020 which indicated that temperatures above 50 c yielded reductions of 3 log10 or greater within a few hours for many pathogens and within a month for the most resistant pathogens however the correlation was strongly influenced by 35 experiments at extreme temperatures above 50 c or below freezing and fecal sludge in onsite toilets rarely reaches these temperatures data from experiments performed at temperatures above 50 c or below 0 c were removed for subsequent meta analysis after removing these data temperature did not correlate significantly with ln k pearson s r 0 10 p 0 15 or ln k 2 pearson s r 0 13 p 0 1154 but it did correlate significantly with k 1 pearson s r 0 20 p 0 0134 fig s7b this indicates that extreme temperatures can influence pathogen decay in fecal sludge but for systems operating at ambient temperatures the influence may be minimal the limited impact of temperature within the ambient range could also be attributed to the heterogeneous distribution of temperature in fecal sludge preneta et al 2013 tønner klank et al 2007 which can be addressed by mixing e g turning compost piles in summary temperatures needed to achieve rapid pathogen decay i e above 50 c were not achieved in most of the experiments and might be difficult to obtain in a real world setting unless designs are modified such as toilets with solar heated chambers cruz espinosa et al 2012 sossou et al 2016a koottatep et al 2020 3 6 3 moisture interestingly higher moisture correlated significantly with higher ln k values pearson s r 0 28 p 0 001 higher k 1 values pearson s r 0 20 p 0 0059 and higher ln k 2 values pearson s r 0 17 p 0 0195 this was counterintuitive since desiccation should increase pathogen inactivation king and monis 2007 himathongkham and riemann 1999 in general ascaris eggs were subjected to higher moisture conditions than other pathogen groups in the experiments and experiments with ascaris eggs made up nearly one fourth of the data set which could be one explanation for the findings lower moisture should cause more rapid inactivation but there is no consensus in the literature about how dry fecal sludge must be to experience this effect it likely differs for different pathogens ascaris and entamoeba persisted in pit latrines after 7 months storage at a moisture content of 29 gibson 2014 mehl et al 2011 recommended less than 25 moisture for pathogen inactivation in pit latrines however others have noted that ascaris eggs possess a multi layered wall composed of chitin and lipids which makes them tolerant to desiccation thus moisture levels below 5 may be needed for their inactivation nordin 2010 in 199 of the 243 experiments from this review fecal sludge moisture levels were above 25 except for the experiments done by endale et al 2012 where the moisture content got as low as 3 after a month of storage the lowest moisture in any other experiment was 7 8 magri et al 2013 which may not be low enough to induce rapid inactivation as such observed decay rates from this review might be confounded by factors other than moisture more research is needed to better understand the role of moisture on pathogen inactivation in fecal sludge 3 6 4 sanitation technology fecal sludge matrix fig 3 shows log transformed k values for the log linear model from experiments performed with different fecal sludge matrices conventional vs urine diverting toilets the use of urea for disinfection and the use of additives for desiccation or alkalinization e g ash lime soil etc fig s6 shows similar box plots for k 1 and k 2 values obtained from the jm2 model for ascaris eggs and protozoan pathogens ln k values from experiments with matrices consistent with fecal sludge from urine diversion toilets feces only were significantly greater p 0 009 than the ln k values from experiments with fecal sludge consistent with conventional pit toilets excreta i e feces and urine for bacteria and viruses the opposite was true p 0 0001 this suggests that the type of toilet may influence decay rates of different pathogen groups in different ways 3 6 5 urea on average for experiments where urea or stored urine was added as a source of ammonia for disinfection decay rates of ascaris eggs and protozoan pathogens were significantly higher p 0 018 than they were when urea was not added this effect was more pronounced in fecal sludge for urine diverting dry toilets uddts than it was in conventional toilets where fresh urine was mixed with fecal matter perhaps due to ph differences fresh urine has a ph between 6 and 7 while the ph of commercial urea and stored urine is often as high as 9 hoglund 2001 ammonia produced from the hydrolysis of urea in stored urine acts as a disinfectant since it is in the nh3 form instead of the protonated form which happens above ph 9 kohn et al 2017 nh3 can diffuse through microbial cell membranes raising the internal ph and reducing viability nelson and pecson 2005 through protein denaturation and the cleavage of nucleic acids nordin 2010 in urine the viability of protozoa is affected by natural ammonia hoglund 2001 but the effects of ammonia sanitization may be minimal in pit latrines and other onsite toilets because of unfavorable ph conditions and the lack of airtight storage which permits ammonia loss to the atmosphere fidjeland et al 2015 in experiments where urea or stored urine was added to fecal sludge anderson et al 2015 fidjeland et al 2016 nordin et al 2009a 2009b magri et al 2013 mckinley et al 2012 ogunyoku et al 2016 sossou et al 2016b concentrations of non protonated nh3 ranged from 14 mg l nh3 n to above 4000 mg l nh3 n but were above 100 mg l nh3 n in most experiments 70 the concentration of non protonated ammonia nh3 n correlated strongly with the amount of urea applied and the ph of the fecal sludge fig s2 unlike ascaris and protozoa there was no significant difference for viruses and bacteria between experiments done with vs without urea p 0 891 3 6 6 alkalinizing and desiccating additives lime was the only additive that caused significantly higher decay rates compared to the control no additives and compared to all other additives p 0 0001 however this was only true for experiments with viruses and bacteria pairwise comparisons revealed that the application of organic materials resulted in significantly lower decay rates of viruses and bacteria compared to the control group for ascaris eggs and protozoan pathogens there were no significant differences between the different additive groups p 0 707 however significant effects of additives have been reported in individual studies but there may have been confounding factors graham et al 2003 compared giardia and cryptosporidium in the contents of uddts with lime addition vs non flush vault toilets without urine diversion finding more rapid reduction in the uddt with lime however the authors did not assess viability endale et al 2012 studied the decay of ascaris eggs in feces no urine after adding lime soil ash or nothing experiments 128 131 fig s1 reporting that experiments with lime and ash produced similar decay rates that were only slightly faster than the control no additives mckinley et al 2012 found that the application of ash to excreta without fresh urine experiment 193 provided more rapid inactivation of ascaris eggs relative to the control experiment 191 but the use of ash for excreta mixed with fresh urine experiment 194 had much more rapid decay and decay was even faster when excreta was mixed with stored urine experiment 195 ogunyoku et al 2016 reported more rapid inactivation of ascaris eggs when lime and urea were added compared to a lower decay rate in feces with lime but without urea experiments 179 181 the latter group had similar decay compared to the control feces plus urea but without lime nordin et al 2009a reported a reduction of 1 log10 after 35 days of storage with ash experiment 187 with much faster reduction when urea was also added at a concentration of 1 by weight experiment 189 this indicates that the effect on ascaris eggs may be derived more from the disinfection properties of nh3 rather than the addition of just ash or lime the addition of 20 quicklime dry mass basis can raise the ph of sludge from ph 6 5 to ph 12 north et al 2008 as mentioned above ph alone did not correlate with decay rates and the use of ash did not have as much of an impact as lime on the decay of bacteria and viruses endale et al 2012 reported that ash treatment of fecal sludge in an eco sanitation system took one month to achieve the same reduction of fecal coliforms as lime treatment achieved in one day like lime ash can also increase the ph of fecal sludge but larger doses are required for example monney and awuah 2016 found that the addition of 180 g of wood ash per liter of sludge produced ph levels of 11 but only 21 3 g of lime per liter of sludge increased the ph to above 12 endale et al 2012 and mckinley et al 2012 raised the ph of fecal sludge to 9 with ash but when they used lime the ph reached 11 or 12 in summary ash does not appear to have the same level of disinfection efficacy as lime for the treatment of fecal sludge also there is not enough evidence to suggest that the decay of ascaris eggs in fecal sludge is significantly increased by only adding lime e g without also adding urea 3 7 multiple linear regression table 3 shows the coefficients standard errors and significance levels for the regression that predicts ln k using the independent variables microbial group temperature moisture ph addition of urea or stored urine use of uddts and use of additives for desiccation or alkalinization the intercept includes bacterial decay in fecal sludge with a ph of 8 a temperature of 20 c a moisture content of 60 without urine diversion and with no urea or other additives added which are typical conditions for a pit latrine bakare et al 2012 nabateesa et al 2017 zuma et al 2015 the model was significant with a residual standard error of 1 669 an f statistic of 23 52 on 15 and 177 degrees of freedom p 0 0001 standardized residuals were randomly distributed with limited deviations from normality fig s8 the r2 value was 0 6659 adjusted r2 0 6376 so the model accounted for two thirds of the variability in decay rates the coefficients for ph and temperature were positive and significant indicating that higher ph and higher temperatures caused more rapid pathogen decay the coefficient for uddt was positive and significant indicating the benefits of urine diversion on decay rates the coefficient for urea addition was positive but not significant this suggests that the use of urea alone may not significantly improve pathogen decay in onsite toilets perhaps unless ph is also increased all additives except for lime and organics had non significant coefficients implying a limited effect on pathogen decay lime had a significant positive coefficient implying that it increased decay rates organic materials for co composting such as sugarcane husks berendes et al 2015 rice husks hashemi et al 2019 or shea nut shells sossou et al 2014 had a significant negative coefficient p 0 003 indicating a potential protective effect on pathogen survival there have been mixed results about the impact of composting processes on pathogen reduction for instance bustamante et al 2008 reported that bacterial indicators and pathogens e g e coli salmonella were not completely eliminated during the co composting of winery and distillery wastes and that the regrowth of bacterial pathogens was influenced by humidity nutrient availability and the presence of competitive microbiota manga et al 2016 found that the use of chicken feathers for co composting fecal sludge instead of organic market waste significantly impacted temperatures which sped up the decay of helminth eggs the estimated intercept was 1 974 which equates to a k value of 0 139 days 1 this produces a t99 value of 33 days implying that on average approximately one month is required for a 2 log10 reduction of bacterial pathogens under the conditions typical of a pit latrine ph 8 20 c 60 moisture no additives the regression coefficients for viruses protozoa and ascaris eggs were negative and significant implying that these pathogen groups decay at slower rates relative to bacteria for viruses under the conditions typical of a pit latrine the estimated k value of 0 056 days 1 produced a t99 of 82 days for protozoan oo cysts and ascaris eggs the estimated k values under the same conditions typical of a pit latrine lead to predicted t99 values of more than a year the regression also indicates that pathogens in fecal sludge at 20 c survive 1 8 times longer on average than they do at 30 c which supports a recommendation that storage times should be twice as long in colder climates 3 8 policy implications the findings from this study have broader policy implications for more than 3 billion people worldwide who use onsite sanitation systems who unicef 2020 recommendations for the storage and treatment of fecal sludge have been made but with limited supporting evidence the who 2006 recommended storage times of 6 months with ph of 9 or more temperature above 35 c and moisture below 25 p 69 without alkaline treatment they recommended storage of at least 1 year for temperatures of 20 35 c and 1 5 2 years for temperatures of 2 20 c stating that higher temperatures provide more or less complete inactivation of ascaris eggs within 1 year and substantial to total inactivation of viruses bacteria and protozoa and that at the lower temperatures viruses and parasitic protozoa would be reduced below risk levels but that some soil borne ova may persist in low numbers after 1 5 2 years who 2006 these recommendations were based on the works of austin 2001 carlander and westrell 1999 chien et al 2001 lan et al 2001 moe and izurieta 2004 peasey 2000 phi et al 2004 strauss 1985 and wang 1999 which are all either technical reports conference proceedings or conference abstracts except for chien et al 2001 all other cited works were either not accessible or did not meet the inclusion criteria for this systematic review and meta analysis stenström et al 2011 made slightly different recommendations for the storage of fecal sludge from uddts when wood ash or lime was added claiming that 6 12 months of storage would provide reductions of up to 4 log units for viruses 6 logs for bacteria and a total reduction of viable protozoa and helminths tilley et al 2014 and the who 2018 repeated these recommendations for alkaline treatment of fecal sludge from uddts suggesting a minimum storage time of 6 months if ash or lime are used more recently the who 2022 stated that more than 2 log10 reduction of pathogens except for ascaris eggs is achieved after the fecal sludge from dry toilets with twin pits fossa alterna is stored for at least 2 years for flush toilets with alternating pits they suggested a similar reduction would be achieved after at least 1 year storage at 20 c or storage of at least 6 months if ph is adjusted to 9 e g with lime or ash who 2022 for regions where helminth infections are prevalent they recommended 1 5 2 years of storage at 2 20 c who 2022 but did not cite any other new sources besides who 2006 stenström et al 2011 and tilley et al 2014 results from our meta analysis provide a more expansive evidence base for recommendations about fecal sludge storage times our findings indicate that the use of lime and ash alone may not effectively inactivate ascaris eggs unless urea is also added without urea storage times for alkalinized fecal sludge from uddts should be longer than 6 months due to risks presented not only from ascaris eggs but potentially also from protozoan pathogens although more research is needed on protozoan pathogen viability under these conditions also the storage of non alkalinized fecal sludge for 1 year at temperatures of 20 35 c does not provide more or less complete inactivation of ascaris eggs as originally suggested by who 2006 for all experiments with ascaris eggs from this meta analysis where lime ash or urea were not added to the fecal sludge and where the ph was less than 9 the maximum reductions were all less than or equal to 1 5 log10 3 9 limitations there are several limitations to the findings from this study first only english language publications in three databases pubmed web of science and scopus were consulted second the data used originated from articles that used different methods and potentially different levels of quality control we qualitatively assigned a score to each paper based on the description of the methods used and the use of process controls but all data were still used in the meta analysis nevertheless the potential bias created by experiments using different quality control methods was likely minimal except for the experiments done with protozoa since none of these experiments used process recovery controls and viability was not assessed in some of the experiments a third limitation is that the data for helminth eggs was entirely based on experiments done with ascaris and may not be representative of other helminths also there were only eight experiments from three qualifying publications for protozoan pathogens only four of these experiments qualified for the calculation of decay rates and in one of them graham et al 2003 oocyst viability was not assessed which could have led to underestimated decay rates and overestimated t99 values for the regression there were some scenarios for which very few experiments were performed for example there were 25 experiments where lime was added to fecal sludge 19 of them measured concentrations of bacteria but only two measured viruses there were no experiments with viruses or protozoa where urea was added to the fecal sludge and the ph was greater than 9 all data produced under those experimental conditions were for ascaris salmonella or fecal indicator bacteria another limitation of the findings from the regression analysis is that with all the factors involved in the model the coefficients may not always reflect the true impact of the factor on pathogen decay dropping some factors could change the magnitude of coefficients for other factors another limitation is that most experiments were lab based a comparison of the results from field based and lab based studies for ascaris eggs found slower decay and higher t99 values in the field based studies which may reflect differences between design user habits or other potential socioeconomic differences in field systems compared to controlled laboratory studies more field based research is needed to confirm trends that have been reported in laboratory settings 4 conclusions we used systematic review and meta analysis to draw insights about pathogen survival in fecal sludge from onsite toilets with respect to design operational and environmental factors the jm2 model provided a better fit to experimental data than the log linear chick model for all pathogen groups the rate of pathogen decay in fecal sludge was significantly different for different pathogen types bacteria died off the fastest followed by viruses then protozoa and helminths the overall median t99 values were 4 8 days 29 days 341 days and 429 days for bacteria viruses protozoan oo cysts and ascaris eggs respectively using the best fit models microbial group ph temperature moisture toilet design e g urine diversion and the use of additives explained two thirds of the variability in decay rate coefficients as expected higher ph values higher temperatures and the application of lime all significantly predicted greater decay rates however lime was more effective for bacteria and viruses than it was for ascaris eggs and protozoan pathogens fecal sludge stored for six months without treatment adequately controls hazards from viruses and bacteria but much longer storage times or alkaline treatment with urea and low moisture or heat is needed to control hazards from protozoan oo cysts and

19913,antibiotic resistance is a major 21st century one health humans animals environment challenge whose spread limits options to treat bacterial infections there is growing interest in monitoring water environments including surface water and wastewater which have been identified as key recipients pathways and sources of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb aquatic environments also facilitate the transmission and amplification of arb enterococcus spp often carry clinically important antibiotic resistance genes and are of interest as environmental monitoring targets enterococcus spp are gram positive bacteria that are typically of fecal origin however they are also found in relevant environmental niches with various species and strains that are opportunistic human pathogens although the value of environmental monitoring of antibiotic resistant enterococcus has been recognized by both national and international organizations lack of procedural standardization has hindered generation of comparable data needed to implement integrated surveillance programs here we provide a comprehensive methodological review to assess the techniques used for the culturing and characterization of antibiotic resistant enterococcus across water matrices for the purpose of environmental monitoring we analyzed 117 peer reviewed articles from 33 countries across six continents the goal of this review is to provide a critical analysis of i the various methods applied globally for isolation confirmation and speciation of enterococcus isolates ii the different methods for profiling antibiotic resistance among enterococci and iii the current prevalence of resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics among enterococcus spp isolated from various environments finally we provide advice regarding a path forward for standardizing culturing of enterococcus spp for the purpose of antibiotic resistance monitoring in wastewater and wastewater influenced waters within a global surveillance framework graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance enterococcus culturing susceptibility testing genotyping standardization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction enterococcus spp are important members of the natural enteric microbiome of both humans and animals and have emerged as important antibiotic resistant pathogens in clinical medicine arias and murray 2012 there are currently 60 classified enterococcus species in the national center for biotechnology information database most of which are commensal microorganisms although some act as opportunistic pathogens in humans e faecalis and e faecium are among the most important etiological agents of nosocomial infections including urinary tract infections utis central nervous system infections endocarditis bacteremia neonatal infections and surgical site infections moellering 1992 murray 1990 from 2006 to 2017 enterococcus spp were responsible for approximately 14 of all healthcare associated infections in the us ranking second overall behind staphylococcus aureus hidron et al 2008 sievert et al 2013 weiner lastinger et al 2020 weiner et al 2016 enterococcus spp possess full or partial intrinsic chromosomal resistance to cephalosporins aminoglycosides lincosamides trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and penicillins hollenbeck and rice 2012 their rapid development of multi drug resistance has been attributed in part to their highly malleable genomes that lack crispr clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats elements which has facilitated the ready acquisition of allochthonous mobile dna e g vancomycin resistance gene clusters palmer and gilmore 2010 nearly 25 of the genomes of many clinical e faecalis and e faecium isolates consist of acquired genetic elements hegstad et al 2010 paulsen et al 2003 recently over 85 of e faecium and 15 of e faecalis isolates responsible for catheter associated utis and central line associated bloodstream infections diagnosed in the us have been found to be vancomycin resistant weiner lastinger et al 2020 the us center for disease control and prevention cdc and the world health organization who have set vre to high priority and a serious threat level centers for disease control and prevention 2019 tacconelli et al 2018 enterococcus spp are members of the larger phenotypically defined group known as enterococci which are gram positive catalase negative obligately fermentative chemoorganotrophs that can survive over a wide range of temperatures ph and salinity teixeira et al 2015 enterococci are found in many extraenteric environmental niches including soils and sediments beach sands and aquatic and terrestrial vegetation enterococci have been extensively isolated from wastewaters marine waters and freshwaters byappanahalli et al 2012 because of their abundance in human and animal feces their extraenteric persistence and the ease with which they are cultured enterococci have been targeted for decades as fecal indicators for the purpose of water quality monitoring jang et al 2017 schoen et al 2011 sinclair et al 2012 enterococci formerly classified within the larger group known as fecal streptococci have been widely used to assess the microbiological safety of surface waters drinking waters recreational beaches and as a target for assessing process removal efficiencies during wastewater treatment enterococci have also been found to correlate directly to public health outcomes for example across the us the rate of gastrointestinal illness in swimmers has been correlated with enterococcus spp levels in recreational beach waters that are impacted by wastewaters prüss 1998 wade et al 2006 2003 however these illnesses are assumed to be caused mainly by viral pathogens soller et al 2010 rather than enterococcus spp their importance as water quality indicators and their inclusion in governmental regulatory frameworks have led to a great deal of method development for isolation and enumeration from environmental samples boehm and sassoubre 2014 health canada 2020 global and national action plans set in place to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance have generally embraced a one health approach humans animals environment european commission 2017 hernando amado et al 2019 but a better understanding of the role of environmental transmission and amplification of antibiotic resistant enterococcus and their genes to humans animals and aquatic environments is needed aquatic environments have been identified as a key recipient and transmission pathway of antibiotic resistant bacteria into and out of human and animal populations amarasiri et al 2020 larsson and flach 2021 multidrug resistant pathogens and mobile antibiotic resistance genes enter the environment via treated and untreated wastewater across the globe alexander et al 2020 marathe et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 recently the who put forth the tricycle protocol as a standardized method for monitoring the dissemination transmission and evolution of antibiotic resistance along the one health continuum humans hospitals and community the food chain animal husbandry and the environment human and animal fecal contamination who 2021 specifically the protocol targets gram negative extended spectrum beta lactamase esbl producing escherichia coli which display phenotypic resistance to third generation cephalosporins while esbl e coli was selected in part to coordinate with global surveillance of enterobacterales marano et al 2020 the extent to which it is truly a representative indicator of resistome dynamics has not been established thus the present is a critical moment to also consider other potential targets antibiotic resistant enterococci present many advantages as a potential target for monitoring antibiotic resistance in the water environment the level of standardization for methods targeting enterococcus spp is arguably second only to e coli in environmental waters as such enterococcus spp could present an attractive complimentary target to e coli notably as gram positive organisms they provide insight into distinct genotypes and phenotypes of antibiotic resistance that would not be captured by monitoring only gram negative organisms in particular the plasticity of enterococcus genomes and their propensity for horizontal gene transfer and exchange of virulence and antibiotic resistance determinants from clinical strains to environmental reservoirs of enterococci ekwanzala et al 2020b gouliouris et al 2019 2018 marks them as potentially comprehensive targets for antibiotic resistance monitoring like e coli they are members of the normal flora of human and animal gastrointestinal tracts byappanahalli et al 2012 and are readily quantified in wastewater and environmental waters their status as normal human flora creates the disadvantage of extreme difficulty in tracking infection rates from human exposure to contaminated water another characteristic they share with e coli a study of individuals engaging in surfing found that surfers were significantly more likely to be colonized with e coli carrying bla ctx m compared to non surfers leonard et al 2018 analogous studies of antibiotic resistant enterococcus spp could shed light on aspects of direct transfer of these bacteria from aquatic environments to humans recent progress has been made in applying culture based methods for monitoring antibiotic resistant enterococcus spp in the environment with emphasis on human and animal wastewater and hospital wastewater pollution gouliouris et al 2019 savin et al 2020 zaheer et al 2020 the phenotypic and morphological similarity of other gram positive organisms to the enterococci however makes isolation on selective media prone to false positives with cross selectivity with other cocci e g streptococcus pediococcus weisella harwood et al 2001 false positives are especially problematic for environmental samples pagel and hardy 1980 non selectivity can actually be exacerbated with addition of antibiotics to media because several members of non target bacillus and other genera are intrinsically resistant to clinically relevant concentrations of certain antibiotics woodford et al 1995 the selection of any monitoring target or strategy entails consideration of the overarching purpose or questions to be addressed and these may vary depending on the focus across the spectrum from wastewater to surface water the following are examples of key monitoring goals and considerations addressed by this review monitoring antibiotic resistance among clinically relevant strains of enterococcus spp in sewage as a means of assessing their levels carried in the human population assessing whether clinically relevant enterococcus spp or specific resistance phenotypes are effectively removed during wastewater treatment and if they persist in impacted aquatic environments evaluating evidence that clinically relevant enterococcus spp acquire antibiotic resistance genes from the environment comparing resistant enterococcus spp in various water matrices both locally and globally to assess factors that may be contributing to antibiotic resistance in gram positive organisms 2 literature review protocol this systematic review was conducted in a four tiered approach using search terms presented in table s1 to collect studies published between january 2000 and december 2020 figure s1 web of science pubmed and google scholar were searched briefly tier 1 was designed to isolate topic relevant search terms for surface water wastewater recycled water or reclaimed water 3 828 792 articles tier 2 was designed to select for those articles addressing antibiotic resistance 15 043 tier 3 further narrowed the search to culturing techniques 5 439 and tier 4 specifically to enterococci enterococcus 682 initially these 682 articles were independently screened by two researchers for containing a complete workflow from environmental sampling through to characterization of individual isolates articles were excluded that only used previously collected isolates further exclusions were articles that exclusively investigated biofilms mesocosms drinking water sediments or digested sludge e g anaerobic digestion fecal source tracking articles based on antibiotic resistance analysis were also excluded harwood et al 2000 articles that used a non selective media for initial isolation such as r2a or tsa were also excluded disagreements on article inclusion from the initial screening were presented to a larger group of five researchers to reach a consensus the resulting 117 peer reviewed articles were then subject to data extraction using parameters outlined in table s2 all included articles are listed in table s4 3 collection and analysis of published data data relevant to the species and phenotypic distribution of all isolated enterococci was collected from 117 peer reviewed articles first the number of isolates per species was extracted from articles in which libraries were speciated 91 articles to reveal general population statistics across environments second antibiotic susceptibility testing ast data were extracted from all articles that provided the percent of resistant isolates compared to total enterococci isolated in the absence of any antibiotic 77 articles studies that summed isolates with intermediate or resistant classifications of resistance without providing individual statistics as well as studies that did not cite standardized methodology for classifying resistance e g current clsi breakpoints at the time of sampling were excluded 4 methods for culturing environmental enterococci in the us and canada enterococci are recommended for monitoring saline brackish or marine and recreational freshwaters in the eu enterococci are regulated in both drinking water and recreational water by standardized culture methods eea 2020 several standardized culture methods have been developed including the us environmental protection agency usepa methods 1106 1 and 1600 for ambient waters and wastewaters usepa 2009 2006 the international organization for standardization iso methods 7899 1 and 7899 2 iso 2000 and method 9230 a d as part of the american public health association s apha standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 1999 rice and baird 2017 table 1 these methods include three distinct techniques membrane filtration mf multiple tube fermentation mtf and defined substrate techniques e g enterolert the current gold standard for enterococci enumeration from the environment is considered the mf technique byappanahalli et al 2012 and was used by over 90 of articles included in this review table 1 the principal selective and differential solid media used in standard mf assays are slanetz bartley sb menterococcus me and membrane enterococcus indoxyl β d glucoside mei these media use various peptone and yeast extract based nutrients with the addition of sodium azide and or nalidixic acid sodium azide obstructs the growth of gram negative bacteria through the inhibition of cytochrome oxidase both sb and me agars include 2 3 5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride ttc which dyes viable colonies red differentiated colonies grown on sb or me are then confirmed as enterococci by their ability to hydrolyze esculin in the presence of bile using either bile esculin azide or esculin iron agars the hydrolyzed esculin product esculetin reacts with iron salt in the media to produce black to reddish colonies for enumeration mei is similar to me medium but contains the chromogen indoxyl β d glucoside when cleaved by β d glucosidase positive enterococci blue halos are formed around positive colonies mei is typically used as a standalone media as all colonies with blue halos are considered enterococci 4 1 performance of standard enterococci culture assays several comparative studies have been conducted over recent decades to assess selectivity of culture media for enterococcus table 2 pagel et al 1980 used pure cultures to assess pse pfizer kf streptococcus me and sb agars against over 100 pure cultures of clinical and environmental isolates of various cocci the highest selectivity for enterococci was observed for pse 94 and me 94 agars with the lowest being kf streptococcus 80 and sb 78 pagel and hardy 1980 compared to me however pse was found to yield lower recovery efficiencies from wastewaters with much higher rates of background colony growth other comparative studies found enterococci selectivity on pse and kf streptococcus agars as low as 86 and 54 respectively brodsky and schiemann 1976 the original me agar formulation study found a false positive rate of 10 and false negative rate of 11 2 for surface water isolates levin et al 1975 subsequent studies have confirmed false positive rates for me agar as low as 2 5 when testing pure enterococcus cultures dionisio and borrego 1995 and 1 7 in marine riverine and treated wastewater effluent adcock and saint 2001 the inclusion of the indoxyl β d glucoside chromogen to me agars resulted in an increase in specificity of enterococcus to upwards of 99 7 in ambient freshwaters adcock and saint 2001 in a recent benchmarking study iso method 7899 2 sb media was found to have false positive rates as high as 18 and false negative rates as high as 57 1 depending on the colony count on the filter membrane of recreational marine water tiwari et al 2018 differences in enterococcus selectivity have also been documented between mf and defined substrate techniques where e faecalis is differentially selected for in wastewater using enterolert leading to the conclusion that these methods should not be used interchangeably for regulatory purposes ferguson et al 2013 2010 kinzelman et al 2003 maheux et al 2009 significant media dependent differences in enterococcus concentrations have also been reported for instance several studies were conducted in the wake of the advent of enterolert assays in the mid 1990s to compare its efficacy against established mf techniques for water quality monitoring fricker and fricker 1996 significant differences in concentrations were reported between enterolert and sb agar in marine and recreational freshwaters valente et al 2010 while no significant differences were found between me agar and enterolert concentrations across surface water wastewater or marine waters abbott et al 1998 budnick et al 1996 eckner 1998 fricker and fricker 1996 no significant differences in enterococci concentrations were identified between me and mei agar adcock and saint 2001 importantly no studies were identified that directly compared the specificities and concentrations derived from sb and me or mei across water matrices such a comparison should be considered in future studies that assess their utility for regulatory frameworks for antibiotic resistance monitoring internationally any biases in species distributions and total enterococci concentrations originating from the selective media could skew downstream distributions in resistance frequencies and introduce bias if the data are used for risk assessment 5 workflows for antibiotic resistant enterococcus monitoring a useful method for culturing and enumerating both generic and antibiotic resistant environmental enterococcus would strike a balance between sensitivity i e detect all enterococcus spp that are present specificity i e avoid detecting other genera and the high throughput needed for large scale environmental monitoring aquatic matrices display a large and dynamic range of enterococci concentrations and a method for their enumeration would also need an appropriately low limit of detection for cleaner samples and a sufficiently high limit of quantification for matrices like wastewater where enterococci are concentrated specific logistical considerations are also warranted such as the ability to perform the assay in low tech laboratories using materials techniques and media that are economically feasible for amr monitoring in low and middle income countries in this instance standard methods that have been developed for enumerating generic enterococci can be leveraged for their extensive vetting with respect to quality assurance quality control and adapted to the increased throughput needs of amr monitoring projects culture based approaches for investigating antibiotic resistance amongst environmental enterococcus must be modified based on the aquatic matrix being investigated and the purpose of the assessment here we delineate these approaches into three general categories population level surveys targeted monitoring for specific antibiotic resistant phenotypes and recovery of low concentration or viable but non culturable vbnc populations figure 1 each with their own benefits and limitations for population level monitoring 73 articles figure 1a where the objective is to achieve an unbiased snapshot of the distribution of resistance phenotypes a collection of isolates can be generated using an enterococcus selective method e g table 1 after colonies have been counted isolates with the specified morphologies can then be selected randomly off plates for phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility testing generating an antibiotic resistance profile as a function of the total number of isolates subsampled the disadvantage of this approach is that most colonies screened may not be antibiotic resistant and finding colonies with the resistant phenotypes of interest and to achieve required statistical power can be akin to searching for a needle in a haystack the advantage to this approach is that it provides a denominator for total enterococcus in the sample and an unbiased distribution of both enterococcal species and their genotypes and phenotypes resulting in an ecologically relevant analysis cho et al 2019 if the phenotype of interest is already known e g high level vre targeted monitoring approaches may be more efficient for in depth characterizations of sub populations of enterococcus such approaches use an antibiotic at clinically relevant breakpoints to select for specific resistance phenotypes figure 1b the use of low intermediate breakpoints of antibiotics may be useful for capturing a broad range of phenotypes in the environment but will frequently capture clinically irrelevant organisms especially in the case of glycopeptide resistance figure 1c the sample can also be plated in tandem on the selective media without the antibiotic figure 1d thus allowing the quantification of the resistant population as a fraction of the total enterococci measured in cfu unit volume a universally comparable monitoring value e g see who tricycle program recommendations who 2021 studies utilizing targeted approaches often screen the identified resistant colonies against a panel of antibiotics which can include the original selective antibiotic to confirm clinically relevant levels of resistance this approach requires the choice of initial selective antibiotic and therefore will exclude strains that are not resistant to the primary selective antibiotic using a selective antibiotic will also skew the distribution of enterococcus spp away from the true distribution often selecting for closely related genera that share the same resistance phenotype such as lactobacillus leuconostoc weissella and pediococcus in the case of high levels of glycopeptide resistance harwood et al 2001 nishiyama et al 2017 2015 in some scenarios the recovery of very dilute phenotypes rare targets or stressed cells is desirable for instance in advanced treated wastewater intended for reuse or other disinfected waters pre enrichment of samples in concentrated selective broth e g enterococcosel or azide dextrose broth amended with the selected antibiotic at low intermediate concentrations can greatly increase the detection limit of rare phenotypes by helping to recover vbnc colonies blanch et al 2003 vilanova and blanch 2006 these recovered resistant colonies can then be streaked on high levels of the antibiotic to recover clinically relevant phenotypes of interest however any protocol employing a target enrichment step will preclude the ability to quantify the resistant enterococcus population or normalize to the total population a necessity for universally comparable datatypes figure 1e after the collection of isolates is generated purification of isolates can be performed on the isolation medium or on other selective differential media such as bile esculin azide bea or esculin iron agar eia ideally all isolates should be confirmed to genus by a method such as qpcr for the 23s rrna gene us environmental protection agency 2012 it is crucial that at least a sub set be confirmed to understand the false positive rate of the isolation method and so that false positive isolates can be removed from the dataset kirby bauer disc diffusion testing can be used to confirm the level of resistance to the primary isolation antibiotic and multi drug resistance further isolate characterization may be desirable including speciation and genotyping for args and virulence factors whole genome sequencing wgs is recommended when resources allow as it is the most accurate and comprehensive method for speciation and genotyping and enables global isolate comparisons a comprehensive evaluation of the suite of methods used for isolate characterization is presented in the following sections 5 1 antibiotic susceptibility testing methods several techniques and automated platforms exist for generalized antibiotic susceptibility testing ast or the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations mics of isolate libraries including kirby bauer disk diffusion assays 47 of articles various commercial automated systems 24 manual broth or agar dilutions 20 or strip test methods 9 figure 2 a over 90 of antimicrobial sensitivity tests ast were performed on either mueller hinton agar or in mueller hinton broth concentrations of antibiotics chosen for ast were predominantly determined by referencing the clinical and research standards institute clsi 70 breakpoints for enterococcus according to the most currently available guidelines other standardized breakpoint concentrations were specific to a particular nation or governmental body e g including the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing eucast 7 the national antimicrobial resistance monitoring system narms usa 2 and the canadian integrated program for antimicrobial resistance surveillance cipars 1 approximately 15 of studies utilizing ast that also differentiated degrees of resistance i e susceptible intermediate or resistant did not cite a justification for antibiotic concentrations nor a standardized method for determining the level of resistance observed the panel of antibiotics used to screen isolates varied across studies but overarching trends were apparent vre was mentioned in the title of 35 of articles identified and vancomycin was included in the screening panel in over 75 of the articles figure 2b the number of observed phenotypes among clinical and environmental isolates of enterococcus are wide ranging which warrants a diverse range of antibiotics included in the panels the antibiotics tested were further categorized into twelve distinct classes by activity the most prominent classes across all studies were glycopeptides 76 macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls 72 tetracyclines 72 beta lactams especially penicillins 70 and aminoglycosides 64 interestingly antibiotics that are either approved by the fda to treat vre infections or are commonly used to treat vre arias and murray 2012 were less commonly included in panels these compounds include linezolid 27 quinupristin dalfopristin 21 daptomycin 8 and the synthetic glycopeptide teicoplanin 28 high level aminoglycoside resistance e g gentamicin streptomycin and kanamycin in enterococci isolated from the environment was the focus of small subset of studies 5 2 multidrug resistance profiling because enterococci are intrinsically resistant to several antibiotics including cephalosporins penicillins clindamycin and aminoglycosides resistant phenotypes are commonly found in environmental samples plasmid and transposon mediated resistance to tetracyclines erythromycin chloramphenicol trimethoprim vancomycin and clindamycin however have further allowed the genus to become a leading cause of multidrug resistant nosocomial infections particularly in the us murray 1998 modern nosocomial e faecium isolates for example are commonly resistant to ampicillin vancomycin and high levels of aminoglycosides miller et al 2014 recently the emergence of multidrug resistant vre to newer last resort antibiotics including oxazolidinone linezolid daptomycin quinupristin dalfopristin and tigecycline have caused frequent treatment failures and are of global concern ahmed and baptiste 2018 thus screening for multidrug resistance amongst isolated environmental enterococci is essential for monitoring the evolution of the genus over time specifically as a function of anthropogenic pollution as well as assessing the relative hazard posed by the isolate the choice of antibiotics to include in screening panels is crucial as most are not useful from a risk based monitoring framework although some may highlight ecological relevance for instance screening for phenotypes that are intrinsic to the genus may not have clinical relevance but may be useful in determining the distribution of endemic phenotypes to contextualize the relative frequency of vre detection 5 3 biochemical and molecular confirmation and speciation because the virulence and resistance characteristics across different enterococcus spp vary substantially speciation of resistant enterococcus isolates is desirable a suite of biochemical tests has been developed by clinical microbiologists to confirm enterococcus to the genus level these tests include gram staining catalase testing thermal growth range thermotolerance growth at 10 and 45 c halotolerance 6 5 nacl growth at ph 9 7 pyrrolidonylarylamidase activity and the ability to hydrolyze esculin in the presence of bile salts e g growth on bile esculin agar facklam and collins 1989 teixeira et al 2015 these tests were common features of nearly three quarters of articles and served as a prerequisite for inclusion in downstream characterization including further speciation figure s2 studies that did not confirm isolates to the genus level either relied on chromogenic agar e g mei chromagar vre to select presumptive enterococci or speciated their library without screening for characteristic metabolisms or morphologies genus specific primers based on the 16s rrna gene deasy et al 2000 23s rrna gene epa method 1611 epa 2012 or the elongation factor ef tu tuf ke et al 1999 gene have also been used for rapid identification of the genus enterococcus however 16s rrna primer sets are known to fail to capture all enterococcus spp botina and sukhodolets 2006 while epa method 1611 has proven to be very reliable in our experience speciation of enterococci libraries was common and performed in 91 117 articles the most common approach of which was pcr there are several conserved proteins and corresponding genes that are targeted in these assays the simultaneous detection of enterococcal species and glycopeptide resistance was the first molecular approach to improve diagnostic speeds for clinical enterococci and was based on the detection of genes encoding d alanine d alanine ddl ligases and other glycopeptide resistance determinants a reduced affinity for glycopeptides in vana and vanb type resistance in enterococci are due to the integration of d alanyl d lacate into peptidoglycan precursors by the chromosomally encoded ddl ligases dutka malen et al 1995a the ddl enzymes in e faecium ddle faecium and e faecalis ddle faecalis are conserved and in resistant strains these enzymes are present in addition to vana or vanb similarly conserved ligases vanc1 and vanc2 3 are highly specific for e gallinarum dutka malen et al 1992 and e casseliflavus navarro and courvalin 1994 respectively the primers published by dutka malen et al 1995 for ddle faecium ddle faecalis vanc1e gallinarum and vanc2 3e casseliflavus have been the most widely used for the speciation of environmental enterococci as many researchers are specifically concerned with the identification of these four most common and clinically relevant species table s3 kariyama et al 2000 and depardieu et al 2004 provided additional multiplex pcr assays for more high throughput approaches to vre surveillance a multiplex pcr assay based on species specific superoxide dismutase soda genes developed by jackson et al 2004 includes primers for 23 different enterococcal species jackson et al 2004 the pcr primers described above were in part developed due to a lack of consensus between commercially available systems and kits such as the analytical profile index api biomérieux pheneplate phplate microplate techniques ab phoenix microbiology systems bd phoenix vitek biomérieux micronaut strep2 merlin microscan walk away beckman coulter and bbl crystal mg scientific manual or automated rapid identification systems the principles behind these higher throughput systems are derived from conventional biochemical phenotyping of enterococci which involve differentiating carbohydrate fermentation of mannitol sorbitol sorbose inulin arabinose melibiose sucrose raffinose trehalose lactose glycerol salicin and maltose among others facklam and collins 1989 teixeira et al 2015 the commercial methods employ a panel of biochemical tests in parallel to reduce the labor costs of manual phenotyping however if atypical species are present these systems will struggle to identify the organism with acceptable levels of certainty castillo rojas et al 2013 this issue is especially problematic in matrices outside of the clinical setting as these systems were developed and validated targeting common clinical strains and reference cultures with distinguishable biochemical characteristics and not the wide phenotypic diversity of environmental samples a comprehensive survey of these systems has been reviewed previously emery et al 2016 an emerging technology for the rapid identification of microorganisms is matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry maldi tof ms singhal et al 2015 this method uses lasers to generate singly protonated ions from analytes in the sample in the process of identifying unknown microbes these analytes are primarily housekeeping and ribosomal proteins given that they constitute a large portion of the dry weight of microbial cells the ionized proteins are then separated by their mass to charge ratio and depending on their time of flight through a channel a peptide mass fingerprint is generated that can be compared to openly sourced databases maldi tof ms for the purpose of enterococci speciation emerged in the literature in 2017 as this is an emerging technique in environmental studies maldi tof ms systems are considerably more expensive than most molecular or phenotypic methods but the throughput is generally larger thousands of isolates and can better accommodate the demand in clinical laboratories 16s rrna gene sequencing was less frequently used than other methods due its non specificity other genes may be sequenced including the soda rpoa and phes genes which have shown to be more discriminatory than the 16s rrna gene for closely related species such as e casseliflavus and e flavescens naser et al 2005 poyart et al 2000 in a recent comparative study of various loci to differentiate closely related enterococcus spp it was determined that the alpha subunits of atp synthase atpa chaperonins groesl and phenylalnyl trna synthase alpha subunits phes performed equally well or better than 16s rrna gene sequencing against 308 enterococci isolates from untreated urban wastewater sanderson et al 2019 the rate of false identification of consensus reference strains based on loci sequencing was approximately 2 much lower than the parallelized carbohydrate phenotyping systems discussed above such as rapid str which had error rates of 15 9 for e faecalis 21 5 for e faecium and 56 9 for e casseliflavus gallinarum the gold standard for speciating enterococci and any organism for that matter is wgs sanderson et al 2019 5 4 genotyping resistant enterococci numerous genetic determinants confer antibiotic resistance across the genus enterococcus co occurrence of resistance genes and virulence factors is of particular concern from a clinical standpoint and is common among nosocomial strains guzman prieto et al 2016 pöntinen et al 2021 most genetic determinants of antibiotic resistance in enterococcus spp are intrinsically encoded i e they exist on the chromosome within the core genome of the genus typically acquired resistance i e a product of horizontal gene transfer is of greater interest for monitoring where the purpose is to examine trends in resistance patterns and if they are changing in time and space acquired resistance genes are of primary concern as drivers of failure of antibiotic treatment in clinical infections canonical mobile resistance determinants within enterococci include those that confer resistance to glycopeptides van gene clusters aminoglycosides aac 6 ie aph 2 ia and aph 3 iiia mls ermb and tetracyclines tetm and tetl figure s3 just over a third of analyzed articles 41 117 genotyped colonies for antibiotic resistance determinants after they had been isolated on antibiotic containing media of which 37 used pcr and 4 used wgs the van operon was commonly targeted with an emphasis on vana and vanb within vre isolates themselves figure s3 there are nine distinct gene clusters conferring glycopeptide resistance in enterococci vana b c d e g l m n hancock et al 2014 teixeira et al 2015 and these determinants differ both genetically and phenotypically based on their physical location encoded on mobile genetic elements or chromosomal whether resistance is inducible or constitutive the type of peptidoglycan precursor that is produced and ultimately the level of resistance conferred vana gene clusters are the most common in clinical isolates and are typically found on tn1546 like transposons are frequently integrated into a wide range of plasmids and produce clinical levels of resistance to vancomycin mic 64 1 000 µg ml and teicoplanin mic 16 512 µg ml teixeira et al 2015 similar to vana vanb gene clusters are also typically found in clinical isolates and are present on transposons tn1547 or tn1549 to tn5382 but differ from vana due their inability to recognize teicoplanin allowing strains with the vanb phenotype to remain susceptible miller et al 2014 these two gene clusters are the most significant genetic determinants in clinically resistant enterococci and several pcr assays have been developed for their detection dutka malen et al 1995b kariyama et al 2000 nam et al 2013 rathnayake et al 2011 enterococci displaying susceptible to intermediate resistance are typically attributed to chromosomally encoded van clusters like vanc1 in e gallinarum and vanc2 3 in e casseliflavus which are commonly detected in environmental samples the much more rare vand n genotypes were not detected in any articles that screened for them kotzamanidis et al 2009 taučer kapteijn et al 2016 zdragas et al 2008 5 5 virulence factors and pathogenesis the pathogenesis of infections caused by enterococci is still poorly understood teixeira et al 2015 however several pcr assays have been developed for the detection of virulence factors common to enterococcus including surface adhesion proteins esp aggregation substances agg cytolysin cyl and hemolysin hyl secretion operons collagen adhesion ace and gelatinase secretion proteins that are predominantly found in endocarditis isolates gele eaton and gasson 2001 mannu et al 2003 vankerckhoven et al 2004 these virulence factors were primarily screened for in the studied articles due to their implications in pathogenesis routes from environmental reservoirs back into humans and animals only 18 of the studies identified screened for virulence factors the most common being esp all 18 articles cyl and gele figure s3 the first vancomycin resistant e faecalis strain documented in the us was revealed to carry a large transmissible pathogenicity island containing both esp and a complete cyl operon and several other functions that are non essential to commensal behavior of the organism shankar et al 2002 the e faecalis pathogenicity island is an integrative conjugative element that can be mobilized between plasmids and chromosomes in e faecalis and e faecium transferring virulence factors and antibiotic resistance determinants laverde gomez et al 2011 manson et al 2010 the co occurrence of virulence with antibiotic resistance is a key consideration when screening the environment for the emergence of potentially hyper virulent strains rathnayake et al 2012 found significant correlations between the presence of virulence factors and phenotypic antibiotic resistance among both e faecium and e faecalis isolates in surface waters and regional clinical isolates in australia rathnayake et al 2012 similarly lata et al 2016 documented widespread co occurrence of vana and vanb genotypes with gele ace efaa and esp virulence factors in both e faecalis and e faecium in impacted surface waters in northern india lata et al 2016 such studies demonstrate the value of monitoring both antibiotic resistance and virulence particularly for gaining insight into ecological factors at play in observed resistance patterns 5 6 multilocus sequence typing multilocus sequence typing mlst is a technique by which multiple loci or specific internal dna fragments within an organism s genome are amplified by pcr sequenced and then compared across multiple isolates of that species the loci are typically housekeeping genes common to the genus and the allelic composition of the set of targets determines the sequence type allowing for the determination of clonal complexes ccs isolates with differences of no more than 2 loci and potential source attribution of isolates sequence types can then be compared to publicly available and curated databases such as pubmlst jolley et al 2018 where global isolate comparisons can be made pulse field gel electrophoresis is a similar technique to mlst and was previously known as the gold standard for source attribution and epidemiological linkages of bacterial isolates but low interlaboratory reproducibility and inability to perform phylogenetic or population structure studies makes it unsuitable for global long term epidemiological studies nemoy et al 2005 mlst profiles of enterococcus have only been developed for faecium homan et al 2002 and faecalis ruiz garbajosa et al 2006 and are therefore the only two species present in the pubmlst database the two profiles are derived from a mixed set of 11 housekeeping genes gdh glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase purk phosphoribosylaminoimidazol carboxylase atpase subunit psts phosphate atp binding cassette transporter atpa atp synthase alpha subunit gyd glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase adk adenylate kinase ddl gki glucokinase aroe shikimate 5 dehydrogenase xpt shikimate 5 dehydrogenase and yqil acetyl coenzyme a acetyltransferase which were chosen for their low ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations and their dispersed locations on the chromosomes mlst is useful when exploring potential clonal relationships between enterococcus spp isolated from the environment and those from critical amr monitoring points such as hospital wastewaters and pharmaceutical production waste the clonal complex 17 cc17 of enterococcus faecium for example is a nosocomial strain associated with outbreaks worldwide and is generally ampicillin and quinolone resistant and contains the esp surface adhesion protein top et al 2008 cc17 has been detected in several environmental samples and is an indication of the interconnectedness of the environment and clinical wastewater streams caplin et al 2008 5 7 whole genome sequencing despite the development of several sophisticated molecular biological assays for the complete characterization of enterococcal isolates over the last few decades the advent and proliferation of next generation sequencing techniques has allowed for comprehensive and high throughput functionality of all the previous assays in a singular method figure 1 wgs of isolates allows for the simultaneous detection of args virulence factors plasmids bacteriophages insertion sequences transposons and the sequence type and cladal relatedness of isolates that can be comparted with enterococcal libraries globally only four articles reviewed here performed wgs ekwanzala et al 2020a gouliouris et al 2019 2018 zaheer et al 2020 indicating that comprehensive epidemiological analysis of antibiotic resistant virulent hospital adapted enterococcal clades is largely absent from the environmental literature in wgs workflows resistant enterococci are initially screened for on selective media supplemented with antibiotics in this case ampicillin or vancomycin and then isolated and speciated before they are subject to sequencing genomic surveillance of e faecium isolates from retail meat patients with bloodstream infections and wastewater treatment plants revealed distinct clades with limited sharing of args between livestock and humans in the uk gouliouris et al 2018 there was however extensive overlap between isolates from bloodstream infections and those from the influents and effluents of 17 different wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the region which could indicate the emergence of new lineages of e faecium that are both hospital adapted and persist in the environment gouliouris et al 2019 similarly a south african study investigated the prevalence of vre in hospital wastewater municipal wastewater and the receiving surface water ekwanzala et al 2020a thirty five percent of the enterococci exiting the wastewater treatment plant were vancomycin resistant leading to the greatest vre loadings in the downstream sediment subsequent comparative genomics found that st40 a human pathogenic e faecalis sequence type and cc17 of e faecium were found persisting in downstream sediments posing a risk to human health and demonstrating the need for more advanced wastewater treatment in this scenario although wgs is more expensive and difficult to perform than pcr based genotyping its high throughput and robust analysis is quickly becoming commonplace as sequencing costs continue to fall also the storage and sharing of sequenced genomes to public databases allows for longitudinal phylogenetic tracking of problematic clones as they are transmitted globally van hal et al 2021 6 trends in total and antibiotic resistant enterococcus found in water environments a comprehensive data extraction and analysis was performed to identify overarching trends in the species distribution of generic and antibiotic resistant enterococcus spp to illuminate general trends and inform sampling priorities extracting data from all articles that reported resistance as a percentage of the total number of isolates in a collection together this collection consisted of 42 459 isolates extracted from 95 117 articles to reduce the amount of bias introduced by sampling and enrichment procedures only enterococcus ast data that was generated in the absence of an initial selective antibiotic were used this reduced the collection size for ast data to 18 729 isolates extracted from 77 articles but allowed for an estimation of the true phenotypic diversity of environmental antibiotic resistant enterococcus this approach also allows for the empirical prioritization of monitoring targets for enterococcus resistant to critical antibiotics as well as a baseline for further studies across different water matrices without a bias towards resistant populations 6 1 total enterococci only 62 of the 91 articles in which libraries were speciated were the data provided in a format that could be extracted unambiguously e g in tabular format or detailed population statistics reported resulting in a collective of 28 343 speciated isolates for analysis figure 3 the three most common enterococcus spp identified across the 62 articles were e faecium 34 0 e faecalis 29 0 and e hirae 13 0 minor species such as e raffinosus e avium and e pseudoavium table s3 each represented less than 2 of the total isolates although this is likely influenced by underrepresentation of these species in common pcr confirmation assays in fact in many articles only e faecalis e faecium e gallinarum and e casseliflavus were screened as these species represent the most encountered resistant clinical isolates despite the uneven representation of the number isolates from each water matrix there were clear trends among enterococcal populations in wwtp and hospital wastewater samples the combined proportions of e faecium e faecalis and e hirae were nearly identical making up approximately 90 of all isolates figure 3 these proportions are consistent with the natural distributions of enterococcus spp in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy human adults and animals silva et al 2012 the proportions of non fecal related or undefined enterococcus spp were greater in surface water and coastal water samples consistent with dilution of fecal contamination with environmental strains a large proportion e hirae the dominant species excreted by cattle jackson et al 2011 was found in cattle feedlot drains zaheer et al 2020 the even proportions of species across comparable water matrices e g wwtps and hospital wastewater observed despite extensive heterogeneity in methodology suggests that there is a general lack of systematic errors or biases in either media selectivity or speciation techniques 6 2 surface water the majority of isolates obtained across studies were derived from surface water fresh water which included both urban and rural watersheds and riverine sites directly impacted by municipal or hospital wastewater discharge 7 146 isolates figure 4 compared to the other environments examined surface waters displayed some of the lowest percentages of resistant isolates to all 18 antibiotics and antibiotic classes it should be noted that despite dilution effects and environmental attenuation 3 5 of 7 146 enterococcus spp isolates were fully resistant to vancomycin the vast majority of these isolates were either e faecium or e faecalis by contrast full vancomycin resistance was virtually undetected in e casseliflavus e gallinarum and the other less dominant species figure 4 table s3 despite intrinsic resistance of e casseliflavus and e gallinarum via vanc genes their phenotypes rarely exceeded clsi breakpoints for full clinical resistance łuczkiewicz et al 2010 examined enterococcus resistance to 13 different antibiotics in an urban river system in poland in the absence of wastewater treatment plant discharge and found that resistance to erythromycin ciprofloxacin and tetracycline was common among all isolates łuczkiewicz et al 2010 they also found multidrug resistance some to all 13 antibiotics tested including vancomycin and high level aminoglycoside resistance among e faecalis and e faecium isolates in the two main tributaries feeding the coastal waters the authors suggested that riverine enterococci should be considered as a potential risk for downstream recreational bathers even in the absence of point source wastewater pollution in contrast studies of rural watersheds 1 urban in ontario canada and georgia us found that the diversity and distribution of antibiotic resistance among enterococcus were strikingly different than in more anthropogenically impacted water bodies cho et al 2019 lanthier et al 2011 these two studies together comprising 2 195 isolates indicate that the enterococcus species and their phenotypes were stochastically distributed and sparse with few multidrug 6 antibiotics resistant strains and no isolates reaching the clsi breakpoints for vancomycin teicoplanin or linezolid they attributed the dispersion of the resistant fecal indicators to domesticated animal and wildlife fecal pollution and their potential for dissemination to be limited the highest rates of resistance among enterococcus isolates from surface water studies came from the north west province of south africa where 86 124 enterococcus spp were phenotypically resistant to vancomycin these were isolated in the absence of a selective antibiotic and displayed multidrug resistance to ampicillin amoxicillin penicillin ciprofloxacin erythromycin and tetracycline interestingly a single isolate of e sulfureus was found to be resistant to ampicillin amoxicillin penicillin streptomycin vancomycin chloramphenicol ciprofloxacin erythromycin and tetracycline molale and bezuidenhout 2016 upstream and downstream sampling of municipal wastewater discharge was carried out in several studies the detection of enterococci with resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics downstream of municipal wastewater discharge was regionally dependent and linked to the degree of treatment employed by the wwtp a tunisian study found no ampicillin resistant enterococcus are or vre in the influent effluent or receiving water suggesting the regional variation in their distribution ben said et al 2015 another study bessa et al 2014 found vana positive e faecium mostly upstream of wwtp discharge in portugal a region where vre is prevalent in the population 6 4 municipal and hospital wastewater municipal and hospital wastewater were commonly sampled across the identified articles together they accounted for 7 400 isolates in the collection and displayed high percentages of clinically relevant antibiotic resistant phenotypes figure 4 enterococcus spp isolates from untreated hospital wastewater displayed the highest percentages of resistance to fluoroquinolones ampicillin penicillin macrolides and vancomycin wwtps which encompassed raw influent activated sludge secondary effluents and variably treated final effluents across 15 different countries yielded enterococcus spp isolates with the highest percentages of resistance to cephalosporins lincosamides nitrofurantoin and teicoplanin figure 4 within the wwtp category only 2 7 of 6 057isolates were resistant to vancomycin in the collection the highest percentages of full vancomycin resistance across studies of wwtp influents came from germany 19 16 84 isolates gallert et al 2005 portugal 3 4 17 499 isolates araújo et al 2010 iran 3 3 19 577 talebi et al 2007 and poland 3 2 6 185 isolates luczkiewicz et al 2013 the 2005 paper gallert et al 2005 is the oldest of the group and reveals the challenges of accurately assessing antibiotic resistant enterococcus particularly vre whose phenotypic characteristics are mimicked by genera such as leuconostoc pediococcus and weisella harwood et al 2001 in this case bacteria were isolated on relatively non selective bile esculin agar and were confirmed only by ability to grow at 6 5 nacl and by microscopy for cell morphology furthermore the method for assessing antibiotic resistance relied on a set zone of inhibition of 2 mm for all antibiotics rather than standardized zone diameters although they represented a smaller fraction of isolates hospital wastewater environments showed the most definitive contributions of phenotypic resistance to receiving waters for example novais et al 2005 found statistically significant increases in phenotypic resistance exceeding clsi breakpoints among e faecium and e faecalis for vancomycin teicoplanin ciprofloxacin and ampicillin in urban sewers receiving hospital wastewater discharge in portugal novais et al 2005 clonal analysis tn1546 typing and virulence factor assays were also consistent with local clinics being the source of downstream surface water isolates similar observations were made along a medical center retirement home wastewater treatment plant river continuum in france in 2013 where the hospital adapted clonal complex cc17 e faecium was culturable along the continuum and into receiving waters leclercq et al 2013 the cc17 concentration though was attenuated by the wwtp and the proportion of cc17 became outweighed by environmental strains further epidemiological source tracking using wgs of vre isolated from 20 wwtps in the uk in 2019 determined that there was widespread dissemination of hospital adapted e faecium in wwtp effluents across eastern england gouliouris et al 2019 they found that wwtps receiving hospital wastewater had significantly higher vre and are concentrations than non hospital associated treatment plants and found highly similar isolates shared between the local teaching hospital and those emitted from surrounding wwtps together these studies provide strong support of enterococcus spp as both a clinically and environmentally relevant target for waterborne monitoring hospital wastewaters the municipal wastewater infrastructure responsible for treatment and receiving waters are key monitoring points for tracking their dissemination 6 5 pharmaceutical wastewater pharmaceutical wastewater is a critical monitoring point in the dissemination of resistant microorganisms and is currently understudied in the field only two such articles focused on resistant enterococcus were encountered in this review guardabassi et al 2002 documented intermediate resistance of presumptive enterococcus to 20 ug ml vancomycin and evidence of vana and vand isolates in the waste biomass from the fermentation tanks used in the production of vancomycin guardabassi et al 2002 the wwtp treating the waste was also enriched with presumptive intermediate level vre and quantifiable cfus were routinely emitted from the plant after secondary clarification without disinfection pfge analysis found identical vre patterns between vancomycin production fermentation waste and the final effluents of the wwtp suggesting that pharmaceutical production waste can be a direct contributor to the dissemination of vre into the environment further guardabassi et al 2004 investigated the relationship of tn1546 like elements in enterococcus spp isolated from municipal sewage activated sludge vancomycin production waste human feces mussels and soil using long pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism and found indistinguishable elements shared across the ecologically distinct locations and between enterococcal species suggesting ready transferability of the vana genotype between clinical and environmental strains guardabassi and dalsgaard 2004 6 6 recycled water due to the increased pressures on freshwater around the world wastewaters are increasingly being treated and reintroduced into water and food cycles as the recycled water is used for crop irrigation groundwater recharge and even direct potable reuse only three studies in the current review examined resistant enterococcus in wastewaters intended for reuse goldstein et al 2014 sampled two wwtps in the mid atlantic and two from the midwest regions of the us that reuse their treated effluents and detected vre in 27 of wastewater samples with higher rates in the mid atlantic plants vre were only detected in final treated effluents when there was lack of chlorination goldstein et al 2014 subsequent studies from the same wwtps found that vre are detectable at low concentrations at the point of use after recovery from uv disinfection although other phenotypes are more prevalent carey et al 2016 both wwtps studied receive hospital wastewater and their effluents were used for spray irrigation goldstein et al 2012 6 7 marine waters and recreational beaches freshwater and marine water environments used for recreational bathing are at the direct interface between environmental fecal pollution and human exposure and are therefore important monitoring points studies of enterococcal populations of marine and freshwater beaches from spain puerto rico poland greece malaysia brazil italy and michigan confirmed that many drug resistant strains are readily culturable in recreational marine water and sand alm et al 2014 arvanitidou et al 2001 dada et al 2013 de oliveira and watanabe pinhata 2008 monticelli et al 2019 sadowy and luczkiewicz 2014 santiago rodriguez et al 2013 tejedor junco et al 2001 high phenotypic and phylogenetic diversity was observed across all studies and many environmental associated enterococci dominated local populations including e casseliflavus monticelli et al 2019 e hirae sadowy and luczkiewicz 2014 and e avium and e raffinosus arvanitidou et al 2001 beach sands are of particular interest as they represent a niche environment for enterococci where horizontal gene transfer can occur at higher frequencies than among planktonic bacteria accelerating the rate at which fecal microbiota exchange genes with pathogens and facilitating human pathogen interactions alm et al 2014 oravcova et al 2017 6 8 cafos and irrigation water studies of the effects of cattle and swine concentrated animal feeding operation cafo wastewater on downstream environments were also prevalent in the literature the enterococcal isolates from cafo studies in the collection showed the highest resistance prevalence to tetracyclines which is not surprising given that tetracyclines make up nearly 40 of all antimicrobials used in animal husbandry in the us cdc 2013 as many cafos contain and treat their wastewater on site their direct impact on groundwater or downstream surface water e g due to runoff or unintentional discharge was a concern the animal products themselves also represent a potential direct line of exposure from animals to humans through the food chain sapkota et al 2007 sampled upstream and downstream of a high density swine operation in the mid atlantic region of the us and found higher mics for clindamycin and tetracycline amongst the enterococcus spp in both downstream groundwater and surface water sapkota et al 2007 similarly stine et al 2007 sampled the waste lagoons surface waters and well water of a swine cafo in the us that had been administering tetracycline containing feed for over 20 years and found that 68 of all enterococci were resistant to tetracyclines and a total of 60 different species displayed phenotypic resistance to tetracyclines across the sites stine et al 2007 further evidence for the direct dissemination of clinically relevant enterococci into ambient surface waters by cafos was documented by jahne et al 2015 jahne et al 2015 they documented a cattle cafo and its on site wastewater treatment system comprising of an infiltration basin with subsequent sequestration by a constructed wetland enterococci that displayed co resistance to vancomycin linezolid and daptomycin were common in the wastewater and during rain events the increased hydraulic loading on the infiltration basin and constructed wetland resulted in the direct emission of these organisms into downstream surface waters 7 conclusion and recommendations in this review we recounted the last 20 years of research assessing antibiotic resistant enterococci in various water environments because enterococcus has been shown to be a reliable indicator of fecal contamination of water bodies several nationally and internationally recognized standard culture methods have been developed for their enumeration various enterococcus spp are both clinically relevant and survive and persist in the environment the studies surveyed here lay the groundwork for considering enterococcus spp as a standardized target for waterborne monitoring of antibiotic resistance recently the who put forward a standardized comprehensive surveillance program for one health inspired monitoring i e the tricycle protocol who 2021 which targets the gram negative esbl e coli here enterococcus spp as gram positive organisms represent a compelling target to consider as a complement to such monitoring programs enterococcus spp display resistance to critically important antibiotics that would not be captured by an e coli targeted monitoring program alone as observed in this critical review enterococcus spp also display sensitive responses to anthropogenic pollution including hospitals and cafos that are apparent in their distinct geographical occurrence patterns the recommended path forward for standardizing environmental antibiotic resistant enterococcus monitoring should ensure the comparability of monitoring points methods employed and reporting metrics accessibility and ease of application are also important considerations ideally enterococcus spp monitoring for the purpose of antibiotic resistance surveillance could be incorporated into existing monitoring programs especially considering the high level of existing standardization and regulatory requirements the existence of nationally and internationally recognized standard culture methods is of great value in ensuring comparability of the data gathered in space and time however further standardization is needed for the purpose of antibiotic resistance surveillance specifically the conclusions and recommendations based on this critical review are as follows mei is a prime candidate for a standard selective media given that it yields the highest selectivity over menterococcus and slanetz bartley and is integrated into existing regulatory recommendations in the us still the findings here were encouraging that studies are generally consistent even if different media were employed but confirmation of the genus is critical because no enterococcus media is 100 selective the addition of a selective antibiotic to the media can decrease specificity by selecting for intrinsically resistant non target genera in line with recommendations made in the who tricycle protocol plating environmental samples on the selective media with and without a primary selective antibiotic produces both a percent resistance of the enterococci population and a cfu unit volume measurement e g cfu ml a cfu ml measurement represents a universally comparable magnitude of antibiotic resistant bacteria depending on the research question vancomycin and other antibiotics used for primary selection may be added to media at the breakpoint for full intermediate or low resistance the full resistance breakpoint is the most useful for clinical relevance but in some environments one may be interested in intermediate resistance where one expects bacteria to be compromised injured use of low level antibiotic in enrichment cultures may be useful for lowering detection limits the use of low intermediate breakpoints may complicate human health risk assessments due to the isolation of intrinsically resistant species that are common in the environment unless further testing is done a defined set of key antibiotics aimed at treating vre infections could also be employed for monitoring emerging phenotypes and multidrug resistance these include ampicillin teicoplanin oxazolidinone linezolid daptomycin quinupristin dalfopristin and tigecycline the emergence of multidrug resistant vre that are co resistant to these 6 antibiotics are of great concern antimicrobial sensitivity testing using disk diffusion on mueller hinton agar or agar dilutions in mueller hinton broth should be followed according to the most up to date clsi guidelines speciation and virulence typing of resistant enterococci is of interest for risk assessment and longitudinally tracking changing genotypes and phenotypes across the genus pcr based approaches are appropriate for low tech labs specific loci sequencing and emerging technologies such as maldi tof ms will increase throughput without sacrificing accuracy key monitoring points to consider for the dissemination of resistant enterococci are the hospital municipal wastewater continuum and their receiving water bodies especially where they impact recreational waters pharmaceutical wastewater and recycled water are critically understudied for resistant enterococcus the surrounding areas of cafos are of particular concern after storm events whenever possible isolation of antibiotic resistant colonies for wgs will aid in determining the sequence type virulence genotype plasmid type acquired amr genes and chromosomal point mutations public sharing of wgs data will help to advance understanding of the ecology

19913,antibiotic resistance is a major 21st century one health humans animals environment challenge whose spread limits options to treat bacterial infections there is growing interest in monitoring water environments including surface water and wastewater which have been identified as key recipients pathways and sources of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb aquatic environments also facilitate the transmission and amplification of arb enterococcus spp often carry clinically important antibiotic resistance genes and are of interest as environmental monitoring targets enterococcus spp are gram positive bacteria that are typically of fecal origin however they are also found in relevant environmental niches with various species and strains that are opportunistic human pathogens although the value of environmental monitoring of antibiotic resistant enterococcus has been recognized by both national and international organizations lack of procedural standardization has hindered generation of comparable data needed to implement integrated surveillance programs here we provide a comprehensive methodological review to assess the techniques used for the culturing and characterization of antibiotic resistant enterococcus across water matrices for the purpose of environmental monitoring we analyzed 117 peer reviewed articles from 33 countries across six continents the goal of this review is to provide a critical analysis of i the various methods applied globally for isolation confirmation and speciation of enterococcus isolates ii the different methods for profiling antibiotic resistance among enterococci and iii the current prevalence of resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics among enterococcus spp isolated from various environments finally we provide advice regarding a path forward for standardizing culturing of enterococcus spp for the purpose of antibiotic resistance monitoring in wastewater and wastewater influenced waters within a global surveillance framework graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance enterococcus culturing susceptibility testing genotyping standardization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction enterococcus spp are important members of the natural enteric microbiome of both humans and animals and have emerged as important antibiotic resistant pathogens in clinical medicine arias and murray 2012 there are currently 60 classified enterococcus species in the national center for biotechnology information database most of which are commensal microorganisms although some act as opportunistic pathogens in humans e faecalis and e faecium are among the most important etiological agents of nosocomial infections including urinary tract infections utis central nervous system infections endocarditis bacteremia neonatal infections and surgical site infections moellering 1992 murray 1990 from 2006 to 2017 enterococcus spp were responsible for approximately 14 of all healthcare associated infections in the us ranking second overall behind staphylococcus aureus hidron et al 2008 sievert et al 2013 weiner lastinger et al 2020 weiner et al 2016 enterococcus spp possess full or partial intrinsic chromosomal resistance to cephalosporins aminoglycosides lincosamides trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and penicillins hollenbeck and rice 2012 their rapid development of multi drug resistance has been attributed in part to their highly malleable genomes that lack crispr clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats elements

world health organization who have set vre to high priority and a serious threat level centers for disease control and prevention 2019 tacconelli et al 2018 enterococcus spp are members of the larger phenotypically defined group known as enterococci which are gram positive catalase negative obligately fermentative chemoorganotrophs that can survive over a wide range of temperatures ph and salinity teixeira et al 2015 enterococci are found in many extraenteric environmental niches including soils and sediments beach sands and aquatic and terrestrial vegetation enterococci have been extensively isolated from wastewaters marine waters and freshwaters byappanahalli et al 2012 because of their abundance in human and animal feces their extraenteric persistence and the ease with which they are cultured enterococci have been targeted for decades as fecal indicators for the purpose of water quality monitoring jang et al 2017 schoen et al 2011 sinclair et al 2012 enterococci formerly classified within the larger group known as fecal streptococci have been widely used to assess the microbiological safety of surface waters drinking waters recreational beaches and as a target for assessing process removal efficiencies during wastewater treatment enterococci have also been found to correlate directly to public health outcomes for example across the us the rate of gastrointestinal illness in swimmers has been correlated with enterococcus spp levels in recreational beach waters that are impacted by wastewaters prüss 1998 wade et al 2006 2003 however these illnesses are assumed to be caused mainly by viral pathogens soller et al 2010 rather than enterococcus spp their importance as water quality indicators and their inclusion in governmental regulatory frameworks have led to a great deal of method development for isolation and enumeration from environmental samples boehm and sassoubre 2014 health canada 2020 global and national action plans set in place to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance have generally embraced a one health approach humans animals environment european commission 2017 hernando amado et al 2019 but a better understanding of the role of environmental transmission and amplification of antibiotic resistant enterococcus and their genes to humans animals and aquatic environments is needed aquatic environments have been identified as a key recipient and transmission pathway of antibiotic resistant bacteria into and out of human and animal populations amarasiri et al 2020 larsson and flach 2021 multidrug resistant pathogens and mobile antibiotic resistance genes enter the environment via treated and untreated wastewater across the globe alexander et al 2020 marathe et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 recently the who put forth the tricycle protocol as a standardized method for monitoring the dissemination transmission and evolution of antibiotic resistance along the one health continuum humans hospitals and community the food chain animal husbandry and the environment human and animal fecal contamination who 2021 specifically the protocol targets gram negative extended spectrum beta lactamase esbl producing escherichia coli which display phenotypic resistance to third generation cephalosporins while esbl e coli was selected in part to coordinate with global surveillance of enterobacterales marano et al 2020 the extent to which it is truly a representative indicator of resistome dynamics has not been established thus the present is a critical moment to also consider other potential targets antibiotic resistant enterococci present many advantages as a potential target for monitoring antibiotic resistance in the water environment the level of standardization for methods targeting enterococcus spp is arguably second only to e coli in environmental waters as such enterococcus spp could present an attractive complimentary target to e coli notably as gram positive organisms they provide insight into distinct genotypes and phenotypes of antibiotic resistance that would not be captured by monitoring only gram negative organisms in particular the plasticity of enterococcus genomes and their propensity for horizontal gene transfer and exchange of virulence and antibiotic resistance determinants from clinical strains to environmental reservoirs of enterococci ekwanzala et al 2020b gouliouris et al 2019 2018 marks them as potentially comprehensive targets for antibiotic resistance monitoring like e coli they are members of the normal flora of human and animal gastrointestinal tracts byappanahalli et al 2012 and are readily quantified in wastewater and environmental waters their status as normal human flora creates the disadvantage of extreme difficulty in tracking infection rates from human exposure to contaminated water another characteristic they share with e coli a study of individuals engaging in surfing found that surfers were significantly more likely to be colonized with e coli carrying bla ctx m compared to non surfers leonard et al 2018 analogous studies of antibiotic resistant enterococcus spp could shed light on aspects of direct transfer of these bacteria from aquatic environments to humans recent progress has been made in applying culture based methods for monitoring antibiotic resistant enterococcus spp in the environment with emphasis on human and animal wastewater and hospital wastewater pollution gouliouris et al 2019 savin et al 2020 zaheer et al 2020 the phenotypic and morphological similarity of other gram positive organisms to the enterococci however makes isolation on selective media prone to false positives with cross selectivity with other cocci e g streptococcus pediococcus weisella harwood et al 2001 false positives are especially problematic for environmental samples pagel and hardy 1980 non selectivity can actually be exacerbated with addition of antibiotics to media because several members of non target bacillus and other genera are intrinsically resistant to clinically relevant concentrations of certain antibiotics woodford et al 1995 the selection of any monitoring target or strategy entails consideration of the overarching purpose or questions to be addressed and these may vary depending on the focus across the spectrum from wastewater to surface water the following are examples of key monitoring goals and considerations addressed by this review monitoring antibiotic resistance among clinically relevant strains of enterococcus spp in sewage as a means of assessing their levels carried in the human population assessing whether clinically relevant enterococcus spp or specific resistance phenotypes are effectively removed during wastewater treatment and if they persist in impacted aquatic environments evaluating evidence that clinically relevant enterococcus spp acquire antibiotic resistance genes from the environment comparing resistant enterococcus spp in various water matrices both locally and globally to assess factors that may be contributing to antibiotic resistance in gram positive organisms 2 literature review protocol this systematic review was conducted in a four tiered approach using search terms presented in table s1 to collect studies published between january 2000 and december 2020 figure s1 web of science pubmed and google scholar were searched briefly tier 1 was designed to isolate topic relevant search terms for surface water wastewater recycled water or reclaimed water 3 828 792 articles tier 2 was designed to select for those articles addressing antibiotic resistance 15 043 tier 3 further narrowed the search to culturing techniques 5 439 and tier 4 specifically to enterococci enterococcus 682 initially these 682 articles were independently screened by two researchers for containing a complete workflow from environmental sampling through to characterization of individual isolates articles were excluded that only used previously collected isolates further exclusions were articles that exclusively investigated biofilms mesocosms drinking water sediments or digested sludge e g anaerobic digestion fecal source tracking articles based on antibiotic resistance analysis were also excluded harwood et al 2000 articles that used a non selective media for initial isolation such as r2a or tsa were also excluded disagreements on article inclusion from the initial screening were presented to a larger group of five researchers to reach a consensus the resulting 117 peer reviewed articles were then subject to data extraction using parameters outlined in table s2 all included articles are listed in table s4 3 collection and analysis of published data data relevant to the species and phenotypic distribution of all isolated enterococci was collected from 117 peer reviewed articles first the number of isolates per species was extracted from articles in which libraries were speciated 91 articles to reveal general population statistics across environments second antibiotic susceptibility testing ast data were extracted from all articles that provided the percent of resistant isolates compared to total enterococci isolated in the absence of any antibiotic 77 articles studies that summed isolates with intermediate or resistant classifications of resistance without providing individual statistics as well as studies that did not cite standardized methodology for classifying resistance e g current clsi breakpoints at the time of sampling were excluded 4 methods for culturing environmental enterococci in the us and canada enterococci are recommended for monitoring saline brackish or marine and recreational freshwaters in the eu enterococci are regulated in both drinking water and recreational water by standardized culture methods eea 2020 several standardized culture methods have been developed including the us environmental protection agency usepa methods 1106 1 and 1600 for ambient waters and wastewaters usepa 2009 2006 the international organization for standardization iso methods 7899 1 and 7899 2 iso 2000 and method 9230 a d as part of the american public health association s apha standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 1999 rice and baird 2017 table 1 these methods include three distinct techniques membrane filtration mf multiple tube fermentation mtf and defined substrate techniques e g enterolert the current gold standard for enterococci enumeration from the environment is considered the mf technique byappanahalli et al 2012 and was used by over 90 of articles included in this review table 1 the principal selective and differential solid media used in standard mf assays are slanetz bartley sb menterococcus me and membrane enterococcus indoxyl β d glucoside mei these media use various peptone and yeast extract based nutrients with the addition of sodium azide and or nalidixic acid sodium azide obstructs the growth of gram negative bacteria through the inhibition of cytochrome oxidase both sb and me agars include 2 3 5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride ttc which dyes viable colonies red differentiated colonies grown on sb or me are then confirmed as enterococci by their ability to hydrolyze esculin in the presence of bile using either bile esculin azide or esculin iron agars the hydrolyzed esculin product esculetin reacts with iron salt in the media to produce black to reddish colonies for enumeration mei is similar to me medium but contains the chromogen indoxyl β d glucoside when cleaved by β d glucosidase positive enterococci blue halos are formed around positive colonies mei is typically used as a standalone media as all colonies with blue halos are considered enterococci 4 1 performance of standard enterococci culture assays several comparative studies have been conducted over recent decades to assess selectivity of culture media for enterococcus table 2 pagel et al 1980 used pure cultures to assess pse pfizer kf streptococcus me and sb agars against over 100 pure cultures of clinical and environmental isolates of various cocci the highest selectivity for enterococci was observed for pse 94 and me 94 agars with the lowest being kf streptococcus 80 and sb 78 pagel and hardy 1980 compared to me however pse was found to yield lower recovery efficiencies from wastewaters with much higher rates of background colony growth other comparative studies found enterococci selectivity on pse and kf streptococcus agars as low as 86 and 54 respectively brodsky and schiemann 1976 the original me agar formulation study found a false positive rate of 10 and false negative rate of 11 2 for surface water isolates levin et al 1975 subsequent studies have confirmed false positive rates for me agar as low as 2 5 when testing pure enterococcus cultures dionisio and borrego 1995 and 1 7 in marine riverine and treated wastewater effluent adcock and saint 2001 the inclusion of the indoxyl β d glucoside chromogen to me agars resulted in an increase in specificity of enterococcus to upwards of 99 7 in ambient freshwaters adcock and saint 2001 in a recent benchmarking study iso method 7899 2 sb media was found to have false positive rates as high as 18 and false negative rates as high as 57 1 depending on the colony count on the filter membrane of recreational marine water tiwari et al 2018 differences in enterococcus selectivity have also been documented between mf and defined substrate techniques where e faecalis is differentially selected for in wastewater using enterolert leading to the conclusion that these methods should not be used interchangeably for regulatory purposes ferguson et al 2013 2010 kinzelman et al 2003 maheux et al 2009 significant media dependent differences in enterococcus concentrations have also been reported for instance several studies were conducted in the wake of the advent of enterolert assays in the mid 1990s to compare its efficacy against established mf techniques for water quality monitoring fricker and fricker 1996 significant differences in concentrations were reported between enterolert and sb agar in marine and recreational freshwaters valente et al 2010 while no significant differences were found between me agar and enterolert concentrations across surface water wastewater or marine waters abbott et al 1998 budnick et al 1996 eckner 1998 fricker and fricker 1996 no significant differences in enterococci concentrations were identified between me and mei agar adcock and saint 2001 importantly no studies were identified that directly compared the specificities and concentrations derived from sb and me or mei across water matrices such a comparison should be considered in future studies that assess their utility for regulatory frameworks for antibiotic resistance monitoring internationally any biases in species distributions and total enterococci concentrations originating from the selective media could skew downstream distributions in resistance frequencies and introduce bias if the data are used for risk assessment 5 workflows for antibiotic resistant enterococcus monitoring a useful method for culturing and enumerating both generic and antibiotic resistant environmental enterococcus would strike a balance between sensitivity i e detect all enterococcus spp that are present specificity i e avoid detecting other genera and the high throughput needed for large scale environmental monitoring aquatic matrices display a large and dynamic range of enterococci concentrations and a method for their enumeration would also need an appropriately low limit of detection for cleaner samples and a sufficiently high limit of quantification for matrices like wastewater where enterococci are concentrated specific logistical considerations are also warranted such as the ability to perform the assay in low tech laboratories using materials techniques and media that are economically feasible for amr monitoring in low and middle income countries in this instance standard methods that have been developed for enumerating generic enterococci can be leveraged for their extensive vetting with respect to quality assurance quality control and adapted to the increased throughput needs of amr monitoring projects culture based approaches for investigating antibiotic resistance amongst environmental enterococcus must be modified based on the aquatic matrix being investigated and the purpose of the assessment here we delineate these approaches into three general categories population level surveys targeted monitoring for specific antibiotic resistant phenotypes and recovery of low concentration or viable but non culturable vbnc populations figure 1 each with their own benefits and limitations for population level monitoring 73 articles figure 1a where the objective is to achieve an unbiased snapshot of the distribution of resistance phenotypes a collection of isolates can be generated using an enterococcus selective method e g table 1 after colonies have been counted isolates with the specified morphologies can then be selected randomly off plates for phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility testing generating an antibiotic resistance profile as a function of the total number of isolates subsampled the disadvantage of this approach is that most colonies screened may not be antibiotic resistant and finding colonies with the resistant phenotypes of interest and to achieve required statistical power can be akin to searching for a needle in a haystack the advantage to this approach is that it provides a denominator for total enterococcus in the sample and an unbiased distribution of both enterococcal species and their genotypes and phenotypes resulting in an ecologically relevant analysis cho et al 2019 if the phenotype of interest is already known e g high level vre targeted monitoring approaches may be more efficient for in depth characterizations of sub populations of enterococcus such approaches use an antibiotic at clinically relevant breakpoints to select for specific resistance phenotypes figure 1b the use of low intermediate breakpoints of antibiotics may be useful for capturing a broad range of phenotypes in the environment but will frequently capture clinically irrelevant organisms especially in the case of glycopeptide resistance figure 1c the sample can also be plated in tandem on the selective media without the antibiotic figure 1d thus allowing the quantification of the resistant population as a fraction of the total enterococci measured in cfu unit volume a universally comparable monitoring value e g see who tricycle program recommendations who 2021 studies utilizing targeted approaches often screen the identified resistant colonies against a panel of antibiotics which can include the original selective antibiotic to confirm clinically relevant levels of resistance this approach requires the choice of initial selective antibiotic and therefore will exclude strains that are not resistant to the primary selective antibiotic using a selective antibiotic will also skew the distribution of enterococcus spp away from the true distribution often selecting for closely related genera that share the same resistance phenotype such as lactobacillus leuconostoc weissella and pediococcus in the case of high levels of glycopeptide resistance harwood et al 2001 nishiyama et al 2017 2015 in some scenarios the recovery of very dilute phenotypes rare targets or stressed cells is desirable for instance in advanced treated wastewater intended for reuse or other disinfected waters pre enrichment of samples in concentrated selective broth e g enterococcosel or azide dextrose broth amended with the selected antibiotic at low intermediate concentrations can greatly increase the detection limit of rare phenotypes by helping to recover vbnc colonies blanch et al 2003 vilanova and blanch 2006 these recovered resistant colonies can then be streaked on high levels of the antibiotic to recover clinically relevant phenotypes of interest however any protocol employing a target enrichment step will preclude the ability to quantify the resistant enterococcus population or normalize to the total population a necessity for universally comparable datatypes figure 1e after the collection of isolates is generated purification of isolates can be performed on the isolation medium or on other selective differential media such as bile esculin azide bea or esculin iron agar eia ideally all isolates should be confirmed to genus by a method such as qpcr for the 23s rrna gene us environmental protection agency 2012 it is crucial that at least a sub set be confirmed to understand the false positive rate of the isolation method and so that false positive isolates can be removed from the dataset kirby bauer disc diffusion testing can be used to confirm the level of resistance to the primary isolation antibiotic and multi drug resistance further isolate characterization may be desirable including speciation and genotyping for args and virulence factors whole genome sequencing wgs is recommended when resources allow as it is the most accurate and comprehensive method for speciation and genotyping and enables global isolate comparisons a comprehensive evaluation of the suite of methods used for isolate characterization is presented in the following sections 5 1 antibiotic susceptibility testing methods several techniques and automated platforms exist for generalized antibiotic susceptibility testing ast or the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations mics of isolate libraries including kirby bauer disk diffusion assays 47 of articles various commercial automated systems 24 manual broth or agar dilutions 20 or strip test methods 9 figure 2 a over 90 of antimicrobial sensitivity tests ast were performed on either mueller hinton agar or in mueller hinton broth concentrations of antibiotics chosen for ast were predominantly determined by referencing the clinical and research standards institute clsi 70 breakpoints for enterococcus according to the most currently available guidelines other standardized breakpoint concentrations were specific to a particular nation or governmental body e g including the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing eucast 7 the national antimicrobial resistance monitoring system narms usa 2 and the canadian integrated program for antimicrobial resistance surveillance cipars 1 approximately 15 of studies utilizing ast that also differentiated degrees of resistance i e susceptible intermediate or resistant did not cite a justification for antibiotic concentrations nor a standardized method for determining the level of resistance observed the panel of antibiotics used to screen isolates varied across studies but overarching trends were apparent vre was mentioned in the title of 35 of articles identified and vancomycin was included in the screening panel in over 75 of the articles figure 2b the number of observed phenotypes among clinical and environmental isolates of enterococcus are wide ranging which warrants a diverse range of antibiotics included in the panels the antibiotics tested were further categorized into twelve distinct classes by activity the most prominent classes across all studies were glycopeptides 76 macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls 72 tetracyclines 72 beta lactams especially penicillins 70 and aminoglycosides 64 interestingly antibiotics that are either approved by the fda to treat vre infections or are commonly used to treat vre arias and murray 2012 were less commonly included in panels these compounds include linezolid 27 quinupristin dalfopristin 21 daptomycin 8 and the synthetic glycopeptide teicoplanin 28 high level aminoglycoside resistance e g gentamicin streptomycin and kanamycin in enterococci isolated from the environment was the focus of small subset of studies 5 2 multidrug resistance profiling because enterococci are intrinsically resistant to several antibiotics including cephalosporins penicillins clindamycin and aminoglycosides resistant phenotypes are commonly found in environmental samples plasmid and transposon mediated resistance to tetracyclines erythromycin chloramphenicol trimethoprim vancomycin and clindamycin however have further allowed the genus to become a leading cause of multidrug resistant nosocomial infections particularly in the us murray 1998 modern nosocomial e faecium isolates for example are commonly resistant to ampicillin vancomycin and high levels of aminoglycosides miller et al 2014 recently the emergence of multidrug resistant vre to newer last resort antibiotics including oxazolidinone linezolid daptomycin quinupristin dalfopristin and tigecycline have caused frequent treatment failures and are of global concern ahmed and baptiste 2018 thus screening for multidrug resistance amongst isolated environmental enterococci is essential for monitoring the evolution of the genus over time specifically as a function of anthropogenic pollution as well as assessing the relative hazard posed by the isolate the choice of antibiotics to include in screening panels is crucial as most are not useful from a risk based monitoring framework although some may highlight ecological relevance for instance screening for phenotypes that are intrinsic to the genus may not have clinical relevance but may be useful in determining the distribution of endemic phenotypes to contextualize the relative frequency of vre detection 5 3 biochemical and molecular confirmation and speciation because the virulence and resistance characteristics across different enterococcus spp vary substantially speciation of resistant enterococcus isolates is desirable a suite of biochemical tests has been developed by clinical microbiologists to confirm enterococcus to the genus level these tests include gram staining catalase testing thermal growth range thermotolerance growth at 10 and 45 c halotolerance 6 5 nacl growth at ph 9 7 pyrrolidonylarylamidase activity and the ability to hydrolyze esculin in the presence of bile salts e g growth on bile esculin agar facklam and collins 1989 teixeira et al 2015 these tests were common features of nearly three quarters of articles and served as a prerequisite for inclusion in downstream characterization including further speciation figure s2 studies that did not confirm isolates to the genus level either relied on chromogenic agar e g mei chromagar vre to select presumptive enterococci or speciated their library without screening for characteristic metabolisms or morphologies genus specific primers based on the 16s rrna gene deasy et al 2000 23s rrna gene epa method 1611 epa 2012 or the elongation factor ef tu tuf ke et al 1999 gene have also been used for rapid identification of the genus enterococcus however 16s rrna primer sets are known to fail to capture all enterococcus spp botina and sukhodolets 2006 while epa method 1611 has proven to be very reliable in our experience speciation of enterococci libraries was common and performed in 91 117 articles the most common approach of which was pcr there are several conserved proteins and corresponding genes that are targeted in these assays the simultaneous detection of enterococcal species and glycopeptide resistance was the first molecular approach to improve diagnostic speeds for clinical enterococci and was based on the detection of genes encoding d alanine d alanine ddl ligases and other glycopeptide resistance determinants a reduced affinity for glycopeptides in vana and vanb type resistance in enterococci are due to the integration of d alanyl d lacate into peptidoglycan precursors by the chromosomally encoded ddl ligases dutka malen et al 1995a the ddl enzymes in e faecium ddle faecium and e faecalis ddle faecalis are conserved and in resistant strains these enzymes are present in addition to vana or vanb similarly conserved ligases vanc1 and vanc2 3 are highly specific for e gallinarum dutka malen et al 1992 and e casseliflavus navarro and courvalin 1994 respectively the primers published by dutka malen et al 1995 for ddle faecium ddle faecalis vanc1e gallinarum and vanc2 3e casseliflavus have been the most widely used for the speciation of environmental enterococci as many researchers are specifically concerned with the identification of these four most common and clinically relevant species table s3 kariyama et al 2000 and depardieu et al 2004 provided additional multiplex pcr assays for more high throughput approaches to vre surveillance a multiplex pcr assay based on species specific superoxide dismutase soda genes developed by jackson et al 2004 includes primers for 23 different enterococcal species jackson et al 2004 the pcr primers described above were in part developed due to a lack of consensus between commercially available systems and kits such as the analytical profile index api biomérieux pheneplate phplate microplate techniques ab phoenix microbiology systems bd phoenix vitek biomérieux micronaut strep2 merlin microscan walk away beckman coulter and bbl crystal mg scientific manual or automated rapid identification systems the principles behind these higher throughput systems are derived from conventional biochemical phenotyping of enterococci which involve differentiating carbohydrate fermentation of mannitol sorbitol sorbose inulin arabinose melibiose sucrose raffinose trehalose lactose glycerol salicin and maltose among others facklam and collins 1989 teixeira et al 2015 the commercial methods employ a panel of biochemical tests in parallel to reduce the labor costs of manual phenotyping however if atypical species are present these systems will struggle to identify the organism with acceptable levels of certainty castillo rojas et al 2013 this issue is especially problematic in matrices outside of the clinical setting as these systems were developed and validated targeting common clinical strains and reference cultures with distinguishable biochemical characteristics and not the wide phenotypic diversity of environmental samples a comprehensive survey of these systems has been reviewed previously emery et al 2016 an emerging technology for the rapid identification of microorganisms is matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry maldi tof ms singhal et al 2015 this method uses lasers to generate singly protonated ions from analytes in the sample in the process of identifying unknown microbes these analytes are primarily housekeeping and ribosomal proteins given that they constitute a large portion of the dry weight of microbial cells the ionized proteins are then separated by their mass to charge ratio and depending on their time of flight through a channel a peptide mass fingerprint is generated that can be compared to openly sourced databases maldi tof ms for the purpose of enterococci speciation emerged in the literature in 2017 as this is an emerging technique in environmental studies maldi tof ms systems are considerably more expensive than most molecular or phenotypic methods but the throughput is generally larger thousands of isolates and can better accommodate the demand in clinical laboratories 16s rrna gene sequencing was less frequently used than other methods due its non specificity other genes may be sequenced including the soda rpoa and phes genes which have shown to be more discriminatory than the 16s rrna gene for closely related species such as e casseliflavus and e flavescens naser et al 2005 poyart et al 2000 in a recent comparative study of various loci to differentiate closely related enterococcus spp it was determined that the alpha subunits of atp synthase atpa chaperonins groesl and phenylalnyl trna synthase alpha subunits phes performed equally well or better than 16s rrna gene sequencing against 308 enterococci isolates from untreated urban wastewater sanderson et al 2019 the rate of false identification of consensus reference strains based on loci sequencing was approximately 2 much lower than the parallelized carbohydrate phenotyping systems discussed above such as rapid str which had error rates of 15 9 for e faecalis 21 5 for e faecium and 56 9 for e casseliflavus gallinarum the gold standard for speciating enterococci and any organism for that matter is wgs sanderson et al 2019 5 4 genotyping resistant enterococci numerous genetic determinants confer antibiotic resistance across the genus enterococcus co occurrence of resistance genes and virulence factors is of particular concern from a clinical standpoint and is common among nosocomial strains guzman prieto et al 2016 pöntinen et al 2021 most genetic determinants of antibiotic resistance in enterococcus spp are intrinsically encoded i e they exist on the chromosome within the core genome of the genus typically acquired resistance i e a product of horizontal gene transfer is of greater interest for monitoring where the purpose is to examine trends in resistance patterns and if they are changing in time and space acquired resistance genes are of primary concern as drivers of failure of antibiotic treatment in clinical infections canonical mobile resistance determinants within enterococci include those that confer resistance to glycopeptides van gene clusters aminoglycosides aac 6 ie aph 2 ia and aph 3 iiia mls ermb and tetracyclines tetm and tetl figure s3 just over a third of analyzed articles 41 117 genotyped colonies for antibiotic resistance determinants after they had been isolated on antibiotic containing media of which 37 used pcr and 4 used wgs the van operon was commonly targeted with an emphasis on vana and vanb within vre isolates themselves figure s3 there are nine distinct gene clusters conferring glycopeptide resistance in enterococci vana b c d e g l m n hancock et al 2014 teixeira et al 2015 and these determinants differ both genetically and phenotypically based on their physical location encoded on mobile genetic elements or chromosomal whether resistance is inducible or constitutive the type of peptidoglycan precursor that is produced and ultimately the level of resistance conferred vana gene clusters are the most common in clinical isolates and are typically found on tn1546 like transposons are frequently integrated into a wide range of plasmids and produce clinical levels of resistance to vancomycin mic 64 1 000 µg ml and teicoplanin mic 16 512 µg ml teixeira et al 2015 similar to vana vanb gene clusters are also typically found in clinical isolates and are present on transposons tn1547 or tn1549 to tn5382 but differ from vana due their inability to recognize teicoplanin allowing strains with the vanb phenotype to remain susceptible miller et al 2014 these two gene clusters are the most significant genetic determinants in clinically resistant enterococci and several pcr assays have been developed for their detection dutka malen et al 1995b kariyama et al 2000 nam et al 2013 rathnayake et al 2011 enterococci displaying susceptible to intermediate resistance are typically attributed to chromosomally encoded van clusters like vanc1 in e gallinarum and vanc2 3 in e casseliflavus which are commonly detected in environmental samples the much more rare vand n genotypes were not detected in any articles that screened for them kotzamanidis et al 2009 taučer kapteijn et al 2016 zdragas et al 2008 5 5 virulence factors and pathogenesis the pathogenesis of infections caused by enterococci is still poorly understood teixeira et al 2015 however several pcr assays have been developed for the detection of virulence factors common to enterococcus including surface adhesion proteins esp aggregation substances agg cytolysin cyl and hemolysin hyl secretion operons collagen adhesion ace and gelatinase secretion proteins that are predominantly found in endocarditis isolates gele eaton and gasson 2001 mannu et al 2003 vankerckhoven et al 2004 these virulence factors were primarily screened for in the studied articles due to their implications in pathogenesis routes from environmental reservoirs back into humans and animals only 18 of the studies identified screened for virulence factors the most common being esp all 18 articles cyl and gele figure s3 the first vancomycin resistant e faecalis strain documented in the us was revealed to carry a large transmissible pathogenicity island containing both esp and a complete cyl operon and several other functions that are non essential to commensal behavior of the organism shankar et al 2002 the e faecalis pathogenicity island is an integrative conjugative element that can be mobilized between plasmids and chromosomes in e faecalis and e faecium transferring virulence factors and antibiotic resistance determinants laverde gomez et al 2011 manson et al 2010 the co occurrence of virulence with antibiotic resistance is a key consideration when screening the environment for the emergence of potentially hyper virulent strains rathnayake et al 2012 found significant correlations between the presence of virulence factors and phenotypic antibiotic resistance among both e faecium and e faecalis isolates in surface waters and regional clinical isolates in australia rathnayake et al 2012 similarly lata et al 2016 documented widespread co occurrence of vana and vanb genotypes with gele ace efaa and esp virulence factors in both e faecalis and e faecium in impacted surface waters in northern india lata et al 2016 such studies demonstrate the value of monitoring both antibiotic resistance and virulence particularly for gaining insight into ecological factors at play in observed resistance patterns 5 6 multilocus sequence typing multilocus sequence typing mlst is a technique by which multiple loci or specific internal dna fragments within an organism s genome are amplified by pcr sequenced and then compared across multiple isolates of that species the loci are typically housekeeping genes common to the genus and the allelic composition of the set of targets determines the sequence type allowing for the determination of clonal complexes ccs isolates with differences of no more than 2 loci and potential source attribution of isolates sequence types can then be compared to publicly available and curated databases such as pubmlst jolley et al 2018 where global isolate comparisons can be made pulse field gel electrophoresis is a similar technique to mlst and was previously known as the gold standard for source attribution and epidemiological linkages of bacterial isolates but low interlaboratory reproducibility and inability to perform phylogenetic or population structure studies makes it unsuitable for global long term epidemiological studies nemoy et al 2005 mlst profiles of enterococcus have only been developed for faecium homan et al 2002 and faecalis ruiz garbajosa et al 2006 and are therefore the only two species present in the pubmlst database the two profiles are derived from a mixed set of 11 housekeeping genes gdh glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase purk phosphoribosylaminoimidazol carboxylase atpase subunit psts phosphate atp binding cassette transporter atpa atp synthase alpha subunit gyd glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase adk adenylate kinase ddl gki glucokinase aroe shikimate 5 dehydrogenase xpt shikimate 5 dehydrogenase and yqil acetyl coenzyme a acetyltransferase which were chosen for their low ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations and their dispersed locations on the chromosomes mlst is useful when exploring potential clonal relationships between enterococcus spp isolated from the environment and those from critical amr monitoring points such as hospital wastewaters and pharmaceutical production waste the clonal complex 17 cc17 of enterococcus faecium for example is a nosocomial strain associated with outbreaks worldwide and is generally ampicillin and quinolone resistant and contains the esp surface adhesion protein top et al 2008 cc17 has been detected in several environmental samples and is an indication of the interconnectedness of the environment and clinical wastewater streams caplin et al 2008 5 7 whole genome sequencing despite the development of several sophisticated molecular biological assays for the complete characterization of enterococcal isolates over the last few decades the advent and proliferation of next generation sequencing techniques has allowed for comprehensive and high throughput functionality of all the previous assays in a singular method figure 1 wgs of isolates allows for the simultaneous detection of args virulence factors plasmids bacteriophages insertion sequences transposons and the sequence type and cladal relatedness of isolates that can be comparted with enterococcal libraries globally only four articles reviewed here performed wgs ekwanzala et al 2020a gouliouris et al 2019 2018 zaheer et al 2020 indicating that comprehensive epidemiological analysis of antibiotic resistant virulent hospital adapted enterococcal clades is largely absent from the environmental literature in wgs workflows resistant enterococci are initially screened for on selective media supplemented with antibiotics in this case ampicillin or vancomycin and then isolated and speciated before they are subject to sequencing genomic surveillance of e faecium isolates from retail meat patients with bloodstream infections and wastewater treatment plants revealed distinct clades with limited sharing of args between livestock and humans in the uk gouliouris et al 2018 there was however extensive overlap between isolates from bloodstream infections and those from the influents and effluents of 17 different wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the region which could indicate the emergence of new lineages of e faecium that are both hospital adapted and persist in the environment gouliouris et al 2019 similarly a south african study investigated the prevalence of vre in hospital wastewater municipal wastewater and the receiving surface water ekwanzala et al 2020a thirty five percent of the enterococci exiting the wastewater treatment plant were vancomycin resistant leading to the greatest vre loadings in the downstream sediment subsequent comparative genomics found that st40 a human pathogenic e faecalis sequence type and cc17 of e faecium were found persisting in downstream sediments posing a risk to human health and demonstrating the need for more advanced wastewater treatment in this scenario although wgs is more expensive and difficult to perform than pcr based genotyping its high throughput and robust analysis is quickly becoming commonplace as sequencing costs continue to fall also the storage and sharing of sequenced genomes to public databases allows for longitudinal phylogenetic tracking of problematic clones as they are transmitted globally van hal et al 2021 6 trends in total and antibiotic resistant enterococcus found in water environments a comprehensive data extraction and analysis was performed to identify overarching trends in the species distribution of generic and antibiotic resistant enterococcus spp to illuminate general trends and inform sampling priorities extracting data from all articles that reported resistance as a percentage of the total number of isolates in a collection together this collection consisted of 42 459 isolates extracted from 95 117 articles to reduce the amount of bias introduced by sampling and enrichment procedures only enterococcus ast data that was generated in the absence of an initial selective antibiotic were used this reduced the collection size for ast data to 18 729 isolates extracted from 77 articles but allowed for an estimation of the true phenotypic diversity of environmental antibiotic resistant enterococcus this approach also allows for the empirical prioritization of monitoring targets for enterococcus resistant to critical antibiotics as well as a baseline for further studies across different water matrices without a bias towards resistant populations 6 1 total enterococci only 62 of the 91 articles in which libraries were speciated were the data provided in a format that could be extracted unambiguously e g in tabular format or detailed population statistics reported resulting in a collective of 28 343 speciated isolates for analysis figure 3 the three most common enterococcus spp identified across the 62 articles were e faecium 34 0 e faecalis 29 0 and e hirae 13 0 minor species such as e raffinosus e avium and e pseudoavium table s3 each represented less than 2 of the total isolates although this is likely influenced by underrepresentation of these species in common pcr confirmation assays in fact in many articles only e faecalis e faecium e gallinarum and e casseliflavus were screened as these species represent the most encountered resistant clinical isolates despite the uneven representation of the number isolates from each water matrix there were clear trends among enterococcal populations in wwtp and hospital wastewater samples the combined proportions of e faecium e faecalis and e hirae were nearly identical making up approximately 90 of all isolates figure 3 these proportions are consistent with the natural distributions of enterococcus spp in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy human adults and animals silva et al 2012 the proportions of non fecal related or undefined enterococcus spp were greater in surface water and coastal water samples consistent with dilution of fecal contamination with environmental strains a large proportion e hirae the dominant species excreted by cattle jackson et al 2011 was found in cattle feedlot drains zaheer et al 2020 the even proportions of species across comparable water matrices e g wwtps and hospital wastewater observed despite extensive heterogeneity in methodology suggests that there is a general lack of systematic errors or biases in either media selectivity or speciation techniques 6 2 surface water the majority of isolates obtained across studies were derived from surface water fresh water which included both urban and rural watersheds and riverine sites directly impacted by municipal or hospital wastewater discharge 7 146 isolates figure 4 compared to the other environments examined surface waters displayed some of the lowest percentages of resistant isolates to all 18 antibiotics and antibiotic classes it should be noted that despite dilution effects and environmental attenuation 3 5 of 7 146 enterococcus spp isolates were fully resistant to vancomycin the vast majority of these isolates were either e faecium or e faecalis by contrast full vancomycin resistance was virtually undetected in e casseliflavus e gallinarum and the other less dominant species figure 4 table s3 despite intrinsic resistance of e casseliflavus and e gallinarum via vanc genes their phenotypes rarely exceeded clsi breakpoints for full clinical resistance łuczkiewicz et al 2010 examined enterococcus resistance to 13 different antibiotics in an urban river system in poland in the absence of wastewater treatment plant discharge and found that resistance to erythromycin ciprofloxacin and tetracycline was common among all isolates łuczkiewicz et al 2010 they also found multidrug resistance some to all 13 antibiotics tested including vancomycin and high level aminoglycoside resistance among e faecalis and e faecium isolates in the two main tributaries feeding the coastal waters the authors suggested that riverine enterococci should be considered as a potential risk for downstream recreational bathers even in the absence of point source wastewater pollution in contrast studies of rural watersheds 1 urban in ontario canada and georgia us found that the diversity and distribution of antibiotic resistance among enterococcus were strikingly different than in more anthropogenically impacted water bodies cho et al 2019 lanthier et al 2011 these two studies together comprising 2 195 isolates indicate that the enterococcus species and their phenotypes were stochastically distributed and sparse with few multidrug 6 antibiotics resistant strains and no isolates reaching the clsi breakpoints for vancomycin teicoplanin or linezolid they attributed the dispersion of the resistant fecal indicators to domesticated animal and wildlife fecal pollution and their potential for dissemination to be limited the highest rates of resistance among enterococcus isolates from surface water studies came from the north west province of south africa where 86 124 enterococcus spp were phenotypically resistant to vancomycin these were isolated in the absence of a selective antibiotic and displayed multidrug resistance to ampicillin amoxicillin penicillin ciprofloxacin erythromycin and tetracycline interestingly a single isolate of e sulfureus was found to be resistant to ampicillin amoxicillin penicillin streptomycin vancomycin chloramphenicol ciprofloxacin erythromycin and tetracycline molale and bezuidenhout 2016 upstream and downstream sampling of municipal wastewater discharge was carried out in several studies the detection of enterococci with resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics downstream of municipal wastewater discharge was regionally dependent and linked to the degree of treatment employed by the wwtp a tunisian study found no ampicillin resistant enterococcus are or vre in the influent effluent or receiving water suggesting the regional variation in their distribution ben said et al 2015 another study bessa et al 2014 found vana positive e faecium mostly upstream of wwtp discharge in portugal a region where vre is prevalent in the population 6 4 municipal and hospital wastewater municipal and hospital wastewater were commonly sampled across the identified articles together they accounted for 7 400 isolates in the collection and displayed high percentages of clinically relevant antibiotic resistant phenotypes figure 4 enterococcus spp isolates from untreated hospital wastewater displayed the highest percentages of resistance to fluoroquinolones ampicillin penicillin macrolides and vancomycin wwtps which encompassed raw influent activated sludge secondary effluents and variably treated final effluents across 15 different countries yielded enterococcus spp isolates with the highest percentages of resistance to cephalosporins lincosamides nitrofurantoin and teicoplanin figure 4 within the wwtp category only 2 7 of 6 057isolates were resistant to vancomycin in the collection the highest percentages of full vancomycin resistance across studies of wwtp influents came from germany 19 16 84 isolates gallert et al 2005 portugal 3 4 17 499 isolates araújo et al 2010 iran 3 3 19 577 talebi et al 2007 and poland 3 2 6 185 isolates luczkiewicz et al 2013 the 2005 paper gallert et al 2005 is the oldest of the group and reveals the challenges of accurately assessing antibiotic resistant enterococcus particularly vre whose phenotypic characteristics are mimicked by genera such as leuconostoc pediococcus and weisella harwood et al 2001 in this case bacteria were isolated on relatively non selective bile esculin agar and were confirmed only by ability to grow at 6 5 nacl and by microscopy for cell morphology furthermore the method for assessing antibiotic resistance relied on a set zone of inhibition of 2 mm for all antibiotics rather than standardized zone diameters although they represented a smaller fraction of isolates hospital wastewater environments showed the most definitive contributions of phenotypic resistance to receiving waters for example novais et al 2005 found statistically significant increases in phenotypic resistance exceeding clsi breakpoints among e faecium and e faecalis for vancomycin teicoplanin ciprofloxacin and ampicillin in urban sewers receiving hospital wastewater discharge in portugal novais et al 2005 clonal analysis tn1546 typing and virulence factor assays were also consistent with local clinics being the source of downstream surface water isolates similar observations were made along a medical center retirement home wastewater treatment plant river continuum in france in 2013 where the hospital adapted clonal complex cc17 e faecium was culturable along the continuum and into receiving waters leclercq et al 2013 the cc17 concentration though was attenuated by the wwtp and the proportion of cc17 became outweighed by environmental strains further epidemiological source tracking using wgs of vre isolated from 20 wwtps in the uk in 2019 determined that there was widespread dissemination of hospital adapted e faecium in wwtp effluents across eastern england gouliouris et al 2019 they found that wwtps receiving hospital wastewater had significantly higher vre and are concentrations than non hospital associated treatment plants and found highly similar isolates shared between the local teaching hospital and those emitted from surrounding wwtps together these studies provide strong support of enterococcus spp as both a clinically and environmentally relevant target for waterborne monitoring hospital wastewaters the municipal wastewater infrastructure responsible for treatment and receiving waters are key monitoring points for tracking their dissemination 6 5 pharmaceutical wastewater pharmaceutical wastewater is a critical monitoring point in the dissemination of resistant microorganisms and is currently understudied in the field only two such articles focused on resistant enterococcus were encountered in this review guardabassi et al 2002 documented intermediate resistance of presumptive enterococcus to 20 ug ml vancomycin and evidence of vana and vand isolates in the waste biomass from the fermentation tanks used in the production of vancomycin guardabassi et al 2002 the wwtp treating the waste was also enriched with presumptive intermediate level vre and quantifiable cfus were routinely emitted from the plant after secondary clarification without disinfection pfge analysis found identical vre patterns between vancomycin production fermentation waste and the final effluents of the wwtp suggesting that pharmaceutical production waste can be a direct contributor to the dissemination of vre into the environment further guardabassi et al 2004 investigated the relationship of tn1546 like elements in enterococcus spp isolated from municipal sewage activated sludge vancomycin production waste human feces mussels and soil using long pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism and found indistinguishable elements shared across the ecologically distinct locations and between enterococcal species suggesting ready transferability of the vana genotype between clinical and environmental strains guardabassi and dalsgaard 2004 6 6 recycled water due to the increased pressures on freshwater around the world wastewaters are increasingly being treated and reintroduced into water and food cycles as the recycled water is used for crop irrigation groundwater recharge and even direct potable reuse only three studies in the current review examined resistant enterococcus in wastewaters intended for reuse goldstein et al 2014 sampled two wwtps in the mid atlantic and two from the midwest regions of the us that reuse their treated effluents and detected vre in 27 of wastewater samples with higher rates in the mid atlantic plants vre were only detected in final treated effluents when there was lack of chlorination goldstein et al 2014 subsequent studies from the same wwtps found that vre are detectable at low concentrations at the point of use after recovery from uv disinfection although other phenotypes are more prevalent carey et al 2016 both wwtps studied receive hospital wastewater and their effluents were used for spray irrigation goldstein et al 2012 6 7 marine waters and recreational beaches freshwater and marine water environments used for recreational bathing are at the direct interface between environmental fecal pollution and human exposure and are therefore important monitoring points studies of enterococcal populations of marine and freshwater beaches from spain puerto rico poland greece malaysia brazil italy and michigan confirmed that many drug resistant strains are readily culturable in recreational marine water and sand alm et al 2014 arvanitidou et al 2001 dada et al 2013 de oliveira and watanabe pinhata 2008 monticelli et al 2019 sadowy and luczkiewicz 2014 santiago rodriguez et al 2013 tejedor junco et al 2001 high phenotypic and phylogenetic diversity was observed across all studies and many environmental associated enterococci dominated local populations including e casseliflavus monticelli et al 2019 e hirae sadowy and luczkiewicz 2014 and e avium and e raffinosus arvanitidou et al 2001 beach sands are of particular interest as they represent a niche environment for enterococci where horizontal gene transfer can occur at higher frequencies than among planktonic bacteria accelerating the rate at which fecal microbiota exchange genes with pathogens and facilitating human pathogen interactions alm et al 2014 oravcova et al 2017 6 8 cafos and irrigation water studies of the effects of cattle and swine concentrated animal feeding operation cafo wastewater on downstream environments were also prevalent in the literature the enterococcal isolates from cafo studies in the collection showed the highest resistance prevalence to tetracyclines which is not surprising given that tetracyclines make up nearly 40 of all antimicrobials used in animal husbandry in the us cdc 2013 as many cafos contain and treat their wastewater on site their direct impact on groundwater or downstream surface water e g due to runoff or unintentional discharge was a concern the animal products themselves also represent a potential direct line of exposure from animals to humans through the food chain sapkota et al 2007 sampled upstream and downstream of a high density swine operation in the mid atlantic region of the us and found higher mics for clindamycin and tetracycline amongst the enterococcus spp in both downstream groundwater and surface water sapkota et al 2007 similarly stine et al 2007 sampled the waste lagoons surface waters and well water of a swine cafo in the us that had been administering tetracycline containing feed for over 20 years and found that 68 of all enterococci were resistant to tetracyclines and a total of 60 different species displayed phenotypic resistance to tetracyclines across the sites stine et al 2007 further evidence for the direct dissemination of clinically relevant enterococci into ambient surface waters by cafos was documented by jahne et al 2015 jahne et al 2015 they documented a cattle cafo and its on site wastewater treatment system comprising of an infiltration basin with subsequent sequestration by a constructed wetland enterococci that displayed co resistance to vancomycin linezolid and daptomycin were common in the wastewater and during rain events the increased hydraulic loading on the infiltration basin and constructed wetland resulted in the direct emission of these organisms into downstream surface waters 7 conclusion and recommendations in this review we recounted the last 20 years of research assessing antibiotic resistant enterococci in various water environments because enterococcus has been shown to be a reliable indicator of fecal contamination of water bodies several nationally and internationally recognized standard culture methods have been developed for their enumeration various enterococcus spp are both clinically relevant and survive and persist in the environment the studies surveyed here lay the groundwork for considering enterococcus spp as a standardized target for waterborne monitoring of antibiotic resistance recently the who put forward a standardized comprehensive surveillance program for one health inspired monitoring i e the tricycle protocol who 2021 which targets the gram negative esbl e coli here enterococcus spp as gram positive organisms represent a compelling target to consider as a complement to such monitoring programs enterococcus spp display resistance to critically important antibiotics that would not be captured by an e coli targeted monitoring program alone as observed in this critical review enterococcus spp also display sensitive responses to anthropogenic pollution including hospitals and cafos that are apparent in their distinct geographical occurrence patterns the recommended path forward for standardizing environmental antibiotic resistant enterococcus monitoring should ensure the comparability of monitoring points methods employed and reporting metrics accessibility and ease of application are also important considerations ideally enterococcus spp monitoring for the purpose of antibiotic resistance surveillance could be incorporated into existing monitoring programs especially considering the high level of existing standardization and regulatory requirements the existence of nationally and internationally recognized standard culture methods is of great value in ensuring comparability of the data gathered in space and time however further standardization is needed for the purpose of antibiotic resistance surveillance specifically the conclusions and recommendations based on this critical review are as follows mei is a prime candidate for a standard selective media given that it yields the highest selectivity over menterococcus and slanetz bartley and is integrated into existing regulatory recommendations in the us still the findings here were encouraging that studies are generally consistent even if different media were employed but confirmation of the genus is critical because no enterococcus media is 100 selective the addition of a selective antibiotic to the media can decrease specificity by selecting for intrinsically resistant non target genera in line with recommendations made in the who tricycle protocol plating environmental samples on the selective media with and without a primary selective antibiotic produces both a percent resistance of the enterococci population and a cfu unit volume measurement e g cfu ml a cfu ml measurement represents a universally comparable magnitude of antibiotic resistant bacteria depending on the research question vancomycin and other antibiotics used for primary selection may be added to media at the breakpoint for full intermediate or low resistance the full resistance breakpoint is the most useful for clinical relevance but in some environments one may be interested in intermediate resistance where one expects bacteria to be compromised injured use of low level antibiotic in enrichment cultures may be useful for lowering detection limits the use of low intermediate breakpoints may complicate human health risk assessments due to the isolation of intrinsically resistant species that are common in the environment unless further testing is done a defined set of key antibiotics aimed at treating vre infections could also be employed for monitoring emerging phenotypes and multidrug resistance these include ampicillin teicoplanin oxazolidinone linezolid daptomycin quinupristin dalfopristin and tigecycline the emergence of multidrug resistant vre that are co resistant to these 6 antibiotics are of great concern antimicrobial sensitivity testing using disk diffusion on mueller hinton agar or agar dilutions in mueller hinton broth should be followed according to the most up to date clsi guidelines speciation and virulence typing of resistant enterococci is of interest for risk assessment and longitudinally tracking changing genotypes and phenotypes across the genus pcr based approaches are appropriate for low tech labs specific loci sequencing and emerging technologies such as maldi tof ms will increase throughput without sacrificing accuracy key monitoring points to consider for the dissemination of resistant enterococci are the hospital municipal wastewater continuum and their receiving water bodies especially where they impact recreational waters pharmaceutical wastewater and recycled water are critically understudied for resistant enterococcus the surrounding areas of cafos are of particular concern after storm events whenever possible isolation of antibiotic resistant colonies for wgs will aid in determining the sequence type virulence genotype plasmid type acquired amr genes and chromosomal point mutations public sharing of wgs data will help to advance understanding of the ecology

risen significantly in the past 15 years carpenter et al 1972 zhang et al 2020 today plastic particles 5 mm commonly referred to as microplastics mps are found in every environmental compartment from the deep sea van cauwenberghe et al 2013 to surface waters kernchen et al 2022 mani et al 2019 soils piehl et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 and the atmosphere gonzález pleiter et al 2021 the ubiquity of mps in a variety of sizes shapes and colours coincide with reports of a corresponding ecotoxicity adverse effects are greatest when mps are mistaken for food and ingested by fauna duncan et al 2019 wright et al 2013 but also include possible transport or leaching of persistent organic micropollutants koelmans et al 2014 schrank et al 2019 and internalization into cells ramsperger et al 2022 recently plastic particles 700 nm have also been detected in samples of human blood leslie et al 2022 in an effort to pinpoint possible sources of and pathways for mps into the environment wastewater treatment plants wwtps have come into focus sun et al 2019 a few studies have reported elevated numbers of mps in the vicinity of wwtps klein et al 2015 mora teddy and matthaei 2020 which highlights the need to investigate current treatment technologies with the respective effluent qualities including further treatment possibilities plants with primary conventional aerobic sludge and secondary treatment have already been reported to reduce the number of mps by up to 99 carr et al 2016 yuan et al 2021 ziajahromi et al 2021 however even with low effluent concentrations wwtps can release significant numbers of microplastic particles mpp into the environment because of high volumetric flows especially in urban areas leslie et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 in the last 20 years tertiary treatment systems have come into focus to tackle increasing problems of phosphorous concentrations fundneider et al 2020 micropollutants fundneider et al 2021 and antibiotic resistant bacteria alexander et al 2016 fundneider et al 2019 depending on specific treatment needs process alternatives include precipitation flocculation adsorption or oxidation and disinfection but rely largely on surface or depth filtration metcalf et al 1991 these processes were originally designed for other purposes than mp removal still various studies have shown that post treatment processes also reduce the numbers of mpp albeit with different sampling and analysis methods resulting in varying rates a dissolved air flotation and an oxidation ditch were found to remove 95 talvitie et al 2017 and 53 6 of mpp lv et al

lares et al 2018 and 99 9 talvitie et al 2017 on the one hand mp removal rates based on the numbers and concentrations of particles measured by spectroscopic methods in effluents are necessary to evaluate possible ecotoxicological effects on the other hand it has been pointed out that mass concentrations are vital to estimate correct loads to pinpoint significant sources norwegian environment

dierkes et al 2019 eisentraut et al 2018 nuelle et al 2014 okoffo et al 2020 in wastewater samples mass concentrations have been extrapolated from imaging data olesen et al 2019 simon et al 2018 or parts of the studied particles 500 µm have been weighed rasmussen et al 2021 recently roscher et al 2022 reported the quantification of the sample fraction 500 µm in the effluent of a wwtp differential scanning calorimetry dsc is an analytical tool to examine phase transitions in polymers and is widely applied in material sciences the method has been adapted to environmental samples such as wastewater bitter and lackner 2021 by measuring the heat flux occurring in the melting process of semi crystalline polymers although amorphous polymers cannot be detected the mass of thermoplastic particles can be quantified directly majewsky et al 2016 without the need for estimation from two dimensional data on particle shape and equivalent diameter the method is comparatively easy and has been successfully used to identify and quantify reference materials becker et al 2020 rodríguez chialanza et al 2018 and for the quantification of semi crystalline mps in industrial wastewaters bitter and lackner 2020 in this study we examined mass concentrations of semi crystalline mps measured via dsc in secondary effluents of four german wastewater treatment plants in addition seven post treatment processes for phosphorous or micropollutant removal were analyzed the investigation focused on the suitability of these systems to also remove mpp without any adaptation of the operation or design their efficiencies for mpp removal were also evaluated materials and methods sampled sites from april 2017 until december 2020 four german municipal wwtps were sampled at each site the secondary effluent and different post treatment filtration systems were analyzed wwtp a is built for a population equivalent pe of 70 000 people with an average dry weather flow of 10 300 m3 d 1 it is equipped with primary biological and secondary treatment as well as phosphorous removal by iron chloride coagulation submerged drain pipes in the secondary clarifiers facilitate the discharge of the final effluent two pilot plants for further phosphorous and micropollutant removal were examined i a pile cloth media filter pcmf with a pes 14 and a ufh 12 pile cloth media successively the fabric is woven with a multi dimensional structure consisting of a filter active pile fiber layer and a non filter active backing fabric the pile fibers layer is made of polyethylene terephthalate pet for pes 14 and pet and polyamide 6 pa6 for ufh 12 the backing of both pile cloths was woven from pet and polypropylene pp ii a membrane filter mf with a 0 1 µm pore size was operated parallel to the pcmf details on the pilot plants and their operation are readily available in fundneider et al 2020 wwtp b has a size of 45 000 pe and an average volumetric flow of 4200 m3 d 1 the plant includes primary biological secondary and tertiary treatment with chemical coagulation the effluent of the secondary clarifiers flows over toothed weirs and on to a multi layer rapid sand filter rsf the filter was built in 1995 in an effort to reduce concentrations of the total suspended solids tss and phosphorous in the effluent it consists of six chambers each with a filter area of 9 45 m2 and three layers theoretically the top layer is 80 mm high and has a grain size of 4 5 8 mm the second layer consists of sand with a grain size diameter of 0 7 1 3 mm and is 620 mm high the bottom layer consists of expanded slate with a grain size of 1 4 2 5 mm wwtp c has a size of 32 000 pe an average volumetric flow of 4900 m3 d 1 the plant includes primary biological and secondary treatment with toothed weirs for the effluent overflow as well as chemical coagulation here a micro strainer and a continuous upstream granulated active carbon filter cont gac both pilot scale were examined the fabric of the micro strainer was made of pet and had a pore size of 10 µm wwtp d handles wastewater of 725 000 pe with primary biological secondary and tertiary treatment and has an average volumetric flow of 87 000 m3 d 1 the secondary effluent flows over toothed weirs onto iron chloride coagulation for phosphorous removal and a full scale powdered activated carbon pac stage with a clarifier cf and a dual layer rsf the top layer of the latter is 400 mm high and consists of anthracite with a grain size 1 4 2 5 mm the bottom layer is 600 mm high and contains sand with a grain size of 0 7 1 3 mm at the time of sampling one of the rsf columns was used as a gac pilot plant for the comparison of micropollutant removal all post treatment systems examined in this study except the sand filter at wwtp b were built to reduce the concentration of micropollutants in the wastewater effluent or as a part of such a process no specific mpp removal had been considered in the planning or design of the systems sampling method at each site samples were taken from shafts valves or tanks depending on the accessibility and ensuring representability at plant a the pcmf was operated parallel to the mf effluent of both plants flowed into open plastic storage tanks within a tent the effluent of the membrane filter was used as blank value and the mean concentration subtracted from the mean

with 1000 µm 100 µm and 10 µm mesh sizes fuhr gmbh klein winternheim germany and wolftechnik filtersysteme gmbh co kg weil der stadt germany combined with a steel screen in front the pump the particulate matter of each sample was separated into the size fractions 1000 5000 µm 100 1000 µm and 10 100 µm filters from fuhr gmbh were installed into stainless steel casings while filters from wolftechnik filtersysteme gmbh co kg had casings made of pp and styrene acrylonitrile resin san for the latter blank values were measured to rule out possible sample contamination the sampled volumes were measured using a water meter hermann pipersberg jr gmbh remscheid germany or a magnetic inductive flowmeter siemens ag munich germany and ranged from 2 04 to 8 74 m3 see table s1 connecting pipes

analysis for every sample fraction the cartridge filter was rinsed thoroughly to remove the particulate matter a 100 µm metal sieve retsch gmbh haan germany was used to filter the size fraction 1000 5000 µm the other two were poured into glass bottles polycarbonate membrane filters 5 µm pore size ø 47 mm nuclepore track etched whatman ge healthcare uk limited england were used for subsequent volume reduction to reduce the amount of particulate matter the following steps were applied as needed wet oxidation with hydrogen peroxide solution 50 vwr international gmbh darmstadt germany at 50 c over 24 h wet oxidation with sodium hypochlorite solution 6 14 cl2 vwr international gmbh darmstadt germany at room temperature density separation with zinc chloride solution ρ 1 8 g cm 3 and a thermo

polycarbonate membrane filters crucibles concavus aluminum pan 30 40 ml ø 5 mm netzsch gerätebau gmbh selb germany were filled for polymer analysis a recovery rate was determined for every person handling samples in the lab which was incorporated into the calculation of the resulting concentration values an r 160 p precision scale sartorius ag göttingen germany was used for weight measurements for every sample fraction a maximum of 10 crucibles were filled for measurement the quantification of polymers was carried out using differential scanning calorimetry dsc netzsch dsc 214 polyma netzsch gerätebau gmbh selb germany the analysis was based on measuring melting enthalpies and therefore only allowed the analysis of semi crystalline thermoplastics each thermogram of extracted particles was searched for melting peaks any presenting melting peaks were analyzed for the peak melting temperature to identify a polymer afterwards the integration of the peak area resulted in a polymer mass the applied temperature program and information on matrix effects and accuracy can be found in bitter and lackner 2021 in the present study the five polymers low density polyethylene pe ld high density polyethylene pe hd pp pa6 and pet were quantified in the different effluents the analyzed concentrations of each polymer was added up to create an mp sum concentration of a sample removal efficiencies of post treatment systems were calculated by comparing effluent and influent concentrations if the concentrations were below the limit of quantification loq the threshold value was used for the calculation of the removal the loq in mg is readily available see previous paragraph and divided by sample volumes at specific samples dates to create an loq in µg l 1 for every sample fraction the mp load removal efficiencies were calculated with volumetric flow values of respective sampling days recorded by the wwtps mp load emissions into the aquatic environment were calculated for final effluents of systems in regular operation not including pilot plants results the measured mp concentrations at the four sampled wwtps are shown in fig 1 bars indicate mean concentrations of secondary effluent and whiskers the standard deviation at wwtp a an average concentration of 10 8 7 2 µg l 1 was measured in the secondary effluent wwtp b showed a lower average concentration of 5 3 1 2 µg l 1 wwtp c displayed the lowest concentration of 0 7 0 6 µg l 1 and at wwtp d a concentration of 9 4 4 1 µg l 1 was measured the highest single value of 19 6 µg l 1 was measured at wwtp a the lowest of 0 1 µg l 1 at wwtp c as shown by the grayscales 99 to 100 of the measured mass of mpp are found in the size ranges 100 µm the size range 10 100 µm accounted for up to

2 with all other detectable polymers making up the rest with 18 6 pa6 6 5 pp and 0 5 pet a similar fraction of pe hd was detected at wwtp c with 73 8 however the further distribution of the polymer fractions showed a slightly different composition with 13 9 pe ld 11 8 pp 0 5 pa6 and 0 1 pet were found the effluent of wwtp d had a similar composition as wwtp a with a different distribution between the polymers this wastewater was dominated by pe hd with 82 6 and also contained 3 1 pe ld and 14 3 pp overall the effluent mp concentrations were all in the low µg l 1 range consisting of 80 pe ld pe hd and pp figs 2 and 3 compare the influent and effluent concentrations as well as the removal efficiencies in the seven post treatment systems at wwtp a two different pile cloth media types of a pcmf were examined pes 14 showed a removal efficiency of 98 87 with an average influent concentration of 9 9 µg l 1 ufh 12 resulted in a 99 99 removal efficiency with an average influent concentration of 2 0 µg l 1 the mf showed an average influent concentration of 12 2 µg l 1 an average concentration of 0 67 µg l 1 was still detectable in the effluent of the mf with mpp in the size ranges of 100 1000 µm and 1000 5000 µm no mpp were found in the size range of 10 100 µm separate analyses however showed that the membrane and the set up were fully functioning and intact fundneider et al 2020 therefore the removal efficiency was set at 100 and the measured mp concentration was used as a blank for the pcmf at wwtp b the rsf showed a removal of 82 38 with an average influent concentration of 5 3 µg l 1 the continuous upflow gac filter at wwtp c was only able to remove 1 9 of the mpp with an average influent concentration of 0 5 µg l 1 a micro strainer mounted on disk filters showed a removal efficiency of 94 63 with an average influent concentration of 1 0 µg l 1 two of the three effluent values were below the loq at wwtp d the discontinuous downflow gac filter delivered a removal efficiency of 99 56 with an average influent concentration of 6 7 µg l 1 lastly a full scale pac system with clarifier and an rsf showed a removal of 97 15 with an average influent concentration of 9 4 µg l 1 fig 3 shows individual measurements as effluent over influent concentrations values are given in table s1 the removal efficiency of the mf 100 is not included due to the logarithmic scale it shows the removal efficiencies on each sampling day and shows that all but one effluent concentrations were 1 µg l 1 it also shows the influent concentrations and highlights the low values for the micro strainer and the continuous upflow gac filter at wwtp c the removal efficiencies of individual polymers are shown as a heat map in fig 4 systems with a removal efficiency 94 do not show clear trends of a dependency on the polymer types the rsf removed pa6 and pet better than pe ld pe hd and pp the continuous upflow gac filter did not remove pet and pp particles showed a mid range removal efficiency for pe ld and pe hd and a high removal efficiency for pa6 in addition the polymer types used for the manufacturing of the pile layer pet or pet pa6 of the pile cloth media as well as the fabric of the micro strainer pet were not found in their effluents the average mp loads in the secondary effluent and the average removal of post treatment systems are given in table 1 as well as the load emissions into the environment all post treatment systems except the continuous upflow gac filter removed significant mp loads wwtp a and c showed an average load of 116 74 g d 1 and 4 77 g d 1 in the secondary effluent respectively wwtp b showed an average load of 4 49 g d 1 in the effluent of the rsf wwtp d showed an average load of 50 42 g d 1 in the effluent of the pac system population related emissions of 0 10 mg pe 1 d 1 0 15 mg pe 1 d 1 and 0 07 mg pe 1 d 1 are in the same range for wwtps b c and d respectively wwtp a stands out with an emission of 1 67 mg pe 1 d 1 discussion mp analysis previously mostly spectroscopic methods were used to examine municipal wwtp effluents elkhatib and oyanedel craver 2020 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy can identify mpp down to 10 µm möller et al 2020 here characteristic vibrational spectra of functional groups enable the identification of mpp including particle number size and chemical composition a drawback of the method is that particles containing a high amount of black carbon are most likely undetectable due to the high absorption of infrared radiation raman spectroscopy uses vibrational spectra of specific chemical bonds to identify particles and their polymer type käppler et al 2016 it has better spatial resolution allowing the detection of particles down to 1 µm ivleva et al 2017 however the method is sensitive to fluorescence from natural organic matter or certain clay minerals braun et al 2020 the results of both spectroscopic methods are given in numbers of mpp per sample volume generating important information for ecotoxicological studies disadvantages include the need for highly purified samples and long measurement times making the overall sample processing and analysis costly and time consuming as a result only small sample sizes are usually analyzed sample sizes 100 l are common in wastewater studies bretas alvim et al 2020 elkhatib and oyanedel craver 2020 sun et al 2019 and cannot be regarded as representative of wwtp effluents which include diurnal weekly and monthly fluctuations of both contaminants and volumes another approach with shorter analysis times are thermoanalytical methods mostly gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms either coupled to pyrolysis py nuelle et al 2014 or thermal extraction and desorption ted dümichen et al 2015 have been applied so far both methods identify characteristic substances after the thermal decomposition of a sample which are then used for the quantification of polymers py gc ms analyzes samples in the µg range and therefore needs a sample purification similar to spectroscopic methods recently mass concentrations of 0 3 3 8 µg l 1 for the mp fraction 500 µm in a wwtp effluent were reported using this method roscher et al 2022 ted gc ms uses larger crucibles with sample sizes in the mg range environmental samples need purification to increase the ratio of mpp within a sample but interference from matrix substances is less an issue braun et al 2020 this method has been used to examine mpp from different rivers and a biogas plant dümichen et al 2017 as well as particles from tire wear in environmental samples eisentraut et al 2018 using dsc only semi crystalline polymers can be quantified thus any resulting mp concentration is potentially lower than the total value of mps taking into account polymers without crystalline fractions pvc polyurethane pur and polystyrene ps are examples of amorphous polymers produced in large quantities and found frequently in wastewaters however pe pp and pet accounted for the majority of production in the plastic industry plasticseurope 2020 and commonly constitute the largest fraction of mpp abundance in municipal wastewaters lv et al 2019 mintenig et al 2014 s m 2017 roscher et al 2022 wolff et al 2019 an advantage of the dsc analysis is its simplicity and the short measurement time 2 h the method is also not as prone to interference from matrix substances as shown in bitter and lackner 2021 and the comparatively high loq reduces the risk of contamination during the processing of samples in the lab although it potentially necessitates large sample volumes in wastewater effluents the effectiveness in comparison to other thermoanalytical methods was proven in an interlaboratory trial becker et al 2020 secondary effluents mp concentrations of secondary effluents at four wwtps were analyzed with values ranging from 0 1 to 19 6 µg l 1 this proves the validity of the dsc analyses for the purpose of determining mp loads in wwtp effluents as the values fit in the range of concentrations reported with other methods a median mp concentration of 16 µg l 1 was reported for ten danish wwtps by extrapolating from spectroscopic data vollertsen and hansen 2017 thereafter 0 5 11 9 µg l 1 were measured by for mpp the size of 10 500 µm with a similar method simon et al 2018 and 0 3 3 8 µg l 1 were determined for mpp also the size of 10 500 µm by py gc ms roscher et al 2022 this confirms the range of mp concentrations found here for wwtps that include primary clarification biological treatment and secondary clarification however in this study the possibility of undetected amorphous mpp remains which would increase the reported values especially from industrial discharge lv et al 2019 measured a higher average concentration of 168 20 µg l 1 in the effluent of an oxidation ditch most likely due to the different design of the plant this study shows that not only the drainage area has an impact on the mp emissions but also the post treatment systems see next subchapter as well as possibly the design of the secondary clarifier wwtp a showed the highest average mp concentrations in the secondary effluent at the time of sampling a visible circulation was transporting small amounts of particulate matter from the separation zone to the top of the clear water zone after the sampling period the inlet structure of the clarifier was modified to optimize the influent of the sludge into the sedimentation and to break up the resulting circulation increasing the hydraulic capacity reducing the effluent tss fundneider 2020 and likely changing mp concentrations average mp loads from 0 05 mg pe 1 d 1 to 2 17 mg pe 1 d 1 were found in the secondary effluents which are in the same range as the values given in literature simon et al 2018 estimated 0 56 g capita 1 a 1 in denmark and conley et al 2019 calculated 0 34 0 68 g capita 1 a 1 in charleston south carolina these values translate to 1 53 mg pe 1 d 1 and 0 93 1 86 mg pe 1 d 1 respectively while these numbers help to improve future models on mp mass fluxes the significance of wwtps as point sources for mpp into aquatic environments still remains a point of discussion the non population related mp loads of 4 77 g d 1 at wwtp c to 116 74 g d 1 at wwtp a also show that wwtps without tertiary treatment can indeed be significant point sources even though the amount of mps originating from non point sources or littered plastic waste might be higher estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 suggest an influence on environmental emissions of mps as well by comparing numbers of mpp in rivers upstream and downstream of four wwtps in addition studies investigating mpp in stormwater retention ponds suggest that this can also be a significant pathway for mpp into the environment liu et al 2019 olesen et al 2019 launay et al 2016 examined micropollutants and showed that stormwater discharges can carry a significant fraction of the load emissions into the environment equipping stormwater discharges with technical particle retention systems comparable to the ones investigated in this study could therefore reduce mp emissions significantly although the technical feasibility and economical expenses would need to be evaluated altogether more research is needed to understand the fluctuations of effluent concentrations in comparison to weather conditions stormwater discharge and the type of urban discharge systems post treatment systems wwtps face rising concerns relating to the quality of receiving water bodies such as phosphorous concentrations micropollutants and antibiotic resistant bacteria rogowska et al 2020 summarized the occurrence of micropollutants measured in treated wastewater showing maximum concentrations from 1 00 to 37 14 µg l 1 for 95 of 100 compounds which is roughly the same concentration range as mps found in secondary effluents see previous subchapter these findings can necessitate tertiary treatment systems for wwtp effluents although those treatment systems are not developed or designed with the intention of removing mpp they often include surface or depth filtration steps which suggest a synergetic removal of mps hence we examined seven different post treatment systems to further understand the fate of mpp in wwtp effluents a pcmf an mf an rsf a micro strainer a continuous upflow gac a discontinuous downflow gac and a full scale pac stage including a clarifier and an rsf an mf pilot plant was operated to reduce tss phosphorous concentrations as well as bacteria and genes contrary to our findings no measureable mpp in the effluent were expected due to findings of fundneider et al 2020 where the mf was reported to be intact and fully functioning as all measured mpp were found in the size ranges 100 µm it is very unlikely that they passed through the membrane additionally the samples were taken out of the open effluent storage tank and therefore the measured mpp could be attributed to contamination from the surrounding plant site the concluded removal efficiency of 100 is higher than numbers reported for mf in bayo et al 2020 lares et al 2018 lv et al 2019 and talvitie et al 2017 two different cloth types of the pcmf were examined the pes 14 and the ufh 12 pile cloth media showed a removal of 98 87 and 99 99 respectively mintenig et al 2017 reported a slightly lower removal efficiency of 97 for a pa2 13 pile cloth media pile layer made of pa6 low numbers of pet fibres were found in the effluent which would likely amount to a mass concentration below the loq of the dsc method applied here we found low concentrations of pe ld pe hd and pp in the effluents but neither pa nor pet which are used to produce the pile cloth media while the majority of systems showed removal efficiencies of 94 the rsf showed an average removal of 82 38 this is lower than the 97 reported in talvitie et al 2017 and the 99 2 99 9 reported in wolff et al 2021 and higher than the efficiency of 79 01 reported in bayo et al 2020 the reason for the comparatively low removal is most likely the lack of maintenance on the filter a visual inspection after sampling showed that the filter beds had been reduced significantly and no new sand had been added the higher removal efficiency of pet and pa6 versus pp pe hd and pe ld are likely due to stochastic distribution and not an indication of a different filtration performance of polymer types a micro strainer showed a removal efficiency of 94 63 it has to be noted that two of three effluent values were below the loq to calculate the removal the loq threshold values were used the overall result is likely influenced by the low influent concentrations found in the secondary effluent we expect the removal efficiency to be closer to 98 5 reported for filter 2 in talvitie et al 2017 if examined with a higher influent concentration simon et al 2018 reported a lower removal efficiency of 89 7 of mpp but conceded that the results suggested a compromised operation mpp were removed independently of their polymer types and no pet was found in the effluent this differs from the findings in talvitie et al 2017 where pet fibres were found in the effluent of both filters while the fabric of the micro strainer in this study is made of pet talvitie et al 2017 did not specify the polymers of the investigated filters the continuous upflow gac filter was the only system studied which has to be classified as inadequate for mp removal this is most likely due to the continuous internal circulation of gac in the filter column during the washing of the filter material the mpp can be returned to the filter surface with the recycled gac and transported to the effluent due to the upflow process pa6 was removed at a higher percentage than the other polymer types which is most likely due to its low influent concentrations the differences between the remaining polymers are likely stochastic and would present differently with higher sample numbers both a full scale pac stage and a gac filter showed high removal efficiencies of 97 15 and 99 56 respectively polymer types had no measureable impact on the removal the full scale rsf and pac stage significantly lowered the mp load of the secondary effluent the same should be true for scaled up systems of the pcmf mf micro strainer and discontinuous downflow gac filter the continuous upflow gac filter did not remove mp loads significantly rasmussen et al 2021 reported an mp load of 0 7 kg d 1 in the effluent of a full scale micro strainer system translating to 0 89 mg pe 1 d 1 with a pe of 790 000 this population related value is similar to the effluents of wwtp b and d which both include tertiary treatment conclusions this study presents mass concentrations of semi crystalline mps in effluents of four german wwtps all measurements were performed using dsc providing a fast and comparatively easy tool to analyze semi crystalline mpp mp concentrations in effluents of secondary clarifiers were found to be in the low µg l 1 range which is in accordance with other studies proving the usefulness of dsc for the determination of mp concentrations in wwtp effluents the implementation of post treatment processes designed for other micropollutants showed in most cases a very good removal of mps independent of polymer types only a continuous upflow gac filter showed poor removal rates and a rapid sand filter showed a less satisfactory removal rate of 82 all the other systems included functioning filtration and showed removal efficiencies 94 based on those results we can state that post treatment systems which contain either discontinuous depth or surface filtration efficiently remove mpp on top of their original treatment purpose and significantly reduce mp loads of secondary effluents overall these findings help to better understand the fate of mpp

19914,microplastics mps are ubiquitous in the environment and have been found in every environmental compartment wastewater and wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been identified as possible point sources contributing to the emission of microplastic particles mpp into the aquatic environment so far mpp in wastewater effluents have mainly been analyzed by spectroscopic methods resulting in concentrations as number per volume in this study we present mass concentrations in the secondary effluents of four german municipal wwtps removal efficiencies of seven post treatment systems and the resulting load emissions differential scanning calorimetry dsc was used for the analysis of semi crystalline mps the concentrations of secondary effluents ranged from 0 1 to 19 6 µg l 1 removal

to 368 mt in 2019 plasticseurope 2020 today plastics occupy almost every aspect of our day to day lives hale et al 2020 consequently reports of plastic emissions go back to the early 1970s and have risen significantly in the past 15 years carpenter et al 1972 zhang et al 2020 today plastic particles 5 mm commonly referred to as microplastics mps are found in every environmental compartment from

in a variety of sizes shapes and colours coincide with reports of a corresponding ecotoxicity adverse effects are greatest when mps are mistaken for food and ingested by fauna duncan et al 2019 wright et al 2013 but also include possible transport or leaching of persistent organic micropollutants koelmans et al 2014 schrank et al 2019 and internalization into cells ramsperger et al 2022 recently plastic particles 700 nm have also been detected in samples of human blood leslie et al 2022 in an effort to pinpoint possible sources of and pathways for mps into the environment wastewater treatment plants wwtps have come into focus sun et al 2019 a few studies have reported elevated numbers of mps in the vicinity of wwtps klein et al 2015 mora teddy and matthaei 2020 which highlights the need to investigate current treatment technologies with the respective effluent qualities including further treatment possibilities plants with primary conventional aerobic sludge and secondary treatment have already been reported to reduce the number of mps by up to 99 carr et al 2016 yuan et al 2021 ziajahromi et al 2021 however even with low effluent concentrations wwtps can release significant numbers of microplastic particles mpp into the environment because of high volumetric flows especially in urban areas leslie et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 in the last 20 years tertiary treatment systems have come into focus to tackle increasing problems of phosphorous concentrations fundneider et al 2020 micropollutants fundneider et al 2021 and antibiotic resistant bacteria alexander et al 2016 fundneider et al 2019 depending on specific treatment needs process alternatives include precipitation flocculation adsorption or oxidation and disinfection but rely largely on surface or depth filtration metcalf et al 1991 these processes were originally designed for other purposes than mp removal still various studies have shown that post treatment processes also reduce the numbers of mpp albeit with different sampling and analysis methods resulting in varying rates a dissolved air flotation and an oxidation ditch were found to remove 95 talvitie et al 2017 and 53 6 of mpp lv et al 2019 respectively micro strainers were found to remove 89 7 simon et al 2019 and 40 98 5 talvitie et al 2017 rapid sand filters showed removal efficiencies of 75 49 bayo et al 2020 97 talvitie et al

lares et al 2018 and 99 9 talvitie et al 2017 on the one hand mp removal rates based on the numbers and concentrations of particles measured by spectroscopic methods in effluents are necessary to evaluate possible ecotoxicological effects on the other hand it has been pointed out that mass concentrations are vital to estimate correct loads to pinpoint significant sources norwegian environment

dierkes et al 2019 eisentraut et al 2018 nuelle et al 2014 okoffo et al 2020 in wastewater samples mass concentrations have been extrapolated from imaging data olesen et al 2019 simon et al 2018 or parts of the studied particles 500 µm have been weighed rasmussen et al 2021 recently roscher et al 2022 reported the quantification of the sample fraction 500 µm in the effluent of a wwtp differential scanning calorimetry dsc is an analytical tool to examine phase transitions in polymers and is widely applied in material sciences the method has been adapted to environmental samples such as wastewater bitter and lackner 2021 by measuring the heat flux occurring in the melting process of semi crystalline polymers although amorphous polymers cannot be detected the mass of thermoplastic particles can be quantified directly majewsky et al 2016 without the need for estimation from two dimensional data on particle shape and equivalent diameter the method is comparatively easy and has been successfully used to identify and quantify reference materials becker et al 2020 rodríguez chialanza et al 2018 and for the quantification of semi crystalline mps in industrial wastewaters bitter and lackner 2020 in this study we examined mass concentrations of semi crystalline mps measured via dsc in secondary effluents of four german wastewater treatment plants in addition seven post treatment processes for phosphorous or micropollutant removal were analyzed the investigation focused on the suitability of these systems to also remove mpp without any adaptation of the operation or design their efficiencies for mpp removal were also evaluated materials and methods sampled sites from april 2017 until december 2020 four german municipal wwtps were sampled at each site the secondary effluent and different post treatment filtration systems were analyzed wwtp a is built for a population equivalent pe of 70 000 people with an average dry weather flow of 10 300 m3 d 1 it is equipped with primary biological and secondary treatment as well as phosphorous removal by iron chloride coagulation submerged drain pipes in the secondary clarifiers facilitate the discharge of the final effluent two pilot plants for further phosphorous and micropollutant removal were examined i a pile cloth media filter pcmf with a pes 14 and a ufh 12 pile cloth media successively the fabric is woven with a multi dimensional structure consisting of a filter active pile fiber layer and a non filter active backing fabric the pile fibers layer is made of polyethylene terephthalate pet for pes 14 and pet and polyamide 6 pa6 for ufh 12 the backing of both pile cloths was woven from pet and polypropylene pp ii a membrane filter mf with a 0 1 µm pore size was operated parallel to the pcmf details on the pilot plants and their operation are readily available in fundneider et al 2020 wwtp b has a size of 45 000 pe and an average volumetric flow of 4200 m3 d 1 the plant includes primary biological secondary and tertiary treatment with chemical coagulation the effluent of the secondary clarifiers flows over toothed weirs and on to a multi layer rapid sand filter rsf the filter was built in 1995 in an effort to reduce concentrations of the total suspended solids tss and phosphorous in the effluent it consists of six chambers each with a filter area of 9 45 m2 and three layers theoretically the top layer is 80 mm high and has a grain size of 4 5 8 mm the second layer consists of sand with a grain size diameter of 0 7 1 3 mm and is 620 mm high the bottom layer consists of expanded slate with a grain size of 1 4 2 5 mm wwtp c has a size of 32 000 pe an average volumetric flow of 4900 m3 d 1 the plant includes primary biological and secondary treatment with toothed weirs for the effluent overflow as well as chemical coagulation here a micro strainer and a continuous upstream granulated active carbon filter cont gac both pilot scale were examined the fabric of the micro strainer was made of pet and had a pore size of 10 µm wwtp d handles wastewater of 725 000 pe with primary biological secondary and tertiary treatment and has an average volumetric flow of 87 000 m3 d 1 the secondary effluent flows over toothed weirs onto iron chloride coagulation for phosphorous removal and a full scale powdered activated carbon pac stage with a clarifier cf and a dual layer rsf the top layer of the latter is 400 mm high and consists of anthracite with a grain size 1 4 2 5 mm the bottom layer is 600 mm high and contains sand with a grain size of 0 7 1 3 mm at the time of sampling one of the rsf columns was used as a gac pilot plant for the comparison of micropollutant removal all post treatment systems examined in this study except the sand filter at wwtp b were built to reduce the concentration of micropollutants in the wastewater effluent or as a part of such a process no specific mpp removal had been considered in the planning or design of the systems sampling method at each site samples were taken from shafts valves or tanks depending on the accessibility and ensuring representability at plant a the pcmf was operated parallel to the mf effluent of both plants flowed into open plastic storage tanks within a tent the effluent of the membrane filter was used as blank value and the mean concentration subtracted from the mean concentration of the pcmf every sample was taken continuously over two hours using centrifugal pumps with a stainless steel impeller gpn 1500 nowax s r l italy and stainless steel cartridge filters with 1000 µm 100 µm and 10 µm mesh sizes fuhr gmbh klein winternheim germany and wolftechnik filtersysteme gmbh co kg weil der stadt germany combined with a steel screen in front the pump the particulate matter of each sample was separated into the size fractions 1000 5000 µm 100 1000 µm and 10 100 µm filters from fuhr gmbh were installed into stainless steel casings while filters from wolftechnik filtersysteme gmbh co kg had casings made of pp and styrene acrylonitrile resin san for the latter blank values were measured to rule out possible sample contamination the sampled volumes were measured using a water meter hermann pipersberg jr gmbh remscheid germany or a magnetic inductive flowmeter siemens ag munich germany and ranged from 2 04 to 8 74 m3 see table s1 connecting pipes were made of polyvinyl chloride pvc or silicone and gaskets were made of polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe or rubber to prevent contamination with relevant semi crystalline polymers sample processing and analysis for every sample fraction the cartridge filter was rinsed thoroughly to remove the particulate matter a 100 µm metal sieve retsch gmbh haan germany was used to filter the size fraction 1000 5000 µm the other two were poured into glass bottles polycarbonate membrane filters 5 µm pore size ø 47 mm nuclepore track etched whatman ge healthcare uk limited england were used for subsequent

polycarbonate membrane filters crucibles concavus aluminum pan 30 40 ml ø 5 mm netzsch gerätebau gmbh selb germany were filled for polymer analysis a recovery rate was determined for every person handling samples in the lab which was incorporated into the calculation of the resulting concentration values an r 160 p precision scale sartorius ag göttingen germany was used for weight measurements for every sample fraction a maximum of 10 crucibles were filled for measurement the quantification of polymers was carried out using differential scanning calorimetry dsc netzsch dsc 214 polyma netzsch gerätebau gmbh selb germany the analysis was based on measuring melting enthalpies and therefore only allowed the analysis of semi crystalline thermoplastics each thermogram of extracted particles was searched for melting peaks any presenting melting peaks were analyzed for the peak melting temperature to identify a polymer afterwards the integration of the peak area resulted in a polymer mass the applied temperature program and information on matrix effects and accuracy can be found in bitter and lackner 2021 in the present study the five polymers low density polyethylene pe ld high density polyethylene pe hd pp pa6 and pet were quantified in the different effluents the analyzed concentrations of each polymer was added up to create an mp sum concentration of a sample removal efficiencies of post treatment systems were calculated by comparing effluent and influent concentrations if the concentrations were below the limit of quantification loq the threshold value was used for the calculation of the removal the loq in mg is readily available see previous paragraph and divided by sample volumes at specific samples dates to create an loq in µg l 1 for every sample fraction the mp load removal efficiencies were calculated with volumetric flow values of respective sampling days recorded by the wwtps mp load emissions into the aquatic environment were calculated for final effluents of systems in regular operation not including pilot plants results the measured mp concentrations at the four sampled wwtps are shown in fig 1 bars indicate mean concentrations of secondary effluent and whiskers the standard deviation at wwtp a an average concentration of 10 8 7 2 µg l 1 was measured in the secondary effluent wwtp b showed a lower average concentration of 5 3 1 2 µg l 1 wwtp c displayed the lowest concentration of 0 7 0 6 µg l 1 and at wwtp d a concentration of 9 4 4 1 µg l 1 was measured the highest single value of 19 6 µg l 1 was measured at wwtp a the lowest of 0 1 µg l 1 at wwtp c as shown by the grayscales 99 to 100 of the measured mass of mpp are found in the size ranges 100 µm the size range 10 100 µm accounted for up to

2 with all other detectable polymers making up the rest with 18 6 pa6 6 5 pp and 0 5 pet a similar fraction of pe hd was detected at wwtp c with 73 8 however the further distribution of the polymer fractions showed a slightly different composition with 13 9 pe ld 11 8 pp 0 5 pa6 and 0 1 pet were found the effluent of wwtp d had a similar composition as wwtp a with a different distribution between the polymers this wastewater was dominated by pe hd with 82 6 and also contained 3 1 pe ld and 14 3 pp overall the effluent mp concentrations were all in the low µg l 1 range consisting of 80 pe ld pe hd and pp figs 2 and 3 compare the influent and effluent concentrations as well as the removal efficiencies in the seven post treatment systems at wwtp a two different pile cloth media types of a pcmf were examined pes 14 showed a removal efficiency of 98 87 with an average influent concentration of 9 9 µg l 1 ufh 12 resulted in a 99 99 removal efficiency with an average influent concentration of 2 0 µg l 1 the mf showed an average influent concentration of 12 2 µg l 1 an average concentration of 0 67 µg l 1 was still detectable in the effluent of the mf with mpp in the size ranges of 100 1000 µm and 1000 5000 µm no mpp were found in the size range of 10 100 µm separate analyses however showed that the membrane and the set up were fully functioning and intact fundneider et al 2020 therefore the removal efficiency was set at 100 and the measured mp concentration was used as a blank for the pcmf at wwtp b the rsf showed a removal of 82 38 with an average influent concentration of 5 3 µg l 1 the continuous upflow gac filter at wwtp c was only able to remove 1 9 of the mpp with an average influent concentration of 0 5 µg l 1 a micro strainer mounted on disk filters showed a removal efficiency of 94 63 with an average influent concentration of 1 0 µg l 1 two of the three effluent values were below the loq at wwtp d the discontinuous downflow gac filter delivered a removal efficiency of 99 56 with an average influent concentration of 6 7 µg l 1 lastly a full scale pac system with clarifier and an rsf showed a removal of 97 15 with an average influent concentration of 9 4 µg l 1 fig 3 shows individual measurements as effluent over influent concentrations values are given in table s1 the removal efficiency of the mf 100 is not included due to the logarithmic scale it shows the removal efficiencies on each sampling day and shows that all but one effluent concentrations were 1 µg l 1 it also shows the influent concentrations and highlights the low values for the micro strainer and the continuous upflow gac filter at wwtp c the removal efficiencies of individual polymers are shown as a heat map in fig 4 systems with a removal efficiency 94 do not show clear trends of a dependency on the polymer types the rsf removed pa6 and pet better than pe ld pe hd and pp the continuous upflow gac filter did not remove pet and pp particles showed a mid range removal efficiency for pe ld and pe hd and a high removal efficiency for pa6 in addition the polymer types used for the manufacturing of the pile layer pet or pet pa6 of the pile cloth media as well as the fabric of the micro strainer pet were not found in their effluents the average mp loads in the secondary effluent and the average removal of post treatment systems are given in table 1 as well as the load emissions into the environment all post treatment systems except the continuous upflow gac filter removed significant mp loads wwtp a and c showed an average load of 116 74 g d 1 and 4 77 g d 1 in the secondary effluent respectively wwtp b showed an average load of 4 49 g d 1 in the effluent of the rsf wwtp d showed an average load of 50 42 g d 1 in the effluent of the pac system population related emissions of 0 10 mg pe 1 d 1 0 15 mg pe 1 d 1 and 0 07 mg pe 1 d 1 are in the same range for wwtps b c and d respectively wwtp a stands out with an emission of 1 67 mg pe 1 d 1 discussion mp analysis previously mostly spectroscopic methods were used to examine municipal wwtp effluents elkhatib and oyanedel craver 2020 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy can identify mpp down to 10 µm möller et al 2020 here characteristic vibrational spectra of functional groups enable the identification of mpp including particle number size and chemical composition a drawback of the method is that particles containing a high amount of black carbon are most likely undetectable due to the high absorption of infrared radiation raman spectroscopy uses vibrational spectra of specific chemical bonds to identify particles and their polymer type käppler et al 2016 it has better spatial resolution allowing the detection of particles down to 1 µm ivleva et al 2017 however the method is sensitive to fluorescence from natural organic matter or certain clay minerals braun et al 2020 the results of both spectroscopic methods are given in numbers of mpp per sample volume generating important information for ecotoxicological studies disadvantages include the need for highly purified samples and long measurement times making the overall sample processing and analysis costly and time consuming as a result only small sample sizes are usually analyzed sample sizes 100 l are common in wastewater studies bretas alvim et al 2020 elkhatib and oyanedel craver 2020 sun et al 2019 and cannot be regarded as representative of wwtp effluents which include diurnal weekly and monthly fluctuations of both contaminants and volumes another approach with shorter analysis times are thermoanalytical methods mostly gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms either coupled to pyrolysis py nuelle et al 2014 or thermal extraction and desorption ted dümichen et al 2015 have been applied so far both methods identify characteristic substances after the thermal decomposition of a sample which are then used for the quantification of polymers py gc ms analyzes samples in the µg range and therefore needs a sample purification similar to spectroscopic methods recently mass concentrations of 0 3 3 8 µg l 1 for the mp fraction 500 µm in a wwtp effluent were reported using this method roscher et al 2022 ted gc ms uses larger crucibles with sample sizes in the mg range environmental samples need purification to increase the ratio of mpp within a sample but interference from matrix substances is less an issue braun et al 2020 this method has been used to examine mpp from different rivers and a biogas plant dümichen et al 2017 as well as particles from tire wear in environmental samples eisentraut et al 2018 using dsc only semi crystalline polymers can be quantified thus any resulting mp concentration is potentially lower than the total value of mps taking into account polymers without crystalline fractions pvc polyurethane pur and polystyrene ps are examples of amorphous polymers produced in large quantities and found frequently in wastewaters however pe pp and pet accounted for the majority of production in the plastic industry plasticseurope 2020 and commonly constitute the largest fraction of mpp abundance in municipal wastewaters lv et al 2019 mintenig et al 2014 s m 2017 roscher et al 2022 wolff et al 2019 an advantage of the dsc analysis is its simplicity and the short measurement time 2 h the method is also not as prone to interference from matrix substances as shown in bitter and lackner 2021 and the comparatively high loq reduces the risk of contamination during the processing of samples in the lab although it potentially necessitates large sample volumes in wastewater effluents the effectiveness in comparison to other thermoanalytical methods was proven in an interlaboratory trial becker et al 2020 secondary effluents mp concentrations of secondary effluents at four wwtps were analyzed with values ranging from 0 1 to 19 6 µg l 1 this proves the validity of the dsc analyses for the purpose of determining mp loads in wwtp effluents as the values fit in the range of concentrations reported with other methods a median mp concentration of 16 µg l 1 was reported for ten danish wwtps by extrapolating from spectroscopic data vollertsen and hansen 2017 thereafter 0 5 11 9 µg l 1 were measured by for mpp the size of 10 500 µm with a similar method simon et al 2018 and 0 3 3 8 µg l 1 were determined for mpp also the size of 10 500 µm by py gc ms roscher et al 2022 this confirms the range of mp concentrations found here for wwtps that include primary clarification biological treatment and secondary clarification however in this study the possibility of undetected amorphous mpp remains which would increase the reported values especially from industrial discharge lv et al 2019 measured a higher average concentration of 168 20 µg l 1 in the effluent of an oxidation ditch most likely due to the different design of the plant this study shows that not only the drainage area has an impact on the mp emissions but also the post treatment systems see next subchapter as well as possibly the design of the secondary clarifier wwtp a showed the highest average mp concentrations in the secondary effluent at the time of sampling a visible circulation was transporting small amounts of particulate matter from the separation zone to the top of the clear water zone after the sampling period the inlet structure of the clarifier was modified to optimize the influent of the sludge into the sedimentation and to break up the resulting circulation increasing the hydraulic capacity reducing the effluent tss fundneider 2020 and likely changing mp concentrations average mp loads from 0 05 mg pe 1 d 1 to 2 17 mg pe 1 d 1 were found in the secondary effluents which are in the same range as the values given in literature simon et al 2018 estimated 0 56 g capita 1 a 1 in denmark and conley et al 2019 calculated 0 34 0 68 g capita 1 a 1 in charleston south carolina these values translate to 1 53 mg pe 1 d 1 and 0 93 1 86 mg pe 1 d 1 respectively while these numbers help to improve future models on mp mass fluxes the significance of wwtps as point sources for mpp into aquatic environments still remains a point of discussion the non population related mp loads of 4 77 g d 1 at wwtp c to 116 74 g d 1 at wwtp a also show that wwtps without tertiary treatment can indeed be significant point sources even though the amount of mps originating from non point sources or littered plastic waste might be higher estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 suggest an influence on environmental emissions of mps as well by comparing numbers of mpp in rivers upstream and downstream of four wwtps in addition studies investigating mpp in stormwater retention ponds suggest that this can also be a significant pathway for mpp into the environment liu et al 2019 olesen et al 2019 launay et al 2016 examined micropollutants and showed that stormwater discharges can carry a significant fraction of the load emissions into the environment equipping stormwater discharges with technical particle retention systems comparable to the ones investigated in this study could therefore reduce mp emissions significantly although the technical feasibility and economical expenses would need to be evaluated altogether more research is needed to understand the fluctuations of effluent concentrations in comparison to weather conditions stormwater discharge and the type of urban discharge systems post treatment systems wwtps face rising concerns relating to the quality of receiving water bodies such as phosphorous concentrations micropollutants and antibiotic resistant bacteria rogowska et al 2020 summarized the occurrence of micropollutants measured in treated wastewater showing maximum concentrations from 1 00 to 37 14 µg l 1 for 95 of 100 compounds which is roughly the same concentration range as mps found in secondary effluents see previous subchapter these findings can necessitate tertiary treatment systems for wwtp effluents although those treatment systems are not developed or designed with the intention of removing mpp they often include surface or depth filtration steps which suggest a synergetic removal of mps hence we examined seven different post treatment systems to further understand the fate of mpp in wwtp effluents a pcmf an mf an rsf a micro strainer a continuous upflow gac a discontinuous downflow gac and a full scale pac stage including a clarifier and an rsf an mf pilot plant was operated to reduce tss phosphorous concentrations as well as bacteria and genes contrary to our findings no measureable mpp in the effluent were expected due to findings of fundneider et al 2020 where the mf was reported to be intact and fully functioning as all measured mpp were found in the size ranges 100 µm it is very unlikely that they passed through the membrane additionally the samples were taken out of the open effluent storage tank and therefore the measured mpp could be attributed to contamination from the surrounding plant site the concluded removal efficiency of 100 is higher than numbers reported for mf in bayo et al 2020 lares et al 2018 lv et al 2019 and talvitie et al 2017 two different cloth types of the pcmf were examined the pes 14 and the ufh 12 pile cloth media showed a removal of 98 87 and 99 99 respectively mintenig et al 2017 reported a slightly lower removal efficiency of 97 for a pa2 13 pile cloth media pile layer made of pa6 low numbers of pet fibres were found in the effluent which would likely amount to a mass concentration below the loq of the dsc method applied here we found low concentrations of pe ld pe hd and pp in the effluents but neither pa nor pet which are used to produce the pile cloth media while the majority of systems showed removal efficiencies of 94 the rsf showed an average removal of 82 38 this is lower than the 97 reported in talvitie et al 2017 and the 99 2 99 9 reported in wolff et al 2021 and higher than the efficiency of 79 01 reported in bayo et al 2020 the reason for the comparatively low removal is most likely the lack of maintenance on the filter a visual inspection after sampling showed that the filter beds had been reduced significantly and no new sand had been added the higher removal efficiency of pet and pa6 versus pp pe hd and pe ld are likely due to stochastic distribution and not an indication of a different filtration performance of polymer types a micro strainer showed a removal efficiency of 94 63 it has to be noted that two of three effluent values were below the loq to calculate the removal the loq threshold values were used the overall result is likely influenced by the low influent concentrations found in the secondary effluent we expect the removal efficiency to be closer to 98 5 reported for filter 2 in talvitie et al 2017 if examined with a higher influent concentration simon et al 2018 reported a lower removal efficiency of 89 7 of mpp but conceded that the results suggested a compromised operation mpp were removed independently of their polymer types and no pet was found in the effluent this differs from the findings in talvitie et al 2017 where pet fibres were found in the effluent of both filters while the fabric of the micro strainer in this study is made of pet talvitie et al 2017 did not specify the polymers of the investigated filters the continuous upflow gac filter was the only system studied which has to be classified as inadequate for mp removal this is most likely due to the continuous internal circulation of gac in the filter column during the washing of the filter material the mpp can be returned to the filter surface with the recycled gac and transported to the effluent due to the upflow process pa6 was removed at a higher percentage than the other polymer types which is most likely due to its low influent concentrations the differences between the remaining polymers are likely stochastic and would present differently with higher sample numbers both a full scale pac stage and a gac filter showed high removal efficiencies of 97 15 and 99 56 respectively polymer types had no measureable impact on the removal the full scale rsf and pac stage significantly lowered the mp load of the secondary effluent the same should be true for scaled up systems of the pcmf mf micro strainer and discontinuous downflow gac filter the continuous upflow gac filter did not remove mp loads significantly rasmussen et al 2021 reported an mp load of 0 7 kg d 1 in the effluent of a full scale micro strainer system translating to 0 89 mg pe 1 d 1 with a pe of 790 000 this population related value is similar to the effluents of wwtp b and d which both include tertiary treatment conclusions this study presents mass concentrations of semi crystalline mps in effluents of four german wwtps all measurements were performed using dsc providing a fast and comparatively easy tool to analyze semi crystalline mpp mp concentrations in effluents of secondary clarifiers were found to be in the low µg l 1 range which is in accordance with other studies proving the usefulness of dsc for the determination of mp concentrations in wwtp effluents the implementation of post treatment processes designed for other micropollutants showed in most cases a very good removal of mps independent of polymer types only a continuous upflow gac filter showed poor removal rates and a rapid sand filter showed a less satisfactory removal rate of 82 all the other systems included functioning filtration and showed removal efficiencies 94 based on those results we can state that post treatment systems which contain either discontinuous depth or surface filtration efficiently remove mpp on top of their original treatment purpose and significantly reduce mp loads of secondary effluents overall these findings help to better understand the fate of mpp
