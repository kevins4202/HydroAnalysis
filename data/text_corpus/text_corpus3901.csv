19505,rapid industrialization and urbanization pose pressure on water resources in china virtual water trade proves to be an increasingly useful tool in water stress alleviation for water scarce regions while bringing opportunities and challenges for less developed water rich regions in this study yunnan a typical province in southwest china was selected as the case study area to explore its potential in socio economic development in the context of water sustainability both input output analysis and structural decomposition analysis on yunnan s water footprint for the period of 2002 2012 were performed at not only an aggregated level but also a sectoral level results show that although the virtual water content of all economic sectors decreased due to technological progress yunnan s total water footprint still increased as a result of economic scale expansion from the sectoral perspective sectors with large water footprints include construction sector agriculture sector food manufacturing processing sector and service sector while metal products sector and food manufacturing processing sector were the major virtual water exporters and textile clothing sector and construction sector were the major importers based on local conditions policy suggestions were proposed including economic structure and efficiency optimization technology promotion and appropriate virtual water trade scheme this study provides valuable insights for regions facing resource curse by exploring potential socio economic progress while ensuring water security graphical abstract image 1 keywords water footprint input output analysis structural decomposition analysis water management yunnan governance 1 introduction as a vital element in production and consumption water has become a major concern as the demand increases sharply during the rapid industrialization and urbanization process in china piao et al 2010 the spatial uneven distribution of available water resources and water demand further leads to severe water scarcity in china dalin et al 2014 more than 300 cities are already short of water and these shortages are intensifying khan et al 2009 in order to alleviate such water crises many large water engineering projects such as the famous south north water transfer project have been launched to fulfill the inflated productive water demands in water scarce regions hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 which were based upon huge investments with significant environmental impacts the concepts of virtual water vw water use in the whole production process of a product or service allan 1993 and water footprint wf total water use behind the products and services consumed within a specific region hoekstra et al 2009 were put forward to respond to water crises from perspectives of consumption and water management which encourage water deficit regions to alleviate their water crises by trading virtual water embedded in water intensive commodities these will set the foundation for water sustainability analysis and can provide solid evidences for policy makers to make rational decisions regarding water management several water footprint studies have been done during the recent years particularly as the leading virtual water exporter in global trade chen and chen 2013 and also the leading importer in international food trade dalin et al 2012 china has attracted extensive attention in relation to regional wf and domestic virtual water trade on various temporal spatial scales cai et al 2017 dong et al 2014 zhang and anadon 2014 zhao et al 2009 it is found that water deficit developed regions have been relying heavily on external water resources jiang et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 while china s virtual water trade patterns are inconsistent with the virtual water strategy in that water scarce regions are net virtual water exporters deng et al 2016 in addition feng et al 2014 investigated the virtual scarce water instead of the traditional volumetric virtual water to identify the sources and hotspots of water scarcity to date existing studies focus mainly on water scarce river basins yin et al 2016 zeng et al 2012 zhao et al 2010 and provinces dong et al 2013 wang et al 2014 but few studies have investigated the potential impact or challenges that virtual water trade may bring to those water rich regions especially for less developed water rich regions where socio economic progress is highly dependent on natural resources a low level of economic efficiency is the major obstacle to the promotion of virtual water strategy moreover the relatively low level of development dampens potential economic benefits and may even result in an unsustainable development mode therefore it is critical to perform a wf analysis so that the key driving forces can be identified for providing a comprehensive understanding of water consumption characteristics in such regions to fill such a gap this study aims to perform a water footprint analysis to assess water sustainability and virtual water trade benefit of yunnan province which is one of the top three water abundant regions in china but ranks bottom regarding its gross domestic production national bureau of statistics 2012 2016 although being one of china s most water rich regions yunnan contributed little to the mitigation of national water crisis through virtual water trade dong et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 zhang and anadon 2014 in the meantime rapid industrialization and urbanization have posed a threat on local water sustainability from methodological point of view both input output analysis and structural decomposition analysis sda methods are adopted to evaluate its water footprint and identify the corresponding driving forces so that policies on guiding water sustainability with the socio economic development of yunnan province can be drawn the remainder of this paper is organized as below the methodology about water footprint and driving force analysis and data sources are presented in section 2 section 3 provides the results of a detailed analysis of total and sectoral wf in yunnan followed by decomposition analysis results to quantify the contributions of various driving factors section 4 discusses policy implications based on these results finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methods and data sources 2 1 water footprint analysis both bottom up approach hoekstra and hung 2005 ma et al 2006 zhuo et al 2014 and top down approach deng et al 2016 dong et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 zhao et al 2009 are widely adopted to calculate wf of regions and inter regional trade the former is characterized by high precision owing to detailed information of virtual water content and the quantity of products or service however such a bottom up approach fails to address the inter connection of economic sectors and has relatively low data availability while the top down approach manifests its strengths on addressing these issues feng et al 2011 one typical top down approach is input output io analysis which can comprehensively analyze wf at a large spatial scale this study investigates yunnan s wf based upon an input output model dong et al 2013 which distinguishes between domestic supplies and imports for intermediate inputs 2 1 1 sectoral virtual water content in this study sectoral virtual water content vwc refers to the total water needed per monetary unit of final demand for this economic sector it is derived by multiplying the direct water intensity matrix with the leontief inverse matrix as shown in equations 1 3 1 vwc dwi i a d 1 2 a d i m ˆ a 3 m i m i x i m i where a d represents the direct input coefficient matrix for domestically produced products and services a represents the direct input coefficient matrix for the original io table i is an identity matrix x i is the gross output of sector i m i is the import coefficient of sector i and m ˆ is the diagonal matrix of the import coefficient vector the direct water intensity dwi is the direct water consumption per monetary gross output it can be calculated by using equation 4 4 dwi d w i j d w i j w j x j where w j is the direct water consumption of sector j and d w i j is the direct water intensity of sector j the indirect water intensity iwi is the water consumption per gross output caused by use of other sectors products and or services it can be obtained by subtracting direct water intensity from the vwc as shown in equation 5 5 iwi vwc dwi 2 1 2 regional water footprint generally regional water footprint wf consists of an internal water footprint iwf and an external water footprint ewf as shown in equation 6 6 wf iwf ewf the internal water footprint iwf is defined as the use of domestic water resources to produce goods and services consumed by the population in the studied region the calculation of the internal water footprint is shown in equation 7 7 iwf i w f j i w f j v w c j f j d where i w f j represents the internal water footprint of sector j v w c j represents the virtual water content of sector j f j d represents the domestic consumption of domestically produced products and services of sector j the external water footprint ewf is defined as the volume of water resources used in other regions to produce goods and services consumed by the population in the studied region the external water footprint can be further divided by different imports 8 ewf ew f f ew f in 9 ewf j f v w c j m j f 10 e w f j i n i v w c i m i j v j where e w f f is directly for domestic final consumption while e w f i n is for domestic intermediate inputs to exclude those imports later exported an adjustment coefficient v j is introduced m j d represents the imports in sector j for domestic final consumption m i j represents the imports for intermediate use from foreign sector i to domestic sector j 2 1 3 water trade balance to further investigate virtual water embodied in trade the indicator of water trade balance wtb is introduced which is the difference between the export and import virtual water volume a positive wtb means this region is a net virtual water exporter while a negative one means that the region is a net importer 11 wtb e ewf 12 e e j e j v w c j e j d where e represents water footprint of exports that are domestically produced e j d represents domestic produced exports in sector j 2 2 structural decomposition analysis to identify the driving factors of regional wf in the io framework structural decomposition analysis sda is applied as a useful tool to examine production structure and final demand hoekstra and van der bergh 2003 sda has been extensively applied to investigate determinants of environmental variables such as energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions guan et al 2008 peters et al 2007 it incorporates the entire economic system into this analysis as the input output tables contain all the sectoral information and their inter relationships sda has its advantages in analyzing detailed industrial sectoral emissions but requires a complete input output table with the increasing availability of input output tables in different regions sda has also been applied in wf research for instance roson and satori roson and sartori 2015 employed sda to investigate underlying causes of the evolution of global wf wang et al 2016 found that technology and economic structure effect can mitigate wf increase while economic scale and consumption level can offset water conservation similar studies are also performed at a river basin zhi et al 2014 or city yang et al 2015 level structural decomposition analysis can be conducted based on either the base year or the end year in this study the average of two polar decompositions is adopted following previous studies mi et al 2017 wang et al 2016 changes of yunnan s wf during 2002 2012 are decomposed into technology effect t efficiency effect e structural effect st scale effect sc and population effect p as shown in equations 13 and 14 13 wf dwi l y y t o t a l y t o t a l p p t e st s c p 14 δ wf δ t δ e δ st δ s c δ p technology effect represents the influence of change in direct water intensity as shown in equation 15 15 t dwi d w i j efficiency effect reflects the influence of the interdependence of economic sectors i e the leontief inverse matrix as shown in equation 16 16 e l i a d 1 b i j where b i j represents the domestic input from sector i for per monetary unit of final demand in sector j structural effect denotes the impact of sectoral distribution of final demand as shown in equation 17 17 st y y t o t a l y j y t o t a l where y j represents final demand of sector j and y t o t a l represents total final demand scale effect refers to the influence of growth of per capita final demand as shown in equation 18 18 s c y t o t a l p where p is the total population in the case area finally population effect depicts the impact of population growth in yunnan and is represented as p 2 3 data sources and treatment 2 3 1 io data the input output data were obtained from 2002 2007 2010 and 2012 yunnan io tables io tables of yunnan province are compiled by the bureau of yunnan statistics every 5 years and the 2010 io table is the extended and most recent io table they are aggregated into 17 sectors to comply with water withdrawal data by sector see table 1 2 3 2 water withdrawal data water withdrawals of primary agriculture secondary manufacturing and construction and tertiary industry service are obtained from yunnan water resources bulletin yunnan water conservation bureau 2003 2008 2011 2013 in this study only blue water withdrawals are included green water is not included because it is usually not subject to competitive use for each sector in secondary industry except construction water withdrawals are obtained from yunnan energy statistical yearbook yunnan statistics bureau 2016a due to data availability sectoral water withdrawals in 2002 are estimated based on sector added values and water withdrawal data from 2004 yunnan economic census yearbook yunnan statistics bureau 2007 water withdrawals of construction sector are calculated by subtracting water withdrawals of other sectors from that of the total secondary industry water withdrawals of sectors in tertiary industry are estimated based on sector added value ratios with the references of 2004 and 2008 yunnan economic census yearbooks yunnan statistics bureau 2007 2011 2 4 case study area in this study yunnan province was chosen as the case study region it is located in the far southwest of china 97 31 106 11 e 21 08 29 15 n bordering chinese provinces guangxi guizhou sichuan and tibet and the countries vietnam laos and myanmar fig 1 it is a mountainous area with the highest elevation about 6 74 km the total area of yunnan is 394 000 km2 with a population of 47 71 million in 2016 yunnan statistics bureau 2016b it is well known for a high level of ethnic diversity for example 25 of 55 chinese minorities can be found in yunnan yunnan is rich in natural resources including mineral deposits biodiversity water etc regarding water resources yunnan has ample rainfall with many lakes and rivers per capita water resources in yunnan exceeds 3000 m3 which is roughly twice the average in the country national bureau of statistics 2016 however the severe drought in 2010 indicates that yunnan is facing water challenges in aspects of uneven distribution of water resources lacking water conservancy projects and water quality degradation the pillar industries in yunnan province include crop production tobacco mining hydropower and tourism all of which largely depend on its local natural resources however the rich resources endowment does not transform into economic benefits yunnan remains one of china s less developed provinces in the 13th five year plan 2016 2020 yunnan aims to move toward sustainable development in the context of resource constraints local government has implemented several projects in infrastructure development and environment conservation such as the development of yunnan s water safety network the implementation of the strictest water resources control system and national protection projects for erhai lake and dianchi lake 3 results 3 1 sectoral virtual water contents fig 2 illustrates the virtual water contents of different economic sectors in yunnan in 2002 2007 2010 and 2012 during the studied period agriculture sector 1 had the highest vwc and higher dwi than iwi sector of water electricity gas production and supply 14 also had higher dwi compared to iwi other sectors shared the feature of higher iwi than dwi among all other sectors with higher iwi than dwi food manufacturing processing 3 textile clothing 4 and wood processing furniture manufacturing 5 were the top 3 sectors in terms of vwc as for the changes in water intensities vwc of all sectors decreased substantially 65 87 during 2002 2012 as a result of sharp decrease in both dwi and iwi the only exception was the sector of other services 17 whose dwi increased by 155 except for sectors of other manufacturing 13 and construction 15 whose dwi decreased by 15 and 47 respectively the decrease of dwi of other sectors all exceeded 50 the sectors with the most significant decreases in both vwc and dwi include mining 2 machinery 10 and transportation equipment manufacturing 11 all exceeding 80 for sub period vwc changes vwc and dwi of most sectors experienced a significant decrease trend during 2002 2007 indicating the improvement of water use efficiency sectors with the most prominent decreases include mining 2 nonmetallic mineral products 8 and machinery 10 however vwc of textile and clothing 4 and dwi of textile and clothing 4 other manufacturing 13 and other services 17 increased during 2007 2010 and 2010 2012 vwc and dwi of most sectors decreased slightly sectors with dwi increases include nonmetallic mineral products 8 and commercial transportation 16 during 2007 2010 and other manufacturing 13 and other services 17 during 2010 2012 3 2 regional water footprints the total wf of yunnan experienced a steady increase from 37 30 billion m3 in 2002 to 51 52 billion m3 in 2010 followed by a slight decrease to 50 02 billion m3 in 2012 fig 3 illustrates the structures of aggregated and sectoral yunnan wf in 2002 2007 2010 and 2012 internal wf of yunnan dropped from 96 07 in 2002 to 93 30 in 2012 while external wf for domestic consumption and intermediate use increased from 2 29 to 1 64 in 2002 to 4 40 and 2 29 in 2012 respectively from the perspective of three industries the wf of secondary industry experienced a dramatic increase during 2002 2012 its wf rose from 44 43 in 2002 to 54 82 in 2010 and remained around 54 in 2012 the wf of tertiary industry 16 17 increased slightly from 31 51 in 2002 to 34 33 in 2012 while the wf of primary industry 1 decreased from 24 06 in 2002 to 11 73 in 2012 sectors with large wf remained the same over the years including construction 15 other services 17 agriculture 1 food manufacturing processing 3 and commercial transportation 16 these five sectors contributed to more than 85 of the total wf of yunnan during the four years the wf of construction 15 whose wf was the highest amongst all the sectors increased from 11 05 billion m3 29 75 in 2002 to 19 04 billion m3 38 05 in 2012 the wf of other services 17 and commercial transportation 16 increased from 9 66 billion m3 25 88 and 2 10 billion m3 5 63 in 2002 to 13 07 billion m3 26 12 and 4 11 billion m3 8 21 in 2012 respectively while the wf of agriculture 1 kept decreasing that of food manufacturing processing 3 fluctuated between 2 53 billion m3 5 87 in 2007 and 4 78 billion m3 9 28 in 2010 3 3 water trade balances wtb yunnan is a virtual water exporter the total wtb of yunnan fluctuated from time to time it rose from 10 87 billion m3 in 2002 to 23 35 billion m3 in 2007 followed by a decrease to 15 84 billion m3 in 2010 and rebounded to 17 55 billion m3 in 2012 main sectors exporting virtual water in the decade include food manufacturing processing 3 metal products 9 commercial transportation 16 other services 17 and water electricity gas production supply 14 major virtual water importers include textile clothing 4 construction 15 machinery 10 transportation equipment manufacturing 11 and electrical electronic communication equipment 12 agriculture sector 1 imported 0 16 billion m3 in 2002 and 0 26 billion m3 in 2010 while exported 0 81 billion m3 in 2007 and 2 04 billion m3 in 2012 although food manufacturing processing 3 was the largest exporter on average its wtb kept decreasing from 7 72 billion m3 in 2002 to 4 89 billion m3 in 2012 less than that of the sector of metal products 9 in 2012 5 53 billion m3 the wtb of the latter sector increased sharply from 2002 0 86 billion m3 to 2007 10 58 billion m3 and has become the major virtual water exporter since then although its wtb decreased during 2007 2012 for tertiary industry wtb of commercial transportation 16 and other services 17 steadily increased from 1 14 billion m3 and 0 34 billion m3 in 2002 to 1 87 billion m3 and 2 52 billion m3 in 2012 sectors including textile clothing 4 wood processing furniture manufacturing 5 transportation equipment manufacturing 11 electrical electronic communication equipment 12 which once were virtual water exporters in 2002 became importers later on the contrary the sector of machinery 10 which was once a virtual water importer became an export sector in 2012 fig 4 shows total and sectoral water trade balances in yunnan for the period of 2002 2012 3 4 driving forces analysis to uncover the contribution of various factors to the changes of water footprints in yunnan during different periods a decomposition analysis was carried out at both the aggregated and sectoral levels five factors including technology efficiency structural scale and population are considered and investigated as demonstrated in fig 5 on the aggregated level economic structure and technology were the two major factors contributing to the reduction of water footprints while gross economic scale was the major factor contributing to the increase of water footprints during 2002 2012 although the effect of economic structure had the largest negative effect on twf increase during 2002 2012 it is noteworthy that during 2007 2010 this effect was much smaller than the effect of technology and during 2010 2012 it became a positive factor efficiency effect and population effect were minor and negligible however such driving effects were particularly obvious in the early years 2002 2007 but became smaller and smaller in recent years 2007 2012 during 2002 2007 scale effect and technology effect were 77 75 and 29 49 compared to wf in 2002 later they became less determinant being 17 85 and 17 62 during 2007 2010 and 15 53 and 11 06 during 2010 2012 to further uncover the characteristics of driving factors at a sectoral level the top 5 and bottom 5 sectors in vwc wf and wtb were compared in fig 6 a f for the ease of analysis we took the logarithm of the absolute number of various effects in the unit of m3 while kept the original signs as all the absolute numbers exceeded 1 m3 and no logarithm was negative for the top 5 sectors in vwc as illustrated in fig 6 a economic scale effect and population effect were the major positive driving factors while technology was the negative effect during 2002 2012 further investigation shows that during each period for every sector scale effect and population effect remain positive technology effect was negative for most sectors with the exception of textile clothing 4 and wood processing furniture manufacturing 5 for the period of 2002 2007 economic efficiency effect offset the wf increase of the top 2 sectors namely agriculture 1 and textile clothing 4 it was positive for agriculture 1 and negative for the other four sectors during 2002 2007 but reversed during 2010 2012 economic structure effect contributed to the wf of textile clothing 4 and wood processing furniture manufacturing 5 positively and that of other three sectors negatively for the bottom 5 sectors in vwc as illustrated in fig 6 b technology effect and efficiency effect were negative while structure effect and population effect were the major positive factors for most of the 5 sectors all the effects on other manufacturing 13 the sector with lowest vwc were relatively small as for sub periods population effect was positive for all sectors during all the sub periods the scale effect of the sector electrical electronic communication equipment 12 during 2002 2007 was the only negative one among all sectors and sub periods efficiency effect was mainly negative for these five sectors structural effect changed from a positive factor during 2002 2007 to a negative one during 2010 2012 unlike the top 5 sectors in vwc technology effect was not a constant wf reduction factor for the bottom 4 sectors especially during 2010 2012 technology effect of the bottom 3 sectors led to the increase of their wf for the top 5 sectors in wf as illustrated in fig 6 c similar to the top 5 in vwc economic scale effect and population effect were the major positive driving factors these two factors contributed to the growth of sectoral wf during all the periods economic structure effect became an increasingly major positive driving factor for the top 3 sectors as shown during 2010 2012 however the top 2 sectors construction 15 and other services 17 presented positive technology effect during 2010 2012 which was adverse to wf reduction it was noteworthy that during 2010 2012 all the driving factors for the sector of construction 15 were positive for the bottom 5 sectors in wf as illustrated in fig 6 d structural effect was the only common positive driving factor while technology effect was the major negative one during 2002 2012 unlike the top 5 sectors in wf economic scale effect and population effect offset the wf increase during 2002 2012 except for the sector of wood processing furniture manufacturing 5 however during 2007 2010 and during 2010 2012 these two effects were positive for all five sectors although being a negative factor as a whole technology effect was positive for all sectors during 2002 2007 the efficiency effect for sectors of mining 2 and wood processing furniture manufacturing 5 was positive while that of other three sectors was negative during 2002 2012 it was mainly negative during 2002 2007 and positive during 2007 2010 but became varied during 2010 2012 for the top 5 in wtb i e the net virtual water exporters as illustrated in fig 6 e similar to the other two categories of top 5 sectors economic scale effect and population effect were the major driving factors of wf increase while technology was the major negative effect the former two factors contributed to the growth of sectoral wf during all the periods in all five sectors structural effect was mainly a positive factor during 2002 2012 but an incredibly negative one during 2007 2010 and during 2010 2012 efficiency effect was positive for the sectors of food manufacturing processing 3 and other services 17 and negative for the other three sectors during 2002 2012 a further examination shows that it was mostly negative during 2002 2007 and reversed during 2007 2010 during 2010 2012 the efficiency effect of food manufacturing processing 3 other services 17 and water electricity gas production supply 14 were positive for the bottom 5 in wtb or the net virtual water importers as illustrated in fig 6 f economic structure effect and population effect were the major positive factors while technology effect and efficiency effect were the major negative factors during 2002 2012 as for the scale effect it contributed to the wf increase of the top three sectors and the wf decrease of the other two sectors however during 2010 2012 scale effect population effect and efficiency effect all contributed to the wf increase while wf mitigation was due to technology effect and structure effect of three manufacturing sectors including machinery 10 transportation equipment manufacturing 11 and electrical electronic communication equipment 12 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of aggregated water footprint in yunnan as one of the most water rich chinese regions yunnan could meet with its local demand mainly with its internal water resource however with the progress of industrialization and urbanization a growing amount of external water has been imported for domestic consumption and intermediate use it is noteworthy that yunnan had the highest wtb in 2007 despite the wf in the same year being much less than that in 2010 or 2012 one possible reason was the severe drought since 2010 inducing the increasing domestic water demand and decreasing export in the context of water supply deficit rational strategies include efforts to reduce water intensity or to develop less water intensive industries which is also reflected in the driving factors analysis that found economic structure shift and technology advance to be the major effects of wf reduction 4 2 characteristics of sectoral water footprints in yunnan at the sectoral level major virtual water exporters and importers were carefully examined in relation to their vwc and wf results show that three of five sectors with high wtb also had high wf while the other two sectors had moderate wf two of them were water intensive and only one sector was among the bottom 5 in vwc for the importers the top 2 sectors had high vwc and wf respectively which explained their import activities the other three sectors shared the feature of low vwc and moderate wf economic scale and population were the common drivers to the increase of sectoral wf while the effects of technology efficiency and structure varied across sectors during different periods as for the major net exporters of virtual water in yunnan there are clear sectoral disparities in relation to their water intensities water footprints and driving factors first as the top virtual water exporter food manufacturing processing 3 was also among the top 5 sectors in vwc and wf indicating its importance and potential of water conservation from this study the finding that the major exporter was food manufacturing processing 3 rather than agriculture 1 implies higher economic benefits than direct export of crops in domestic trade second although contributing less than 2 to the total wf the sector of metal products 9 has been the largest virtual water exporter in yunnan since 2007 in 2005 yunnan government enacted an industrial development plan in order to double its industrial output in 2007 based on 2002 yunnan yearbook press 2006 third sectors in the tertiary industry such as commercial transportation 16 and other services 17 shared the characteristics of high wtb high wf and relatively low vwc however except for the common positive scale effect and population effect technology efficiency and structure have completely different effects fourth as the only sector with high wtb and vwc but moderate wf water electricity gas production supply 14 seems to be a good choice for export in that moderate wf level means low local impact whereas high vwc implies a comparative advantage finally the top 5 virtual water importers can be categorized into two categories the first category includes those sectors with low wtb low vwc and moderate wf such as sectors of machinery 10 transportation equipment manufacturing 11 and electrical electronic communication equipment 12 the second category includes those sectors with urgent needs for external water resource such as textile clothing 4 and construction 15 as the major virtual importer the sector of textile clothing 4 was also the second in terms of vwc which justifies the import activities as it would ease local water crisis by importing water intensive commodities as the second largest importer and the top wf sector construction sector 15 mitigated its impact on local water resource to some extent through import activities with the booming of construction sector 15 all the driving factors began to contribute to the further increase of this sector 4 3 policy implications 4 3 1 for global water management studies on water footprint and virtual water can provide valuable policy insights for preparing appropriate water management strategies particularly for developing countries where such studies are still few and water crises are increasing a comprehensive wf analysis can illustrate the flows of water resources by addressing production consumption and trade activities within the investigated region first it contributes to the development of regional wf accounts by quantifying vwc of domestic products and can facilitate the creation of a global wf database second it provides valuable information to local decision makers so that they can ensure local water security and social welfare by examining local industrial and trade structure technology level and social development third it can help quantify the environmental impacts of major sectors so that more suitable mitigation policies can be initiated in order to achieve these targets it is critical to build up an information platform with sufficient and accurate data and information from a global perspective it is necessary to build up a global wf database so that wf through the global supply chains can be presented to national leaders across the whole world with the trade globalization and increasing populations water dialogues between different countries becomes increasingly important so that potential conflicts can be avoided through rational adjustment of production and trade structure at the global level a round table is one feasible way to promote such a dialogue so that concerns from different stakeholders can be shared and addressed harmoniously in addition international cooperation is crucial so that more advanced water conservation technologies can be transferred from more developed countries to less developed regions 4 3 2 for less developed water rich regions following policy implications are raised based on the above results 4 3 2 1 first technology development and application should be further promoted although water saving technology can help reduce the overall wf further efforts should be made especially for those water intensive sectors take agriculture 1 as an example whose return on investment of research development r d is not satisfying due to a lack of scale production besides yunnan has various minorities with different production efficiencies such a reality determines that no one size fits all technology exists to wield the powerful tool of technology one needs to carefully examine the local conditions so that rational solutions can be found as for the case of yunnan it is apparent that commercial crop rather than subsistence crop is where researchers should put their technological efforts yunnan s unique climate and abundant precipitation have determined that such agricultural products are irreplaceable and thus competitive in the domestic trade market consequently more research funds should be allocated for supporting the related r d activities so that the yields of these commercial crop can be increased and simultaneously the corresponding wf can be reduced 4 3 2 2 second economic structure need to be optimized while economic efficiency should be improved the adjustment of economic structure has significantly decreased wf during the last decade however potential exists for further improvement on one hand during 2002 2012 the adjustment focused on secondary industry rather than tertiary industry in fact yunnan could have achieved far more economic benefits from tourism since it has become a major tourism destination the increasing visitors both at home and abroad posed increasing pressure on local ecosystem particularly its water resource therefore it is necessary for yunnan provincial government to initiate more efforts on guiding its tourism industries for their water conservation in terms of efficiency improvement innovative measures such as circular economy geng et al 2013 and industrial symbiosis geng et al 2009 should be further promoted circular economy presents opportunities to address problems of resource consumption and environmental degradation at the regional level while industrial symbiosis can create a win win situation for multiple stakeholders and lead to improved resource efficiency through byproducts exchanges water and energy cascading practically it would be ideal to retrofit all the industrial parks within yunnan into eco industrial parks so that more synergy opportunities can be identified leading to the overall eco efficiency improvement 4 3 2 3 third a more appropriate virtual water trade scheme need to be designed for water rich but less developed regions such as yunnan the following three types of sectors deserve special attentions first sectors with higher vwc but relatively low wf have comparative advantages and can be considered as the major virtual water export sectors second sectors with high wtb and wf are the current major exporters with heavy environmental burden their driving factors need to be further examined so that proper mitigation solutions can be identified third sectors with high vwc and wf should consider importing virtual water so that their impacts on local water pressure could be mitigated these implications can help provide valuable insights for local decision makers to reconsider their current trade patterns so that sustainable water management can be realized in yunnan for instance first yunnan should phase out the mass export of food manufacturing processing 3 and further expand the import of virtual water for construction 15 along with efforts to promote technology advance and to raise economic efficiency to adapt to its rapid development also yunnan should support the sector of wood processing furniture manufacturing 5 for virtual water export due to its low wf since this sector has clear comparative advantage in the virtual water trade market 5 conclusions the main conclusions of this study are listed as follows less developed water rich regions could be contributing more to the global water management through virtual water trade a comprehensive analysis of local water footprint can help design proper virtual water strategy leading to improved economic benefits without harming local water security yunnan was chosen as a case study to identify its water footprint characteristics and water sustainable pathway by combining both input output analysis and structural decomposition analysis methods results indicate that less developed water rich regions should optimize its industrial structure improve its resource efficiency apply more feasible water conservation technologies and adjust its trade patterns in order to achieve sustainable water management acknowledgements this study was sponsored by the major science and technology program for water pollution control and treatment 2017zx07202

19505,rapid industrialization and urbanization pose pressure on water resources in china virtual water trade proves to be an increasingly useful tool in water stress alleviation for water scarce regions while bringing opportunities and challenges for less developed water rich regions in this study yunnan a typical province in southwest china was selected as the case study area to explore its potential in socio economic development in the context of water sustainability both input output analysis and structural decomposition analysis on yunnan s water footprint for the period of 2002 2012 were performed at not only an aggregated level but also a sectoral level results show that although the virtual water content of all economic sectors decreased due to technological progress yunnan s total water footprint still increased as a result of economic scale expansion from the sectoral perspective sectors with large water footprints include construction sector agriculture sector food manufacturing processing sector and service sector while metal products sector and food manufacturing processing sector were the major virtual water exporters and textile clothing sector and construction sector were the major importers based on local conditions policy suggestions were proposed including economic structure and efficiency optimization technology promotion and appropriate virtual water trade scheme this study provides valuable insights for regions facing resource curse by exploring potential socio economic progress while ensuring water security graphical abstract image 1 keywords water footprint input output analysis structural decomposition analysis water management yunnan governance 1 introduction as a vital element in production and consumption water has become a major concern as the demand increases sharply during the rapid industrialization and urbanization process in china piao et al 2010 the spatial uneven distribution of available water resources and water demand further leads to severe water scarcity in china dalin et al 2014 more than 300 cities are already short of water and these shortages are intensifying khan et al 2009 in order to alleviate such water crises many large water engineering projects such as the famous south north water transfer project have been launched to fulfill the inflated productive water demands in water scarce regions hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 which were based upon huge investments with significant environmental impacts the concepts of virtual water vw water use in the whole production process of a product or service allan 1993 and water footprint wf total water use behind the products and services consumed within a specific region hoekstra et al 2009 were put forward to respond to water crises from perspectives of consumption and water management which encourage water deficit regions to alleviate their water crises by trading virtual water embedded in water intensive commodities these will set the foundation for water sustainability analysis and can provide solid evidences for policy makers to make rational decisions regarding water management several water footprint studies have been done during the recent years particularly as the leading virtual water exporter in global trade chen and chen 2013 and also the leading importer in international food trade dalin et al 2012 china has attracted extensive attention in relation to regional wf and domestic virtual water trade on various temporal spatial scales cai et al 2017 dong et al 2014 zhang and anadon 2014 zhao et al 2009 it is found that water deficit developed regions have been relying heavily on external water resources jiang et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 while china s virtual water trade patterns are inconsistent with the virtual water strategy in that water scarce regions are net virtual water exporters deng et al 2016 in addition feng et al 2014 investigated the virtual scarce water instead of the traditional volumetric virtual water to identify the sources and hotspots of water scarcity to date existing studies focus mainly on water scarce river basins yin et al 2016 zeng et al 2012 zhao et al 2010 and provinces dong et al 2013 wang et al 2014 but few studies have investigated the potential impact or challenges that virtual water trade may bring to those water rich regions especially for less developed water rich regions where socio economic progress is highly dependent on natural resources a low level of economic efficiency is the major obstacle to the promotion of virtual water strategy moreover the relatively low level of development dampens potential economic benefits and may even result in an unsustainable development mode therefore it is critical to perform a wf analysis so that the key driving forces can be identified for providing a comprehensive understanding of water consumption characteristics in such regions to fill such a gap this study aims to perform a water footprint analysis to assess water sustainability and virtual water trade benefit of yunnan province which is one of the top three water abundant regions in china but ranks bottom regarding its gross domestic production national bureau of statistics 2012 2016 although being one of china s most water rich regions yunnan contributed little to the mitigation of national water crisis through virtual water trade dong et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 zhang and anadon 2014 in the meantime rapid industrialization and urbanization have posed a threat on local water sustainability from methodological point of view both input output analysis and structural decomposition analysis sda methods are adopted to evaluate its water footprint and identify the corresponding driving forces so that policies on guiding water sustainability with the socio economic development of yunnan province can be drawn the remainder of this paper is organized as below the methodology about water footprint and driving force analysis and data sources are presented in section 2 section 3 provides the results of a detailed analysis of total and sectoral wf in yunnan followed by decomposition analysis results to quantify the contributions of various driving factors section 4 discusses policy implications based on these results finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methods and data sources 2 1 water footprint analysis both bottom up approach hoekstra and hung 2005 ma et al 2006 zhuo et al 2014 and top down approach deng et al 2016 dong et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 zhao et al 2009 are widely adopted to calculate wf of regions and inter regional trade the former is characterized by high precision owing to detailed information of virtual water content and the quantity of products or service however such a bottom up approach fails to address the inter connection of economic sectors and has relatively low data availability while the top down approach manifests its strengths on addressing these issues feng et al 2011 one typical top down approach is input output io analysis which can comprehensively analyze wf at a large spatial scale this study investigates yunnan s wf based upon an input output model dong et al 2013 which distinguishes between domestic supplies and imports for intermediate inputs 2 1 1 sectoral virtual water content in this study sectoral virtual water content vwc refers to the total water needed per monetary unit of final demand for this economic sector it is derived by multiplying the direct water intensity matrix with the leontief inverse matrix as shown in equations 1 3 1 vwc dwi i a d 1 2 a d i m ˆ a 3 m i m i x i m i where a d represents the direct input coefficient matrix for domestically produced products and services a represents the direct input coefficient matrix for the original io table i is an identity matrix x i is the gross output of sector i m i is the import coefficient of sector i and m ˆ is the diagonal matrix of the import coefficient vector the direct water intensity dwi is the direct water consumption per monetary gross output it can be calculated by using equation 4 4 dwi d w i j d w i j w j x j where w j is the direct water consumption of sector j and d w i j is the direct water intensity of sector j the indirect water intensity iwi is the water consumption per gross output caused by use of other sectors products and or services it can be obtained by subtracting direct water intensity from the vwc as shown in equation 5 5 iwi vwc dwi 2 1 2 regional water footprint generally regional water footprint wf consists of an internal water footprint iwf and an external water footprint ewf as shown in equation 6 6 wf iwf ewf the internal water footprint iwf is defined as the use of domestic water resources to produce goods and services consumed by the population in the studied region the calculation of the internal water footprint is shown in equation 7 7 iwf i w f j i w f j v w c j f j d where i w f j represents the internal water footprint of sector j v w c j represents the virtual water content of sector j f j d represents the domestic consumption of domestically produced products and services of sector j the external water footprint ewf is defined as the volume of water resources used in other regions to produce goods and services consumed by the population in the studied region the external water footprint can be further divided by different imports 8 ewf ew f f ew f in 9 ewf j f v w c j m j f 10 e w f j i n i v w c i m i j v j where e w f f is directly for domestic final consumption while e w f i n is for domestic intermediate inputs to exclude those imports later exported an adjustment coefficient v j is introduced m j d represents the imports in sector j for domestic final consumption m i j represents the imports for intermediate use from foreign sector i to domestic sector j 2 1 3 water trade balance to further investigate virtual water embodied in trade the indicator of water trade balance wtb is introduced which is the difference between the export and import virtual water volume a positive wtb means this region is a net virtual water exporter while a negative one means that the region is a net importer 11 wtb e ewf 12 e e j e j v w c j e j d where e represents water footprint of exports that are domestically produced e j d represents domestic produced exports in sector j 2 2 structural decomposition analysis to identify the driving factors of regional wf in the io framework structural decomposition analysis sda is applied as a useful tool to examine production structure and final demand hoekstra and van der bergh 2003 sda has been extensively applied to investigate determinants of environmental variables such as energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions guan et al 2008 peters et al 2007 it incorporates the entire economic system into this analysis as the input output tables contain all the sectoral information and their inter relationships sda has its advantages in analyzing detailed industrial sectoral emissions but requires a complete input output table with the increasing availability of input output tables in different regions sda has also been applied in wf research for instance roson and satori roson and sartori 2015 employed sda to investigate underlying causes of the evolution of global wf wang et al 2016 found that technology and economic structure effect can mitigate wf increase while economic scale and consumption level can offset water conservation similar studies are also performed at a river basin zhi et al 2014 or city yang et al 2015 level structural decomposition analysis can be conducted based on either the base year or the end year in this study the average of two polar decompositions is adopted following previous studies mi et al 2017 wang et al 2016 changes of yunnan s wf during 2002 2012 are decomposed into technology effect t efficiency effect e structural effect st scale effect sc and population effect p as shown in equations 13 and 14 13 wf dwi l y y t o t a l y t o t a l p p t e st s c p 14 δ wf δ t δ e δ st δ s c δ p technology effect represents the influence of change in direct water intensity as shown in equation 15 15 t dwi d w i j efficiency effect reflects the influence of the interdependence of economic sectors i e the leontief inverse matrix as shown in equation 16 16 e l i a d 1 b i j where b i j represents the domestic input from sector i for per monetary unit of final demand in sector j structural effect denotes the impact of sectoral distribution of final demand as shown in equation 17 17 st y y t o t a l y j y t o t a l where y j represents final demand of sector j and y t o t a l represents total final demand scale effect refers to the influence of growth of per capita final demand as shown in equation 18 18 s c y t o t a l p where p is the total population in the case area finally population effect depicts the impact of population growth in yunnan and is represented as p 2 3 data sources and treatment 2 3 1 io data the input output data were obtained from 2002 2007 2010 and 2012 yunnan io tables io tables of yunnan province are compiled by the bureau of yunnan statistics every 5 years and the 2010 io table is the extended and most recent io table they are aggregated into 17 sectors to comply with water withdrawal data by sector see table 1 2 3 2 water withdrawal data water withdrawals of primary agriculture secondary manufacturing and construction and tertiary industry service are obtained from yunnan water resources bulletin yunnan water conservation bureau 2003 2008 2011 2013 in this study only blue water withdrawals are included green water is not included because it is usually not subject to competitive use for each sector in secondary industry except construction water withdrawals are obtained from yunnan energy statistical yearbook yunnan statistics bureau 2016a due to data availability sectoral water withdrawals in 2002 are estimated based on sector added values and water withdrawal data from 2004 yunnan economic census yearbook yunnan statistics bureau 2007 water withdrawals of construction sector are calculated by subtracting water withdrawals of other sectors from that of the total secondary industry water withdrawals of sectors in tertiary industry are estimated based on sector added value ratios with the references of 2004 and 2008 yunnan economic census yearbooks yunnan statistics bureau 2007 2011 2 4 case study area in this study yunnan province was chosen as the case study region it is located in the far southwest of china 97 31 106 11 e 21 08 29 15 n bordering chinese provinces guangxi guizhou sichuan and tibet and the countries vietnam laos and myanmar fig 1 it is a mountainous area with the highest elevation about 6 74 km the total area of yunnan is 394 000 km2 with a population of 47 71 million in 2016 yunnan statistics bureau 2016b it is well known for a high level of ethnic diversity for example 25 of 55 chinese minorities can be found in yunnan yunnan is rich in natural resources including mineral deposits biodiversity water etc regarding water resources yunnan has ample rainfall with many lakes and rivers per capita water resources in yunnan exceeds 3000 m3 which is roughly twice the average in the country national bureau of statistics 2016 however the severe drought in 2010 indicates that yunnan is facing water challenges in aspects of uneven distribution of water resources lacking water conservancy projects and water quality degradation the pillar industries in yunnan province include crop production tobacco mining hydropower and tourism all of which largely depend on its local natural resources however the rich resources endowment does not transform into economic benefits yunnan remains one of china s less developed provinces in the 13th five year plan 2016 2020 yunnan aims to move toward sustainable development in the context of resource constraints local government has implemented several projects in infrastructure development and environment conservation such as the development of yunnan s water safety network the implementation of the strictest water resources control system and national protection projects for erhai lake and dianchi lake 3 results 3 1 sectoral virtual water contents fig 2 illustrates the virtual water contents of different economic sectors in yunnan in 2002 2007 2010 and 2012 during the studied period agriculture sector 1 had the highest vwc and higher dwi than iwi sector of water electricity gas production and supply 14 also had higher dwi compared to iwi other sectors shared the feature of higher iwi than dwi among all other sectors with higher iwi than dwi food manufacturing processing 3 textile clothing 4 and wood processing furniture manufacturing 5 were the top 3 sectors in terms of vwc as for the changes in water intensities vwc of all sectors decreased substantially 65 87 during 2002 2012 as a result of sharp decrease in both dwi and iwi the only exception was the sector of other services 17 whose dwi increased by 155 except for sectors of other manufacturing 13 and construction 15 whose dwi decreased by 15 and 47 respectively the decrease of dwi of other sectors all exceeded 50 the sectors with the most significant decreases in both vwc and dwi include mining 2 machinery 10 and transportation equipment manufacturing 11 all exceeding 80 for sub period vwc changes vwc and dwi of most sectors experienced a significant decrease trend during 2002 2007 indicating the improvement of water use efficiency sectors with the most prominent decreases include mining 2 nonmetallic mineral products 8 and machinery 10 however vwc of textile and clothing 4 and dwi of textile and clothing 4 other manufacturing 13 and other services 17 increased during 2007 2010 and 2010 2012 vwc and dwi of most sectors decreased slightly sectors with dwi increases include nonmetallic mineral products 8 and commercial transportation 16 during 2007 2010 and other manufacturing 13 and other services 17 during 2010 2012 3 2 regional water footprints the total wf of yunnan experienced a steady increase from 37 30 billion m3 in 2002 to 51 52 billion m3 in 2010 followed by a slight decrease to 50 02 billion m3 in 2012 fig 3 illustrates the structures of aggregated and sectoral yunnan wf in 2002 2007 2010 and 2012 internal wf of yunnan dropped from 96 07 in 2002 to 93 30 in 2012 while external wf for domestic consumption and intermediate use increased from 2 29 to 1 64 in 2002 to 4 40 and 2 29 in 2012 respectively from the perspective of three industries the wf of secondary industry experienced a dramatic increase during 2002 2012 its wf rose from 44 43 in 2002 to 54 82 in 2010 and remained around 54 in 2012 the wf of tertiary industry 16 17 increased slightly from 31 51 in 2002 to 34 33 in 2012 while the wf of primary industry 1 decreased from 24 06 in 2002 to 11 73 in 2012 sectors with large wf remained the same over the years including construction 15 other services 17 agriculture 1 food manufacturing processing 3 and commercial transportation 16 these five sectors contributed to more than 85 of the total wf of yunnan during the four years the wf of construction 15 whose wf was the highest amongst all the sectors increased from 11 05 billion m3 29 75 in 2002 to 19 04 billion m3 38 05 in 2012 the wf of other services 17 and commercial transportation 16 increased from 9 66 billion m3 25 88 and 2 10 billion m3 5 63 in 2002 to 13 07 billion m3 26 12 and 4 11 billion m3 8 21 in 2012 respectively while the wf of agriculture 1 kept decreasing that of food manufacturing processing 3 fluctuated between 2 53 billion m3 5 87 in 2007 and 4 78 billion m3 9 28 in 2010 3 3 water trade balances wtb yunnan is a virtual water exporter the total wtb of yunnan fluctuated from time to time it rose from 10 87 billion m3 in 2002 to 23 35 billion m3 in 2007 followed by a decrease to 15 84 billion m3 in 2010 and rebounded to 17 55 billion m3 in 2012 main sectors exporting virtual water in the decade include food manufacturing processing 3 metal products 9 commercial transportation 16 other services 17 and water electricity gas production supply 14 major virtual water importers include textile clothing 4 construction 15 machinery 10 transportation equipment manufacturing 11 and electrical electronic communication equipment 12 agriculture sector 1 imported 0 16 billion m3 in 2002 and 0 26 billion m3 in 2010 while exported 0 81 billion m3 in 2007 and 2 04 billion m3 in 2012 although food manufacturing processing 3 was the largest exporter on average its wtb kept decreasing from 7 72 billion m3 in 2002 to 4 89 billion m3 in 2012 less than that of the sector of metal products 9 in 2012 5 53 billion m3 the wtb of the latter sector increased sharply from 2002 0 86 billion m3 to 2007 10 58 billion m3 and has become the major virtual water exporter since then although its wtb decreased during 2007 2012 for tertiary industry wtb of commercial transportation 16 and other services 17 steadily increased from 1 14 billion m3 and 0 34 billion m3 in 2002 to 1 87 billion m3 and 2 52 billion m3 in 2012 sectors including textile clothing 4 wood processing furniture manufacturing 5 transportation equipment manufacturing 11 electrical electronic communication equipment 12 which once were virtual water exporters in 2002 became importers later on the contrary the sector of machinery 10 which was once a virtual water importer became an export sector in 2012 fig 4 shows total and sectoral water trade balances in yunnan for the period of 2002 2012 3 4 driving forces analysis to uncover the contribution of various factors to the changes of water footprints in yunnan during different periods a decomposition analysis was carried out at both the aggregated and sectoral levels five factors including technology efficiency structural scale and population are considered and investigated as demonstrated in fig 5 on the aggregated level economic structure and technology were the two major factors contributing to the reduction of water footprints while gross economic scale was the major factor contributing to the increase of water footprints during 2002 2012 although the effect of economic structure had the largest negative effect on twf increase during 2002 2012 it is noteworthy that during 2007 2010 this effect was much smaller than the effect of technology and during 2010 2012 it became a positive factor efficiency effect and population effect were minor and negligible however such driving effects were particularly obvious in the early years 2002 2007 but became smaller and smaller in recent years 2007 2012 during 2002 2007 scale effect and technology effect were 77 75 and 29 49 compared to wf in 2002 later they became less determinant being 17 85 and 17 62 during 2007 2010 and 15 53 and 11 06 during 2010 2012 to further uncover the characteristics of driving factors at a sectoral level the top 5 and bottom 5 sectors in vwc wf and wtb were compared in fig 6 a f for the ease of analysis we took the logarithm of the absolute number of various effects in the unit of m3 while kept the original signs as all the absolute numbers exceeded 1 m3 and no logarithm was negative for the top 5 sectors in vwc as illustrated in fig 6 a economic scale effect and population effect were the major positive driving factors while technology was the negative effect during 2002 2012 further investigation shows that during each period for every sector scale effect and population effect remain positive technology effect was negative for most sectors with the exception of textile clothing 4 and wood processing furniture manufacturing 5 for the period of 2002 2007 economic efficiency effect offset the wf increase of the top 2 sectors namely agriculture 1 and textile clothing 4 it was positive for agriculture 1 and negative for the other four sectors during 2002 2007 but reversed during 2010 2012 economic structure effect contributed to the wf of textile clothing 4 and wood processing furniture manufacturing 5 positively and that of other three sectors negatively for the bottom 5 sectors in vwc as illustrated in fig 6 b technology effect and efficiency effect were negative while structure effect and population effect were the major positive factors for most of the 5 sectors all the effects on other manufacturing 13 the sector with lowest vwc were relatively small as for sub periods population effect was positive for all sectors during all the sub periods the scale effect of the sector electrical electronic communication equipment 12 during 2002 2007 was the only negative one among all sectors and sub periods efficiency effect was mainly negative for these five sectors structural effect changed from a positive factor during 2002 2007 to a negative one during 2010 2012 unlike the top 5 sectors in vwc technology effect was not a constant wf reduction factor for the bottom 4 sectors especially during 2010 2012 technology effect of the bottom 3 sectors led to the increase of their wf for the top 5 sectors in wf as illustrated in fig 6 c similar to the top 5 in vwc economic scale effect and population effect were the major positive driving factors these two factors contributed to the growth of sectoral wf during all the periods economic structure effect became an increasingly major positive driving factor for the top 3 sectors as shown during 2010 2012 however the top 2 sectors construction 15 and other services 17 presented positive technology effect during 2010 2012 which was adverse to wf reduction it was noteworthy that during 2010 2012 all the driving factors for the sector of construction 15 were positive for the bottom 5 sectors in wf as illustrated in fig 6 d structural effect was the only common positive driving factor while technology effect was the major negative one during 2002 2012 unlike the top 5 sectors in wf economic scale effect and population effect offset the wf increase during 2002 2012 except for the sector of wood processing furniture manufacturing 5 however during 2007 2010 and during 2010 2012 these two effects were positive for all five sectors although being a negative factor as a whole technology effect was positive for all sectors during 2002 2007 the efficiency effect for sectors of mining 2 and wood processing furniture manufacturing 5 was positive while that of other three sectors was negative during 2002 2012 it was mainly negative during 2002 2007 and positive during 2007 2010 but became varied during 2010 2012 for the top 5 in wtb i e the net virtual water exporters as illustrated in fig 6 e similar to the other two categories of top 5 sectors economic scale effect and population effect were the major driving factors of wf increase while technology was the major negative effect the former two factors contributed to the growth of sectoral wf during all the periods in all five sectors structural effect was mainly a positive factor during 2002 2012 but an incredibly negative one during 2007 2010 and during 2010 2012 efficiency effect was positive for the sectors of food manufacturing processing 3 and other services 17 and negative for the other three sectors during 2002 2012 a further examination shows that it was mostly negative during 2002 2007 and reversed during 2007 2010 during 2010 2012 the efficiency effect of food manufacturing processing 3 other services 17 and water electricity gas production supply 14 were positive for the bottom 5 in wtb or the net virtual water importers as illustrated in fig 6 f economic structure effect and population effect were the major positive factors while technology effect and efficiency effect were the major negative factors during 2002 2012 as for the scale effect it contributed to the wf increase of the top three sectors and the wf decrease of the other two sectors however during 2010 2012 scale effect population effect and efficiency effect all contributed to the wf increase while wf mitigation was due to technology effect and structure effect of three manufacturing sectors including machinery 10 transportation equipment manufacturing 11 and electrical electronic communication equipment 12 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of aggregated water footprint in yunnan as one of the most water rich chinese regions yunnan could meet with its local demand mainly with its internal water resource however with the progress of industrialization and urbanization a growing amount of external water has been imported for domestic consumption and intermediate use it is noteworthy that yunnan had the highest wtb in 2007 despite the wf in the same year being much less than that in 2010 or 2012 one possible reason was the severe drought since 2010 inducing the increasing domestic water demand and decreasing export in the context of water supply deficit rational strategies include efforts to reduce water intensity or to develop less water intensive industries which is also reflected in the driving factors analysis that found economic structure shift and technology advance to be the major effects of wf reduction 4 2 characteristics of sectoral water footprints in yunnan at the sectoral level major virtual water exporters and importers were carefully examined in relation to their vwc and wf results show that three of five sectors with high wtb also had high wf while the other two sectors had moderate wf two of them were water intensive and only one sector was among the bottom 5 in vwc for the importers the top 2 sectors had high vwc and wf respectively which explained their import activities the other three sectors shared the feature of low vwc and moderate wf economic scale and population were the common drivers to the increase of sectoral wf while the effects of technology efficiency and structure varied across sectors during different periods as for the major net exporters of virtual water in yunnan there are clear sectoral disparities in relation to their water intensities water footprints and driving factors first as the top virtual water exporter food manufacturing processing 3 was also among the top 5 sectors in vwc and wf indicating its importance and potential of water conservation from this study the finding that the major exporter was food manufacturing processing 3 rather than agriculture 1 implies higher economic benefits than direct export of crops in domestic trade second although contributing less than 2 to the total wf the sector of metal products 9 has been the largest virtual water exporter in yunnan since 2007 in 2005 yunnan government enacted an industrial development plan in order to double its industrial output in 2007 based on 2002 yunnan yearbook press 2006 third sectors in the tertiary industry such as commercial transportation 16 and other services 17 shared the characteristics of high wtb high wf and relatively low vwc however except for the common positive scale effect and population effect technology efficiency and structure have completely different effects fourth as the only sector with high wtb and vwc but moderate wf water electricity gas production supply 14 seems to be a good choice for export in that moderate wf level means low local impact whereas high vwc implies a comparative advantage finally the top 5 virtual water importers can be categorized into two categories the first category includes those sectors with low wtb low vwc and moderate wf such as sectors of machinery 10 transportation equipment manufacturing 11 and electrical electronic communication equipment 12 the second category includes those sectors with urgent needs for external water resource such as textile clothing 4 and construction 15 as the major virtual importer the sector of textile clothing 4 was also the second in terms of vwc which justifies the import activities as it would ease local water crisis by importing water intensive commodities as the second largest importer and the top wf sector construction sector 15 mitigated its impact on local water resource to some extent through import activities with the booming of construction sector 15 all the driving factors began to contribute to the further increase of this sector 4 3 policy implications 4 3 1 for global water management studies on water footprint and virtual water can provide valuable policy insights for preparing appropriate water management strategies particularly for developing countries where such studies are still few and water crises are increasing a comprehensive wf analysis can illustrate the flows of water resources by addressing production consumption and trade activities within the investigated region first it contributes to the development of regional wf accounts by quantifying vwc of domestic products and can facilitate the creation of a global wf database second it provides valuable information to local decision makers so that they can ensure local water security and social welfare by examining local industrial and trade structure technology level and social development third it can help quantify the environmental impacts of major sectors so that more suitable mitigation policies can be initiated in order to achieve these targets it is critical to build up an information platform with sufficient and accurate data and information from a global perspective it is necessary to build up a global wf database so that wf through the global supply chains can be presented to national leaders across the whole world with the trade globalization and increasing populations water dialogues between different countries becomes increasingly important so that potential conflicts can be avoided through rational adjustment of production and trade structure at the global level a round table is one feasible way to promote such a dialogue so that concerns from different stakeholders can be shared and addressed harmoniously in addition international cooperation is crucial so that more advanced water conservation technologies can be transferred from more developed countries to less developed regions 4 3 2 for less developed water rich regions following policy implications are raised based on the above results 4 3 2 1 first technology development and application should be further promoted although water saving technology can help reduce the overall wf further efforts should be made especially for those water intensive sectors take agriculture 1 as an example whose return on investment of research development r d is not satisfying due to a lack of scale production besides yunnan has various minorities with different production efficiencies such a reality determines that no one size fits all technology exists to wield the powerful tool of technology one needs to carefully examine the local conditions so that rational solutions can be found as for the case of yunnan it is apparent that commercial crop rather than subsistence crop is where researchers should put their technological efforts yunnan s unique climate and abundant precipitation have determined that such agricultural products are irreplaceable and thus competitive in the domestic trade market consequently more research funds should be allocated for supporting the related r d activities so that the yields of these commercial crop can be increased and simultaneously the corresponding wf can be reduced 4 3 2 2 second economic structure need to be optimized while economic efficiency should be improved the adjustment of economic structure has significantly decreased wf during the last decade however potential exists for further improvement on one hand during 2002 2012 the adjustment focused on secondary industry rather than tertiary industry in fact yunnan could have achieved far more economic benefits from tourism since it has become a major tourism destination the increasing visitors both at home and abroad posed increasing pressure on local ecosystem particularly its water resource therefore it is necessary for yunnan provincial government to initiate more efforts on guiding its tourism industries for their water conservation in terms of efficiency improvement innovative measures such as circular economy geng et al 2013 and industrial symbiosis geng et al 2009 should be further promoted circular economy presents opportunities to address problems of resource consumption and environmental degradation at the regional level while industrial symbiosis can create a win win situation for multiple stakeholders and lead to improved resource efficiency through byproducts exchanges water and energy cascading practically it would be ideal to retrofit all the industrial parks within yunnan into eco industrial parks so that more synergy opportunities can be identified leading to the overall eco efficiency improvement 4 3 2 3 third a more appropriate virtual water trade scheme need to be designed for water rich but less developed regions such as yunnan the following three types of sectors deserve special attentions first sectors with higher vwc but relatively low wf have comparative advantages and can be considered as the major virtual water export sectors second sectors with high wtb and wf are the current major exporters with heavy environmental burden their driving factors need to be further examined so that proper mitigation solutions can be identified third sectors with high vwc and wf should consider importing virtual water so that their impacts on local water pressure could be mitigated these implications can help provide valuable insights for local decision makers to reconsider their current trade patterns so that sustainable water management can be realized in yunnan for instance first yunnan should phase out the mass export of food manufacturing processing 3 and further expand the import of virtual water for construction 15 along with efforts to promote technology advance and to raise economic efficiency to adapt to its rapid development also yunnan should support the sector of wood processing furniture manufacturing 5 for virtual water export due to its low wf since this sector has clear comparative advantage in the virtual water trade market 5 conclusions the main conclusions of this study are listed as follows less developed water rich regions could be contributing more to the global water management through virtual water trade a comprehensive analysis of local water footprint can help design proper virtual water strategy leading to improved economic benefits without harming local water security yunnan was chosen as a case study to identify its water footprint characteristics and water sustainable pathway by combining both input output analysis and structural decomposition analysis methods results indicate that less developed water rich regions should optimize its industrial structure improve its resource efficiency apply more feasible water conservation technologies and adjust its trade patterns in order to achieve sustainable water management acknowledgements this study was sponsored by the major science and technology program for water pollution control and treatment 2017zx07202

19506,the aims of this study are to evaluate under visible light conditions the ability of h2o2 and tio2 to produce oh their quantitative impacts on the cell integrity of microcystis and the subsequent release and degradation of microcystins mcs a sequential reaction model was developed including one sub model to simulate the rupture kinetics for cell integrity of microcystis and another to describe the release and degradation of mcs for cell rupture the dual oxidant delayed chick watson model dcwm and dual oxidant hom model hm were first proposed and developed giving excellent simulation results of cell rupture kinetics kinetic rate constants between microcystis cells and h2o2 k h 2 o 2 cell as well as oh k oh cell under visible light successfully separated the individual effects of h2o2 and oh on microcystis the dual oxidant models were further validated with additional experiments making the models more convincing finally the dual oxidant cell rupture models were integrated with the mc degradation model and well predicted the observed mcs concentrations in the experimental systems the results of this study not only demonstrate the potential application of h2o2 and tio2 for the control of cyanobacteria and metabolites in natural water bodies but also provide a new methodology to differentiate the individual contributions of the two oxidants h2o2 and oh on cell rupture thus giving a novel way to more precisely determine the effective doses of applied oxidants for cyanobacteria control graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrogen peroxide microcystis microcystins titanium dioxide visible light dual oxidant kinetic model 1 introduction eutrophication in natural water bodies has become a critical issue due to its potential risk to human health and ecology excessive phosphorus and nitrogen inputs are believed to be the main reasons for cyanobacteria overgrowth and harmful cyanobacteria blooms cheung et al 2013 smith et al 1999 the high concentrations of cyanobacteria inevitably produce more cyanobacterial metabolites including toxins and taste and odor t o compounds thus increasing the burden and risk of drinking water supplies cheung et al 2013 various methods have been developed to control cyanobacteria in water such as physical chemical or biological treatments among these chemical oxidation has been widely applied and this utilizes oxidants such as chlorine chlorine dioxide and permanganate to remove algae fan et al 2016 li et al 2014 lin et al 2009 sharma et al 2012 although these conventional oxidants may inhibit the growth of cyanobacteria and destroy the cells they cannot effectively oxidize the released cyanotoxins and t o compounds after rupturing the cells thus increasing the risk to the water supply westrick et al 2010 advanced oxidation processes aops which involve highly reactive hydroxyl radical oh are considered to be an alternative method for the control of cyanobacteria in water as this approach has the capability to both rupture cyanobacteria cells and destroy the associated cyanotoxins and t o compounds sharma et al 2012 westrick et al 2010 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 an aop chemical when used with the support of ultra violet uv light is considered as an environmentally benign algaecide as it decomposes to water and oxygen hobson et al 2012 this chemical has been tested for suppressing cyanobacteria in one lake matthijs et al 2012 and dinoflagellates in one creek burson et al 2014 in the netherlands one lake in china wang et al 2012 and one wastewater stabilization pond in australia barrington et al 2011 in the field study carried out in the netherlands cyanobacteria dominated by planktothrix agardhii were selectively eliminated within a few days in the studied shallow lake lake koetshuis while other plankton and macrofauna remained unaffected although field applications of h2o2 have been shown to successfully suppress the growth of cyanobacteria in natural water bodies only one study has attempted to model the process kinetics of cell rupture and subsequent metabolite degradation huo et al 2015 in huo et al 2015 the kinetics of cell rupture and the subsequent release and degradation of cyanotoxin microcystin were modeled for cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa under h2o2 and light conditions although the model successfully predicted the change in concentration of mcs using independently measured parameters the impacts of h2o2 and oh were not well characterized although oh is known to be generated from h2o2 decomposition under the irradiation of uv light the efficiency of oh production is very low in natural environmental where uv light only accounts for 5 of the natural sunlight spectrum this will limit the applications of h2o2 when oh is a more desirable oxidant bolton and cater 1994 krishnan et al 2017 therefore it is of great interest to enhance the production of oh from h2o2 under visible light which accounts for 40 50 of the sunlight spectrum previous studies have shown that the combination of tio2 and h2o2 is promising to produce oh under visible light irradiation kang 2017 li et al 2001 rao and chu 2009 2010 it is noted that tio2 is an important photocatalyst material for producing oh modification of this material such as by doping with fe improves its ability to absorb the light with longer wavelength but potentially impair its photocatalytic reactivity under uv irradiation lin et al 2006 in comparison the combination of tio2 and h2o2 can not only utilize visible light to produce oh but also has higher photocatalytic activity under uv light irradiation dixit et al 2010 therefore the combined application of tio2 and h2o2 has the potential to maximize the energy utilization of sunlight in natural water bodies in a study of indigenous antibiotic resistant bacteria arb inactivation fiorentino et al 2015 simultaneous application of h2o2 and tio2 under sunlight was found to be more effective than h2o2 or tio2 alone and solar photo fenton treatment a similar observation was also reported for the inactivation of bacillus subtilis under sunlight irradiation witowitaya et al 2014 although studies have reported that visible light h2o2 tio2 or oh may affect the activity of microorganisms or cyanobacteria cho and yoon 2008 dalai et al 2012 2013 drábková et al 2007 rinalducci et al 2008 the combined effects of tio2 and h2o2 on the cell integrity of cyanobacteria have never been studied in particular models to quantitatively describe the individual and combined impacts of the two oxidants in the tio2 and h2o2 systems oh and h2o2 on the cell integrity of cyanobacteria and the release and degradation of cyanotoxins have never been reported in the literature therefore it remains a strong need to develop models to quantify the individual and combined impacts of h2o2 and oh on the cell integrity and toxin release and degradation and based on the models measures involving both oxidants for cyanobacteria control can be better evaluated the main objectives of this study are as follows 1 to evaluate oh production in a system of tio2 and or h2o2 under visible light irradiation 2 to understand the effects of tio2 h2o2 oh and visible light on a model cyanobacterium species m aeruginosa by detecting the cell integrity and release and degradation of mcs 3 to develop dual oxidant kinetic models to differentiate and quantify the effects of h2o2 and oh on cell integrity under visible light 2 material and methods 2 1 cell culture and counting m aeruginosa pcc 7820 was used as a toxic strain in this study the cell culture and counting procedure followed the process outlined in huo et al 2015 2 2 photocatalytic oxidation experiments in the photocatalytic oxidation batch system visible light was provided by simulated solar light suntest cps 1500 w air cooled xenon lamp atlas inc u s equipped with a uv 400 nm cut off filter detailed confirmation of the light spectrum and intensity are shown in the si section s1 before the oxidation experiment a predetermined amount of tio2 powder p25 tio2 80 anatase and 20 rutile uniregion bio tech u s was placed into a 0 5 l glass beaker pyrex germany filled with asm 1 medium rippka 1988 and sonicated for 10 15 min to ensure that tio2 powder was well dispersed the mixture was subsequently amended with a calculated amount of h2o2 stock solution 1000 mg l 1 prepared from 30 w h2o2 sigma aldrich u s 4 chlorobenzoic acid pcba probe for oh determination and cyanobacterial cells the content was mixed with a magnetic stir bar and the exposure to light was minimized during the mixing a uv cut off filter was placed on top of the reactor and the reaction started as soon as the simulated solar light was turned on concentrations of h2o2 tio2 and cells were set as 0 5 mg l 1 20 mg l 1 and 50 000 cells ml 1 respectively samples were taken at different time intervals to measure cell numbers cell integrity h2o2 pcba and mcs concentration the preservation of samples for different analysis is described in the si section s2 2 3 sample analysis analysis of h2o2 was based on a method reported by sellers 1980 the concentration of pcba was determined by a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc interpretation of pcba degradation and extraction of oh information followed a method developed by elovitz and von gunten 1999 during the oxidation process a portion of microcystis cells were found either ruptured or disappeared calculation of cell integrity considered both cell rupture percentage and cell number reduction percentage determined by flow cytometry and optical microscope respectively a direct competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kit elisa kit was used for the mcs analysis detailed procedures for sample analysis can be found in the si sections s3 s4 2 4 kinetic modeling change of cell integrity over time exhibited an initial lag phase shoulder behavior in h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems indicating possible oxidation resistance mechanism of the cells cho et al 2003 dalrymple et al 2010 haas et al 1995 marugán et al 2008 to elucidate the relationships among cell integrity oxidant concentration and reaction time two disinfection models the delayed chick watson model dcwm and hom model hm were chosen for their ability to simulate the shoulder lag behavior of cell integrity measured in this study in dcwm inactivation of cells is divided into two phases with an initial lag phase exhibiting no loss of cell integrity followed by a second phase where the first order kinetics equation was applied to cell integrity decay cho et al 2003 2004 sivaganesan et al 2006 1 ln n n 0 0 f o r t t lag k c ct ct lag f o r t t lag where n0 is the initial cell concentration cells ml 1 n is the cell concentration at time t cells ml 1 k c is the cell rupture rate constant m 1 min 1 t lag is lag phase time min and c is disinfectant concentration m in hm two empirical parameters m and n are introduced to describe cell inactivation that deviates from the classical log linear behavior cho et al 2003 dalrymple et al 2010 haas et al 1995 marugán et al 2008 2 ln n n 0 k h c n t m where kh is the cell rupture rate constant m n min m for the case m 1 eq 2 is simplified to the chick watson equation for m 1 the model presents a shoulder at the beginning of the reaction for m 1 the equation allows the fitting of a tail towards the end of the reaction in batch reaction systems it is common that disinfectant concentration decreases with time as the disinfectant is consumed by cells and other constituents in the medium to account for the time dependence of disinfectant concentration in hm the decay of the disinfectant is described by the following first order rate law 3 c c 0 exp k t where k is the first order decay constant of the disinfectant and c0 is the initial disinfectant concentration by combining eq 3 with eq 2 a modified form of hm was achieved haas et al 1995 4 ln n n 0 m nk m k h c 0 n 1 exp nk t m m the optimal values of model parameters such as k c and ct lag in dcwm and k h and m in hm n set to 1 were obtained by minimizing the error sum of squares ess with the solver function in microsoft excel 2013 ess was defined as the sum of the squares of the difference between the natural logarithm of the predicted cell integrity and the natural logarithm of the observed cell integrity 5 ess ln n i n 0 ln ni n 0 2 where n i n 0 is the observed cell integrity and n i n 0 is the predicted cell integrity kinetic models for simulating mcs concentrations were developed following a concept proposed in the literature huo et al 2015 that integrates a cell rupture kinetic model with an mcs degradation model it was assumed that mcs are released into the water immediately after cell rupture as suggested in huo et al 2015 details of the model development will be discussed in section 3 3 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 production of hydroxyl radical oh the hydroxyl radical is a critical species in aops in addition to h2o2 and tio2 which are the focus of this study two other factors that potentially influence the production of oh were also evaluated namely visible light and fe3 the concentration of oh can vary with reaction time fig s1 the time averaged concentration of oh was calculated and compared across different systems and conditions fig 1 a as shown in fig 1a no oh production was observed in the cell suspension under visible light the same observation was also found in the tio2 system with or without visible light in contrast oh was detected in h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems in the dark at a concentration of 1 27 1 62 10 15 m a fenton like reaction between h2o2 and fe3 a component of asm 1 medium is believed to be the main mechanism of oh production in this case several studies have indicated the significance of fenton like reactions in acidic environments due to increasing solubility of fe3 de laat and gallard 1999 jung et al 2009 although the asm 1 medium in this study is circum neutral ph 7 6 7 8 edta in the medium reacts with fe3 to produce a stable edta fe3 complex which improves the solubility of fe3 and promotes a fenton like reaction li et al 2012 visible light substantially enhances oh production in both h2o2 only and h2o2 tio2 systems since the low molar absorptivity of h2o2 at the wavelength of visible light miles 2013 minimizes the direct photolysis of h2o2 a photo fenton reaction is most likely responsible for the increased oh concentration the effect of h2o2 on the production of oh under visible light was investigated by varying the initial h2o2 concentration 0 5 mg l 1 fig 1a the results showed that oh production increased with h2o2 concentration within the tested range in h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems a comparison between these two systems demonstrated that the addition of tio2 enhanced oh production especially in the presence of visible light about a two fold increase in the average oh concentration was achieved for both h2o2 doses 2 5 and 5 mg l 1 after tio2 was added the detailed mechanism for h2o2 interacting with tio2 under visible light is that titanium peroxide complexes form on the surface of tio2 upon contacting h2o2 in water shifting the adsorption spectrum of tio2 to longer wavelengths subsequently the visible light applied in this study induces an electronic transition from surface complexes to the conduction band of tio2 with the generation of oh li et al 2001 rao and chu 2010 understanding the role of fe3 in oh production in h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems under visible light is important to identify the oh production pathway and recognize potential contributing factors during the evaluation of these systems for this purpose two experiments were designed the first compared oh production between asm 1 medium containing 0 22 mg l 1 fe3 and asm 1 medium without fe3 fig 1b in the absence of fe3 h2o2 alone was not able to produce oh under visible light in contrast a small amount of oh around 5 10 16 m was detected in the h2o2 tio2 system suggesting a oh production pathway resulting from the interaction between h2o2 and tio2 under visible light as discussed above in the presence of fe3 oh production was significantly enhanced in both h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems even though the fe3 concentration was relatively low 0 22 mg l 1 in the second experiment asm 1 medium was replaced with phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 4 to further evaluate the influence of fe3 and other constituents in asm 1 medium on oh production the concentration of pbs was adjusted to 0 2 mm to match the ion strength of asm 1 medium h2o2 alone did not produce oh consistent with the observation from the first experiment fig 1b a relatively high concentration of oh 4 01 10 15 m was measured in the h2o2 tio2 system which confirms the contribution of tio2 to oh production with h2o2 under visible light it also suggests that fe3 is not necessary for oh production in the h2o2 tio2 system under visible light the lower oh concentration in asm 1 medium without fe3 compared to that in pbs may be a result of interference by other ions in asm 1 medium several studies have reported the inhibiting effect of common anions and cations in an aqueous environment on the degradation of organic compounds in tio2 photocatalysis systems bekkouche et al 2012 chantal guillard et al 2005 chen et al 1997 liang et al 2008 the phpzc of p25 was determined to be 6 2 chen et al 1997 therefore the surface of tio2 was negatively charged in asm 1 medium ph 7 65 7 80 and pbs ph 7 4 leading to the adsorption of cations from the solution due to electrostatic force and consequently the reduction of available sites for h2o2 adsorption the presence of strongly adsorbing divalent cations mg2 ca2 etc potentially contributed to the stronger inhibition of oh production in asm 1 medium compared to pbs in summary the results show the feasibility of applying tio2 to enhance oh production from h2o2 under visible light an adequate amount of oh was produced in the h2o2 tio2 system under visible light in both asm 1 medium and pbs solution whereas oh was not detected in the h2o2 system in a fe3 absent asm 1 medium and pbs solution demonstrating the important role of tio2 in promoting oh production in addition fe3 also plays an important role in the h2o2 systems dissolved fe3 increased oh production irrespective of the presence of light though the mechanism may differ under light conditions as one of the most abundant metals on earth iron exists in natural water bodies ranging from 0 5 to 50 mg l 1 who 2008 which is higher than the fe3 concentration in this research a total iron concentration ranging from 0 075 to 15 mg l 1 has been reported in the waters of different reservoirs cottet et al 2015 eckerrot and petterson 1993 kritzberg and ekström 2012 sarkkola et al 2013 suggesting that the application of the h2o2 tio2 system in reservoirs may produce more oh depending on the water quality 3 2 cell integrity of microcystis the effects of visible light h2o2 and tio2 on the cell integrity of microcystis were investigated and the results are shown in fig 1c no loss of cell integrity was observed within 5 h in h2o2 tio2 or h2o2 tio2 systems in the absence of visible light suggesting that the applied doses of h2o2 and tio2 and low concentration of oh produced in these systems 0 1 62 10 15 m were not effective to rupture microcystis cells visible light alone and a combination of tio2 and visible light also did not induce cell rupture significant loss of cell integrity was only observed in h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems under visible light within the tested range an increase in h2o2 concentration led to a greater loss of cell integrity which was less noticeable at the beginning of the reaction and became increasingly pronounced as the reaction proceeded the addition of tio2 to h2o2 enhanced cell rupture although the effect was less significant as shown in fig 1d added 2 propanol did not affect cell integrity while cell rupture was slowed down in h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems under visible light in the presence of 2 propnaol indicating that oh contributes to the loss of cell integrity however significant cell rupture was still observed in the presence of 2 propanol suggesting that factors other than oh are also important in this though h2o2 has a lower oxidation potential than oh it is a strong oxidant and present in the system at much higher concentration than oh therefore we assumed h2o2 as another major factor in relation to cell rupture and treated it independently from oh one example to illustrate the importance of h2o2 came from the tests of the h2o2 tio2 system under visible light although the amount of oh produced in the h2o2 tio2 system was twice that in the h2o2 system cell rupture was not enhanced to the same extent this may be a result of the faster degradation of h2o2 in the presence of tio2 table 1 offsetting the effect caused by the increase in oh concentration to overcome the challenge of separating and quantifying the effects of oh and h2o2 on cell rupture we modified the kinetic models introduced in section 2 4 to extract individual rate constants for two oxidants as will be explained in the next section another interesting result was that h2o2 alone in dark did not cause cell rupture within 5 h whereas h2o2 in combination with 2 propanol eliminating effect of oh under irradiation of visible light led to obvious cell rupture the synergic antibacterial effect of h2o2 and visible light was also found in feuerstein et al 2006 in which several possible mechanisms were proposed to explain the observation overall the constant irradiation by visible light caused additional stress on the cyanobacteria than by h2o2 in the dark leading to an ros sensitive state and induced the final cell rupture feuerstein et al 2006 rinalducci et al 2008 therefore it is worth further research effort for elucidating the influence of light on cyanobacteria inactivation 3 3 kinetic modeling of cell rupture and microcystins concentration 3 3 1 kinetic modeling of cell rupture the experimental data for cell rupture in selected tests were fitted with dcwm and hm as described in section 2 4 the optimal kinetic parameters and model simulations are presented in table 2 and fig 2 a b respectively both dcwm and hm captured the shoulder behavior at the beginning of the reaction although hm yielded better results statistically higher r2 and lower ees values the kinetic parameters extracted from dcwm provide values with direct physical meanings for example a decrease in ctlag and increase in k c correspond to a shorter lag phase and faster cell rupture respectively although these kinetic models successfully described loss of cell integrity the relationship between the kinetic rate constants and concentrations of individual oxidants i e h2o2 and oh in this system is not clear enough this lack of understanding impaired the models ability to predict cell rupture under scenarios other than those that were experimentally tested to develop better kinetic models we made assumptions that h2o2 and oh under visible light are the major factors contributing to the degradation of cell integrity and that there is no synergistic effect between h2o2 and oh these assumptions allowed the separation of cell rupture kinetics into two parts two cell rupture kinetic rate constants k h 2 o 2 cell and k oh cell were introduced and the refined equations for dual oxidant dcwm and hm are expressed as eqs 6 7 3 3 1 1 dual oxidant dcwm 6 ln n n 0 0 for t t lag k c ct ct lag k c h 2 o 2 cell c h 2 o 2 k c oh cell c oh t t lag k c h 2 o 2 cell k c oh cell r ct c h 2 o 2 t c h 2 o 2 t lag k c c 0 h 2 o 2 e k t dt c 0 h 2 o 2 e k t lag dt for t t lag dual oxidant hm 7 ln n n 0 k h c n t m k h h 2 o 2 cell c h 2 o 2 n t m k h oh cell c oh n t m k h h 2 o 2 cell k h oh cell r ct n c h 2 o 2 n t m m nk m k h h 2 o 2 cell k h oh cell r ct n c h 2 o 2 n 1 exp nk t m m where k c h 2 o 2 cell and k c oh cell are the second order rate constants of cell rupture caused by h2o2 and oh in dual oxidant dcwm k h h 2 o 2 cell and k h oh cell are the corresponding rate constants of cell rupture in dual oxidant hm respectively and r ct is the radical transformation efficiency eq s3 si for dual oxidant dcwm it is necessary to know the connection between the concentration of oxidants and t lag to predict cell integrity of microcystis it is noticed that the t lag acquired in this study under different oxidant concentration show close results 102 116 min this could be due to the small differences of oxidant concentration applied in the study making the differences of t lag not obvious to further predict cell integrity of microcystis an average of t lag 111 2 min was used in this system a series of k c h 2 o 2 cell and k c oh cell values were determined by solving eq 6 with any two k c values where the predicted t lag was used and the corresponding average oxidant concentrations derived from table 1 the average values of k c h 2 o 2 cell and k c oh cell are listed in table 3 for dual oxidant hm n was set to 1 to simplify the calculation and m was taken as the average value from all systems for the convenience of comparing rate constants a new series of k h values were acquired and k h h 2 o 2 cell and k h oh cell were determined in a similar fashion as that for dual oxidant dcwm by solving eq 7 the average values of k c h 2 o 2 cell and k c oh cell are 64 64 61 91 m 1 min 1 and 2 26 0 90 1012 m 1 min 1 respectively table 3 the relatively high standard deviation of the rate constants from dual oxidant dcwm implies that this model may not have strong predictive ability the simulation of cell rupture using the kinetic parameters in table 3 showed high uncertainty and the model was not able to predict cell rupture between 60 and 120 min when shoulder behavior was pronounced fig 2c and fig s2 in comparison dual oxidant hm provided excellent prediction results with much less uncertainty using an average k h h 2 o 2 cell value of 9 86 1 15 10 4 m 1 min 3 and an average k h oh cell value of 1 09 0 17 107 m 1 min 3 fig 2d and fig s3 the flexibility of this model allowed the prediction to closely follow the shoulder behavior while the lag phase time was not explicit to further evaluate the kinetic models two models with corresponding rate constants from table 3 were applied to the dataset from fig 1d the predicted values were close to the observed ones fig s4 which validated both the kinetic models and the assumption that h2o2 and oh act independently in inducing cell rupture the rate constants for h2o2 and oh are expected to be able to predict cell rupture of microcystis under situations with different h2o2 and or oh concentrations with the assistance of kinetic models the impact of h2o2 and oh on cell integrity can be separately characterized and compared dual oxidant hm was chosen for its superior performance in describing and predicting cell rupture two examples are shown in fig 3 for h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems under visible light 5 mg l 1 h2o2 the effects of h2o2 and oh were individually presented by simulating cell rupture using k h h 2 o 2 cell and k h oh cell respectively the contribution of h2o2 to loss of cell integrity was much greater than that of oh in the h2o2 system fig 3a in contrast the contribution of h2o2 decreased while oh took on more importance in the h2o2 tio2 system fig 3b this observation agrees well with the earlier discussion in section 3 1 which noted that the h2o2 tio2 system has higher production of oh with a faster decay of h2o2 although the ratio of the two oxidants may vary with reaction conditions both oh and h2o2 play important roles in affecting cell integrity and neither of them should be ignored while modeling cell rupture in visible light systems although the individual effects of h2o2 and oh on cell integrity were successfully quantified by the dual oxidant models the models also imply that visible light plays a role in cell rupture for example cell integrity was not compromised in h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems without visible light fig 1c even though there was a significant amount of h2o2 and detectable level of oh according to the dual oxidant models the loss of cell integrity should be 80 after 4 h of reaction at h2o2 of 5 mg l 1 and oh of 1 26 10 15 m in the h2o2 system without visible light since visible light alone did not affect cell integrity fig 1c this discrepancy suggests that visible light enhanced the effects of h2o2 or oh although this synergetic mechanism remained unclear one possible explanation is that constant irradiation by visible light caused stress on the cyanobacteria e g promoting the generation of reactive oxygen species rinalducci et al 2008 and increased the reaction rate constant between the oxidant and cell as the light used in this study is similar to natural sunlight the k h 2 o 2 cell and k oh cell acquired in this study intrinsically include the synergistic effect of visible light and may be applicable in other systems under natural light conditions however when light sources are very different to natural conditions these kinetic parameters may need to be re estimated 3 3 2 kinetic modeling of microcystins release and degradation as proposed in a previous study huo et al 2015 the concentration of intracellular mcs is directly determined by the change in cell integrity which is readily predicted by the models developed above on the other hand the dynamics of extracellular and total mcs depend on both cell rupture kinetics and mcs degradation kinetics to develop a kinetic model for mcs degradation the following potential pathways of mcs lost from aqueous phase were evaluated although h2o2 is a strong oxidant previous researchers found that it is not able to effectively degrade mcs at a dose of up to 1 76 2 mm he et al 2012 li et al 2009 which is much higher than those used in this study 0 15 mm the adsorption of mc lr onto tio2 is dependent on solution ph and in the current test solutions ph 7 8 the loss of mc lr due to adsorption was less than 10 and was thus considered insignificant choi et al 2007 feitz et al 1999 pelaez et al 2011 the direct photolysis of mcs was also neglected since less than 5 of mcs was degraded under natural sunlight within 7 days su et al 2013 therefore in the studied systems oh was taken as the major cause of mcs degradation a second order reaction between mcs and oh is assumed as in the literature onstad et al 2007 mcs release and degradation models were obtained by integrating a cell rupture model and second order reaction model of mcs degradation by oh the equations below were based on dcwm and hm for ease of presentation while the simulations were conducted with models based on dual oxidant dcwm and hm that are easily derived by substituting eqs 6 7 into eqs 8 11 mcs model based on dcwm 8 dc e dt k oh mc c e c oh f o r t t lag q n 0 k c c 0 h 2 o 2 e k c c 0 h 2 o 2 e k t

c i were acquired for the mcs model based on dcwm for the mcs model based on hm the analytical solution for c i and numerical solutions for c e and c t were applied due to the complexity of equations si sections s6 input parameters need to be specified to apply these models to the studied systems the value of k oh mc was reported in the literature 1 1 1010 m 1 s 1 onstad et al 2007 the cell quota q was measured between 33 and 48 fg cell 1 in this system and the initial cell concentration n0 was 50 000 cells ml 1 the kinetic parameters for cell rupture were obtained from tables 1 and 3 measurement and calculation of h2o2 and oh concentrations were introduced in the methods section and s5 in si therefore all input parameters were either obtained from the literature or measured from experiments fig 4 shows the observed mcs concentrations measured by the elisa method and predicted values by dual oxidant dcwm and dual oxidant hm both models predicted total mcs very well dual oxidant hm has the potential advantage of providing more accurate predictions of the onset of mcs release due to its better performance in predicting cell rupture kinetics the extracellular mcs increased dramatically within a time range corresponding to an accelerated cell rupture suggesting that cell rupture caused the release of mcs into the water a continuous decrease of total mcs was observed in all systems an increase in the mcs degradation rate followed cell rupture which is most obvious in fig 4c where the highest oh concentration was obtained indicating that generated oh reacted mainly with extracellular mcs as discussed previously systems with tio2 produced more oh with faster decay of h2o2 compared to those only having h2o2 under visible light in contrast to the small difference in cell rupture efficiency given by the overall effect of the two oxidants much higher removals of total mcs were achieved in the h2o2 tio2 system than in the h2o2 system under visible light therefore degradation of mcs was mainly attributed to oh in the system to further confirm the applicability of kinetic models based on dual oxidant hm the model was applied to the cell rupture and mcs release experimental results from a previous study huo et al 2015 in both examples that differ in h2o2 doses cell rupture kinetics were well simulated by using an m value of 4 6 and average k h h 2 o 2 cell and k h oh cell values of 6 94 1 11 10 7 m 1 min 4 6 and 3 50 2 51 104 m 1 min 4 6 fig s5 these cell rupture kinetic parameters together with the second order rate constant for mcs oxidation by oh successfully predicted the release and degradation of mcs it would be interesting to compare the cell rupture rate constants between huo et al 2015 and the current study however the rate constants have different units so a direct comparison is not feasible instead we compared the loss of cell integrity with fixed concentrations of h2o2 5 mg l 1 and oh 5 10 15 m fig s6 obviously under the same concentrations of h2o2 and oh the loss rate of cell integrity predicted using the rate constant from huo et al 2015 was much faster than that using rate constants from this study this discrepancy could be due to the different experimental parameters light sources light spectrum and cell numbers used in the two works the uv portion of the light source which is believed to have a direct stress on cyanobacterium moon et al 2012 tao et al 2010 is eliminated in the current study thus reducing the rate constants of oxidants besides the different light spectrum and intensity more distributed in this study in the visible light region might have some impacts on the cell rupture 4 conclusions this study shows that tio2 was able to enhance oh production from h2o2 under visible light in the studied water the two oxidants oh and h2o2 in the h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems were responsible for the rupture of microcystis cells in the experiments under visible light condition kinetic models were developed to predict the cell rupture by incorporating two individual rate constants for the impact of the two oxidants on cells using these kinetic rate constants we are able to predict the cell rupture of microcystis in both h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems as long as the concentrations of the oxidants h2o2 and oh are determined the sequential reaction model developed in this study that integrates the cell rupture kinetic model and the second order mcs degradation model is able to simulate and predict the change in mcs in the current systems as well as other systems in the published literature the superior performance of mcs models based on dual oxidant hm suggests that separate optimization of kinetic models in an integrated model can lead to an overall improvement of model performance this study s kinetic models and the methodology of model development have the potential to be applied to other processes systems for evaluating the control of cyanobacteria in

19506,the aims of this study are to evaluate under visible light conditions the ability of h2o2 and tio2 to produce oh their quantitative impacts on the cell integrity of microcystis and the subsequent release and degradation of microcystins mcs a sequential reaction model was developed including one sub model to simulate the rupture kinetics for cell integrity of microcystis and another to describe the release and degradation of mcs for cell rupture the dual oxidant delayed chick watson model dcwm and dual oxidant hom model hm were first proposed and developed giving excellent simulation results of cell rupture kinetics kinetic rate constants between microcystis cells and h2o2 k h 2 o 2 cell as well as oh k oh cell under visible light successfully separated the individual effects of h2o2 and oh on microcystis the dual oxidant models were further validated with additional experiments making the models more convincing finally the dual oxidant cell rupture models were integrated with the mc degradation model and well predicted the observed mcs concentrations in the experimental systems the results of this study not only demonstrate the potential application of h2o2 and tio2 for the control of cyanobacteria and metabolites in natural water bodies but also provide a new methodology to differentiate the individual contributions of the two oxidants h2o2 and oh on cell rupture thus giving a novel way to more precisely determine the effective doses of applied oxidants for cyanobacteria control graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrogen peroxide microcystis microcystins titanium dioxide visible light dual oxidant kinetic model 1 introduction eutrophication in natural water bodies has become a critical issue due to its potential risk to human health and ecology excessive phosphorus and nitrogen inputs are believed to be the main reasons for cyanobacteria overgrowth and harmful cyanobacteria blooms cheung et al 2013 smith et al 1999 the high concentrations of cyanobacteria inevitably produce more cyanobacterial metabolites including toxins and taste and odor t o compounds thus increasing the burden and risk of drinking water supplies cheung et al 2013 various methods have been developed to control cyanobacteria in water such as physical chemical or biological treatments among these chemical oxidation has been widely applied and this utilizes oxidants such as chlorine chlorine dioxide and permanganate to remove algae fan et al 2016 li et al 2014 lin et al 2009 sharma et al 2012 although these conventional oxidants may inhibit the growth of cyanobacteria and destroy the cells they cannot effectively oxidize the released cyanotoxins and t o compounds after rupturing the cells thus increasing the risk to the water supply westrick et al 2010 advanced oxidation processes aops which involve highly reactive hydroxyl radical oh are considered to be an alternative method for the control of cyanobacteria in water as this approach has the capability to both rupture cyanobacteria cells and destroy the associated cyanotoxins and t o compounds sharma et al 2012 westrick et al 2010 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 an aop chemical when used with the support of ultra violet uv light is considered as an environmentally benign algaecide as it decomposes to water and oxygen hobson et al 2012 this chemical has been tested for suppressing cyanobacteria in one lake matthijs et al 2012 and dinoflagellates in one creek burson et al 2014 in the netherlands one lake in china wang et al 2012 and one wastewater stabilization pond in australia barrington et al 2011 in the field study carried out in the netherlands cyanobacteria dominated by planktothrix agardhii were selectively eliminated within a few days in the studied shallow lake lake koetshuis while other plankton and macrofauna remained unaffected although field applications of h2o2 have been shown to successfully suppress the growth of cyanobacteria in natural water bodies only one study has attempted to model the process kinetics of cell rupture and subsequent metabolite degradation huo et al 2015 in huo et al 2015 the kinetics of cell rupture and the subsequent release and degradation of cyanotoxin microcystin were modeled for cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa under h2o2 and light conditions although the model successfully predicted the change in concentration of mcs using independently measured parameters the impacts of h2o2 and oh were not well characterized although oh is known to be generated from h2o2 decomposition under the irradiation of uv light the efficiency of oh production is very low in natural environmental where uv light only accounts for 5 of the natural sunlight spectrum this will limit the applications of h2o2 when oh is a more desirable oxidant bolton and cater 1994 krishnan et al 2017 therefore it is of great interest to enhance the production of oh from h2o2 under visible light which accounts for 40 50 of the sunlight spectrum previous studies have shown that the combination of tio2 and h2o2 is promising to produce oh under visible light irradiation kang 2017 li et al 2001 rao and chu 2009 2010 it is noted that tio2 is an important photocatalyst material for producing oh modification of this material such as by doping with fe improves its ability to absorb the light with longer wavelength but potentially impair its photocatalytic reactivity under uv irradiation lin et al 2006 in comparison the combination of tio2 and h2o2 can not only utilize visible light to produce oh but also has higher photocatalytic activity under uv light irradiation dixit et al 2010 therefore the combined application of tio2 and h2o2 has the potential to maximize the energy utilization of sunlight in natural water bodies in a study of indigenous antibiotic resistant bacteria arb inactivation fiorentino et al 2015 simultaneous application of h2o2 and tio2 under sunlight was found to be more effective than h2o2 or tio2 alone and solar photo fenton treatment a similar observation was also reported for the inactivation of bacillus subtilis under sunlight irradiation witowitaya et al 2014 although studies have reported that visible light h2o2 tio2 or oh may affect the activity of microorganisms or cyanobacteria cho and yoon 2008 dalai et al 2012 2013 drábková et al 2007 rinalducci et al 2008 the combined effects of tio2 and h2o2 on the cell integrity of cyanobacteria have never been studied in particular models to quantitatively describe the individual and combined impacts of the two oxidants in the tio2 and h2o2 systems oh and h2o2 on the cell integrity of cyanobacteria and the release and degradation of cyanotoxins have never been reported in the literature therefore it remains a strong need to develop models to quantify the individual and combined impacts of h2o2 and oh on the cell integrity and toxin release and degradation and based on the models measures involving both oxidants for cyanobacteria control can be better evaluated the main objectives of this study are as follows 1 to evaluate oh production in a system of tio2 and or h2o2 under visible light irradiation 2 to understand the effects of tio2 h2o2 oh and visible light on a model cyanobacterium species m aeruginosa by detecting the cell integrity and release and degradation of mcs 3 to develop dual oxidant kinetic models to differentiate and quantify the effects of h2o2 and oh on cell integrity under visible light 2 material and methods 2 1 cell culture and counting m aeruginosa pcc 7820 was used as a toxic strain in this study the cell culture and counting procedure followed the process outlined in huo et al 2015 2 2 photocatalytic oxidation experiments in the photocatalytic oxidation batch system visible light was provided by simulated solar light suntest cps 1500 w air cooled xenon lamp atlas inc u s equipped with a uv 400 nm cut off filter detailed confirmation of the light spectrum and intensity are shown in the si section s1 before the oxidation experiment a predetermined amount of tio2 powder p25 tio2 80 anatase and 20 rutile uniregion bio tech u s was placed into a 0 5 l glass beaker pyrex germany filled with asm 1 medium rippka 1988 and sonicated for 10 15 min to ensure that tio2 powder was well dispersed the mixture was subsequently amended with a calculated amount of h2o2 stock solution 1000 mg l 1 prepared from 30 w h2o2 sigma aldrich u s 4 chlorobenzoic acid pcba probe for oh determination and cyanobacterial cells the content was mixed with a magnetic stir bar and the exposure to light was minimized during the mixing a uv cut off filter was placed on top of the reactor and the reaction started as soon as the simulated solar light was turned on concentrations of h2o2 tio2 and cells were set as 0 5 mg l 1 20 mg l 1 and 50 000 cells ml 1 respectively samples were taken at different time intervals to measure cell numbers cell integrity h2o2 pcba and mcs concentration the preservation of samples for different analysis is described in the si section s2 2 3 sample analysis analysis of h2o2 was based on a method reported by sellers 1980 the concentration of pcba was determined by a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc interpretation of pcba degradation and extraction of oh information followed a method developed by elovitz and von gunten 1999 during the oxidation process a portion of microcystis cells were found either ruptured or disappeared calculation of cell integrity considered both cell rupture percentage and cell number reduction percentage determined by flow cytometry and optical microscope respectively a direct competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kit elisa kit was used for the mcs analysis detailed procedures for sample analysis can be found in the si sections s3 s4 2 4 kinetic modeling change of cell integrity over time exhibited an initial lag phase shoulder behavior in h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems indicating possible oxidation resistance mechanism of the cells cho et al 2003 dalrymple et al 2010 haas et al 1995 marugán et al 2008 to elucidate the relationships among cell integrity oxidant concentration and reaction time two disinfection models the delayed chick watson model dcwm and hom model hm were chosen for their ability to simulate the shoulder lag behavior of cell integrity measured in this study in dcwm inactivation of cells is divided into two phases with an initial lag phase exhibiting no loss of cell integrity followed by a second phase where the first order kinetics equation was applied to cell integrity decay cho et al 2003 2004 sivaganesan et al 2006 1 ln n n 0 0 f o r t t lag k c ct ct lag f o r t t lag where n0 is the initial cell concentration cells ml 1 n is the cell concentration at time t cells ml 1 k c is the cell rupture rate constant m 1 min 1 t lag is lag phase time min and c is disinfectant concentration m in hm two empirical parameters m and n are introduced to describe cell inactivation that deviates from the classical log linear behavior cho et al 2003 dalrymple et al 2010 haas et al 1995 marugán et al 2008 2 ln n n 0 k h c n t m where kh is the cell rupture rate constant m n min m for the case m 1 eq 2 is simplified to the chick watson equation for m 1 the model presents a shoulder at the beginning of the reaction for m 1 the equation allows the fitting of a tail towards the end of the reaction in batch reaction systems it is common that disinfectant concentration decreases with time as the disinfectant is consumed by cells and other constituents in the medium to account for the time dependence of disinfectant concentration in hm the decay of the disinfectant is described by the following first order rate law 3 c c 0 exp k t where k is the first order decay constant of the disinfectant and c0 is the initial disinfectant concentration by combining eq 3 with eq 2 a modified form of hm was achieved haas et al 1995 4 ln n n 0 m nk m k h c 0 n 1 exp nk t m m the optimal values of model parameters such as k c and ct lag in dcwm and k h and m in hm n set to 1 were obtained by minimizing the error sum of squares ess with the solver function in microsoft excel 2013 ess was defined as the sum of the squares of the difference between the natural logarithm of the predicted cell integrity and the natural logarithm of the observed cell integrity 5 ess ln n i n 0 ln ni n 0 2 where n i n 0 is the observed cell integrity and n i n 0 is the predicted cell integrity kinetic models for simulating mcs concentrations were developed following a concept proposed in the literature huo et al 2015 that integrates a cell rupture kinetic model with an mcs degradation model it was assumed that mcs are released into the water immediately after cell rupture as suggested in huo et al 2015 details of the model development will be discussed in section 3 3 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 production of hydroxyl radical oh the hydroxyl radical is a critical species in aops in addition to h2o2 and tio2 which are the focus of this study two other factors that potentially influence the production of oh were also evaluated namely visible light and fe3 the concentration of oh can vary with reaction time fig s1 the time averaged concentration of oh was calculated and compared across different systems and conditions fig 1 a as shown in fig 1a no oh production was observed in the cell suspension under visible light the same observation was also found in the tio2 system with or without visible light in contrast oh was detected in h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems in the dark at a concentration of 1 27 1 62 10 15 m a fenton like reaction between h2o2 and fe3 a component of asm 1 medium is believed to be the main mechanism of oh production in this case several studies have indicated the significance of fenton like reactions in acidic environments due to increasing solubility of fe3 de laat and gallard 1999 jung et al 2009 although the asm 1 medium in this study is circum neutral ph 7 6 7 8 edta in the medium reacts with fe3 to produce a stable edta fe3 complex which improves the solubility of fe3 and promotes a fenton like reaction li et al 2012 visible light substantially enhances oh production in both h2o2 only and h2o2 tio2 systems since the low molar absorptivity of h2o2 at the wavelength of visible light miles 2013 minimizes the direct photolysis of h2o2 a photo fenton reaction is most likely responsible for the increased oh concentration the effect of h2o2 on the production of oh under visible light was investigated by varying the initial h2o2 concentration 0 5 mg l 1 fig 1a the results showed that oh production increased with h2o2 concentration within the tested range in h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems a comparison between these two systems demonstrated that the addition of tio2 enhanced oh production especially in the presence of visible light about a two fold increase in the average oh concentration was achieved for both h2o2 doses 2 5 and 5 mg l 1 after tio2 was added the detailed mechanism for h2o2 interacting with tio2 under visible light is that titanium peroxide complexes form on the surface of tio2 upon contacting h2o2 in water shifting the adsorption spectrum of tio2 to longer wavelengths subsequently the visible light applied in this study induces an electronic transition from surface complexes to the conduction band of tio2 with the generation of oh li et al 2001 rao and chu 2010 understanding the role of fe3 in oh production in h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems under visible light is important to identify the oh production pathway and recognize potential contributing factors during the evaluation of these systems for this purpose two experiments were designed the first compared oh production between asm 1 medium containing 0 22 mg l 1 fe3 and asm 1 medium without fe3 fig 1b in the absence of fe3 h2o2 alone was not able to produce oh under visible light in contrast a small amount of oh around 5 10 16 m was detected in the h2o2 tio2 system suggesting a oh production pathway resulting from the interaction between h2o2 and tio2 under visible light as discussed above in the presence of fe3 oh production was significantly enhanced in both h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems even though the fe3 concentration was relatively low 0 22 mg l 1 in the second experiment asm 1 medium was replaced with phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 4 to further evaluate the influence of fe3 and other constituents in asm 1 medium on oh production the concentration of pbs was adjusted to 0 2 mm to match the ion strength of asm 1 medium h2o2 alone did not produce oh consistent with the observation from the first experiment fig 1b a relatively high concentration of oh 4 01 10 15 m was measured in the h2o2 tio2 system which confirms the contribution of tio2 to oh production with h2o2 under visible light it also suggests that fe3 is not necessary for oh production in the h2o2 tio2 system under visible light the lower oh concentration in asm 1 medium without fe3 compared to that in pbs may be a result of interference by other ions in asm 1 medium several studies have reported the inhibiting effect of common anions and cations in an aqueous environment on the degradation of organic compounds in tio2 photocatalysis systems bekkouche et al 2012 chantal guillard et al 2005 chen et al 1997 liang et al 2008 the phpzc of p25 was determined to be 6 2 chen et al 1997 therefore the surface of tio2 was negatively charged in asm 1 medium ph 7 65 7 80 and pbs ph 7 4 leading to the adsorption of cations from the solution due to electrostatic force and consequently the reduction of available sites for h2o2 adsorption the presence of strongly adsorbing divalent cations mg2 ca2 etc potentially contributed to the stronger inhibition of oh production in asm 1 medium compared to pbs in summary the results show the feasibility of applying tio2 to enhance oh production from h2o2 under visible light an adequate amount of oh was produced in the h2o2 tio2 system under visible light in both asm 1 medium and pbs solution whereas oh was not detected in the h2o2 system in a fe3 absent asm 1 medium and pbs solution demonstrating the important role of tio2 in promoting oh production in addition fe3 also plays an important role in the h2o2 systems dissolved fe3 increased oh production irrespective of the presence of light though the mechanism may differ under light conditions as one of the most abundant metals on earth iron exists in natural water bodies ranging from 0 5 to 50 mg l 1 who 2008 which is higher than the fe3 concentration in this research a total iron concentration ranging from 0 075 to 15 mg l 1 has been reported in the waters of different reservoirs cottet et al 2015 eckerrot and petterson 1993 kritzberg and ekström 2012 sarkkola et al 2013 suggesting that the application of the h2o2 tio2 system in reservoirs may produce more oh depending on the water quality 3 2 cell integrity of microcystis the effects of visible light h2o2 and tio2 on the cell integrity of microcystis were investigated and the results are shown in fig 1c no loss of cell integrity was observed within 5 h in h2o2 tio2 or h2o2 tio2 systems in the absence of visible light suggesting that the applied doses of h2o2 and tio2 and low concentration of oh produced in these systems 0 1 62 10 15 m were not effective to rupture microcystis cells visible light alone and a combination of tio2 and visible light also did not induce cell rupture significant loss of cell integrity was only observed in h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems under visible light within the tested range an increase in h2o2 concentration led to a greater loss of cell integrity which was less noticeable at the beginning of the reaction and became increasingly pronounced as the reaction proceeded the addition of tio2 to h2o2 enhanced cell rupture although the effect was less significant as shown in fig 1d added 2 propanol did not affect cell integrity while cell rupture was slowed down in h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems under visible light in the presence of 2 propnaol indicating that oh contributes to the loss of cell integrity however significant cell rupture was still observed in the presence of 2 propanol suggesting that factors other than oh are also important in this though h2o2 has a lower oxidation potential than oh it is a strong oxidant and present in the system at much higher concentration than oh therefore we assumed h2o2 as another major factor in relation to cell rupture and treated it independently from oh one example to illustrate the importance of h2o2 came from the tests of the h2o2 tio2 system under visible light although the amount of oh produced in the h2o2 tio2 system was twice that in the h2o2 system cell rupture was not enhanced to the same extent this may be a result of the faster degradation of h2o2 in the presence of tio2 table 1 offsetting the effect caused by the increase in oh concentration to overcome the challenge of separating and quantifying the effects of oh and h2o2 on cell rupture we modified the kinetic models introduced in section 2 4 to extract individual rate constants for two oxidants as will be explained in the next section another interesting result was that h2o2 alone in dark did not cause cell rupture within 5 h whereas h2o2 in combination with 2 propanol eliminating effect of oh under irradiation of visible light led to obvious cell rupture the synergic antibacterial effect of h2o2 and visible light was also found in feuerstein et al 2006 in which several possible mechanisms were proposed to explain the observation overall the constant irradiation by visible light caused additional stress on the cyanobacteria than by h2o2 in the dark leading to an ros sensitive state and induced the final cell rupture feuerstein et al 2006 rinalducci et al 2008 therefore it is worth further research effort for elucidating the influence of light on cyanobacteria inactivation 3 3 kinetic modeling of cell rupture and microcystins concentration 3 3 1 kinetic modeling of cell rupture the experimental data for cell rupture in selected tests were fitted with dcwm and hm as described in section 2 4 the optimal kinetic parameters and model simulations are presented in table 2 and fig 2 a b respectively both dcwm and hm captured the shoulder behavior at the beginning of the reaction although hm yielded better results statistically higher r2 and lower ees values the kinetic parameters extracted from dcwm provide values with direct physical meanings for example a decrease in ctlag and increase in k c correspond to a shorter lag phase and faster cell rupture respectively although these kinetic models successfully described loss of cell integrity the relationship between the kinetic rate constants and concentrations of individual oxidants i e h2o2 and oh in this system is not clear enough this lack of understanding impaired the models ability to predict cell rupture under scenarios other than those that were experimentally tested to develop better kinetic models we made assumptions that h2o2 and oh under visible light are the major factors contributing to the degradation of cell integrity and that there is no synergistic effect between h2o2 and oh these assumptions allowed the separation of cell rupture kinetics into two parts two cell rupture kinetic rate constants k h 2 o 2 cell and k oh cell were introduced and the refined equations for dual oxidant dcwm and hm are expressed as eqs 6 7 3 3 1 1 dual oxidant dcwm 6 ln n n 0 0 for t t lag k c ct ct lag k c h 2 o 2 cell c h 2 o 2 k c oh cell c oh t t lag k c h 2 o 2 cell k c oh cell r ct c h 2 o 2 t c h 2 o 2 t lag k c c 0 h 2 o 2 e k t dt c 0 h 2 o 2 e k t lag dt for t t lag dual oxidant hm 7 ln n n 0 k h c n t m k h h 2 o 2 cell c h 2 o 2 n t m k h oh cell c oh n t m k h h 2 o 2 cell k h oh cell r ct n c h 2 o 2 n t m m nk m k h h 2 o 2 cell k h oh cell r ct n c h 2 o 2 n 1 exp nk t m m where k c h 2 o 2 cell and k c oh cell are the second order rate constants of cell rupture caused by h2o2 and oh in dual oxidant dcwm k h h 2 o 2 cell and k h oh cell are the corresponding rate constants of cell rupture in dual oxidant hm respectively and r ct is the radical transformation efficiency eq s3 si for dual oxidant dcwm it is necessary to know the connection between the concentration of oxidants and t lag to predict cell integrity of microcystis it is noticed that the t lag acquired in this study under different oxidant concentration show close results 102 116 min this could be due to the small differences of oxidant concentration applied in the study making the differences of t lag not obvious to further predict cell integrity of microcystis an average of t lag 111 2 min was used in this system a series of k c h 2 o 2 cell and k c oh cell values were determined by solving eq 6 with any two k c values where the predicted t lag was used and the corresponding average oxidant concentrations derived from table 1 the average values of k c h 2 o 2 cell and k c oh cell are listed in table 3 for dual oxidant hm n was set to 1 to simplify the calculation and m was taken as the average value from all systems for the convenience of comparing rate constants a new series of k h values were acquired and k h h 2 o 2 cell and k h oh cell were determined in a similar fashion as that for dual oxidant dcwm by solving eq 7 the average values of k c h 2 o 2 cell and k c oh cell are 64 64 61 91 m 1 min 1 and 2 26 0 90 1012 m 1 min 1 respectively table 3 the relatively high standard deviation of the rate constants from dual oxidant dcwm implies that this model may not have strong predictive ability the simulation of cell rupture using the kinetic parameters in table 3 showed high uncertainty and the model was not able to predict cell rupture between 60 and 120 min when shoulder behavior was pronounced fig 2c and fig s2 in comparison dual oxidant hm provided excellent prediction results with much less uncertainty using an average k h h 2 o 2 cell value of 9 86 1 15 10 4 m 1 min 3 and an average k h oh cell value of 1 09 0 17 107 m 1 min 3 fig 2d and fig s3 the flexibility of this model allowed the prediction to closely follow the shoulder behavior while the lag phase time was not explicit to further evaluate the kinetic models two models with corresponding rate constants from table 3 were applied to the dataset from fig 1d the predicted values were close to the observed ones fig s4 which validated both the kinetic models and the assumption that h2o2 and oh act independently in inducing cell rupture the rate constants for h2o2 and oh are expected to be able to predict cell rupture of microcystis under situations with different h2o2 and or oh concentrations with the assistance of kinetic models the impact of h2o2 and oh on cell integrity can be separately characterized and compared dual oxidant hm was chosen for its superior performance in describing and predicting cell rupture two examples are shown in fig 3 for h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems under visible light 5 mg l 1 h2o2 the effects of h2o2 and oh were individually presented by simulating cell rupture using k h h 2 o 2 cell and k h oh cell respectively the contribution of h2o2 to loss of cell integrity was much greater than that of oh in the h2o2 system fig 3a in contrast the contribution of h2o2 decreased while oh took on more importance in the h2o2 tio2 system fig 3b this observation agrees well with the earlier discussion in section 3 1 which noted that the h2o2 tio2 system has higher production of oh with a faster decay of h2o2 although the ratio of the two oxidants may vary with reaction conditions both oh and h2o2 play important roles in affecting cell integrity and neither of them should be ignored while modeling cell rupture in visible light systems although the individual effects of h2o2 and oh on cell integrity were successfully quantified by the dual oxidant models the models also imply that visible light plays a role in cell rupture for example cell integrity was not compromised in h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems without visible light fig 1c even though there was a significant amount of h2o2 and detectable level of oh according to the dual oxidant models the loss of cell integrity should be 80 after 4 h of reaction at h2o2 of 5 mg l 1 and oh of 1 26 10 15 m in the h2o2 system without visible light since visible light alone did not affect cell integrity fig 1c this discrepancy suggests that visible light enhanced the effects of h2o2 or oh although this synergetic mechanism remained unclear one possible explanation is that constant irradiation by visible light caused stress on the cyanobacteria e g promoting the generation of reactive oxygen species rinalducci et al 2008 and increased the reaction rate constant between the oxidant and cell as the light used in this study is similar to natural sunlight the k h 2 o 2 cell and k oh cell acquired in this study intrinsically include the synergistic effect of visible light and may be applicable in other systems under natural light conditions however when light sources are very different to natural conditions these kinetic parameters may need to be re estimated 3 3 2 kinetic modeling of microcystins release and degradation as proposed in a previous study huo et al 2015 the concentration of intracellular mcs is directly determined by the change in cell integrity which is readily predicted by the models developed above on the other hand the dynamics of extracellular and total mcs depend on both cell rupture kinetics and mcs degradation kinetics to develop a kinetic model for mcs degradation the following potential pathways of mcs lost from aqueous phase were evaluated although h2o2 is a strong oxidant previous researchers found that it is not able to effectively degrade mcs at a dose of up to 1 76 2 mm he et al 2012 li et al 2009 which is much higher than those used in this study 0 15 mm the adsorption of mc lr onto tio2 is dependent on solution ph and in the current test solutions ph 7 8 the loss of mc lr due to adsorption was less than 10 and was thus considered insignificant choi et al 2007 feitz et al 1999 pelaez et al 2011 the direct photolysis of mcs was also neglected since less than 5 of mcs was degraded under natural sunlight within 7 days su et al 2013 therefore in the studied systems oh was taken as the major cause of mcs degradation a second order reaction between mcs and oh is assumed as in the literature onstad et al 2007 mcs release and degradation models were obtained by integrating a cell rupture model and second order reaction model of mcs degradation by oh the equations below were based on dcwm and hm for ease of presentation while the simulations were conducted with models based on dual oxidant dcwm and hm that are easily derived by substituting eqs 6 7 into eqs 8 11 mcs model based on dcwm 8 dc e dt k oh mc c e c oh f o r t t lag q n 0 k c c 0 h 2 o 2 e k c c 0 h 2 o 2 e k t

intracellular mcs μg l 1 q is the mcs cell quota μg l 1 k oh mc is the second order rate constant between oh and mcs m 1 s 1 k 1 m nk m k h c 0 n k 2 nk m k 3 m the model for total mcs is obtained by simply summing up the models for extracellular and intracellular mcs 12 dc t dt dc e dt dc i dt where c t is the concentration of total mcs in the system μg l 1 the analytical solutions of c t c e and c i were acquired for the mcs model based on dcwm for the mcs model based on hm the analytical solution for c i and numerical solutions for c e and c t were applied due to the complexity of equations si sections s6 input parameters need to be specified to apply these models to the studied systems the value of k oh mc was reported in the literature 1 1 1010 m 1 s 1 onstad et al 2007 the cell quota q was measured between 33 and 48 fg cell 1 in this system and the initial cell concentration n0 was 50 000 cells ml 1 the kinetic parameters for cell rupture were obtained from tables 1 and 3 measurement and calculation of h2o2 and oh concentrations were introduced in the methods section and s5 in si therefore all input parameters were either obtained from the literature or measured from experiments fig 4 shows the observed mcs concentrations measured by the elisa method and predicted values by dual oxidant dcwm and dual oxidant hm both models predicted total mcs very well dual oxidant hm has the potential advantage of providing more accurate predictions of the onset of mcs release due to its better performance in predicting cell rupture kinetics the extracellular mcs increased dramatically within a time range corresponding to an accelerated cell rupture suggesting that cell rupture caused the release of mcs into the water a continuous decrease of total mcs was observed in all systems an increase in the mcs degradation rate followed cell rupture which is most obvious in fig 4c where the highest oh concentration was obtained indicating that generated oh reacted mainly with extracellular mcs as discussed previously systems with tio2 produced more oh with faster decay of h2o2 compared to those only having h2o2 under visible light in contrast to the small difference in cell rupture efficiency given by the overall effect of the two oxidants much higher removals of total mcs were achieved in the h2o2 tio2 system than in the h2o2 system under visible light therefore degradation of mcs was mainly attributed to oh in the system to further confirm the applicability of kinetic models based on dual oxidant hm the model was applied to the cell rupture and mcs release experimental results from a previous study huo et al 2015 in both examples that differ in h2o2 doses cell rupture kinetics were well simulated by using an m value of 4 6 and average k h h 2 o 2 cell and k h oh cell values of 6 94 1 11 10 7 m 1 min 4 6 and 3 50 2 51 104 m 1 min 4 6 fig s5 these cell rupture kinetic parameters together with the second order rate constant for mcs oxidation by oh successfully predicted the release and degradation of mcs it would be interesting to compare the cell rupture rate constants between huo et al 2015 and the current study however the rate constants have different units so a direct comparison is not feasible instead we compared the loss of cell integrity with fixed concentrations of h2o2 5 mg l 1 and oh 5 10 15 m fig s6 obviously under the same concentrations of h2o2 and oh the loss rate of cell integrity predicted using the rate constant from huo et al 2015 was much faster than that using rate constants from this study this discrepancy could be due to the different experimental parameters light sources light spectrum and cell numbers used in the two works the uv portion of the light source which is believed to have a direct stress on cyanobacterium moon et al 2012 tao et al 2010 is eliminated in the current study thus reducing the rate constants of oxidants besides the different light spectrum and intensity more distributed in this study in the visible light region might have some impacts on the cell rupture 4 conclusions this study shows that tio2 was able to enhance oh production from h2o2 under visible light in the studied water the two oxidants oh and h2o2 in the h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems were responsible for the rupture of microcystis cells in the experiments under visible light condition kinetic models were developed to predict the cell rupture by incorporating two individual rate constants for the impact of the two oxidants on cells using these kinetic rate constants we are able to predict the cell rupture of microcystis in both h2o2 and h2o2 tio2 systems as long as the concentrations of the oxidants h2o2 and oh are determined the sequential reaction model developed in this study that integrates the cell rupture kinetic model and the second order mcs degradation model is able to simulate and predict the change in mcs in the current systems as well as other systems in the published literature the superior performance of mcs models based on dual oxidant hm suggests that separate optimization of kinetic models in an integrated model can lead to an overall improvement of model performance this study s kinetic models and the methodology of model development have the potential to be applied to other processes systems for evaluating the control of cyanobacteria in

19507,for the first time the natural formation of silver based nanoparticles ag b nps was studied in field investigations of two pre alpine lakes in germany that contain geogenic silver traces in the sub ng l 1 range light sensitive microorganisms most likely accumulate and transport these silver traces from deeper water layers to the surface at the surface of the eutrophic lake approximately 40 of total silver 5 7 ng l 1 consisted of ag b nps whereas in the oligotrophic lake with similar enrichment of silver species no ag b nps were detected additional lab experiments with nature related ag i concentrations in the lower ng l 1 range and natural organic matter with total organic carbon values of 5 mg l 1 revealed that contrary to common interpretation in the literature ag b nps are also or even preferably formed in the dark particle size increases gradually with increasing reaction time showing that ostwald ripening occurs even at such low particle concentrations when sulfide ions are present smaller ag b nps with a narrower size distribution are formed graphical abstract image 1 keywords silver nanoparticles nanoparticle formation environmental analysis cloud point extraction electrothermal atomic absorption spectroscopy single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 1 introduction numerous studies on sources of engineered silver nanoparticles eagnps and their possible release and distribution in the environment have already been reported benn et al 2010 colman et al 2014 kim et al 2010 li et al 2013 2016 mittelman et al 2015 because of a lack of analytical techniques with sufficient selectivity and detection power most of these studies were performed by spiking natural or semi natural samples with eagnps typically in the mg l 1 and μg l 1 ranges and by modeling based on dynamic probabilistic material flow analysis gottschalk et al 2009 2013 sun et al 2014 2015 tan et al 2017 in a recent study the lower q 0 15 and upper q 0 85 concentrations of eagnps present in surface waters were estimated to be 0 40 and 2 78 ng l 1 sun et al 2016 these values are consistent with the findings of our previous study in which we described for the first time the distribution of real silver based nanoparticles ag b nps in representative wastewater treatment plants wwtps that use different input and treatment technologies additionally we clarified the extent to which the effluent of wwtps influences the concentration of ag b nps along a river a gradual progressive increase in the ag b np level of the river over a distance of 150 km with a final ag b np concentration of 1 7 ng l 1 was found li et al 2013 2016 more importantly we further observed that surrounding lakes which do not receive wwtp effluent also showed measurable ag b np concentrations with levels ranging from 0 5 to 1 3 ng l 1 indicating that ag b nps might be formed naturally via the reduction of ag i species by natural organic matter nom it has already been demonstrated that both humic and fulvic acids from different sources river sediment and soil can reduce ag i to ag b nps at elevated temperatures e g at 90 c adegboyega et al 2013 akaighe et al 2011 also irradiation with artificial sunlight was reported to be a key factor for reduction of ag i to ag b nps by nom in the aquatic environment hou et al 2013 lu et al 2016 yin et al 2012 2014 however these laboratory studies were performed at nom concentrations as high as 100 mg l 1 and ag i concentrations as high as 200 mg l 1 adegboyega et al 2013 akaighe et al 2011 hou et al 2013 lu et al 2016 sharma et al 2015 yin et al 2012 2014 strongly exceeding the concentrations of silver pg l 1 to ng l 1 and nom typically 10 mg l 1 in natural waters silvestry rodriguez et al 2008 robust and extensively validated analytical methods recently developed by our group duester et al 2016 hartmann et al 2013 2014 li et al 2013 2016 enable the measurement of ag b nps even in complex matrices such as wwtp influents ensuring high species selectivity and a limit of detection lod as low as 0 2 ng l 1 in combination with single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry spicp ms size selective measurements with a lod of 0 25 ng l 1 for particles as small as 10 nm can also be performed paving the way for a more comprehensive understanding of the formation of ag b nps under natural conditions for this purpose we studied the natural formation of ag b nps in lakes with different eutrophication degrees which do not receive silver from anthropogenic sources these results are compared with the results of similar measurements performed in a lake located in the same area that is polluted with ag b nps from wwtp effluent the measurements in the natural environment are supplemented by laboratory experiments with nature related silver and nom concentrations the effects of light irradiation nom content incubation time as well as temperature and the presence of sulfide on the formation and size distribution of ag b nps are studied in detail in this study we use the term ag b nps to reflect the fact that silver can form a confusing diversity of nanosized particles with different sizes morphologies compositions and surface coatings which usually cannot be fully characterized at environmentally relevant concentrations with current analytical techniques moreover ag b nps exhibit very dynamic behavior such as ostwald ripening even at very low naturally occurring particle concentrations 2 material and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were at least of analytical grade and were used without further purification ultra pure water upw with a resistivity of 18 2 mω cm 1 was obtained from a direct q system millipore billerica usa nom from the suwannee river srnom a reference material from the international humic substance society ihss was used for all experiments involving nom induced ag b np formation we prepared a nom stock solution with a toc concentration of 20 mg l 1 by dissolving the dry powder in upw icp ms measurements revealed trace impurities of 3 ng l 1 ag in this nom stock solution which did not affect the experiments and conclusions an aunp dispersion particle size 56 nm nist reference material 8013 used for spicp ms calibration was obtained from the national institute of standards and technology gaithersburg md usa agnp dispersions particle size 60 nm cagnp 20 mg l 1 used for et aas calibration were obtained from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa the used dissolved ag i standard 1000 mg l 1 was based on agno3 in 3 hno3 triton tx 114 was used as a surfactant for the nanoparticle extraction procedure d penicillamine and disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate were used as complexing agents and acetic acid glacial and sodium acetate anhydrous were used for ph buffering all glassware was thoroughly cleaned by being rinsed with 6 5 hno3 solution followed by steaming with hno3 vapor for 4 h and triplicate washing with upw prior to use 2 2 lake water collection we sampled lake water from two natural lakes in bavaria germany sampling sites are shown in fig a1 table a1 contains the corresponding coordinates gps data the lakes were carefully chosen to represent a typical oligotrophic lake lake königssee and a eutrophic lake lake waginger see table a1 gives more detailed information about the lakes for each site we collected samples at different depths to at least 10 m depth using a limnos water sampler hydro bios kiel germany lake waginger see was sampled to the ground max 23 m which was not possible for lake königssee with a maximum depth of 190 m all water samples were collected in new one way polyvinyl chloride pvc containers 500 ml which were rinsed threefold with the sample before they were filled to volume immediately after collecting each sample we measured its temperature and ph using a ph 110 handheld measurement system vwr darmstadt germany 2 3 instrumentation for et aas measurements we used an aanalyst 800 instrument perkin elmer waltham ma usa equipped with a transversally heated graphite atomizer thga 800 and an as 72 autosampler a silver hollow cathode lamp maasen gmbh reutlingen germany as the light source for aas measurements was operated at the recommended current of 10 ma we integrated the aas signal over 5 s at the absorption line λ 328 1 nm to quantify the silver in the samples high purity argon 99 998 was used as an inert gas during the measurements we measured the total silver concentration and agnp size distribution in single particle mode target mass 107ag with a 7900 icp ms instrument agilent technologies santa clara ca usa equipped with an autosampler asx 520 the agilent masshunter workstation 4 4 software version c 01 04 build 544 3 was used for data evaluation the dwell time was set to 100 μs resulting in 600 000 data points for an acquisition time of 1 min the pump rate was gravimetrically determined as 0 316 ml min 1 for calibration we followed the recently published protocol peters et al 2014 in brief we determined the transport efficiency i e the part of all sample particles finally reaching the detector for the spicp ms measurement using aunp nist reference material 8013 the transport efficiency for au and ag are identical however aunps are more stable than agnps and are available as a certified reference material we carried out a second calibration using a 1 μg l 1 dissolved silver standard solution agno3 in hno3 in single particle mode to determine element sensitivity all optimized system parameters for spicp ms mode are given in table a3 we performed total silver concentration measurements by icp ms with 107ag as the target mass driven in helium collision mode as internal standards we chose 151eu and 115in the measured lake water samples were not filtered but were stabilized by the addition of 3 25 w w hno3 for calibration we applied a properly diluted ag i stock solution 1000 mg l 1 in hno3 to obtain calibration solutions in the upper pg l 1 and lower ng l 1 range we conducted toc measurements of all real environmental samples which were measured undiluted without filtration using a toc l csh csn analyzer shimadzu kyoto japan all samples were mixed thoroughly seconds before the toc analysis started for calibration we prepared standard solutions containing 10 and 100 mg l 1 toc based on potassium hydrogen phthalate solutions in upw 2 4 selective enrichment of ag b nps from water samples we used cloud point extraction cpe a robust and thoroughly validated method developed by our group duester et al 2016 hartmann et al 2013 2014 li et al 2016 to separate and enrich ag b nps from environmental and artificial samples dissolved ag i species and matrix components are efficiently retained by this procedure paving a way to an undisturbed and highly sensitive measurement of ag b nps e g by cpe et aas or cpe spicp ms for cpe we mixed 40 ml samples containing ag b nps and ag i species with 3 0 ml of saturated ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt edta solution 1 0 ml of saturated d penicillamine solution 400 μl of 1 m sodium acetate solution 100 μl of 1 25 m acetic acid and 1 ml of 10 w w tx 114 in 50 ml tapered polypropylene sample tubes the mixtures were incubated at 40 c for 30 min after centrifugation 12 min 4500 g the samples were cooled for 5 min in an ice bath the aqueous supernatants were subsequently removed by decanting the remaining viscous surfactant droplets containing the enriched and separated ag b nps were diluted either with ethanol for et aas measurement or with ethanol and upw for icp ms measurement 2 5 determination of ag b nps by et aas et aas is very sensitive for silver and requires a sample volume of only 20 μl organic matrix constituents can be easily eliminated with an appropriate furnace temperature program which has already been described in our previous publications hartmann et al 2013 2014 hartmann and schuster 2013 li et al 2013 et aas uses a high precision pipetting system for sample application which can handle small solvent volumes with higher viscosity therefore we diluted the surfactant droplet obtained by cpe with only 100 μl of ethanol allowing for a high enrichment factor of 80 and an lod for silver as low as 0 2 ng l 1 we calibrated the system identically to the cpe procedure used for et aas measurement for this purpose we applied particle stock solutions of 60 nm citrate coated agnps which were freed from impurities of dissolved silver species by dialysis prior to use 2 6 determination and size distribution of ag b nps by spicp ms icp ms uses nebulizers for sample introduction which cannot handle highly concentrated surfactant solutions therefore we diluted the surfactant droplet obtained by cpe with 400 μl of ethanol and upw to a total volume of 10 ml additionally we prepared all calibration solutions and dispersions in the same uniform manner because of the almost complete separation of particles from dissolved silver species by the cpe procedure the limit of detection for particles measured by spicp ms was improved substantially and the smallest detectable particle size was reduced leading to a hitherto unequaled lod of 0 25 ng l 1 for particles as small as 10 nm 2 7 sample preparation for nom and sulfide induced formation of ag b nps under semi natural conditions to observe potential ag b np formation from dissolved ag i species under the influence of nom we added a solution of dissolved ag i agno3 in 3 hno3 to 40 ml of aqueous srnom solutions representing toc concentrations of 0 1 and 5 mg l 1 yielding in a final ag i concentration of 50 ng l 1 one way polypropylene vials were used as reaction vessels which were wrapped with several layers of aluminum foil to prevent the incidence of light control experiments allowing the incidence of light were also performed for these experiments we used glass vessels which allow better light transmission in addition to reaction samples containing dissolved ag i we prepared reference samples containing nom but no ag i to observe potential silver backgrounds related to the nom material furthermore we added 1 ml of hoac naoac ph buffer 8 203 g naoac in 3 29 ml of hoac and 36 71 ml of upw to each reaction mixture we prepared all nom ag i combinations in triplicate to assess the reproducibility of nom induced formation experiments the mixtures were incubated for 24 h at 7 and 23 c afterwards we added 50 μl of a 0 1 m nh3 solution to adjust the ph of the sample and the mixtures were then subjected to ag b np concentration analysis by cpe et aas and cpe spicp ms for determination of their particle concentrations and size distributions respectively in a second experimental setup we investigated the influence of dissolved sulfide we prepared all nom ag i model mixtures as previously described whereas 160 μl of 4 mm na2s solution which was obtained by dissolving 0 6632 g of na2s in 5 ml of upw was added to all samples sulfide was added ultimately to ensure identical reaction times for all samples 3 results and discussions 3 1 formation of ag b nps in natural lakes in this study we investigated two dimictic mainly groundwater fed natural lakes located within the pre alpine area in southern germany the lakes with different eutrophication degrees see table a1 were investigated with respect to the proportion of ag b nps as a part of the total silver concentration at various water depths both lakes showed similar total silver concentrations of 0 84 0 52 lowest value to 5 69 0 33 ng l 1 highest value within the upper water layers see table a2 the lakes as well as their small tributaries do not receive wwtp effluent which might contain silver species from anthropogenic sources the oligotrophic fjord like lake königssee volume 5 108 m3 max depth 190 m exhibits a high water quality total phosphorus tp 5 μg l 1 visibility depth 10 5 m motor boats are not allowed and there are no agricultural influences the eutrophic lake waginger see tp 24 μg l 1 visibility depth 2 8 m volume 9 107 m3 max depth 27 m is protected from wwtp effluent by a perimeter sewerage system whereas the lake clearly shows agricultural influences nevertheless fertilization with sewage sludge a potential source for the introduction of ag b nps or other silver species into the lake is not applied around the lake and tributaries unfortunately very little is known about natural silver concentrations in the hydrosphere the estimated silver concentration in the oceans is 0 04 ng l 1 schutz and turekian 1965 other authors ranville and flegal 2005 have reported oceanic silver concentrations ranging from 0 02 to 10 5 ng l 1 depending on the location where the samples were collected the silver concentrations measured in the pre alpine lakes lie within this concentration range we therefore anticipate that the measured silver concentrations are of geogenic origin total organic carbon toc as a measure of nom concentration in the lakes is consistent with the eutrophication degree ranging from an average of 1 32 mg l 1 lake königssee to 5 10 mg l 1 lake waginger see whereby only negligible variations of the toc values were observed with increasing water depth see table a2 this consistency also applies to the weakly basic ph values which range from 7 7 to 8 3 we examined lake waginger see in april 2017 during the beginning of thermal stratification lake königssee was examined in september 2016 and showed a pronounced thermal stratification with a distinct thermocline between the epilimnion and the metalimnion in the case of lake waginger see we collected samples from the surface of the lake to its bottom lake königssee is very deep 100 m 190 m we therefore only collected samples to the upper metalimnion which was identical with the visibility depth at this time in both lakes the highest total silver concentrations were always observed near the water surface and the concentrations gradually decreased with increasing water depth in lake königssee we could not detect any silver 0 77 ng l 1 in the transition zone between the epilimnion and the metalimnion or in the metalimnion to the visibility depth of approximately 10 m this observation is interesting because it implies that there must be a mechanism that transports silver species from lower water layers to the surface of the lake the most likely explanation for this unexpected observation is that light sensitive microorganisms e g cyanobacteria which are omnipresent in the pre alpine lakes accumulate silver and transport it to the surface of the lake where the light intensity for photosynthesis is highest in natural and in contaminated water bodies microorganisms can serve as a major sink for heavy metals acharya and apte 2013 anjana et al 2007 awasthi and rai 2004 blanco et al 1999 cain et al 2008 markou et al 2015 cyanobacteria for example can bind heavy metal species via a metabolically mediated active uptake bioaccumulation and or a passive biosorption process via their exopolysaccharide eps coating de philippis et al 2011 bioaccumulation requires living cells and is a comparatively slow process biosorption which does not necessarily require living cells follows faster kinetics reaching a sorption maximum within hours de philippis et al 2003 2011 demirel et al 2009 kadukova 2016 vannela and verma 2006 crystalline au 0 nanoparticles aunps can be observed in cyanobacteria within the first minutes of incubation with dissolved au iii species present in high concentrations mg l 1 range rosken et al 2014 obviously cyanobacteria can bind and immediately reduce au iii species to aunps suggesting a biosorption more than a bioaccumulation process ag i also shows a strong tendency for reduction to ag 0 so bioaccumulation and or biosorption might be a pathway for the formation of ag b nps in natural waters from geogenic ag i sources kang et al 2014 yin et al 2016 this does not necessarily exclude that dissolved nom also plays a major role in the natural formation of ag b nps in our investigations ag b np formation was only observed in the samples collected from lake waginger see which compared with lake königssee provides an approximately five times higher nom concentration see table a2 but also approximately twice as much of chlorophyll a which is a measure of the number of cyanobacteria and or phototrophic eukaryotes see table a1 present in the lake the data given in fig 2 and table a2 indicate that the comparatively high nom and local total silver concentrations are the most likely explanation for ag b np formation at the surface of lake waginger see approximately 40 2 35 0 08 ng l 1 of the near surface silver was transferred to ag b nps as demonstrated by spicp ms measurements showing that ag b nps in the surface sample from lake waginger see exhibited a particle size ranging from 10 to 30 nm whereas 75 of all of the detected nanoparticles from lake waginger see were 10 15 nm in size fig 1 with spicp ms an ag b np concentration of 0 98 0 12 ng l 1 was determined the discrepancy compared with the concentration measured by cpe et aas 2 35 0 08 ng l 1 table a2 suggests that particles smaller than 10 nm which cannot be detected by spicp ms were also formed thus a substantial mass fraction of ag b nps smaller than 10 nm might exist even though thermal stratification in lake waginger see was not in a fully developed state we could observe a concentration gradient for total silver ranging from a depth of 10 m 1 76 0 89 ng l 1 to the surface of the lake with the highest observed total silver concentration of 5 69 0 33 ng l 1 and a corresponding ag b np concentration of 2 35 0 08 ng l 1 table a2 sampling site ss1 with increasing depth 1 23 m ss1 the ag b np concentration decreased to a constant level of 0 7 0 8 ng l 1 this uniform depth independent distribution of ag b nps is most likely a remnant of the turnover cycles of the lake and it shows that ag b nps unlike dissolved silver species are not accumulated by light sensitive microorganisms and are therefore not transported to the surface of the lake the fact that ag b nps were also observed in deeper water layers where daylight is scarce is a strong indication that ag b np formation does not necessarily require light we were able to clarify some of the aspects of nom and sulfide mediated ag b np formation under dark conditions see following sections an increase in the total silver concentration was also observed near the bottom of lake waginger see table a2 ss1 this increase in silver concentration is most likely caused by the release of silver species from the sediment detritus of the lake ag b nps formed and concentrated at the surface of the lake during summer stratification can be reasonably assumed to be partly or completely dissolved during the turnover cycles of the lake because of the more uniform distribution of ag b nps within the lake during these cycles the state of equilibrium between ag b np formation and ag b np dissolution sigg and lindauer 2015 zook et al 2011 shifts toward ag b np dissolution because of the comparatively low ag b np and total silver concentrations at these times during summer stratification with accumulated silver concentrations at the surface of the lake ag b nps are obviously rebuilt in higher concentrations a completely different behavior was observed in the mesotrophic lake chiemsee tp 8 μg l 1 visibility depth 5 1 m volume 2 109 m3 max depth 73 m another dimictic pre alpine lake which was investigated in our previous work li et al 2016 lake chiemsee receives effluent from several wwtps along its main tributary tiroler achen here we observed a uniform distribution of ag b nps over the lake and negligible differences in ag b np levels 0 3 0 5 ng l 1 within a depth of 0 10 m during summer stratification in this lake water exchange occurs within 1 26 years thus the lake is obviously a reservoir for wwtp based ag b nps submitted by its tributaries 3 2 formation of ag b nps under semi natural conditions there is some evidence that nom and sulfur play a key role in the formation of ag b nps from dissolved ag i species in natural waters analytical techniques developed in our group enable not only the measurement of ag b np concentrations in the sub ng l 1 range with high selectivity and accuracy but also the observation of particle formation via size selective measurements of particles as small as 10 nm in the same concentration range therefore the measurements in the natural environment were supplemented by laboratory experiments with nature related silver concentrations in the ng l 1 range and with toc concentrations 5 mg l 1 obtained by the preparation of appropriate nom reference material solutions therefore we studied the effects of daylight and dark conditions nom content incubation time temperature and the presence of sulfide on the formation and size distribution of ag b nps in detail to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the natural formation of ag b nps in the aquatic environment at ultra trace levels in the ng l 1 range reproducibility and accuracy of experiments is a major issue effects such as the loss of analyte by sorption e g to vessel walls or contamination of solvents and reagents become more dominant and can lead to serious errors for this reason all experiments involving nom and sulfur induced formation of ag b nps from ag i were performed under the strict rules of ultra trace analysis to avoid systematical errors to the extent possible 3 3 nom induced formation of ag b nps from ag i under daylight and dark conditions because ag i is a very photosensitive species the effects of light irradiation on the formation of ag b nps from ag i are assumed to play a key role however we observed only negligible differences in the nom induced formation of ag b nps from ag i under daylight and under dark conditions fig 2 the experiments were performed with an initial ag i concentration of 50 ng l 1 and with nom solutions with a toc of 0 1 or 5 mg l 1 over a time span of 24 h at a temperature of 7 c substantial formation of ag b nps was only observed in solutions with a toc of 5 mg l 1 in this case approximately 10 of the initial ag i content was transferred to ag b nps with a slightly higher conversion rate under dark conditions apparently light irradiation is not a key factor for nom induced formation of ag b nps at environmentally relevant concentrations numerous studies with non natural ag i and nom concentrations have indicated that the reduction of ag i to ag b nps is enabled through the formation of photo induced radical species formed by nom under the influence of light irradiation preferably at elevated temperatures adegboyega et al 2013 akaighe et al 2011 hou et al 2013 lu et al 2016 yin et al 2014 our experiments indicate that other light independent mechanisms that enable the formation of ag b nps at ultra trace levels under dark conditions and at low temperatures must also exist low molecular weight quinones which are usually contained in nom are principally capable of reducing dissolved metallic species to form clusters and finally nanoparticles under dark conditions jiang et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 however there might also exist other unknown nom related mechanisms that trigger the formation of ag b nps from dissolved ag i species under natural conditions 3 4 formation of ag b nps from ag i in the presence of nom and sulfide sulfur is omnipresent in the aquatic environment kaegi et al 2013 kent et al 2014 and shows a strong binding affinity to silver if it is present in lower oxidation states sulfide ions for example immediately form ag2s in the presence of ag i a very stable compound with a solubility product k sp as low as 5 10 51 mol3 l 3 levard et al 2011 2012 25 c ag2s formation can also occur in natural waters e g in anaerobic zones of eutrophic lakes thus the formation of ag b nps not only in the presence of nom but also in the presence of sulfide a final product of the anaerobic digestion of sulfur containing compounds warrants investigation in one of our previous publications we demonstrated that the applied cpe procedure is independent of the composition with respect to the coating of extracted ag b nps for ag2s agnps an extraction efficiency of approximately 90 has been observed hartmann et al 2014 therefore the coatings chemical composition of extracted ag b nps cannot be extinguished using cpe nonetheless substantial changes in the conversion rate of ag i to ag b nps were observed in the presence of sulfide compared with the results obtained when nom was used as reducing agent see previous section the conversion of ag i to ag b nps dark conditions cag i 50 ng l 1 toc 5 mg l 1 7 c 24 h was dramatically increased from 10 to 46 when sulfide 160 μm was added to the solutions figs 2 and 3 at 23 c the conversion rate of ag i to ag b nps toc 5 mg l 1 reached 70 even without the addition of nom 11 7 c and 23 23 c of the initial ag i was transferred to ag b nps moreover the conversion rate was linearly dependent r 2 0 84 at 7 c r 2 0 87 at 23 c on the nom concentration toc 0 5 mg l 1 the size of particles formed from ag i 50 ng l 1 in the presence of nom toc 1 mg l 1 and 5 mg l 1 and sulfide 160 μm was also investigated we observed a pronounced effect of incubation time on the particle size distribution under dark conditions fig 4 shows that the increase of incubation time from 1 to 24 h led to a substantial shift of the particle size distribution from smaller to larger particles especially in the size range from 15 to 25 nm apparently ostwald ripening occurs even at such low metal concentrations leading to the growth of larger particles at the expense of smaller ones hansen et al 2013 in this context we also investigated the particle size distribution obtained in the presence of nom toc 5 mg l 1 with and without sulfide 160 and 0 μm obviously incubation without sulfide led to a substantially broader particle size distribution fig 5 a compared with the size distribution obtained after incubation with sulfide fig 5b the most likely explanation for this observation is that the extraordinarily low solubility product constant of ag2s which is the species most likely formed in the solutions with added sulfide hinders ostwald ripening in the literature a lower size limit of 20 nm has been reported for ag b nps whose size can be determined by spicp ms lee et al 2014 we lowered this size limit dramatically by application of the cpe procedure which eliminates the background caused by dissolved silver species thus particles as small as 10 nm can be measured reliably via cpe spicp ms nevertheless even smaller particles are reasonably assumed to be formed from ag i in the presence of nom and or sulfide the size of such small particles can currently not be determined at sub ng l 1 levels with modern analytical techniques particularly if nom a colloidal suspension with a broad particle size distribution is present in higher concentrations 4 conclusions we discovered that ag b nps can be formed naturally from geogenic silver traces in water bodies if nom and or other ubiquitous reducing agents such as sulfide ions are present in sufficient concentrations moreover light sensitive microorganisms can collect dissolved silver species and transport them to the surface of natural water bodies leading to a considerable local enrichment of silver if some necessary but not fully known conditions are met nanoparticle formation occurs in natural waters even at silver concentrations in the sub ng l 1 range our lab experiments with nature related silver and nom concentrations revealed that particle formation is not necessarily photocontrolled it can occur under dark conditions and at low temperatures such as in deep water layers in pores or even in groundwaters because of the extraordinary chemical affinity between silver and sulfur ag b np formation is enhanced in the presence of traces of sulfide in addition this exceptional affinity leads to the formation of smaller particles that are obviously less prone to ostwald ripening even though sulfide dominates particle formation nom concentration also plays a major role if present in substantial concentrations the lab experiments as well as the observations in the natural lakes show that higher nom concentrations with toc values of approximately 5 mg l 1 substantially increase the formation of ag b nps from traces of dissolved silver species generally the lab investigations reflect the observations made in the natural lakes remarkably well even the sizes of ag b nps measured in surface water of the eutrophic lake are very similar to particle sizes observed in the lab experiments a currently much debated question is whether and to what extend the increasing production of eagnps influences the concentration of ag b nps in surface waters moreover the answer to this question is very important for estimating the influence of transformed engineered ag b nps released by for example wwtps on the biological balance in natural water bodies our findings show that the concentration of naturally formed ag b nps at the surface of an eutrophic pre alpine lake in southern germany is similar to wwtp based ag b np concentrations measured in a river originating in the same region li et al 2016 the river isar receives effluents from a series of wwtps including effluents from the city of munich with 1 43 million inhabitants li et al 2016 final clarification of the influence that ag b nps of different origin might have on the biological balance in natural waters requires knowledge of the chemical composition of the particles rather than their concentration we are currently working on techniques that will enable a highly efficient species preserving enrichment of ag b nps from natural and contaminated waters we are confident that these investigations will enable high resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy

19507,for the first time the natural formation of silver based nanoparticles ag b nps was studied in field investigations of two pre alpine lakes in germany that contain geogenic silver traces in the sub ng l 1 range light sensitive microorganisms most likely accumulate and transport these silver traces from deeper water layers to the surface at the surface of the eutrophic lake approximately 40 of total silver 5 7 ng l 1 consisted of ag b nps whereas in the oligotrophic lake with similar enrichment of silver species no ag b nps were detected additional lab experiments with nature related ag i concentrations in the lower ng l 1 range and natural organic matter with total organic carbon values of 5 mg l 1 revealed that contrary to common interpretation in the literature ag b nps are also or even preferably formed in the dark particle size increases gradually with increasing reaction time showing that ostwald ripening occurs even at such low particle concentrations when sulfide ions are present smaller ag b nps with a narrower size distribution are formed graphical abstract image 1 keywords silver nanoparticles nanoparticle formation environmental analysis cloud point extraction electrothermal atomic absorption spectroscopy single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 1 introduction numerous studies on sources of engineered silver nanoparticles eagnps and their possible release and distribution in the environment have already been reported benn et al 2010 colman et al 2014 kim et al 2010 li et al 2013 2016 mittelman et al 2015 because of a lack of analytical techniques with sufficient selectivity and detection power most of these studies were performed by spiking natural or semi natural samples with eagnps typically in the mg l 1 and μg l 1 ranges and by modeling based on dynamic probabilistic material flow analysis gottschalk et al 2009 2013 sun et al 2014 2015 tan et al 2017 in a recent study the lower q 0 15 and upper q 0 85 concentrations of eagnps present in surface waters were estimated to be 0 40 and 2 78 ng l 1 sun et al 2016 these values are consistent with the findings of our previous study in which we described for the first time the distribution of real silver based nanoparticles ag b nps in representative wastewater treatment plants wwtps that use different input and treatment technologies additionally we clarified the extent to which the effluent of wwtps influences the concentration of ag b nps along a river a gradual progressive increase in the ag b np level of the river over a distance of 150 km with a final ag b np concentration of 1 7 ng l 1 was found li et al 2013 2016 more importantly we further observed that surrounding lakes which do not receive wwtp effluent also showed measurable ag b np concentrations with levels ranging from 0 5 to 1 3 ng l 1 indicating that ag b nps might be formed naturally via the reduction of ag i species by natural organic matter nom it has already been demonstrated that both humic and fulvic acids from different sources river sediment and soil can reduce ag i to ag b nps at elevated temperatures e g at 90 c adegboyega et al 2013 akaighe et al 2011 also irradiation with artificial sunlight was reported to be a key factor for reduction of ag i to ag b nps by nom in the aquatic environment hou et al 2013 lu et al 2016 yin et al 2012 2014 however these laboratory studies were performed at nom concentrations as high as 100 mg l 1 and ag i concentrations as high as 200 mg l 1 adegboyega et al 2013 akaighe et al 2011 hou et al 2013 lu et al 2016 sharma et al 2015 yin et al 2012 2014 strongly exceeding the concentrations of silver pg l 1 to ng l 1 and nom typically 10 mg l 1 in natural waters silvestry rodriguez et al 2008 robust and extensively validated analytical methods recently developed by our group duester et al 2016 hartmann et al 2013 2014 li et al 2013 2016 enable the measurement of ag b nps even in complex matrices such as wwtp influents ensuring high species selectivity and a limit of detection lod as low as 0 2 ng l 1 in combination with single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry spicp ms size selective measurements with a lod of 0 25 ng l 1 for particles as small as 10 nm can also be performed paving the way for a more comprehensive understanding of the formation of ag b nps under natural conditions for this purpose we studied the natural formation of ag b nps in lakes with different eutrophication degrees which do not receive silver from anthropogenic sources these results are compared with the results of similar measurements performed in a lake located in the same area that is polluted with ag b nps from wwtp effluent the measurements in the natural environment are supplemented by laboratory experiments with nature related silver and nom concentrations the effects of light irradiation nom content incubation time as well as temperature and the presence of sulfide on the formation and size distribution of ag b nps are studied in detail in this study we use the term ag b nps to reflect the fact that silver can form a confusing diversity of nanosized particles with different sizes morphologies compositions and surface coatings which usually cannot be fully characterized at environmentally relevant concentrations with current analytical techniques moreover ag b nps exhibit very dynamic behavior such as ostwald ripening even at very low naturally occurring particle concentrations 2 material and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were at least of analytical grade and were used without further purification ultra pure water upw with a resistivity of 18 2 mω cm 1 was obtained from a direct q system millipore billerica usa nom from the suwannee river srnom a reference material from the international humic substance society ihss was used for all experiments involving nom induced ag b np formation we prepared a nom stock solution with a toc concentration of 20 mg l 1 by dissolving the dry powder in upw icp ms measurements revealed trace impurities of 3 ng l 1 ag in this nom stock solution which did not affect the experiments and conclusions an aunp dispersion particle size 56 nm nist reference material 8013 used for spicp ms calibration was obtained from the national institute of standards and technology gaithersburg md usa agnp dispersions particle size 60 nm cagnp 20 mg l 1 used for et aas calibration were obtained from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa the used dissolved ag i standard 1000 mg l 1 was based on agno3 in 3 hno3 triton tx 114 was used as a surfactant for the nanoparticle extraction procedure d penicillamine and disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate were used as complexing agents and acetic acid glacial and sodium acetate anhydrous were used for ph buffering all glassware was thoroughly cleaned by being rinsed with 6 5 hno3 solution followed by steaming with hno3 vapor for 4 h and triplicate washing with upw prior to use 2 2 lake water collection we sampled lake water from two natural lakes in bavaria germany sampling sites are shown in fig a1 table a1 contains the corresponding coordinates gps data the lakes were carefully chosen to represent a typical oligotrophic lake lake königssee and a eutrophic lake lake waginger see table a1 gives more detailed information about the lakes for each site we collected samples at different depths to at least 10 m depth using a limnos water sampler hydro bios kiel germany lake waginger see was sampled to the ground max 23 m which was not possible for lake königssee with a maximum depth of 190 m all water samples were collected in new one way polyvinyl chloride pvc containers 500 ml which were rinsed threefold with the sample before they were filled to volume immediately after collecting each sample we measured its temperature and ph using a ph 110 handheld measurement system vwr darmstadt germany 2 3 instrumentation for et aas measurements we used an aanalyst 800 instrument perkin elmer waltham ma usa equipped with a transversally heated graphite atomizer thga 800 and an as 72 autosampler a silver hollow cathode lamp maasen gmbh reutlingen germany as the light source for aas measurements was operated at the recommended current of 10 ma we integrated the aas signal over 5 s at the absorption line λ 328 1 nm to quantify the silver in the samples high purity argon 99 998 was used as an inert gas during the measurements we measured the total silver concentration and agnp size distribution in single particle mode target mass 107ag with a 7900 icp ms instrument agilent technologies santa clara ca usa equipped with an autosampler asx 520 the agilent masshunter workstation 4 4 software version c 01 04 build 544 3 was used for data evaluation the dwell time was set to 100 μs resulting in 600 000 data points for an acquisition time of 1 min the pump rate was gravimetrically determined as 0 316 ml min 1 for calibration we followed the recently published protocol peters et al 2014 in brief we determined the transport efficiency i e the part of all sample particles finally reaching the detector for the spicp ms measurement using aunp nist reference material 8013 the transport efficiency for au and ag are identical however aunps are more stable than agnps and are available as a certified reference material we carried out a second calibration using a 1 μg l 1 dissolved silver standard solution agno3 in hno3 in single particle mode to determine element sensitivity all optimized system parameters for spicp ms mode are given in table a3 we performed total silver concentration measurements by icp ms with 107ag as the target mass driven in helium collision mode as internal standards we chose 151eu and 115in the measured lake water samples were not filtered but were stabilized by the addition of 3 25 w w hno3 for calibration we applied a properly diluted ag i stock solution 1000 mg l 1 in hno3 to obtain calibration solutions in the upper pg l 1 and lower ng l 1 range we conducted toc measurements of all real environmental samples which were measured undiluted without filtration using a toc l csh csn analyzer shimadzu kyoto japan all samples were mixed thoroughly seconds before the toc analysis started for calibration we prepared standard solutions containing 10 and 100 mg l 1 toc based on potassium hydrogen phthalate solutions in upw 2 4 selective enrichment of ag b nps from water samples we used cloud point extraction cpe a robust and thoroughly validated method developed by our group duester et al 2016 hartmann et al 2013 2014 li et al 2016 to separate and enrich ag b nps from environmental and artificial samples dissolved ag i species and matrix components are efficiently retained by this procedure paving a way to an undisturbed and highly sensitive measurement of ag b nps e g by cpe et aas or cpe spicp ms for cpe we mixed 40 ml samples containing ag b nps and ag i species with 3 0 ml of saturated ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt edta solution 1 0 ml of saturated d penicillamine solution 400 μl of 1 m sodium acetate solution 100 μl of 1 25 m acetic acid and 1 ml of 10 w w tx 114 in 50 ml tapered polypropylene sample tubes the mixtures were incubated at 40 c for 30 min after centrifugation 12 min 4500 g the samples were cooled for 5 min in an ice bath the aqueous supernatants were subsequently removed by decanting the remaining viscous surfactant droplets containing the enriched and separated ag b nps were diluted either with ethanol for et aas measurement or with ethanol and upw for icp ms measurement 2 5 determination of ag b nps by et aas et aas is very sensitive for silver and requires a sample volume of only 20 μl organic matrix constituents can be easily eliminated with an appropriate furnace temperature program which has already been described in our previous publications hartmann et al 2013 2014 hartmann and schuster 2013 li et al 2013 et aas uses a high precision pipetting system for sample application which can handle small solvent volumes with higher viscosity therefore we diluted the surfactant droplet obtained by cpe with only 100 μl of ethanol allowing for a high enrichment factor of 80 and an lod for silver as low as 0 2 ng l 1 we calibrated the system identically to the cpe procedure used for et aas measurement for this purpose we applied particle stock solutions of 60 nm citrate coated agnps which were freed from impurities of dissolved silver species by dialysis prior to use 2 6 determination and size distribution of ag b nps by spicp ms icp ms uses nebulizers for sample introduction which cannot handle highly concentrated surfactant solutions therefore we diluted the surfactant droplet obtained by cpe with 400 μl of ethanol and upw to a total volume of 10 ml additionally we prepared all calibration solutions and dispersions in the same uniform manner because of the almost complete separation of particles from dissolved silver species by the cpe procedure the limit of detection for particles measured by spicp ms was improved substantially and the smallest detectable particle size was reduced leading to a hitherto unequaled lod of 0 25 ng l 1 for particles as small as 10 nm 2 7 sample preparation for nom and sulfide induced formation of ag b nps under semi natural conditions to observe potential ag b np formation from dissolved ag i species under the influence of nom we added a solution of dissolved ag i agno3 in 3 hno3 to 40 ml of aqueous srnom solutions representing toc concentrations of 0 1 and 5 mg l 1 yielding in a final ag i concentration of 50 ng l 1 one way polypropylene vials were used as reaction vessels which were wrapped with several layers of aluminum foil to prevent the incidence of light control experiments allowing the incidence of light were also performed for these experiments we used glass vessels which allow better light transmission in addition to reaction samples containing dissolved ag i we prepared reference samples containing nom but no ag i to observe potential silver backgrounds related to the nom material furthermore we added 1 ml of hoac naoac ph buffer 8 203 g naoac in 3 29 ml of hoac and 36 71 ml of upw to each reaction mixture we prepared all nom ag i combinations in triplicate to assess the reproducibility of nom induced formation experiments the mixtures were incubated for 24 h at 7 and 23 c afterwards we added 50 μl of a 0 1 m nh3 solution to adjust the ph of the sample and the mixtures were then subjected to ag b np concentration analysis by cpe et aas and cpe spicp ms for determination of their particle concentrations and size distributions respectively in a second experimental setup we investigated the influence of dissolved sulfide we prepared all nom ag i model mixtures as previously described whereas 160 μl of 4 mm na2s solution which was obtained by dissolving 0 6632 g of na2s in 5 ml of upw was added to all samples sulfide was added ultimately to ensure identical reaction times for all samples 3 results and discussions 3 1 formation of ag b nps in natural lakes in this study we investigated two dimictic mainly groundwater fed natural lakes located within the pre alpine area in southern germany the lakes with different eutrophication degrees see table a1 were investigated with respect to the proportion of ag b nps as a part of the total silver concentration at various water depths both lakes showed similar total silver concentrations of 0 84 0 52 lowest value to 5 69 0 33 ng l 1 highest value within the upper water layers see table a2 the lakes as well as their small tributaries do not receive wwtp effluent which might contain silver species from anthropogenic sources the oligotrophic fjord like lake königssee volume 5 108 m3 max depth 190 m exhibits a high water quality total phosphorus tp 5 μg l 1 visibility depth 10 5 m motor boats are not allowed and there are no agricultural influences the eutrophic lake waginger see tp 24 μg l 1 visibility depth 2 8 m volume 9 107 m3 max depth 27 m is protected from wwtp effluent by a perimeter sewerage system whereas the lake clearly shows agricultural influences nevertheless fertilization with sewage sludge a potential source for the introduction of ag b nps or other silver species into the lake is not applied around the lake and tributaries unfortunately very little is known about natural silver concentrations in the hydrosphere the estimated silver concentration in the oceans is 0 04 ng l 1 schutz and turekian 1965 other authors ranville and flegal 2005 have reported oceanic silver concentrations ranging from 0 02 to 10 5 ng l 1 depending on the location where the samples were collected the silver concentrations measured in the pre alpine lakes lie within this concentration range we therefore anticipate that the measured silver concentrations are of geogenic origin total organic carbon toc as a measure of nom concentration in the lakes is consistent with the eutrophication degree ranging from an average of 1 32 mg l 1 lake königssee to 5 10 mg l 1 lake waginger see whereby only negligible variations of the toc values were observed with increasing water depth see table a2 this consistency also applies to the weakly basic ph values which range from 7 7 to 8 3 we examined lake waginger see in april 2017 during the beginning of thermal stratification lake königssee was examined in september 2016 and showed a pronounced thermal stratification with a distinct thermocline between the epilimnion and the metalimnion in the case of lake waginger see we collected samples from the surface of the lake to its bottom lake königssee is very deep 100 m 190 m we therefore only collected samples to the upper metalimnion which was identical with the visibility depth at this time in both lakes the highest total silver concentrations were always observed near the water surface and the concentrations gradually decreased with increasing water depth in lake königssee we could not detect any silver 0 77 ng l 1 in the transition zone between the epilimnion and the metalimnion or in the metalimnion to the visibility depth of approximately 10 m this observation is interesting because it implies that there must be a mechanism that transports silver species from lower water layers to the surface of the lake the most likely explanation for this unexpected observation is that light sensitive microorganisms e g cyanobacteria which are omnipresent in the pre alpine lakes accumulate silver and transport it to the surface of the lake where the light intensity for photosynthesis is highest in natural and in contaminated water bodies microorganisms can serve as a major sink for heavy metals acharya and apte 2013 anjana et al 2007 awasthi and rai 2004 blanco et al 1999 cain et al 2008 markou et al 2015 cyanobacteria for example can bind heavy metal species via a metabolically mediated active uptake bioaccumulation and or a passive biosorption process via their exopolysaccharide eps coating de philippis et al 2011 bioaccumulation requires living cells and is a comparatively slow process biosorption which does not necessarily require living cells follows faster kinetics reaching a sorption maximum within hours de philippis et al 2003 2011 demirel et al 2009 kadukova 2016 vannela and verma 2006 crystalline au 0 nanoparticles aunps can be observed in cyanobacteria within the first minutes of incubation with dissolved au iii species present in high concentrations mg l 1 range rosken et al 2014 obviously cyanobacteria can bind and immediately reduce au iii species to aunps suggesting a biosorption more than a bioaccumulation process ag i also shows a strong tendency for reduction to ag 0 so bioaccumulation and or biosorption might be a pathway for the formation of ag b nps in natural waters from geogenic ag i sources kang et al 2014 yin et al 2016 this does not necessarily exclude that dissolved nom also plays a major role in the natural formation of ag b nps in our investigations ag b np formation was only observed in the samples collected from lake waginger see which compared with lake königssee provides an approximately five times higher nom concentration see table a2 but also approximately twice as much of chlorophyll a which is a measure of the number of cyanobacteria and or phototrophic eukaryotes see table a1 present in the lake the data given in fig 2 and table a2 indicate that the comparatively high nom and local total silver concentrations are the most likely explanation for ag b np formation at the surface of lake waginger see approximately 40 2 35 0 08 ng l 1 of the near surface silver was transferred to ag b nps as demonstrated by spicp ms measurements showing that ag b nps in the surface sample from lake waginger see exhibited a particle size ranging from 10 to 30 nm whereas 75 of all of the detected nanoparticles from lake waginger see were 10 15 nm in size fig 1 with spicp ms an ag b np concentration of 0 98 0 12 ng l 1 was determined the discrepancy compared with the concentration measured by cpe et aas 2 35 0 08 ng l 1 table a2 suggests that particles smaller than 10 nm which cannot be detected by spicp ms were also formed thus a substantial mass fraction of ag b nps smaller than 10 nm might exist even though thermal stratification in lake waginger see was not in a fully developed state we could observe a concentration gradient for total silver ranging from a depth of 10 m 1 76 0 89 ng l 1 to the surface of the lake with the highest observed total silver concentration of 5 69 0 33 ng l 1 and a corresponding ag b np concentration of 2 35 0 08 ng l 1 table a2 sampling site ss1 with increasing depth 1 23 m ss1 the ag b np concentration decreased to a constant level of 0 7 0 8 ng l 1 this uniform depth independent distribution of ag b nps is most likely a remnant of the turnover cycles of the lake and it shows that ag b nps unlike dissolved silver species are not accumulated by light sensitive microorganisms and are therefore not transported to the surface of the lake the fact that ag b nps were also observed in deeper water layers where daylight is scarce is a strong indication that ag b np formation does not necessarily require light we were able to clarify some of the aspects of nom and sulfide mediated ag b np formation under dark conditions see following sections an increase in the total silver concentration was also observed near the bottom of lake waginger see table a2 ss1 this increase in silver concentration is most likely caused by the release of silver species from the sediment detritus of the lake ag b nps formed and concentrated at the surface of the lake during summer stratification can be reasonably assumed to be partly or completely dissolved during the turnover cycles of the lake because of the more uniform distribution of ag b nps within the lake during these cycles the state of equilibrium between ag b np formation and ag b np dissolution sigg and lindauer 2015 zook et al 2011 shifts toward ag b np dissolution because of the comparatively low ag b np and total silver concentrations at these times during summer stratification with accumulated silver concentrations at the surface of the lake ag b nps are obviously rebuilt in higher concentrations a completely different behavior was observed in the mesotrophic lake chiemsee tp 8 μg l 1 visibility depth 5 1 m volume 2 109 m3 max depth 73 m another dimictic pre alpine lake which was investigated in our previous work li et al 2016 lake chiemsee receives effluent from several wwtps along its main tributary tiroler achen here we observed a uniform distribution of ag b nps over the lake and negligible differences in ag b np levels 0 3 0 5 ng l 1 within a depth of 0 10 m during summer stratification in this lake water exchange occurs within 1 26 years thus the lake is obviously a reservoir for wwtp based ag b nps submitted by its tributaries 3 2 formation of ag b nps under semi natural conditions there is some evidence that nom and sulfur play a key role in the formation of ag b nps from dissolved ag i species in natural waters analytical techniques developed in our group enable not only the measurement of ag b np concentrations in the sub ng l 1 range with high selectivity and accuracy but also the observation of particle formation via size selective measurements of particles as small as 10 nm in the same concentration range therefore the measurements in the natural environment were supplemented by laboratory experiments with nature related silver concentrations in the ng l 1 range and with toc concentrations 5 mg l 1 obtained by the preparation of appropriate nom reference material solutions therefore we studied the effects of daylight and dark conditions nom content incubation time temperature and the presence of sulfide on the formation and size distribution of ag b nps in detail to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the natural formation of ag b nps in the aquatic environment at ultra trace levels in the ng l 1 range reproducibility and accuracy of experiments is a major issue effects such as the loss of analyte by sorption e g to vessel walls or contamination of solvents and reagents become more dominant and can lead to serious errors for this reason all experiments involving nom and sulfur induced formation of ag b nps from ag i were performed under the strict rules of ultra trace analysis to avoid systematical errors to the extent possible 3 3 nom induced formation of ag b nps from ag i under daylight and dark conditions because ag i is a very photosensitive species the effects of light irradiation on the formation of ag b nps from ag i are assumed to play a key role however we observed only negligible differences in the nom induced formation of ag b nps from ag i under daylight and under dark conditions fig 2 the experiments were performed with an initial ag i concentration of 50 ng l 1 and with nom solutions with a toc of 0 1 or 5 mg l 1 over a time span of 24 h at a temperature of 7 c substantial formation of ag b nps was only observed in solutions with a toc of 5 mg l 1 in this case approximately 10 of the initial ag i content was transferred to ag b nps with a slightly higher conversion rate under dark conditions apparently light irradiation is not a key factor for nom induced formation of ag b nps at environmentally relevant concentrations numerous studies with non natural ag i and nom concentrations have indicated that the reduction of ag i to ag b nps is enabled through the formation of photo induced radical species formed by nom under the influence of light irradiation preferably at elevated temperatures adegboyega et al 2013 akaighe et al 2011 hou et al 2013 lu et al 2016 yin et al 2014 our experiments indicate that other light independent mechanisms that enable the formation of ag b nps at ultra trace levels under dark conditions and at low temperatures must also exist low molecular weight quinones which are usually contained in nom are principally capable of reducing dissolved metallic species to form clusters and finally nanoparticles under dark conditions jiang et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 however there might also exist other unknown nom related mechanisms that trigger the formation of ag b nps from dissolved ag i species under natural conditions 3 4 formation of ag b nps from ag i in the presence of nom and sulfide sulfur is omnipresent in the aquatic environment kaegi et al 2013 kent et al 2014 and shows a strong binding affinity to silver if it is present in lower oxidation states sulfide ions for example immediately form ag2s in the presence of ag i a very stable compound with a solubility product k sp as low as 5 10 51 mol3 l 3 levard et al 2011 2012 25 c ag2s formation can also occur in natural waters e g in anaerobic zones of eutrophic lakes thus the formation of ag b nps not only in the presence of nom but also in the presence of sulfide a final product of the anaerobic digestion of sulfur containing compounds warrants investigation in one of our previous publications we demonstrated that the applied cpe procedure is independent of the composition with respect to the coating of extracted ag b nps for ag2s agnps an extraction efficiency of approximately 90 has been observed hartmann et al 2014 therefore the coatings chemical composition of extracted ag b nps cannot be extinguished using cpe nonetheless substantial changes in the conversion rate of ag i to ag b nps were observed in the presence of sulfide compared with the results obtained when nom was used as reducing agent see previous section the conversion of ag i to ag b nps dark conditions cag i 50 ng l 1 toc 5 mg l 1 7 c 24 h was dramatically increased from 10 to 46 when sulfide 160 μm was added to the solutions figs 2 and 3 at 23 c the conversion rate of ag i to ag b nps toc 5 mg l 1 reached 70 even without the addition of nom 11 7 c and 23 23 c of the initial ag i was transferred to ag b nps moreover the conversion rate was linearly dependent r 2 0 84 at 7 c r 2 0 87 at 23 c on the nom concentration toc 0 5 mg l 1 the size of particles formed from ag i 50 ng l 1 in the presence of nom toc 1 mg l 1 and 5 mg l 1 and sulfide 160 μm was also investigated we observed a pronounced effect of incubation time on the particle size distribution under dark conditions fig 4 shows that the increase of incubation time from 1 to 24 h led to a substantial shift of the particle size distribution from smaller to larger particles especially in the size range from 15 to 25 nm apparently ostwald ripening occurs even at such low metal concentrations leading to the growth of larger particles at the expense of smaller ones hansen et al 2013 in this context we also investigated the particle size distribution obtained in the presence of nom toc 5 mg l 1 with and without sulfide 160 and 0 μm obviously incubation without sulfide led to a substantially broader particle size distribution fig 5 a compared with the size distribution obtained after incubation with sulfide fig 5b the most likely explanation for this observation is that the extraordinarily low solubility product constant of ag2s which is the species most likely formed in the solutions with added sulfide hinders ostwald ripening in the literature a lower size limit of 20 nm has been reported for ag b nps whose size can be determined by spicp ms lee et al 2014 we lowered this size limit dramatically by application of the cpe procedure which eliminates the background caused by dissolved silver species thus particles as small as 10 nm can be measured reliably via cpe spicp ms nevertheless even smaller particles are reasonably assumed to be formed from ag i in the presence of nom and or sulfide the size of such small particles can currently not be determined at sub ng l 1 levels with modern analytical techniques particularly if nom a colloidal suspension with a broad particle size distribution is present in higher concentrations 4 conclusions we discovered that ag b nps can be formed naturally from geogenic silver traces in water bodies if nom and or other ubiquitous reducing agents such as sulfide ions are present in sufficient concentrations moreover light sensitive microorganisms can collect dissolved silver species and transport them to the surface of natural water bodies leading to a considerable local enrichment of silver if some necessary but not fully known conditions are met nanoparticle formation occurs in natural waters even at silver concentrations in the sub ng l 1 range our lab experiments with nature related silver and nom concentrations revealed that particle formation is not necessarily photocontrolled it can occur under dark conditions and at low temperatures such as in deep water layers in pores or even in groundwaters because of the extraordinary chemical affinity between silver and sulfur ag b np formation is enhanced in the presence of traces of sulfide in addition this exceptional affinity leads to the formation of smaller particles that are obviously less prone to ostwald ripening even though sulfide dominates particle formation nom concentration also plays a major role if present in substantial concentrations the lab experiments as well as the observations in the natural lakes show that higher nom concentrations with toc values of approximately 5 mg l 1 substantially increase the formation of ag b nps from traces of dissolved silver species generally the lab investigations reflect the observations made in the natural lakes remarkably well even the sizes of ag b nps measured in surface water of the eutrophic lake are very similar to particle sizes observed in the lab experiments a currently much debated question is whether and to what extend the increasing production of eagnps influences the concentration of ag b nps in surface waters moreover the answer to this question is very important for estimating the influence of transformed engineered ag b nps released by for example wwtps on the biological balance in natural water bodies our findings show that the concentration of naturally formed ag b nps at the surface of an eutrophic pre alpine lake in southern germany is similar to wwtp based ag b np concentrations measured in a river originating in the same region li et al 2016 the river isar receives effluents from a series of wwtps including effluents from the city of munich with 1 43 million inhabitants li et al 2016 final clarification of the influence that ag b nps of different origin might have on the biological balance in natural waters requires knowledge of the chemical composition of the particles rather than their concentration we are currently working on techniques that will enable a highly efficient species preserving enrichment of ag b nps from natural and contaminated waters we are confident that these investigations will enable high resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy

19508,the much over looked element in new sanitation the transport systems which bridge the source and treatment facilities is the focus of this study the knowledge of rheological properties of concentrated domestic slurry is essential for the design of the waste collection and transport systems to investigate these properties samples were collected from a pilot sanitation system in the netherlands two types of slurries were examined black water consisting of human faecal waste urine and flushed water from vacuum toilets and black water with ground kitchen waste rheograms of these slurries were obtained using a narrow gap rotating rheometer and modelled using a herschel bulkley model the effect of concentration on the slurry are described through the changes in the parameters of the herschel bulkley model a detailed method is proposed on estimating the parameters for the rheological models for the black water yield stress and consistency index follow an increasing power law with the concentration and the behaviour index follows a decreasing power law the influence of temperature on the viscosity of the slurry is described using an arrhenius type relation the viscosity of black water decreases with temperature as for the black water mixed with ground kitchen waste it is found that the viscosity increases with concentration and decreases with temperature the viscosity of black water with ground kitchen waste is found to be higher than that of black water which can be attributed to the presence of larger particles in the slurry graphical abstract image 1 keywords rheology concentrated domestic slurry novel sanitation parameter estimation error analysis concentration and temperature influence 1 introduction critical evaluation of our current sanitation system has led to the introduction of a new sanitation paradigm see e g kujawa roeleveld et al 2006 tervahauta et al 2013 zeeman et al 2008 the new paradigm is based on source separation of the waste as depicted in fig 1 and minimizing the use of water for transport this source separated waste consists primarily of faecal matter from vacuum toilets toilet paper and grinded kitchen waste arising from the use of food waste disposers these domestic waste streams are subsequently treated with the objective to minimize energy use during treatment while maximizing the recovery of resources present in the wastewater namely bio energy generated from the anaerobic transformation of organic material nutrients nitrogen phosphorus potassium and sulphur and water although significant advancements have been made with respect to treatment processes in the new sanitation systems the collection and transport aspects of the wastewater bridging source e g households or industrial complexes and treatment facilities have been grossly neglected transport of the collected slurries is of particular interest when the new paradigm will be applied in a large scale for any further development of the source separated sanitation approach both transport and treatment are inseparable parts of the entire sanitation system and requires full assessment in order to evaluate its potentials for future waste handling larsen et al 2009 in order to design and operate a transport system for source separated concentrated domestic slurry cds composed of black water blw that consists of human faecal waste urine and flushed water from vacuum toilets and grinded kitchen waste gkw detailed knowledge about the physical properties of transported liquid particularly its rheology is essential chilton et al 1996 slatter and thomas 1995 thomas and wilson 1987 it has been shown that even the basic aspects of a pipeline design for example the expected flow regime laminar or turbulent and pressure drop can be misjudged without a rigorous understanding of the rheology eshtiaghi et al 2012 food waste disposers fwd are an integral part of the new sanitation paradigm they macerate the kitchen food waste and dispose them into the sewer system fwds have been identified by many researchers as an effective domestic food waste management strategy iacovidou et al 2012a lundie and peters 2005 nakakubo et al 2012 they may increase resource recovery in particular when connected to an anaerobic digester braun and wellinger 2003 iacovidou et al 2012b although many researchers have recommended fwds they have also indicated that for a large scale implementation or for higher market penetration the implications of fwds environment and conventional sewer system with respect to its transportation need to be examined an overview of this can be found in iacovidou et al 2012a therefore it is only important that the transport of these gkw is assessed 1 1 current state of art the state of the art on the solids content of wastewater in traditional sewer systems is summarised in the book solids in sewers ashley et al 2005 although it provides great details regarding the origin and physio chemical properties of the wastewater rheological properties have not been characterised it is common that a viscosity close to pure water is considered for the design of traditional sewer systems hager 2010 however cds is much less diluted compared to the traditional domestic waste tervahauta et al 2013 therefore it is expected to have a considerably larger apparent viscosity many studies have investigated the rheological behaviour of the primary secondary and aerobic anaerobic digested sludge in treatment plants as summarised in eshtiaghi et al 2013a b ratkovich et al 2013 it was concluded that the sludge is a non newtonian fluid showing a shear thinning thixotropic behaviour on the existence of the yield stress no agreement was found however the obtained results are not directly applicable to the cds because primary and secondary sludge do not represent fresh faecal sludge and they undergo different treatments that change the structure of suspended organic matter present in the slurry a study on fresh faecal sludge by woolley et al 2014 is the only available literature on this unfortunately their study doesn t give much information on procedure and collection to make the study useful for analysis the inclusion of waste from fwds also increases the flow complexity of these slurries apparently the rheological knowledge of sludge in treatment plants cannot be directly used to reliably estimate the rheological properties of cds therefore proper measurement needs to be conducted to investigate these properties the current work presents measurements that were carried out to characterise the rheological properties of cds the influence of two parameters namely temperature and concentration is examined based on the outcome of the measurement the fluid models that describe the rheological behaviour of cds are introduced also the inclusion of gkw is accessed from a rheological aspect of these slurries a summary of the investigated concentration is presented in table 1 2 method and material 2 1 cds sample two samples of domestic slurry were collected slurry 1 blw consisting of human faecal waste toilet paper and flushed water was collected from a vacuum collection experimental facility in the building of desah b v in sneek the netherlands the vacuum collection system consists of a urine separation vacuum toilet connected to a collection tank through a vacuum pump the vacuum pump is fitted with a cutter upstream fig 2 b to cut the incoming waste slurry 2 blw with gkw was collected from the housing project noorderhoek consisting of 215 houses in sneek netherlands these houses have source separation implemented in them along with vacuum toilets and food kitchen waste disposers slurry 2 is collected from a collection tank as shown in fig 2a it has to be noted that prior to the collection the cds passes through a cutter pump as shown in fig 2b which transfers it from a vacuum tank to the collection tank as schematized in fig 2a in some vacuum stations the waste is directly transferred from the vacuum tank to the treatment plant by sewage pumps without any intermediate collection tanks in such configurations there are cutters installed upstream of the tank to break down the large lumps the samples thus collected were immediately transported to the laboratory in a cool box at 4 c 1 c the procedure followed the advice for the preservation of wastewater samples given in association 2005 in order to retard biological activity and microbiological decomposition in the samples in order to preserve the original moisture content and avoid reactions with air the samples were kept in sealed containers once in laboratory the samples were maintained refrigerated at the same conditions minimizing changes in the organic compounds during storage until testing to obtain slurry 1 as fresh as possible the collection tank was emptied and cleaned a day before sampling and the toilets were connected to the tank at the morning of collection day in addition to obtain a good representative sample slurry 2 was collected during the evening at the peak of usage of the toilets and food waste disposers the maximum retention time of the samples was five hours at the room temperature the samples were tested within 3 days of its collection 2 1 1 sample preparation existence of large particles in a sample puts a constraint on the geometry of the rotational rheometer in order to ensure a continuum description of the flow a gap size to a maximum particle size ratio should be 10 or more to guarantee a shear flow van wazer 1963 to ensure this both slurries 1 and 2 were screened by passing through a mesh with opening size of 2 mm for removing coarse particles which only comprise a negligible portion of the total solids in the wastes hereafter the samples were sieved using a mesh of opening size of 0 125 mm which was carefully chosen to minimise the material loss during sieving and to maximise the particle to rheometer gap ratio through this procedure the total suspended solids tss that is lost from sieving is between 10 and 20 this low percentage of loss can be attributed to the presence of a grinder pump as shown in fig 2b which transfers the cds from the vacuum tank to the collection tank the cumulative particle size distribution for both slurries 1 and 2 presented in fig 3 is used to calculate the minimum gap size as a standard the minimum gap size must be 10 times the d90 representative particle size of the slurry the d90 for slurry 1 is 51 μ m and for slurry 2 is 80 μ m therefore a gap size of 800 μ m would be satisfactory for both slurries the tss upon collection of slurry 1 was 2 6 tss wt wt and slurry 2 was 1 8 tss wt wt the samples were then concentrated to study its rheology at various concentrations using gravity settling slurry 1 was concentrated to 7 2 tss wt wt and slurry 2 3 tss wt wt the obtained supernatant of each sample was respectively used to dilute the sample to obtain different concentrations slurry 1 was further concentrated to 11 2 tss wt wt by centrifugation at 10 g for 1 min and then diluted to 10 using the supernatant the centrifugation procedure was adapted to make sure that the settled particles were suspended upon gentle shaking this was deemed necessary to ensure that the original flocs were maintained with minimal changes 2 2 rheometry commonly used rheometers capable of measuring fundamental rheological properties of sludge are placed into two general categories eshtiaghi et al 2013a b rotational rheometer and capillary rheometers advantages and disadvantages of each category have been described in eshtiaghi et al 2013a b seyssiecq et al 2003 slatter 1997 the rotational rheometer has become widely accepted in recent years as the most common class of rheometer utilised in sludge rheology eshtiaghi et al 2013a b and is also used in this study the rheology measurements were performed with a mcr302 instrument from anton paar graz austria equipped with a standard cup and bob cup diameter 29 29 mm bob diameter 27 mm bob length 40 5 mm this geometry has a gap size 1145 μ m satisfying the minimum required gap size mentioned in section 2 1 a peltier temperature control system was used to set and maintain the temperature with an accuracy of 0 1 c the rheology was measured at 10 c 20 c 30 c and 40 c for each concentration to determine the influence of temperature to avoid evaporation during the measurements a lid was installed on the cup to cover the sample it is suggested that for slurries of this nature a pre shear is required to erase material memory and to have similar initial conditions for all samples baudez et al 2013 2011 therefore for each investigation the sample was pre sheared for 5 min at a shear rate of 1000 s 1 and then left to rest for 5 min these conditions were found suitably to reproduce results the rheogram for each investigation was obtained by a step wise shear ramp up procedure and recording the steady state shear stress for every set shear rate through the step wise shear ramp up the inertia of the equipment is avoided by waiting for steady state at each measurement point baroutian et al 2013 this ensures that the inertia of the fluid and the equipment is eliminated a ramp down procedure is avoided as it would considerably include the inertia of the fluid as the fluid that is rotating at a higher angular velocity is slowed down which causes a delay in reaching steady state the shear rate range was so determined to avoid the occurrence of secondary flows thota radhakrishnan et al 2015 at the end of every test the used sample was discarded and a fresh sample was used for the next test 2 3 rheological model rheological models are an empirical representation of the obtained rheogram graphical representation of shear stress vs shear rate for design purposes the rheological models are used rather than the rheograms as rheology is the single most important representation of the hydrodynamic behaviour any discrepancy with the rheological prediction using the model would lead to poor process design as rheology is usually extrapolated for turbulent flow predictions slatter 1997 therefore the choice of the rheological model is critical in this aspect the models used commonly are τ μ n γ the newtonian model that represents a linear relationship between shear stress and shear rate equation 1 τ k o γ n o the ostwald model that represents a power law relationship between the shear stress and shear rate showing a shear thinning behaviour with n 1 equation 2 τ τ y b μ b γ the bingham model represents a fluid with a yield stress the yield stress is the minimum shear stress required for the fluid to start flowing equation 3 τ τ y h b k h b γ n h b the herschel bulkley hb model is used to represent a shear thinning fluid with a yield stress equation 4 τ τ y c h b μ c h b γ k c h b γ n c h b the combined herschel bulkley chb used by baudez baudez et al 2013 2011 represents well the linear shear thinning behaviour at high shear rates giving a constant high shear viscosity it is merely a hb model coupled with a newtonian model equation 5 elaborate reviews on the models available have been already provided in articles by seyssiecq et al 2003 and eshtiaghi et al 2013a b 2 4 statistical assessment to access the predictive capability of the selected rheological models mentioned in section 2 3 the following statistical descriptors are used the root mean square error rmse measures the overall accuracy of the model the squared sum error ssr measures the square of the absolute deviation of the model 6 r m s e i 1 n τ i τ ˆ i 2 n 7 s s r i 1 n τ i τ ˆ i 2 2 5 parameter estimation the goal of the parameter estimation step is to determine a unique set of model parameters for the obtained rheometric data ratkovich et al 2013 this is done using optimisation algorithms by minimizing the square of the residuals between the model and the experimental data although this step seems straightforward by using commercially available software implicit assumptions in the optimization algorithms violation of boundaries of the model parameters and over parameterization can lead to obtaining parameters that are often not unique or physically meaningless care must be taken in estimating these parameters and for this reason two optimization algorithms have been used in the study and shall be detailed below 2 5 1 genetic algorithm trust region gtr minimization of the square of the residuals is a quadratic problem most gradient based optimization algorithms are very sensitive to the initial point and thus obtain only some local minima in the proximity of the initial point as most rheological models are non linear there may exist many local minima identifying the most optimal minima preferably the global minimum of these satisfying the boundary conditions in place requires the optimization procedure to run many initial points for which the results of the genetic algorithm provide valuable information i e it results in a global map of the location of local minima which in turn are candidates to be investigated further using some gradient based search algorithm a genetic algorithm is one such tool that helps in achieving this in a systematic manner in this algorithm an initial population of a random set of parameters within the boundary specified is generated in our case the boundaries depend on the parameters and in general are 0 τ y 0 k and 0 n 1 using the objective function the corresponding fitness values for each set of parameters is determined using this information a new generation is produced by applying three genetic operations namely reproduction crossover and mutation chaudhuri et al 2006 these operations ensure that a minimum that is found is investigated and also new sets of parameters are added to avoid being stuck in a local minimum more information on this approach can be found in chaudhuri et al 2006 rooki et al 2012 each population that is generated is likely to converge to the global minimum although a stand alone genetic algorithm is sufficient for convergence but to ensure this a gradient based optimization algorithm is coupled with it after a number of generations termination from the genetic algorithm a part of the population with high scores of fitness value based on the rmse equation 6 is taken and fed to a gradient based optimization procedure a trust region byrd et al 1987 optimization which is a simple gradient based algorithm is used in this case hereafter the parameter set with the lowest rmse equation 6 is chosen as the optimal solution this entire algorithm is schematized in fig 4 in this study this algorithm is used in general for all modelling purposes 2 5 2 golden section search gss the golden section search method was proposed by ohen and blick 1990 for determining model parameters of the robertson stiff fluid model this numerical scheme was later modified by kelessidis et al 2006 to be used for predicting the parameters for a hb fluid model in their paper kelessidis et al 2006 the authors demonstrated that the gss method lead to meaningful and appropriate values for the model parameters this algorithm is particularly helpful when the parameters are correlated which is the case with the hb model and will be discussed later the algorithm essentially de couples the parameters and reduces the correlation in their estimation this numerical scheme has been used in this paper and is presented in fig 5 in this study this algorithm is only used to find more accurate solutions for the hb model 3 results and discussion 3 1 rheology the rheograms for slurry 1 as shown in fig 6 a few representative rheograms and slurry 2 as shown in fig 7 a few representative rheograms at various concentrations and temperatures were obtained using the shear rate ramp up procedure mentioned in section 2 2 for slurry 1 the concentrations ranged between 0 4 and 11 2 tss wt wt and for slurry 2 the concentration ranged between 0 8 and 3 0 tss wt wt for each sample the influence of temperature was evaluated at 10 c 20 c 30 c and 40 c the steady state laminar data was used in creating these rheograms this was ensured by identifying the onset of secondary flows thota radhakrishnan et al 2015 and removing it from the obtained data more details on identifying laminar flow and secondary flow along with the range of shear rates can be found here thota radhakrishnan et al 2015 this therefore influenced the maximum applicable shear rate for each concentration and temperature depending on the onset of secondary flows from the rheograms it can be observed that the shear stress increases non linearly with respect to the shear rate at high tss concentrations in slurry 1 at low tss concentration the shear stress is a linear function of shear rate for both slurry 1 and 2 as for the influence of temperature it is observed that the increase in temperature reduces the shear stress this can be attributed to the increase in thermal motion of the molecules and thereby reducing the forces between the molecules resulting in an ease of the flow of the slurry thus lowering the viscosity the influence of increasing the solid content in the slurry can be seen in fig 8 which is slurry 1 at various concentrations but at a fixed temperature of 20 c the illustration shows an increase in shear stress with the increase in shear rate this observation has also been reported in many other studies baroutian et al 2013 this increase is due to the increase in interactions between the constituent particles present in the slurry the increase in interactions results in increase in the energy loss thereby requiring more energy i e high shear stress to keep the slurry in a prescribed motion as mentioned in baroutian et al 2013 polysaccharides and proteins are likely the determining constituents for the rheological properties of these slurries 3 2 rheological modelling the rheological models described in section 2 3 were used to describe the obtained rheology data it must be noted that this process of fitting the experimental data to a rheological model is tedious it requires a priori information and a structured methodology this is due to the empirical nature of the models that are used to fit the data in practice a single model is used to fit an entire data set but this fails due to the correlation between the parameters ratkovich et al 2013 this can be seen from the errors fig 7 from the model fitting using the gtr algorithm to the different models the model comparison is done using the residuals from the same optimisation algorithm so as to not bias the results therefore based on the rmse errors from the parameter estimation the best model is chosen to represent the rheology data at low concentrations there is a linear relationship between the shear stress and shear rate but at concentrations 3 tss it is observed there exists a non linear non newtonian relationship the yield stress isn t a measured quantity it is one that is derived as a parameter from the model essentially extrapolating the obtained rheology data it is therefore difficult to estimate the true yield stress and a minimum threshold yield stress of 0 01 pa is taken for considering its existence this value is used to determine the appropriate model at low tss from tables 2 and 3 although the bingham model fits better at lower tss a linear model is chosen as the yield stress from the bingham model is 0 01 pa the power law model was the least suitable for all the cases at higher tss the chb model used by baroutian et al 2013 is a better fit than that of the hb model this can entirely be attributed to the increase in the degree of freedom of the optimisation by adding another parameter but to further investigate the applicability of the hb and chb models the identifiability of their parameters is to be accessed to assess the identifiability of the parameters principal component analysis pca is used this is done using the jacobian of the models from equation 8 and equation 12 singular value decomposition of the matrix j t j equation 17 gives information about the identifiability of the parameters the diagonal terms of the matrix σ is the variance of the parameter combination and the matrix v gives the singular values fig 9 illustrate the singular values of the parameter combination it can be seen that the chb model performs poorly as the parameter combinations are co dependent this implies that there cannot be a meaningful parameter estimation using this model but when accessing the eigen vectors of the hb model fig 9 it can be seen that the parameter combinations are less co dependent therefore the hb model is a more relevant model to be used 8 j τ 1 τ y h b τ 1 k h b τ 1 n h b τ n τ y h b τ n k h b τ n n h b 9 τ n τ y h b 1 10

section 2 5 2 is used this is a better algorithm in estimating the parameters for the hb model as can be seen from the rmse ratios in fig 10 as this method is only applicable to the hb model it is not applied to the entire dataset for this the gtr algorithm is used to identify for which of the dataset a hb model applies and then the gss algorithm is used on these datasets the final estimated parameters for the models are shown in tables 4 and 5 for the sake of representation the hb model is used because the hb model is a generalised model for including both the bingham with n 1 and the newtonian model with τ y 0 and n 1 3 3 effect of concentration and temperature many studies have already concluded that changes in concentrations and temperature influence the rheology of the slurries to a great extent baroutian et al 2013 nicky eshtiaghi et al 2013a b mori et al 2006 ratkovich et al 2013 sanin 2002 seyssiecq et al 2003 studying the influence of temperature and concentration to the flow of the fluid i e rheology is considered important because many transportation applications and slurry handling equipment such as mixers aerators and heat exchangers encounter gradients of temperature and concentration these gradients may occur due to the design of such equipment or the hydrodynamic flow in them centrifugation settling mixing an interesting outcome of the rheological modelling is to breakdown the influence of concentration and temperature on the rheology to the different parameters in the model as each parameter represents a particular phenomenon in the behaviour of the fluid flow it is easier to understand its contribution to the flow behaviour when studied separately the hb model will be used as a general non newtonian model to represent the entire range of slurry rheology studying the influence of temperature and concentration through the rheological parameters imposes an extra step of caution and this is to quantify the uncertainty in the prediction of the rheology using the parameters that have been estimated using the algorithms what this means is that there is an inherent error presented in the model s prediction with the parameters estimated this error represents an uncertainty band of the prediction for the models parameters to represent the behaviour of the slurry to the influence of temperature and concentration the error uncertainty bands from the model prediction must not overlap with one another implying that for example investigating the influence of temperature on 10 slurry as shown in fig 11 a the uncertainty band of the model prediction of 10 slurry at different temperatures must not overlap if they do then the model parameters regressed do not represent the influence of temperature as is seen from experimental observation therefore before evaluating the influence of temperature and concentration on the rheological parameters an assessment of the uncertainty of the prediction of the models must be performed this is to remove the uncertainty of incorrectly identifying the influence of conditions of the variables this is done through gauss s law of error propagation the uncertainty in the prediction is found using equation 19 which is for a hb model where the covariance is obtained using equation 18 from this it can be observed that the uncertainty band for evaluating the effect of temperature fig 11a and concentration fig 11b do not overlap thereby emphasizing its influence 18 c o v a r i a n c e o f h e r s c h e l b u l k l e y σ r e s i d u e s 2 j t j 1 σ τ y h b 2 σ τ y h b σ k h b σ τ y

particular trend can be derived although from figs 6 and 8 it can clearly be seen that the shear stress decreases for a given shear rate implying that the viscosity decreases with temperature the same does not reflect on the individual parameters for this reason the influence of the temperature on the rheology is resolved through its effect on the apparent viscosity an arrhenius type equation abu jdayil et al 2010 battistoni et al 1993 pevere et al 2009 yang et al 2009 is used for this purpose the apparent viscosity ratio of shear stress by shear rate at a shear rate can be described using equation 20 as a function of temperature where a and e are constants 20 μ a p p a e e t on taking the ratio of the apparent viscosities at two different temperatures we get equation 21 which is independent of the constant a implying if the apparent viscosity at a particular temperature is known with the knowledge of e rheological temperature constant c the apparent viscosity at another temperature can be calculated 21 μ a p p t 1 μ a p p t 2 e e 1 t 1 1 t 2 accessing the value of e for apparent viscosity ratios at various concentrations and shear rates an average value of 7 5 c was obtained fig 13 and this holds good for slurry 1 and slurry 2 knowing the value of e is useful as in the following sections parameter models are introduced for the slurry at 20 c and to obtain the rheology at other temperatures this rheological temperature constant can be used 3 3 2 yield stress τ y the yield stress specifies the minimum stress that is required for the slurry to start flowing below which it can impede the flow over the range of concentrations the yield stress increases exponentially as illustrated in fig 14 there is a pronounced exponential behaviour in slurry 1 whereas in slurry 2 an underlying behaviour is not identified this could be that the sample size is small and at low concentrations an exponential model fig 15 a equation 22 5 deviation from the measurements is used describe the influence of concentration on yield stress of slurry 1 at 20 c chosen as a representative this model type has been reportedly used in other works eshtiaghi et al 2013a b seyssiecq et al 2003 it can be seen that the yield stress is effectively 0 below a threshold concentration and then increases above this concentration the exponential behaviour in slurry 1 can be explained through the increase in particle interactions as the concentration increases these interactions are weak physical forces between particles and molecules although these forces are weak with the increase in concentrations the number of neighbouring particles in interaction increase and thus creating a structure the yield stress tends to zero at low concentrations and is physically meaningful only after reaching a certain concentration also observed in equation 22 a threshold concentration where its effects can be felt for our case of slurry 1 this is 1 5 tss 22 τ y 0 012 c 1 5 2 1 for c 1 5 tss wt wt τ y 0 for c 1 5 tss wt wt 3 3 3 consistency index k the consistency index gives an idea about the viscosity of the slurry although both the τ y and n are required to compute the absolute viscosity k can be used to perceive the viscous behaviour of the slurry over the range of concentrations the consistency index exponentially increases fig 16 as a representative equation 23 derived with 5 deviation describes the concentration dependence of the consistency index of slurry 1 at 20 c fig 15b it takes the value of the viscosity of water at 0 tss of the slurry the exponential increase of the flow index is observed in both slurry 1 and 2 clearly the observed behaviour which is similar to the yield stress can also be attributed to the forces between the constituent particles 23 k 0 002 e 0 48 c 3 3 4 behaviour index n the behaviour index describes the shear thinning behaviour of the slurry this is an important parameter as it governs the influence of the change in shear rate on the shear stress newtonian fluids have the behaviour index as 1 meaning that an increase in shear rate increases the shear stress proportional to the consistency index but with non newtonian fluids with the behaviour index less than 1 implies that a change in shear rate might not necessarily reflect in a sizeable change in the shear stress even though the consistency index has a high value this is essentially the shear thinning behaviour observed in these slurries as a representative equation 24 derived with 5 deviation describes the behaviour index as a function of concentration for slurry 1 at 20 c fig 15c over the range of concentrations the onset of shear thinning behaviour is at a concentration of 2 5 tss above this concentration the behaviour index decreases gradually with the concentration of the slurry fig 17 this behaviour may be a reflection of the fluid structures referred to by quemada 1998 as a structural unit su introducing the concept of effective volume fraction of the sus as a basis for rheological models the shear thinning behaviour occurs with the breakup of fluid structures and the constituent particles aligning in the direction of the flow at low shear rates there isn t enough shearing to breakup these fluid structures but as the shearing rate increases more fluid structures are broken and the constituent particles align with the flow thereby making it easier to flow i e shear thinning the increase in concentration causes an increase in fluid structures present and by that the proportion of fluid structures broken is higher i e increased shear thinning 24 n 0 97 0 16 log c 1 7 for c 2 5 tss wt wt n 1 for c 2 5 tss wt wt 3 4 effect of adding kitchen waste comparing the viscosities of both the slurries it is observed that the viscosity of slurry 2 is on an average approximate averaging over all concentration and 3 different shear rates 50 more than that of slurry 1 fig 18 this could be explained by comparing the particle size distribution of both slurries fig 3 slurry 2 has a higher d90 than that of slurry 1 section 2 1 adding to this the proportion of larger particles is higher in slurry 2 than in slurry 1 fig 3 signifying that the particle size distribution of kitchen waste tends towards larger particles therefore this affirms that the particle size distribution plays a major role in determining the viscosities of slurries of this nature that being said the sample collected here is small to put forth a strong conclusion about the addition of kitchen waste further research could shed light on these aspects 3 5 comparison with waste water treatment plant sludge a select few of the available literature data is compared with the slurries studied in this paper primary and secondary sludge from markis et al 2014 and anaerobic digested sludge from baudez et al 2011 is compared in comparison to the waste water treatment plant wwtp sludge the cds behaves similarly with respect to the non newtonian characteristics fig 19 at low concentrations the non newtonian behaviour is predominantly that of bingham type with a low yield stress this can be seen for slurry 1 with 5 tss wt wt primary sludge 2 8 tss wt wt and anaerobic digested sludge at 1 8 tss wt wt as the concentration of suspended solids increase the shear thinning behaviour comes into play with a higher yield stress therefore leading to a herschel bulkley type behaviour slurry 1 at 11 2 tss wt wt and secondary sludge at 3 7 tss wt wt show similar herschel bulkley behaviour 4 conclusion to study the hydrodynamic behaviour of concentrated domestic slurries 2 sample slurries from a pilot project involving novel sanitations systems were collected slurry 1 contained black water and slurry 2 black water with ground kitchen waste these samples were later processed and studied for their rheology using a narrow gap couette rheometer chosen appropriately for their particle size distribution rheograms were obtained for various tss concentration and temperatures of slurries among the rheological models explored the herschel bulkley hb model fits best the purpose of describing the obtained rheograms in general the viscosity increases with increase in tss concentration and decreases with increase in temperature and this reflects on the parameters to describe the effect of temperature on the rheology of the slurry an arrhenius type equation is used the influence of concentration on the rheology is described using the changes in these parameters the yield stress and consistency index are exponentially related to the concentration whereas the behaviour index has a decreasing power law relation comparing the viscosities of slurry 1 and 2 reveals that the addition of kitchen waste increases the viscosity the knowledge on the rheology thus collected can be used to predict the pressure drop in the transport of cds and thus can be used to evaluate and design different sanitation options

19508,the much over looked element in new sanitation the transport systems which bridge the source and treatment facilities is the focus of this study the knowledge of rheological properties of concentrated domestic slurry is essential for the design of the waste collection and transport systems to investigate these properties samples were collected from a pilot sanitation system in the netherlands two types of slurries were examined black water consisting of human faecal waste urine and flushed water from vacuum toilets and black water with ground kitchen waste rheograms of these slurries were obtained using a narrow gap rotating rheometer and modelled using a herschel bulkley model the effect of concentration on the slurry are described through the changes in the parameters of the herschel bulkley model a detailed method is proposed on estimating the parameters for the rheological models for the black water yield stress and consistency index follow an increasing power law with the concentration and the behaviour index follows a decreasing power law the influence of temperature on the viscosity of the slurry is described using an arrhenius type relation the viscosity of black water decreases with temperature as for the black water mixed with ground kitchen waste it is found that the viscosity increases with concentration and decreases with temperature the viscosity of black water with ground kitchen waste is found to be higher than that of black water which can be attributed to the presence of larger particles in the slurry graphical abstract image 1 keywords rheology concentrated domestic slurry novel sanitation parameter estimation error analysis concentration and temperature influence 1 introduction critical evaluation of our current sanitation system has led to the introduction of a new sanitation paradigm see e g kujawa roeleveld et al 2006 tervahauta et al 2013 zeeman et al 2008 the new paradigm is based on source separation of the waste as depicted in fig 1 and minimizing the use of water for transport this source separated waste consists primarily of faecal matter from vacuum toilets toilet paper and grinded kitchen waste arising from the use of food waste disposers these domestic waste streams are subsequently treated with the objective to minimize energy use during treatment while maximizing the recovery of resources present in the wastewater namely bio energy generated from the anaerobic transformation of organic material nutrients nitrogen phosphorus potassium and sulphur and water although significant advancements have been made with respect to treatment processes in the new sanitation systems the collection and transport aspects of the wastewater bridging source e g households or industrial complexes and treatment facilities have been grossly neglected transport of the collected slurries is of particular interest when the new paradigm will be applied in a large scale for any further development of the source separated sanitation approach both transport and treatment are inseparable parts of the entire sanitation system and requires full assessment in order to evaluate its potentials for future waste handling larsen et al 2009 in order to design and operate a transport system for source separated concentrated domestic slurry cds composed of black water blw that consists of human faecal waste urine and flushed water from vacuum toilets and grinded kitchen waste gkw detailed knowledge about the physical properties of transported liquid particularly its rheology is essential chilton et al 1996 slatter and thomas 1995 thomas and wilson 1987 it has been shown that even the basic aspects of a pipeline design for example the expected flow regime laminar or turbulent and pressure drop can be misjudged without a rigorous understanding of the rheology eshtiaghi et al 2012 food waste disposers fwd are an integral part of the new sanitation paradigm they macerate the kitchen food waste and dispose them into the sewer system fwds have been identified by many researchers as an effective domestic food waste management strategy iacovidou et al 2012a lundie and peters 2005 nakakubo et al 2012 they may increase resource recovery in particular when connected to an anaerobic digester braun and wellinger 2003 iacovidou et al 2012b although many researchers have recommended fwds they have also indicated that for a large scale implementation or for higher market penetration the implications of fwds environment and conventional sewer system with respect to its transportation need to be examined an overview of this can be found in iacovidou et al 2012a therefore it is only important that the transport of these gkw is assessed 1 1 current state of art the state of the art on the solids content of wastewater in traditional sewer systems is summarised in the book solids in sewers ashley et al 2005 although it provides great details regarding the origin and physio chemical properties of the wastewater rheological properties have not been characterised it is common that a viscosity close to pure water is considered for the design of traditional sewer systems hager 2010 however cds is much less diluted compared to the traditional domestic waste tervahauta et al 2013 therefore it is expected to have a considerably larger apparent viscosity many studies have investigated the rheological behaviour of the primary secondary and aerobic anaerobic digested sludge in treatment plants as summarised in eshtiaghi et al 2013a b ratkovich et al 2013 it was concluded that the sludge is a non newtonian fluid showing a shear thinning thixotropic behaviour on the existence of the yield stress no agreement was found however the obtained results are not directly applicable to the cds because primary and secondary sludge do not represent fresh faecal sludge and they undergo different treatments that change the structure of suspended organic matter present in the slurry a study on fresh faecal sludge by woolley et al 2014 is the only available literature on this unfortunately their study doesn t give much information on procedure and collection to make the study useful for analysis the inclusion of waste from fwds also increases the flow complexity of these slurries apparently the rheological knowledge of sludge in treatment plants cannot be directly used to reliably estimate the rheological properties of cds therefore proper measurement needs to be conducted to investigate these properties the current work presents measurements that were carried out to characterise the rheological properties of cds the influence of two parameters namely temperature and concentration is examined based on the outcome of the measurement the fluid models that describe the rheological behaviour of cds are introduced also the inclusion of gkw is accessed from a rheological aspect of these slurries a summary of the investigated concentration is presented in table 1 2 method and material 2 1 cds sample two samples of domestic slurry were collected slurry 1 blw consisting of human faecal waste toilet paper and flushed water was collected from a vacuum collection experimental facility in the building of desah b v in sneek the netherlands the vacuum collection system consists of a urine separation vacuum toilet connected to a collection tank through a vacuum pump the vacuum pump is fitted with a cutter upstream fig 2 b to cut the incoming waste slurry 2 blw with gkw was collected from the housing project noorderhoek consisting of 215 houses in sneek netherlands these houses have source separation implemented in them along with vacuum toilets and food kitchen waste disposers slurry 2 is collected from a collection tank as shown in fig 2a it has to be noted that prior to the collection the cds passes through a cutter pump as shown in fig 2b which transfers it from a vacuum tank to the collection tank as schematized in fig 2a in some vacuum stations the waste is directly transferred from the vacuum tank to the treatment plant by sewage pumps without any intermediate collection tanks in such configurations there are cutters installed upstream of the tank to break down the large lumps the samples thus collected were immediately transported to the laboratory in a cool box at 4 c 1 c the procedure followed the advice for the preservation of wastewater samples given in association 2005 in order to retard biological activity and microbiological decomposition in the samples in order to preserve the original moisture content and avoid reactions with air the samples were kept in sealed containers once in laboratory the samples were maintained refrigerated at the same conditions minimizing changes in the organic compounds during storage until testing to obtain slurry 1 as fresh as possible the collection tank was emptied and cleaned a day before sampling and the toilets were connected to the tank at the morning of collection day in addition to obtain a good representative sample slurry 2 was collected during the evening at the peak of usage of the toilets and food waste disposers the maximum retention time of the samples was five hours at the room temperature the samples were tested within 3 days of its collection 2 1 1 sample preparation existence of large particles in a sample puts a constraint on the geometry of the rotational rheometer in order to ensure a continuum description of the flow a gap size to a maximum particle size ratio should be 10 or more to guarantee a shear flow van wazer 1963 to ensure this both slurries 1 and 2 were screened by passing through a mesh with opening size of 2 mm for removing coarse particles which only comprise a negligible portion of the total solids in the wastes hereafter the samples were sieved using a mesh of opening size of 0 125 mm which was carefully chosen to minimise the material loss during sieving and to maximise the particle to rheometer gap ratio through this procedure the total suspended solids tss that is lost from sieving is between 10 and 20 this low percentage of loss can be attributed to the presence of a grinder pump as shown in fig 2b which transfers the cds from the vacuum tank to the collection tank the cumulative particle size distribution for both slurries 1 and 2 presented in fig 3 is used to calculate the minimum gap size as a standard the minimum gap size must be 10 times the d90 representative particle size of the slurry the d90 for slurry 1 is 51 μ m and for slurry 2 is 80 μ m therefore a gap size of 800 μ m would be satisfactory for both slurries the tss upon collection of slurry 1 was 2 6 tss wt wt and slurry 2 was 1 8 tss wt wt the samples were then concentrated to study its rheology at various concentrations using gravity settling slurry 1 was concentrated to 7 2 tss wt wt and slurry 2 3 tss wt wt the obtained supernatant of each sample was respectively used to dilute the sample to obtain different concentrations slurry 1 was further concentrated to 11 2 tss wt wt by centrifugation at 10 g for 1 min and then diluted to 10 using the supernatant the centrifugation procedure was adapted to make sure that the settled particles were suspended upon gentle shaking this was deemed necessary to ensure that the original flocs were maintained with minimal changes 2 2 rheometry commonly used rheometers capable of measuring fundamental rheological properties of sludge are placed into two general categories eshtiaghi et al 2013a b rotational rheometer and capillary rheometers advantages and disadvantages of each category have been described in eshtiaghi et al 2013a b seyssiecq et al 2003 slatter 1997 the rotational rheometer has become widely accepted in recent years as the most common class of rheometer utilised in sludge rheology eshtiaghi et al 2013a b and is also used in this study the rheology measurements were performed with a mcr302 instrument from anton paar graz austria equipped with a standard cup and bob cup diameter 29 29 mm bob diameter 27 mm bob length 40 5 mm this geometry has a gap size 1145 μ m satisfying the minimum required gap size mentioned in section 2 1 a peltier temperature control system was used to set and maintain the temperature with an accuracy of 0 1 c the rheology was measured at 10 c 20 c 30 c and 40 c for each concentration to determine the influence of temperature to avoid evaporation during the measurements a lid was installed on the cup to cover the sample it is suggested that for slurries of this nature a pre shear is required to erase material memory and to have similar initial conditions for all samples baudez et al 2013 2011 therefore for each investigation the sample was pre sheared for 5 min at a shear rate of 1000 s 1 and then left to rest for 5 min these conditions were found suitably to reproduce results the rheogram for each investigation was obtained by a step wise shear ramp up procedure and recording the steady state shear stress for every set shear rate through the step wise shear ramp up the inertia of the equipment is avoided by waiting for steady state at each measurement point baroutian et al 2013 this ensures that the inertia of the fluid and the equipment is eliminated a ramp down procedure is avoided as it would considerably include the inertia of the fluid as the fluid that is rotating at a higher angular velocity is slowed down which causes a delay in reaching steady state the shear rate range was so determined to avoid the occurrence of secondary flows thota radhakrishnan et al 2015 at the end of every test the used sample was discarded and a fresh sample was used for the next test 2 3 rheological model rheological models are an empirical representation of the obtained rheogram graphical representation of shear stress vs shear rate for design purposes the rheological models are used rather than the rheograms as rheology is the single most important representation of the hydrodynamic behaviour any discrepancy with the rheological prediction using the model would lead to poor process design as rheology is usually extrapolated for turbulent flow predictions slatter 1997 therefore the choice of the rheological model is critical in this aspect the models used commonly are τ μ n γ the newtonian model that represents a linear relationship between shear stress and shear rate equation 1 τ k o γ n o the ostwald model that represents a power law relationship between the shear stress and shear rate showing a shear thinning behaviour with n 1 equation 2 τ τ y b μ b γ the bingham model represents a fluid with a yield stress the yield stress is the minimum shear stress required for the fluid to start flowing equation 3 τ τ y h b k h b γ n h b the herschel bulkley hb model is used to represent a shear thinning fluid with a yield stress equation 4 τ τ y c h b μ c h b γ k c h b γ n c h b the combined herschel bulkley chb used by baudez baudez et al 2013 2011 represents well the linear shear thinning behaviour at high shear rates giving a constant high shear viscosity it is merely a hb model coupled with a newtonian model equation 5 elaborate reviews on the models available have been already provided in articles by seyssiecq et al 2003 and eshtiaghi et al 2013a b 2 4 statistical assessment to access the predictive capability of the selected rheological models mentioned in section 2 3 the following statistical descriptors are used the root mean square error rmse measures the overall accuracy of the model the squared sum error ssr measures the square of the absolute deviation of the model 6 r m s e i 1 n τ i τ ˆ i 2 n 7 s s r i 1 n τ i τ ˆ i 2 2 5 parameter estimation the goal of the parameter estimation step is to determine a unique set of model parameters for the obtained rheometric data ratkovich et al 2013 this is done using optimisation algorithms by minimizing the square of the residuals between the model and the experimental data although this step seems straightforward by using commercially available software implicit assumptions in the optimization algorithms violation of boundaries of the model parameters and over parameterization can lead to obtaining parameters that are often not unique or physically meaningless care must be taken in estimating these parameters and for this reason two optimization algorithms have been used in the study and shall be detailed below 2 5 1 genetic algorithm trust region gtr minimization of the square of the residuals is a quadratic problem most gradient based optimization algorithms are very sensitive to the initial point and thus obtain only some local minima in the proximity of the initial point as most rheological models are non linear there may exist many local minima identifying the most optimal minima preferably the global minimum of these satisfying the boundary conditions in place requires the optimization procedure to run many initial points for which the results of the genetic algorithm provide valuable information i e it results in a global map of the location of local minima which in turn are candidates to be investigated further using some gradient based search algorithm a genetic algorithm is one such tool that helps in achieving this in a systematic manner in this algorithm an initial population of a random set of parameters within the boundary specified is generated in our case the boundaries depend on the parameters and in general are 0 τ y 0 k and 0 n 1 using the objective function the corresponding fitness values for each set of parameters is determined using this information a new generation is produced by applying three genetic operations namely reproduction crossover and mutation chaudhuri et al 2006 these operations ensure that a minimum that is found is investigated and also new sets of parameters are added to avoid being stuck in a local minimum more information on this approach can be found in chaudhuri et al 2006 rooki et al 2012 each population that is generated is likely to converge to the global minimum although a stand alone genetic algorithm is sufficient for convergence but to ensure this a gradient based optimization algorithm is coupled with it after a number of generations termination from the genetic algorithm a part of the population with high scores of fitness value based on the rmse equation 6 is taken and fed to a gradient based optimization procedure a trust region byrd et al 1987 optimization which is a simple gradient based algorithm is used in this case hereafter the parameter set with the lowest rmse equation 6 is chosen as the optimal solution this entire algorithm is schematized in fig 4 in this study this algorithm is used in general for all modelling purposes 2 5 2 golden section search gss the golden section search method was proposed by ohen and blick 1990 for determining model parameters of the robertson stiff fluid model this numerical scheme was later modified by kelessidis et al 2006 to be used for predicting the parameters for a hb fluid model in their paper kelessidis et al 2006 the authors demonstrated that the gss method lead to meaningful and appropriate values for the model parameters this algorithm is particularly helpful when the parameters are correlated which is the case with the hb model and will be discussed later the algorithm essentially de couples the parameters and reduces the correlation in their estimation this numerical scheme has been used in this paper and is presented in fig 5 in this study this algorithm is only used to find more accurate solutions for the hb model 3 results and discussion 3 1 rheology the rheograms for slurry 1 as shown in fig 6 a few representative rheograms and slurry 2 as shown in fig 7 a few representative rheograms at various concentrations and temperatures were obtained using the shear rate ramp up procedure mentioned in section 2 2 for slurry 1 the concentrations ranged between 0 4 and 11 2 tss wt wt and for slurry 2 the concentration ranged between 0 8 and 3 0 tss wt wt for each sample the influence of temperature was evaluated at 10 c 20 c 30 c and 40 c the steady state laminar data was used in creating these rheograms this was ensured by identifying the onset of secondary flows thota radhakrishnan et al 2015 and removing it from the obtained data more details on identifying laminar flow and secondary flow along with the range of shear rates can be found here thota radhakrishnan et al 2015 this therefore influenced the maximum applicable shear rate for each concentration and temperature depending on the onset of secondary flows from the rheograms it can be observed that the shear stress increases non linearly with respect to the shear rate at high tss concentrations in slurry 1 at low tss concentration the shear stress is a linear function of shear rate for both slurry 1 and 2 as for the influence of temperature it is observed that the increase in temperature reduces the shear stress this can be attributed to the increase in thermal motion of the molecules and thereby reducing the forces between the molecules resulting in an ease of the flow of the slurry thus lowering the viscosity the influence of increasing the solid content in the slurry can be seen in fig 8 which is slurry 1 at various concentrations but at a fixed temperature of 20 c the illustration shows an increase in shear stress with the increase in shear rate this observation has also been reported in many other studies baroutian et al 2013 this increase is due to the increase in interactions between the constituent particles present in the slurry the increase in interactions results in increase in the energy loss thereby requiring more energy i e high shear stress to keep the slurry in a prescribed motion as mentioned in baroutian et al 2013 polysaccharides and proteins are likely the determining constituents for the rheological properties of these slurries 3 2 rheological modelling the rheological models described in section 2 3 were used to describe the obtained rheology data it must be noted that this process of fitting the experimental data to a rheological model is tedious it requires a priori information and a structured methodology this is due to the empirical nature of the models that are used to fit the data in practice a single model is used to fit an entire data set but this fails due to the correlation between the parameters ratkovich et al 2013 this can be seen from the errors fig 7 from the model fitting using the gtr algorithm to the different models the model comparison is done using the residuals from the same optimisation algorithm so as to not bias the results therefore based on the rmse errors from the parameter estimation the best model is chosen to represent the rheology data at low concentrations there is a linear relationship between the shear stress and shear rate but at concentrations 3 tss it is observed there exists a non linear non newtonian relationship the yield stress isn t a measured quantity it is one that is derived as a parameter from the model essentially extrapolating the obtained rheology data it is therefore difficult to estimate the true yield stress and a minimum threshold yield stress of 0 01 pa is taken for considering its existence this value is used to determine the appropriate model at low tss from tables 2 and 3 although the bingham model fits better at lower tss a linear model is chosen as the yield stress from the bingham model is 0 01 pa the power law model was the least suitable for all the cases at higher tss the chb model used by baroutian et al 2013 is a better fit than that of the hb model this can entirely be attributed to the increase in the degree of freedom of the optimisation by adding another parameter but to further investigate the applicability of the hb and chb models the identifiability of their parameters is to be accessed to assess the identifiability of the parameters principal component analysis pca is used this is done using the jacobian of the models from equation 8 and equation 12 singular value decomposition of the matrix j t j equation 17 gives information about the identifiability of the parameters the diagonal terms of the matrix σ is the variance of the parameter combination and the matrix v gives the singular values fig 9 illustrate the singular values of the parameter combination it can be seen that the chb model performs poorly as the parameter combinations are co dependent this implies that there cannot be a meaningful parameter estimation using this model but when accessing the eigen vectors of the hb model fig 9 it can be seen that the parameter combinations are less co dependent therefore the hb model is a more relevant model to be used 8 j τ 1 τ y h b τ 1 k h b τ 1 n h b τ n τ y h b τ n k h b τ n n h b 9 τ n τ y h b 1 10

section 2 5 2 is used this is a better algorithm in estimating the parameters for the hb model as can be seen from the rmse ratios in fig 10 as this method is only applicable to the hb model it is not applied to the entire dataset for this the gtr algorithm is used to identify for which of the dataset a hb model applies and then the gss algorithm is used on these datasets the final estimated parameters for the models are shown in tables 4 and 5 for the sake of representation the hb model is used because the hb model is a generalised model for including both the bingham with n 1 and the newtonian model with τ y 0 and n 1 3 3 effect of concentration and temperature many studies have already concluded that changes in concentrations and temperature influence the rheology of the slurries to a great extent baroutian et al 2013 nicky eshtiaghi et al 2013a b mori et al 2006 ratkovich et al 2013 sanin 2002 seyssiecq et al 2003 studying the influence of temperature and concentration to the flow of the fluid i e rheology is considered important because many transportation applications and slurry handling equipment such as mixers aerators and heat exchangers encounter gradients of temperature and concentration these gradients may occur due to the design of such equipment or the hydrodynamic flow in them centrifugation settling mixing an interesting outcome of the rheological modelling is to breakdown the influence of concentration and temperature on the rheology to the different parameters in the model as each parameter represents a particular phenomenon in the behaviour of the fluid flow it is easier to understand its contribution to the flow behaviour when studied separately the hb model will be used as a general non newtonian model to represent the entire range of slurry rheology studying the influence of temperature and concentration through the rheological parameters imposes an extra step of caution and this is to quantify the uncertainty in the prediction of the rheology using the parameters that have been estimated using the algorithms what this means is that there is an inherent error presented in the model s prediction with the parameters estimated this error represents an uncertainty band of the prediction for the models parameters to represent the behaviour of the slurry to the influence of temperature and concentration the error uncertainty bands from the model prediction must not overlap with one another implying that for example investigating the influence of temperature on 10 slurry as shown in fig 11 a the uncertainty band of the model prediction of 10 slurry at different temperatures must not overlap if they do then the model parameters regressed do not represent the influence of temperature as is seen from experimental observation therefore before evaluating the influence of temperature and concentration on the rheological parameters an assessment of the uncertainty of the prediction of the models must be performed this is to remove the uncertainty of incorrectly identifying the influence of conditions of the variables this is done through gauss s law of error propagation the uncertainty in the prediction is found using equation 19 which is for a hb model where the covariance is obtained using equation 18 from this it can be observed that the uncertainty band for evaluating the effect of temperature fig 11a and concentration fig 11b do not overlap thereby emphasizing its influence 18 c o v a r i a n c e o f h e r s c h e l b u l k l e y σ r e s i d u e s 2 j t j 1 σ τ y h b 2 σ τ y h b σ k h b σ τ y

particular trend can be derived although from figs 6 and 8 it can clearly be seen that the shear stress decreases for a given shear rate implying that the viscosity decreases with temperature the same does not reflect on the individual parameters for this reason the influence of the temperature on the rheology is resolved through its effect on the apparent viscosity an arrhenius type equation abu jdayil et al 2010 battistoni et al 1993 pevere et al 2009 yang et al 2009 is used for this purpose the apparent viscosity ratio of shear stress by shear rate at a shear rate can be described using equation 20 as a function of temperature where a and e are constants 20 μ a p p a e e t on taking the ratio of the apparent viscosities at two different temperatures we get equation 21 which is independent of the constant a implying if the apparent viscosity at a particular temperature is known with the knowledge of e rheological temperature constant c the apparent viscosity at another temperature can be calculated 21 μ a p p t 1 μ a p p t 2 e e 1 t 1 1 t 2 accessing the value of e for apparent viscosity ratios at various concentrations and shear rates an average value of 7 5 c was obtained fig 13 and this holds good for slurry 1 and slurry 2 knowing the value of e is useful as in the following sections parameter models are introduced for the slurry at 20 c and to obtain the rheology at other temperatures this rheological temperature constant can be used 3 3 2 yield stress τ y the yield stress specifies the minimum stress that is required for the slurry to start flowing below which it can impede the flow over the range of concentrations the yield stress increases exponentially as illustrated in fig 14 there is a pronounced exponential behaviour in slurry 1 whereas in slurry 2 an underlying behaviour is not identified this could be that the sample size is small and at low concentrations an exponential model fig 15 a equation 22 5 deviation from the measurements is used describe the influence of concentration on yield stress of slurry 1 at 20 c chosen as a representative this model type has been reportedly used in other works eshtiaghi et al 2013a b seyssiecq et al 2003 it can be seen that the yield stress is effectively 0 below a threshold concentration and then increases above this concentration the exponential behaviour in slurry 1 can be explained through the increase in particle interactions as the concentration increases these interactions are weak physical forces between particles and molecules although these forces are weak with the increase in concentrations the number of neighbouring particles in interaction increase and thus creating a structure the yield stress tends to zero at low concentrations and is physically meaningful only after reaching a certain concentration also observed in equation 22 a threshold concentration where its effects can be felt for our case of slurry 1 this is 1 5 tss 22 τ y 0 012 c 1 5 2 1 for c 1 5 tss wt wt τ y 0 for c 1 5 tss wt wt 3 3 3 consistency index k the consistency index gives an idea about the viscosity of the slurry although both the τ y and n are required to compute the absolute viscosity k can be used to perceive the viscous behaviour of the slurry over the range of concentrations the consistency index exponentially increases fig 16 as a representative equation 23 derived with 5 deviation describes the concentration dependence of the consistency index of slurry 1 at 20 c fig 15b it takes the value of the viscosity of water at 0 tss of the slurry the exponential increase of the flow index is observed in both slurry 1 and 2 clearly the observed behaviour which is similar to the yield stress can also be attributed to the forces between the constituent particles 23 k 0 002 e 0 48 c 3 3 4 behaviour index n the behaviour index describes the shear thinning behaviour of the slurry this is an important parameter as it governs the influence of the change in shear rate on the shear stress newtonian fluids have the behaviour index as 1 meaning that an increase in shear rate increases the shear stress proportional to the consistency index but with non newtonian fluids with the behaviour index less than 1 implies that a change in shear rate might not necessarily reflect in a sizeable change in the shear stress even though the consistency index has a high value this is essentially the shear thinning behaviour observed in these slurries as a representative equation 24 derived with 5 deviation describes the behaviour index as a function of concentration for slurry 1 at 20 c fig 15c over the range of concentrations the onset of shear thinning behaviour is at a concentration of 2 5 tss above this concentration the behaviour index decreases gradually with the concentration of the slurry fig 17 this behaviour may be a reflection of the fluid structures referred to by quemada 1998 as a structural unit su introducing the concept of effective volume fraction of the sus as a basis for rheological models the shear thinning behaviour occurs with the breakup of fluid structures and the constituent particles aligning in the direction of the flow at low shear rates there isn t enough shearing to breakup these fluid structures but as the shearing rate increases more fluid structures are broken and the constituent particles align with the flow thereby making it easier to flow i e shear thinning the increase in concentration causes an increase in fluid structures present and by that the proportion of fluid structures broken is higher i e increased shear thinning 24 n 0 97 0 16 log c 1 7 for c 2 5 tss wt wt n 1 for c 2 5 tss wt wt 3 4 effect of adding kitchen waste comparing the viscosities of both the slurries it is observed that the viscosity of slurry 2 is on an average approximate averaging over all concentration and 3 different shear rates 50 more than that of slurry 1 fig 18 this could be explained by comparing the particle size distribution of both slurries fig 3 slurry 2 has a higher d90 than that of slurry 1 section 2 1 adding to this the proportion of larger particles is higher in slurry 2 than in slurry 1 fig 3 signifying that the particle size distribution of kitchen waste tends towards larger particles therefore this affirms that the particle size distribution plays a major role in determining the viscosities of slurries of this nature that being said the sample collected here is small to put forth a strong conclusion about the addition of kitchen waste further research could shed light on these aspects 3 5 comparison with waste water treatment plant sludge a select few of the available literature data is compared with the slurries studied in this paper primary and secondary sludge from markis et al 2014 and anaerobic digested sludge from baudez et al 2011 is compared in comparison to the waste water treatment plant wwtp sludge the cds behaves similarly with respect to the non newtonian characteristics fig 19 at low concentrations the non newtonian behaviour is predominantly that of bingham type with a low yield stress this can be seen for slurry 1 with 5 tss wt wt primary sludge 2 8 tss wt wt and anaerobic digested sludge at 1 8 tss wt wt as the concentration of suspended solids increase the shear thinning behaviour comes into play with a higher yield stress therefore leading to a herschel bulkley type behaviour slurry 1 at 11 2 tss wt wt and secondary sludge at 3 7 tss wt wt show similar herschel bulkley behaviour 4 conclusion to study the hydrodynamic behaviour of concentrated domestic slurries 2 sample slurries from a pilot project involving novel sanitations systems were collected slurry 1 contained black water and slurry 2 black water with ground kitchen waste these samples were later processed and studied for their rheology using a narrow gap couette rheometer chosen appropriately for their particle size distribution rheograms were obtained for various tss concentration and temperatures of slurries among the rheological models explored the herschel bulkley hb model fits best the purpose of describing the obtained rheograms in general the viscosity increases with increase in tss concentration and decreases with increase in temperature and this reflects on the parameters to describe the effect of temperature on the rheology of the slurry an arrhenius type equation is used the influence of concentration on the rheology is described using the changes in these parameters the yield stress and consistency index are exponentially related to the concentration whereas the behaviour index has a decreasing power law relation comparing the viscosities of slurry 1 and 2 reveals that the addition of kitchen waste increases the viscosity the knowledge on the rheology thus collected can be used to predict the pressure drop in the transport of cds and thus can be used to evaluate and design different sanitation options

19509,comprehensively understanding the fate and transport of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in subsurface environment is crucial to assess its environmental impacts in this work column experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of physicochemical factors on the retention and transport of 14c labeled pfoa in saturated sand and limestone porous media the retention of pfoa in limestone columns was higher than that in sand columns under the same solution chemistry conditions this can be attributed to that the limestone had less negative zeta potential and larger specific surface area than the sand changes in ionic strength low to high and cation type na to ca2 had little influences on the mobility of pfoa in sand porous media but significantly enhanced the retention of pfoa in limestone porous media nearly no pfoa was retained in the sand columns but relatively high levels of pfoa retention 28 7 48 4 were achieved in the limestone columns higher input concentration resulted in lower pfoa retention in limestone porous media reflecting the blocking effect of the sorption sites the blocking effect was insignificant in sand porous media probably because the experimental conditions were unfavorable for pfoa sorption on sand media a two site kinetic retention model effectively simulated both the breakthrough and retention behaviors of the pfoa in the sand and limestone porous media graphical abstract image 1 keywords perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa retention transport physicochemical factors quartz sand limestone 1 introduction perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa is an anionic surfactant with a fully fluorinated carbon chain connected to a carboxylic acid group due to the strong carbon fluorine bond pfoa exhibits unique physical and chemical properties including extraordinary stability with strong resistance to thermal chemical and biological degradation moody and field 2000 these properties make pfoa suitable for a broad range of industrial and consumer product applications such as water and stain resistant materials cooking utensils food packaging and fire extinguishing foams lindstrom et al 2011 the industrial scale applications for approximately 60 years have inevitably released pfoa into a variety of biological and environmental matrices yamazaki et al 2015 lam et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 d eon and mabury 2011 in natural subsurface environment pfoa has been detected around the world at ng l 1 to μg l 1 levels in groundwater and at ng g 1 levels in soils filipovic et al 2015 loos et al 2010 houtz et al 2013 furthermore extensive studies have revealed that pfoa exposure can elicit adverse effects to biota and humans steenland et al 2010 looker et al 2014 koskela et al 2016 wang et al 2016 a good understanding of the fate and transport of pfoa in subsurface media thus is crucial to assess its environmental impact and potential risk the fate and transport of pfoa in the subsurface environment are strongly dependent on its interactions with surrounding media many laboratory scale batch studies have documented that the sorption behavior of pfoa on environmental media is profoundly influenced by medium physicochemical properties e g surface area organic carbon content and solution chemistry e g ph and ionic strength higgins and luthy 2006 milinovic et al 2015 mckenzie et al 2015 consequently the transport and retention of pfoa in environmental media are expected to be sensitive to these physicochemical factors nonetheless only few studies have addressed this issue mckenzie et al 2015 2016 gellrich et al 2012 wu et al 2016 gellrich et al 2012 studied the leaching behavior of perfluorinated compounds pfcs in soil and found that pfcs with shorter chain lengths e g pfoa leach much faster than pfcs with longer chain lengths wu et al 2016 reported that higher ionic strength may lead to greater pfoa retention in quartz sand suggesting that sorption sites of sand increase with increasing ionic strength mckenzie et al 2015 investigated the influence of chemical oxidants on perfluoroalkyl acid pfaa including pfoa transport in sand porous media and showed that permanganate and catalyzed hydrogen peroxide chp can increase pfaa transport while activated persulfate can decrease pfaa transport this phenomenon is likely due to the changes of ph and polyvalent cation concentration of solution as well as the changes of koc values of porous media similarly mckenzie et al 2016 showed that permanganate and chp can increase pfaa transport in non aqueous phase liquid napl contaminated sand porous media despite these efforts pfoa transport and retention processes in natural media are still incompletely understood a variety of porous media is distributed in natural subsurface systems besides soil and sand carbonates i e limestones and dolomites are another essential natural media which contain approximately 40 of the discovered hydrocarbon resources and considerable groundwater resources mehdi et al 2008 bayat et al 2015 particularly groundwater withdrawn from carbonate aquifers accounts for 78 of the total water supply in northern china rui et al 2011 moreover the physicochemical properties of porous media have been proven to play pivotal roles in determining the transport behaviors of various pollutants wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 dong et al 2017 for instance graphene oxide exhibits quite different transport behaviors in carbonate porous media to that in quartz sand dong et al 2017 sun et al 2015 due to the distinct differences in porous medium surface charge and roughness and the presence of cation bridge therefore it is anticipated that physicochemical properties of porous media can also strongly influence the transport behavior of pfoa however little effort has been made to test this hypothesis comprehensive studies thus are in great demand to evaluate and compare pfoa transport behaviors in quartz sand and carbonate rock media for its benign use and risk management pfoa concentrations in natural subsurface environment often vary in response to local industrial activities and urbanization houtz et al 2013 meng et al 2015 previous investigations have revealed that input concentration significantly influences the transport behaviors of antibiotics and dissolved organic solutes zhang et al 2010 unold et al 2010 banzhaf and hebig 2016 for instance zhang et al 2010 and unold et al 2010 observed that higher input concentrations lead to less retardation of sulfadiazine in soil in addition banzhaf and hebig 2016 reported that the organic solute concentration strongly affected the sorption and desorption processes between solutes and solid surfaces and thus influenced the retardation behavior however the potential effect of input concentration to pfoa transport in porous media has not been systematically evaluated the overall objective of this study is to gain insight into the roles of porous medium type ionic strength and cation type and input concentration in controlling the transport and retention of radioactively labeled pfoa 1 14c 14c pfoa in saturated porous media at environmentally relevant pfoa concentrations quartz sand and limestone 0 75 0 85 mm were used as experimental porous media the input concentration was determined to range from 0 80 to 6 92 μg l 1 the specific objectives of this research are to 1 examine the influence of medium type ionic strength and cation type and input concentration on pfoa transport and retention in saturated porous media 2 understand the governing mechanisms of pfoa transport and retention in saturated porous media 3 model the transport and retention of pfoa in saturated porous media 2 materials and methods 2 1 pfoa 14c pfoa was purchased from american radiolabeled chemicals inc st louis mo usa with a specific radioactivity of 2 035 gbq mm 1 non labeled pfoa was purchased from the kmf laborchemie handels gmbh germany a 14c pfoa solutions were prepared by adding 167 μl 14c pfoa stock solution 5 87 kbq ml 1 and 0 65 and 150 μl unlabeled pfoa stock solutions 10 mg l 1 to 250 ml of deionized di water at desired solution ph and ionic strength to obtain final concentrations ranging from 0 80 to 6 92 μg l 1 table 1 the initial ph was adjusted to 5 6 by 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh solutions and the ionic strengths were controlled by adding 0 5 m stock solutions of nacl and cacl2 2 2 porous media two different types of porous media were studied in this research quartz sand was purchased from unimin corporation mn usa which was sieved to obtain a size range of 0 75 0 85

china the limestone was broken off into smaller pieces using a crusher machine and then sieved to a size ranging from 0 75 to 0 85 mm subsequently the limestone grains were washed by tap water and di water to remove impurities both porous media were dried overnight at 90 c and stored under vacuum until needed scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive x ray sem edx jeol jsm 6490 japan was used to determine the surface morphologies and properties of the porous media x ray diffraction xrd dmx ⅲa japan and x ray fluorescence xrf arl 9800 switzerland analyses were carried out to determine the composition of the porous media surface area and porosity analyzer asap 2020 hd88 micromeritics was utilized to determine the specific surface area ssa of the porous media the organic content of limestone was measured using an elemental analyzer ecs 4024 chnso costech inc italy the zeta potential values of the porous media under varying solution ionic strengths and cations were measured using a zetapals brookhaven instruments corporation ny usa 2 3 column experiments polypropylene columns with an inner diameter of 2 5 cm and a length of 16 7 cm were used for all experiments a single 100 mesh stainless steel screen was used as a capillary barrier and filter at both ends of the column the column was connected to a peristaltic pump bt100 1f longer pump hebei china on the inlet side to maintain an upward flow and a fraction collector bs 100a puyang scientific instrument research institute china on the outlet side the column was uniformly wet packed with the porous media according to the method explained by tian tian et al 2010 a flow of 1 0 ml min 1 was applied for all experiments which equivalent to a darcy velocity of 2 94 m d 1 the porosity of the packed quartz sand and limestone columns were determined detailed in s1 and were approximately 0 37 0 01 and 0 44 0 01 respectively nonreactive tracer tests were carried out with a solution of 25 mg l 1 kno3 to determine water flow characteristics and column performance and the details are provided in the supporting information s2 and figure s1 the tracer results showed that both the sand and limestone media were well packed in the columns without notable signs of wall effects or preferential flow paths each of the packed columns was pre equilibrated with around 25 pore volumes pvs of pfoa free background solution at desired ionic strength before starting a transport experiment the effluent concentrations of na and ca2 in limestone columns were measured and the results indicate that the dissolved ca2 from limestone surface had negligible effect on the solution ionic strength table s1 a pulse of three pvs of 14c pfoa water solution was then introduced into the column followed by several pvs of 14c pfoa free background solution at the same ionic strength effluent samples were collected using a fraction collector in polypropylene tubes the effluent concentrations of pfoa were assessed by measuring the radioactivity on a liquid scintillation counter lsc ls6500 beckman coulter usa the radioactivity was measured after mixing 6 ml of effluent solution with 12 ml of scintillation cocktail gold star multipurpose meridian biotechnologies ltd uk the spatial distributions of retained pfoa in the columns were determined right after recovery of the breakthrough curves the packed column was carefully excavated in 2 1 cm thick increments porous media of each layer were dried homogenized and crushed duplicated samples were then weighed accurately 0 5 g and combusted in a biological oxidizer ox 500 r j harvey instrument corporation usa the resulting 14co2 was trapped in a vial containing 10 ml of alkaline scintillation cocktail oxysolve c 400 zinsser analytic germany and was subjected to lsc to measure the radioactivity mass balance was calculated by comparing the quantities of pfoa in the effluent and retained in the porous media to the initial amount injected into the column 2 4 mathematical model various solute transport models with equilibrium or nonequilibrium were tested against the column experimental data figs s2 s7 furthermore the breakthrough curves btcs of pfoa showed no sign of retardation in both media and long tails in limestone media which are typical characteristics of kinetic interactions of solute transport in porous media then advection dispersion equation coupled with two site kinetic retention i e adr model was selected to simulate the retention and transport of the pfoa in the porous media the governing equation can be written as dong et al 2017 1 c t ρ θ s 1 t ρ θ s 2 t d 2 c z 2 ν c z where c is the pfoa concentration in the aqueous phase m l 3 where m and l denote units of mass and length respectively t is the time t where t denotes unites of time ρ is the soil bulk density m l 3 θ is the volumetric water content s 1 is the pfoa concentration in solid phase associated with sorption sites 1 m m 1 s 2 is the pfoa concentration in solid phase associated with sorption sites 2 m m 1 d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient l2 t 1 z is the vertical spatial coordinate l and ν is the velocity of pore water l t 1 2 ρ θ s 1 t k 1 c where k 1 is the first order sorption coefficient of site 1 t 1 3 ρ θ s 2 t k 2 c ρ θ k d 2 s 2 where k 2 is the first order sorption coefficient of site 2 t 1 and k d2 is the desorption coefficient of site 2 t 1 the above model was solved and applied to the experimental data using the hydrus 1d code which enables to fit model parameters using the levenberge marquardt nonlinear least square optimization routine 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of porous media the sem analysis depicted that the surface of quartz sand grains was smooth while limestone grains was rough with irregular dents and bumps fig 1 a and c the ssa of the sand and limestone grains were 0 05 and 0 27 m2 g 1 respectively the edx xrd and xrf analyses revealed that quartz sand was mainly composed of quartz while limestone was composed of a high content of calcium and a low content of quartz and other metal elements magnesium aluminum iron and potassium fig 1b and d fig s8 and table s2 the organic content of limestone was determined to be very low 0 12 as shown in table 1 limestone grains were significantly less negatively charged than quartz sand grains under the same solution chemistry conditions this distinct difference was likely due to the much lower point of zero charge pzc value of quartz sand than limestone somasundaran and agar 1967 findlay et al 1996 alotaibi et al 2011 in addition both quartz sand and limestone became significantly more negative with increasing ionic strength mainly due to the compression of the electrical double layer of porous media and this trend was consistent with many previous studies liu et al 2013 alroudhan et al 2016 furthermore it should be noticed that comparing with nacl cacl2 was more effective in the reduction of medium zeta potential value which is attributed to the surface negative charges neutralization of ca2 you et al 2010 3 2 effect of medium type measured and fitted btcs and retention profiles rps of pfoa in quartz sand and limestone porous media under different ionic strength and cation type 1 50 30 0 and 90 0 mm for nacl and 0 50 10 0 and 30 0 mm for cacl2 are presented in fig 2 and fig 3 the btcs are plotted as normalized effluent concentrations c c0 versus pvs and the rps are plotted as normalized solid phase concentrations s c0 against the distance from the column inlet mass balance information effluent retention and total for these experiments are provided in table 1 breakthrough of pfoa in quartz sand and limestone porous media were at 0 85 and 1 00 pore volume respectively the btcs in quartz sand porous media were symmetrical and exhibited low degree of tailing additionally effluent mass recoveries of pfoa under both nacl and cacl2 solution in quartz sand porous media entirely exceeded 96 8 table 1 indicating that the retention of pfoa in quartz sand porous media for all conditions tested was low the presence of ca2 had little influence on pfoa transport in sand columns fig 3a demonstrating that cation bridging effect was not responsible for the transport of pfoa in quartz sand porous media thus the high mobility of pfoa in sand porous media was mainly due to the great electrostatic repulsions between anionic pfoa molecules and negatively charged sand grains 54 5 8 6 mv this is consistent with the result of a previous study reported by hellsing et al 2016 that shows nearly no sorption of pfoa on silica surface owing to the great electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged functional group of pfoa and the negatively charged silica surface unlike in quartz sand porous media the btcs in limestone porous media exhibited increasing retention rate and high degree of tailing figs 2b and 3b furthermore the maximum breakthrough plateau values of pfoa in limestone porous media were much lower than those in quartz sand porous media under the same solution chemistry figs 2 and 3 potential mechanisms for the distinct difference are summarized as follows i the less negative zeta potentials of limestone grains 9 2 18 0 mv than that of quartz sand grains 54 5 8 6 mv contributed to weaker electrostatic repulsions between pfoa and limestone grains consequently the conditions for the adsorption of pfoa on limestone surface became generally more favorable therefore the electrostatic interaction could be the main mechanism that controlled the retention and transport of pfoa in limestone porous media in this study ii the relatively large ssa of limestone grains 0 27 m2 g 1 for limestone vs 0 05 m2 g 1 for quartz sand likely provided adequate retention sites for the sorption of pfoa on limestone surface du et al 2014 yu et al 2009 deng et al 2012 when two different size fractions of limestone grains i e fine 0 35 0 45 mm and coarse 0 75 0 85 mm were tested under the same experimental condition pfoa showed higher retention in the fine limestone ssa of 0 40 m2 g 1 column that in the coarse limestone ssa of 0 27 m2 g 1 column detailed in s3 and fig s9 confirming that the notable role of ssa in the sorption of pfoa in limestone porous media on the other hand it has been proposed that organic carbon content of a sorbent is the dominant parameter affecting the sorption behavior of pfcs through hydrophobic interaction higgins and luthy 2006 milinovic et al 2015 however when the organic carbon content 1 02 of sorbent e g sediment is low it may have marginal influence on pfoa sorption higgins and luthy 2006 in this study the organic carbon content of limestone is very low 0 12 suggesting that hydrophobic interaction might be insignificant to the sorption of pfoa in limestone porous media the rps for pfoa in limestone columns exhibited a somewhat uniform distribution with depth figs 2d and 3d which can be attribute to the saturation of the maximum retention capacity of the limestone grains as the retention sites at the upper profile were filled up pfoa migrated downward to the retention sites in the lower profile the two site kinetic retention model provided a good description for both btcs and rps of pfoa in both quartz sand and limestone porous media under various ionic strengths and cation types r2 0 94 the fitted results confirm the importance of the physiochemical properties of porous media on the transport process of pfoa as shown in table s3 only one site first order sorption coefficient k1 was used to simulate the transport process of pfoa in quartz sand and the fitted values of k1 were quite small 5 54 10 4 1 55 10 3 min 1 confirming the dominance of electrostatic repulsion on controlling the retention and transport of pfoa in sand media compared with quartz sand limestone showed more complex physiochemical properties e g larger saa and less negatively charged surface these factors resulted in more complex transport process in limestone than in quartz sand thus more parameters including two site first order sorption coefficients k1 and k2 and one site desorption coefficient kd2 were used to simulate the transport process of pfoa in limestone porous media all of the three fitting parameters were relatively large indicating that both sites played important roles in governing pfoa retention and transport in limestone porous media 3 3 effects of ionic strength and cation type inspection of fig 2a c and fig 3a c indicates that both ionic strength and cation type had little effect on the mobility of pfoa in quartz sand porous media attested from high effluent mass recoveries of pfoa for all conditions 96 8 97 9 however limestone responded to the changes of ionic strength and cation type entirely differently than quartz sand as shown in fig 2b d and fig 3b d higher ionic strength gave rise to higher relative pfoa retention in both types of cations previous studies reported that the cation bridge effect is not responsible for the high adsorption capacity of pfoa anions to sediment higgins and luthy 2006 thus the bridging effects of ca2 between limestone and pfoa anions may have an insignificant influence on pfoa transport in limestone porous media in this study as discussed in section 3 1 limestone grains became less negatively charged at higher ionic strength nacl 9 2 1 2 mv cacl2 11 4 18 0 mv the increased pfoa retention with increasing ionic strength nacl and cacl2 was likely promoted by enhanced electrostatic attraction between the limestone surface and pfoa molecules furthermore higher retention of pfoa in cacl2 than in nacl at the same ionic strength was probably because ca2 neutralized surface negative charges of limestone surface 11 4 18 0 mv more effectively than na 9 2 1 2 mv and thus promoted the pfoa sorption on limestone surface via stronger electrostatic attraction the best fit values of k1 k2 and kd2 under different ionic strength and cation type are shown in table s3 for the column packed with quartz sand the fitted values of k1 were very small which is consistent with the experimental results that ionic strength and cation type had little influence on pfoa retention in sand porous media for the columns packed with limestone however the fitted values of k1 and k2 all slightly increased with increasing ionic strength suggesting an increasing rate of retention at both sites on the limestone media the value of kd2 generally decreased with increasing ionic strength indicating a decreasing detachment rate at the reversible attachment site site 2 consequently these observations confirm that greater pfoa retention occurred on the limestone surface at higher ionic strength besides at the same ionic strength e g 1 50 mm nacl and 0 50 mm cacl2 the values of k1 and k2 of pfoa in cacl2 were higher than that in nacl while value of kd2 of cacl2 was lower than that of nacl this reflected that greater pfoa retention rate smaller pfoa detachment rate and more retention sites in cacl2 than in nacl thus confirmed that cacl2 was more effective than nacl to promote the retention of pfoa in saturated limestone porous media 3 4 effect of input concentration the effect of pfoa input concentration 0 80 6 87 μg l 1 on its retention and transport in quartz sand and limestone porous media was evaluated at ionic strength of 1 5 mm nacl btcs of pfoa in quartz sand porous media under various input concentrations were nearly identical fig 4 a and effluent mass recoveries of pfoa all exceeded 97 9 table 1 implying that input concentration had insignificant impact on the pfoa transport in quartz sand porous media this is likely due to the strong electrostatic repulsions between pfoa and sand grains rendering to unfavorable conditions for pfoa sorption however in comparing with quartz sand input concentration had a great effect on pfoa transport in limestone porous media the effluent mass recovery reached 74 4 at the high input concentration 6 40 μg l 1 which was much higher than that 49 9 at the low input concentration 0 80 μg l 1 table 1 this indicates that higher input concentration resulted in lower relative pfoa retention this effect is likely because the retention sites might be filled at the higher input concentration resulting in the blocking effect that would reduce the attachment rate of pfoa in the media wang et al 2013 the best fit values of k1 k2 and kd2 under various input concentrations are shown in table s3 the fitted values of k1 in sand columns were very small under various input concentrations confirming that input concentration had little influence on pfoa retention in sand porous media in the limestone columns however the best fit values of k1 and k2 both decreased with increasing input concentration which can also be attributed to the blocking effect in this study first order kinetics were used to describe pfoa attachment process so k1 and k2 represent the overall or average attachment rates of pfoa in the media the blocking effect at higher concentration thus would reduce the values of both k1 and k2 the best fit value of kd2 increased with increasing input concentration which is consistent with the results that greater recovery of pfoa in the effluent occurred at higher input concentration different combinations of second order kinetic expressions had been tested against the experimental btcs and rps even though those simulations also matched experimental data well the model results were not reliable due to the issue of over parameterization 4 conclusion this study provides valuable insights into pfoa retention and transport in subsurface environment under various physicochemical conditions natural media vary significantly in their texture structure mineralogy and chemical composition subsequently leading to their various physicochemical properties besides hydrochemical conditions like ionic strength and cation type surrounding the natural media are diverse findings from this study advance the understanding of pfoa transport in sand and

environment furthermore pfoa concentrations in natural subsurface environment may vary in response to local industrial activities and urbanization findings of this study suggest that special attention

19509,comprehensively understanding the fate and transport of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in subsurface environment is crucial to assess its environmental impacts in this work column experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of physicochemical factors on the retention and transport of 14c labeled pfoa in saturated sand and limestone porous media the retention of pfoa in limestone columns was higher than that in sand columns under the same solution chemistry conditions this can be attributed to that the limestone had less negative zeta potential and larger specific surface area than the sand changes in ionic strength low to high and cation type na to ca2 had little influences on the mobility of pfoa in sand porous media but significantly enhanced the retention of pfoa in limestone porous media nearly no pfoa was retained in the sand columns but relatively high levels of pfoa retention 28 7 48 4 were achieved in the limestone columns higher input concentration resulted in lower pfoa retention in limestone porous media reflecting the blocking effect of the sorption sites the blocking effect was insignificant in sand porous media probably because the experimental conditions were unfavorable for pfoa sorption on sand media a two site kinetic retention model effectively simulated both the breakthrough and retention behaviors of the pfoa in the sand and limestone porous media graphical abstract image 1 keywords perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa retention transport physicochemical factors quartz sand limestone 1 introduction perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa is an anionic surfactant with a fully fluorinated carbon chain connected to a carboxylic acid group due to the strong carbon fluorine bond pfoa exhibits unique physical and chemical properties including extraordinary stability with strong resistance to thermal chemical and biological degradation moody and field 2000 these properties make pfoa suitable for a broad range of industrial and consumer product applications such as water and stain resistant materials cooking utensils food packaging and fire extinguishing foams lindstrom et al 2011 the industrial scale applications for approximately 60 years have inevitably released pfoa into a variety of biological and environmental matrices yamazaki et al 2015 lam et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 d eon and mabury 2011 in natural subsurface environment pfoa has been detected around the world at ng l 1 to μg l 1 levels in groundwater and at ng g 1 levels in soils filipovic et al 2015 loos et al 2010 houtz et al 2013 furthermore extensive studies have revealed that pfoa exposure can elicit adverse effects to biota and humans steenland et al 2010 looker et al 2014 koskela et al 2016 wang et al 2016 a good understanding of the fate and transport of pfoa in subsurface media thus is crucial to assess its environmental impact and potential risk the fate and transport of pfoa in the subsurface environment are strongly dependent on its interactions with surrounding media many laboratory scale batch studies have documented that the sorption behavior of pfoa on environmental media is profoundly influenced by medium physicochemical properties e g surface area organic carbon content and solution chemistry e g ph and ionic strength higgins and luthy 2006 milinovic et al 2015 mckenzie et al 2015 consequently the transport and retention of pfoa in environmental media are expected to be sensitive to these physicochemical factors nonetheless only few studies have addressed this issue mckenzie et al 2015 2016 gellrich et al 2012 wu et al 2016 gellrich et al 2012 studied the leaching behavior of perfluorinated compounds pfcs in soil and found that pfcs with shorter chain lengths e g pfoa leach much faster than pfcs with longer chain lengths wu et al 2016 reported that higher ionic strength may lead to greater pfoa retention in quartz sand suggesting that sorption sites of sand increase with increasing ionic strength mckenzie et al 2015 investigated the influence of chemical oxidants on perfluoroalkyl acid pfaa including pfoa transport in sand porous media and showed that permanganate and catalyzed hydrogen peroxide chp can increase pfaa transport while activated persulfate can decrease pfaa transport this phenomenon is likely due to the changes of ph and polyvalent cation concentration of solution as well as the changes of koc values of porous media similarly mckenzie et al 2016 showed that permanganate and chp can increase pfaa transport in non aqueous phase liquid napl contaminated sand porous media despite these efforts pfoa transport and retention processes in natural media are still incompletely understood a variety of porous media is distributed in natural subsurface systems besides soil and sand carbonates i e limestones and dolomites are another essential natural media which contain approximately 40 of the discovered hydrocarbon resources and considerable groundwater resources mehdi et al 2008 bayat et al 2015 particularly groundwater withdrawn from carbonate aquifers accounts for 78 of the total water supply in northern china rui et al 2011 moreover the physicochemical properties of porous media have been proven to play pivotal roles in determining the transport behaviors of various pollutants wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 dong et al 2017 for instance graphene oxide exhibits quite different transport behaviors in carbonate porous media to that in quartz sand dong et al 2017 sun et al 2015 due to the distinct differences in porous medium surface charge and roughness and the presence of cation bridge therefore it is anticipated that physicochemical properties of porous media can also strongly influence the transport behavior of pfoa however little effort has been made to test this hypothesis comprehensive studies thus are in great demand to evaluate and compare pfoa transport behaviors in quartz sand and carbonate rock media for its benign use and risk management pfoa concentrations in natural subsurface environment often vary in response to local industrial activities and urbanization houtz et al 2013 meng et al 2015 previous investigations have revealed that input concentration significantly influences the transport behaviors of antibiotics and dissolved organic solutes zhang et al 2010 unold et al 2010 banzhaf and hebig 2016 for instance zhang et al 2010 and unold et al 2010 observed that higher input concentrations lead to less retardation of sulfadiazine in soil in addition banzhaf and hebig 2016 reported that the organic solute concentration strongly affected the sorption and desorption processes between solutes and solid surfaces and thus influenced the retardation behavior however the potential effect of input concentration to pfoa transport in porous media has not been systematically evaluated the overall objective of this study is to gain insight into the roles of porous medium type ionic strength and cation type and input concentration in controlling the transport and retention of radioactively labeled pfoa 1 14c 14c pfoa in saturated porous media at environmentally relevant pfoa concentrations quartz sand and limestone 0 75 0 85 mm were used as experimental porous media the input concentration was determined to range from 0 80 to 6 92 μg l 1 the specific objectives of this research are to 1 examine the influence of medium type ionic strength and cation type and input concentration on pfoa transport and retention in saturated porous media 2 understand the governing mechanisms of pfoa transport and retention in saturated porous media 3 model the transport and retention of pfoa in saturated porous media 2 materials and methods 2 1 pfoa 14c pfoa was purchased from american radiolabeled chemicals inc st louis mo usa with a specific radioactivity of 2 035 gbq mm 1 non labeled pfoa was purchased from the kmf laborchemie handels gmbh germany a 14c pfoa solutions were prepared by adding 167 μl 14c pfoa stock solution 5 87 kbq ml 1 and 0 65 and 150 μl unlabeled pfoa stock solutions 10 mg l 1 to 250 ml of deionized di water at desired solution ph and ionic strength to obtain final concentrations ranging from 0 80 to 6 92 μg l 1 table 1 the initial ph was adjusted to 5 6 by 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh solutions and the ionic strengths were controlled by adding 0 5 m stock solutions of nacl and cacl2 2 2 porous media two different types of porous media were studied in this research quartz sand was purchased from unimin corporation mn usa which was sieved to obtain a size range of 0 75 0 85 mm the quartz sand was sequentially treated by tap water 10 nitric acid v v and di water to remove metal oxide and organic impurities limestone was acquired from hengyang county in hunan province china the limestone was broken off into smaller pieces using a crusher machine and then sieved to a size ranging from 0 75 to 0 85 mm subsequently the limestone grains were washed by tap water and di water to remove impurities both porous media were dried overnight at 90 c and stored under vacuum until needed scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive x ray sem edx jeol jsm 6490 japan was used to determine the surface morphologies and properties of the porous media x ray diffraction xrd dmx ⅲa japan and x ray fluorescence xrf arl 9800 switzerland analyses were carried out to determine the composition of the porous media surface area and porosity analyzer asap 2020 hd88 micromeritics was utilized to determine the specific surface area ssa of the porous media the organic content of limestone was measured using an elemental analyzer ecs 4024 chnso costech inc italy the zeta potential values of the porous media under varying solution ionic strengths and cations were measured using a zetapals brookhaven instruments corporation ny usa 2 3 column experiments polypropylene columns with an inner diameter of 2 5 cm and a length of 16 7 cm were used for all experiments a single 100 mesh stainless steel screen was used as a capillary barrier and filter at both ends of the column the column was connected to a peristaltic pump bt100 1f longer pump hebei china on the inlet side to maintain an upward flow and a fraction collector bs 100a puyang scientific instrument research institute china on the outlet side the column was uniformly wet packed with the porous media according to the method explained by tian tian et al 2010 a flow of 1 0 ml min 1 was applied for all experiments which equivalent to a darcy velocity of 2 94 m d 1 the porosity of the packed quartz sand and limestone columns were determined detailed in s1 and were approximately 0 37 0 01 and 0 44 0 01 respectively nonreactive tracer tests were carried out with a solution of 25 mg l 1 kno3 to determine water flow characteristics and column performance and the details are provided in the supporting information s2 and figure s1 the tracer results showed that both the sand and limestone media were well packed in the columns without notable signs of wall effects or preferential flow paths each of the packed columns was pre equilibrated with around 25 pore volumes pvs of pfoa free background solution at desired ionic strength before starting a transport experiment the effluent concentrations of na and ca2 in limestone columns were measured and the results indicate that the dissolved ca2 from limestone surface had negligible effect on the solution ionic strength table s1 a pulse of three pvs of 14c pfoa water solution was then introduced into the column followed by several pvs of 14c pfoa free background solution at the same ionic strength effluent samples were collected using a fraction collector in polypropylene tubes the effluent concentrations of pfoa were assessed by measuring the radioactivity on a liquid scintillation counter lsc ls6500 beckman coulter usa the radioactivity was measured after mixing 6 ml of effluent solution with 12 ml of scintillation cocktail gold star multipurpose meridian biotechnologies ltd uk the spatial distributions of retained pfoa in the columns were determined right after recovery of the breakthrough curves the packed column was carefully excavated in 2 1 cm thick increments porous media of each layer were dried homogenized and crushed duplicated samples were then weighed accurately 0 5 g and combusted in a biological oxidizer ox 500 r j harvey instrument corporation usa the resulting 14co2 was trapped in a vial containing 10 ml of alkaline scintillation cocktail oxysolve c 400 zinsser analytic germany and was subjected to lsc to measure the radioactivity mass balance was calculated by comparing the quantities of pfoa in the effluent and retained in the porous media to the initial amount injected into the column 2 4 mathematical model various solute transport models with equilibrium or nonequilibrium were tested against the column experimental data figs s2 s7 furthermore the breakthrough curves btcs of pfoa showed no sign of retardation in both media and long tails in limestone media which are typical characteristics of kinetic interactions of solute transport in porous media then advection dispersion equation coupled with two site kinetic retention i e adr model was selected to simulate the retention and transport of the pfoa in the porous media the governing equation can be written as dong et al 2017 1 c t ρ θ s 1 t ρ θ s 2 t d 2 c z 2 ν c z where c is the pfoa concentration in the aqueous phase m l 3 where m and l denote units of mass and length respectively t is the time t where t denotes unites of time ρ is the soil bulk density m l 3 θ is the volumetric water content s 1 is the pfoa concentration in solid phase associated with sorption sites 1 m m 1 s 2 is the pfoa concentration in solid phase associated with sorption sites 2 m m 1 d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient l2 t 1 z is the vertical spatial coordinate l and ν is the velocity of pore water l t 1 2 ρ θ s 1 t k 1 c where k 1 is the first order sorption coefficient of site 1 t 1 3 ρ θ s 2 t k 2 c ρ θ k d 2 s 2 where k 2 is the first order sorption coefficient of site 2 t 1 and k d2 is the desorption coefficient of site 2 t 1 the above model was solved and applied to the experimental data using the hydrus 1d code which enables to fit model parameters using the levenberge marquardt nonlinear least square optimization routine 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of porous media the sem analysis depicted that the surface of quartz sand grains was smooth while limestone grains was rough with irregular dents and bumps fig 1 a and c the ssa of the sand and limestone grains were 0 05 and 0 27 m2 g 1 respectively the edx xrd and xrf analyses revealed that quartz sand was mainly composed of quartz while limestone was composed of a high content of calcium and a low content of quartz and other metal elements magnesium aluminum iron and potassium fig 1b and d fig s8 and table s2 the organic content of limestone was determined to be very low 0 12 as shown in table 1 limestone grains were significantly less negatively charged than quartz sand grains under the same solution chemistry conditions this distinct difference was likely due to the much lower point of zero charge pzc value of quartz sand than limestone somasundaran and agar 1967 findlay et al 1996 alotaibi et al 2011 in addition both quartz sand and limestone became significantly more negative with increasing ionic strength mainly due to the compression of the electrical double layer of porous media and this trend was consistent with many previous studies liu et al 2013 alroudhan et al 2016 furthermore it should be noticed that comparing with nacl cacl2 was more effective in the reduction of medium zeta potential value which is attributed to the surface negative charges neutralization of ca2 you et al 2010 3 2 effect of medium type measured and fitted btcs and retention profiles rps of pfoa in quartz sand and limestone porous media under different ionic strength and cation type 1 50 30 0 and 90 0 mm for nacl and 0 50 10 0 and 30 0 mm for cacl2 are presented in fig 2 and fig 3 the btcs are plotted as normalized effluent concentrations c c0 versus pvs and the rps are plotted as normalized solid phase concentrations s c0 against the distance from the column inlet mass balance information effluent retention and total for these experiments are provided in table 1 breakthrough of pfoa in quartz sand and limestone porous media were at 0 85 and 1 00 pore volume respectively the btcs in quartz sand porous media were symmetrical and exhibited low degree of tailing additionally effluent mass recoveries of pfoa under both nacl and cacl2 solution in quartz sand porous media entirely exceeded 96 8 table 1 indicating that the retention of pfoa in quartz sand porous media for all conditions tested was low the presence of ca2 had little influence on pfoa transport in sand columns fig 3a demonstrating that cation bridging effect was not responsible for the transport of pfoa in quartz sand porous media thus the high mobility of pfoa in sand porous media was mainly due to the great electrostatic repulsions between anionic pfoa molecules and negatively charged sand grains 54 5 8 6 mv this is consistent with the result of a previous study reported by hellsing et al 2016 that shows nearly no sorption of pfoa on silica surface owing to the great electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged functional group of pfoa and the negatively charged silica surface unlike in quartz sand porous media the btcs in limestone porous media exhibited increasing retention rate and high degree of tailing figs 2b and 3b furthermore the maximum breakthrough plateau values of pfoa in limestone porous media were much lower than those in quartz sand porous media under the same solution chemistry figs 2 and 3 potential mechanisms for the distinct difference are summarized as follows i the less negative zeta potentials of limestone grains 9 2 18 0 mv than that of quartz sand grains 54 5 8 6 mv contributed to weaker electrostatic repulsions between pfoa and limestone grains consequently the conditions for the adsorption of pfoa on limestone surface became generally more favorable therefore the electrostatic interaction could be the main mechanism that controlled the retention and transport of pfoa in limestone porous media in this study ii the relatively large ssa of limestone grains 0 27 m2 g 1 for limestone vs 0 05 m2 g 1 for quartz sand likely provided adequate retention sites for the sorption of pfoa on limestone surface du et al 2014 yu et al 2009 deng et al 2012 when two different size fractions of limestone grains i e fine 0 35 0 45 mm and coarse 0 75 0 85 mm were tested under the same experimental condition pfoa showed higher retention in the fine limestone ssa of 0 40 m2 g 1 column that in the coarse limestone ssa of 0 27 m2 g 1 column detailed in s3 and fig s9 confirming that the notable role of ssa in the sorption of pfoa in limestone porous media on the other hand it has been proposed that organic carbon content of a sorbent is the dominant parameter affecting the sorption behavior of pfcs through hydrophobic interaction higgins and luthy 2006 milinovic et al 2015 however when the organic carbon content 1 02 of sorbent e g sediment is low it may have marginal influence on pfoa sorption higgins and luthy 2006 in this study the organic carbon content of limestone is very low 0 12 suggesting that hydrophobic interaction might be insignificant to the sorption of pfoa in limestone porous media the rps for pfoa in limestone columns exhibited a somewhat uniform distribution with depth figs 2d and 3d which can be attribute to the saturation of the maximum retention capacity of the limestone grains as the retention sites at the upper profile were filled up pfoa migrated downward to the retention sites in the lower profile the two site kinetic retention model provided a good description for both btcs and rps of pfoa in both quartz sand and limestone porous media under various ionic strengths and cation types r2 0 94 the fitted results confirm the importance of the physiochemical properties of porous media on the transport process of pfoa as shown in table s3 only one site first order sorption coefficient k1 was used to simulate the transport process of pfoa in quartz sand and the fitted values of k1 were quite small 5 54 10 4 1 55 10 3 min 1 confirming the dominance of electrostatic repulsion on controlling the retention and transport of pfoa in sand media compared with quartz sand limestone showed more complex physiochemical properties e g larger saa and less negatively charged surface these factors resulted in more complex transport process in limestone than in quartz sand thus more parameters including two site first order sorption coefficients k1 and k2 and one site desorption coefficient kd2 were used to simulate the transport process of pfoa in limestone porous media all of the three fitting parameters were relatively large indicating that both sites played important roles in governing pfoa retention and transport in limestone porous media 3 3 effects of ionic strength and cation type inspection of fig 2a c and fig 3a c indicates that both ionic strength and cation type had little effect on the mobility of pfoa in quartz sand porous media attested from high effluent mass recoveries of pfoa for all conditions 96 8 97 9 however limestone responded to the changes of ionic strength and cation type entirely differently than quartz sand as shown in fig 2b d and fig 3b d higher ionic strength gave rise to higher relative pfoa retention in both types of cations previous studies reported that the cation bridge effect is not responsible for the high adsorption capacity of pfoa anions to sediment higgins and luthy 2006 thus the bridging effects of ca2 between limestone and pfoa anions may have an insignificant influence on pfoa transport in limestone porous media in this study as discussed in section 3 1 limestone grains became less negatively charged at higher ionic strength nacl 9 2 1 2 mv cacl2 11 4 18 0 mv the increased pfoa retention with increasing ionic strength nacl and cacl2 was likely promoted by enhanced electrostatic attraction between the limestone surface and pfoa molecules furthermore higher retention of pfoa in cacl2 than in nacl at the same ionic strength was probably because ca2 neutralized surface negative charges of limestone surface 11 4 18 0 mv more effectively than na 9 2 1 2 mv and thus promoted the pfoa sorption on limestone surface via stronger electrostatic attraction the best fit values of k1 k2 and kd2 under different ionic strength and cation type are shown in table s3 for the column packed with quartz sand the fitted values of k1 were very small which is consistent with the experimental results that ionic strength and cation type had little influence on pfoa retention in sand porous media for the columns packed with limestone however the fitted values of k1 and k2 all slightly increased with increasing ionic strength suggesting an increasing rate of retention at both sites on the limestone media the value of kd2 generally decreased with increasing ionic strength indicating a decreasing detachment rate at the reversible attachment site site 2 consequently these observations confirm that greater pfoa retention occurred on the limestone surface at higher ionic strength besides at the same ionic strength e g 1 50 mm nacl and 0 50 mm cacl2 the values of k1 and k2 of pfoa in cacl2 were higher than that in nacl while value of kd2 of cacl2 was lower than that of nacl this reflected that greater pfoa retention rate smaller pfoa detachment rate and more retention sites in cacl2 than in nacl thus confirmed that cacl2 was more effective than nacl to promote the retention of pfoa in saturated limestone porous media 3 4 effect of input concentration the effect of pfoa input concentration 0 80 6 87 μg l 1 on its retention and transport in quartz sand and limestone porous media was evaluated at ionic strength of 1 5 mm nacl btcs of pfoa in quartz sand porous media under various input concentrations were nearly identical fig 4 a and effluent mass recoveries of pfoa all exceeded 97 9 table 1 implying that input concentration had insignificant impact on the pfoa transport in quartz sand porous media this is likely due to the strong electrostatic repulsions between pfoa and sand grains rendering to unfavorable conditions for pfoa sorption however in comparing with quartz sand input concentration had a great effect on pfoa transport in limestone porous media the effluent mass recovery reached 74 4 at the high input concentration 6 40 μg l 1 which was much higher than that 49 9 at the low input concentration 0 80 μg l 1 table 1 this indicates that higher input concentration resulted in lower relative pfoa retention this effect is likely because the retention sites might be filled at the higher input concentration resulting in the blocking effect that would reduce the attachment rate of pfoa in the media wang et al 2013 the best fit values of k1 k2 and kd2 under various input concentrations are shown in table s3 the fitted values of k1 in sand columns were very small under various input concentrations confirming that input concentration had little influence on pfoa retention in sand porous media in the limestone columns however the best fit values of k1 and k2 both decreased with increasing input concentration which can also be attributed to the blocking effect in this study first order kinetics were used to describe pfoa attachment process so k1 and k2 represent the overall or average attachment rates of pfoa in the media the blocking effect at higher concentration thus would reduce the values of both k1 and k2 the best fit value of kd2 increased with increasing input concentration which is consistent with the results that greater recovery of pfoa in the effluent occurred at higher input concentration different combinations of second order kinetic expressions had been tested against the experimental btcs and rps even though those simulations also matched experimental data well the model results were not reliable due to the issue of over parameterization 4 conclusion this study provides valuable insights into pfoa retention and transport in subsurface environment under various physicochemical conditions natural media vary significantly in their texture structure mineralogy and chemical composition subsequently leading to their various physicochemical properties besides hydrochemical conditions like ionic strength and cation type surrounding the natural media are diverse findings from this study advance the understanding of pfoa transport in sand and
