1345,physical and hydraulic properties of porous media are routinely measured simulated at smaller scales e g pore and core however their determination at larger scales e g field and reservoir has still been a great challenge although understanding the scale dependence of transport modes in rocks and soils is essential the porous media community still lacks in a solid theoretic framework in this short communication we propose finite size scaling analysis from physics to investigate the scale dependence of tortuosity and diffusion coefficient by comparing with two and three dimensional simulations we demonstrate that the finite size scaling analysis is a powerful approach more specifically we show that the plot of simulated tortuosity or diffusion coefficient versus scale looks scattered however after applying the finite size scaling analysis the data collapse together showing a quasi universal trend keywords diffusion coefficient finite size scaling analysis scale tortuosity 1 introduction determining the effect of scale on flow and transport in porous media has been a great challenge it is well documented in the literature that transport modes such as tortuosity τ duda et al 2011 ghanbarian et al 2013b matyka et al 2008 and diffusion d ewing et al 2012 ewing and horton 2002 are scale dependent the origin of scale dependence is the presence of spatial heterogeneity at various scales bear 1972 at pore and core scales small scale heterogeneity e g pore sizes and pore connectivity controls the scale dependence of transport modes while at field scale large scale heterogeneity e g fractures and their orientations plays a key role nonetheless we are still far from fully understanding how transport modes in soils and rocks vary with scale various empirical models have been proposed to characterize the scale dependence of saturated hydraulic conductivity schulze makuch et al 1999 and tortuosity duda et al 2011 for example matyka et al 2008 proposed the following empirical model that could fit their simulations reasonably well 1 τ τ bexp cl where τ represents hydraulic tortuosity of an infinitely large system l is the linear size of the medium and b and c are two fitting parameters we should point out that there exist four main types of tortuosity i e geometrical electrical diffusive and hydraulic clennell 1997 ghanbarian et al 2013a one should typically expect hydraulic tortuosity to be greater than electrical or diffusive tortuosity and electrical tortuosity to be greater than geometrical tortuosity however when a medium is homogeneous and its pore size distribution is narrow enough the values of the four types of tortuosity become similar ghanbarian et al 2013a crawford et al 1993 showed that diffusion in soils is typically non fickian and diffusion constant should be replaced by a scale dependent diffusion coefficient they proposed the following power law scale dependency 2 d l θ where θ 2 d n d d in which d n is the fractal dimension capturing the heterogeneity of pore space and d is the fractal dimension related to tortuosity for two soil samples crawford et al 1993 determined the values of d n and d from soil thin sections and reported θ 0 92 and 1 29 in addition to empirical relationships and fractal geometry percolation theory was applied to explain the scale dependence of permeability esmaeilpour et al 2021 hunt et al 2014 hunt 2006 and tortuosity ghanbarian et al 2013b for instance ghanbarian et al 2013b proposed the following theoretical relationship for geometrical tortuosity τ 1 3 τ p p c c l 1 ν ν ν d x where p is the occupation fraction 0 p 1 p c is the critical occupation fraction and c is a constant coefficient representing the typical bond or pore throat length ν is the critical exponent that scales the correlation length and its value in two and three dimensions is respectively 4 3 and 0 88 stauffer and aharony 1994 the exponent d x is the relevant fractal dimensionality and the subscript x stands for either b denoting the backbone cluster spanning the network or opt denoting the optimal path ghanbarian et al 2013b the value of d opt in two and three dimensions is respectively 1 21 and 1 43 sheppard et al 1999 at the percolation threshold p p c eq 3 reduces to the simple power law τ l d x 1 by comparison with experiments ghanbarian et al 2013b showed that eq 3 accurately estimated the porosity dependence of tortuosity in porous media they also compared the theoretical estimations of the scale dependence of tortuosity with numerical simulations and found reasonable agreement although there exist a few empirical and theoretical models in the literature the porous media community still lacks in a solid theory to explain how various physical and hydraulic properties of porous media may vary with scale hopmans et al 2002 stated that the inherent complexity of flow in heterogeneous media and the need to integrate theory with experiment demand innovative and multidisciplinary research efforts to overcome restrictions imposed by current understanding of scale dependence of flow and transport therefore the main objectives of this short communication are to 1 present concepts of finite size scaling analysis from physics and apply them to tortuosity diffusion coefficient and their scale dependence and 2 compare the proposed theoretic framework with numerical simulations in two and three dimensions 2 finite size scaling analysis percolation properties such as percolation threshold and universal non universal power law scaling relationships are valid for infinitely large systems sahimi 2011 however samples are typically finite in size either in numerical simulations or experimental observations fisher 1971 developed the finite size scaling analysis a theory for the scaling properties of a finite system near its percolation threshold based on finite size scaling analysis any property y of a system is linked to its linear size l as follows 4 y l ζ f l 1 ν p p c where f is a non singular function in the limit l y follows a power law such as y p p c δ in which δ ζν in the finite size scaling framework the spatial heterogeneity across scales is captured via parameters p and p c as well as scaling exponents ν and δ by applying finite size scaling theory to tortuosity τ one has 5 τ l ω ν f τ l 1 ν p p c where ω is the critical exponent that scales tortuosity as l τ follows the power law τ p p c ω while in the limit p p c τ conforms to τ l ω ν similarly for diffusion coefficient d one has 6 d l μ ν f d l 1 ν p p c where μ is the critical exponent relating diffusion coefficient to occupation fraction p and its critical value p c as in d p p c μ for an infinitely large medium 3 comparison with 2 d simulations matyka et al 2008 simulated hydraulic tortuosity in a two dimensional porous medium composed of freely overlapping solid squares of the same size to solve the flow equation they used the lattice boltzmann method with a single relaxation time matyka et al 2008 investigated the scale dependence of tortuosity at porosities ϕ 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 for different system sizes i e 50 100 200 and 300 lattice units l u the critical porosity for their 2 d system was 0 367 ϕ c 0 367 to apply the finite size scaling analysis eq 5 to the simulations of matyka et al 2008 following balberg 1987 and hunt et al 2014 we replaced p and p c respectively with ϕ and ϕ c the value of the exponent ω was determined using the simulations at the critical porosity ϕ c 0 367 carried out by duda et al 2011 who calculated the value of hydraulic tortuosity in a similar 2 d system in the simulations of duda et al 2011 a 2 d medium was constructed of freely overlapping solid squares placed uniformly at random locations in fig 1 we show the simulated hydraulic tortuosity versus the system size at ϕ ϕ c by fitting the power law τ l ω ν we found the exponent ω ν 0 1941 which is slightly greater than 0 19 the value reported by duda et al 2011 in their fig 4 given that ν 4 3 in two dimensions the value of ω is 0 259 the exponent ω ν 0 1941 is consistent with the result of ghanbarian et al 2013b who theoretically found τ l d opt 1 with d opt 1 21 in two dimensions simulations of duda et al 2011 show that at the percolation threshold ϕ ϕ c most of the fluid moving through the medium takes the most probable traveling length d opt fig 2a shows the simulated hydraulic tortuosity versus porosity minus its critical value at different system sizes for the simulations of matyka et al 2008 we also present the simulated hydraulic tortuosity against the system size at different porosities i e 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 in fig 2b it is apparent that the hydraulic tortuosity value increases with the increase of system size as can be seen both the τ ϕ ϕ c and τ l plots fig 2a and b are scattered however after applying the finite size scaling analysis with ω ν 0 1941 the data collapsed into a quasi universal trend fig 2c the collapse in the data is not perfect this might be due to the fact that the exponent ω was determined from another set of simulations reported by duda et al 2011 in a similar porous medium in fact matyka et al 2008 numerically calculated hydraulic tortuosity from the lengths of streamlines cutting an arbitrary cross section and the number of streamlines generated see their eq 14 however duda et al 2011 determined hydraulic tortuosity directly from fluid velocity field which simplified the calculation of tortuosity we found that if one replaces ω ν 0 1941 with ω ν 0 34 the data perfectly collapse together results not shown nonetheless fig 2c indicates that the finite size scaling analysis is a promising method to study the scale dependence of hydraulic tortuosity in porous media as we show via further evaluations in the next section 4 comparison with 3 d simulations to study transport in a sparely connected pore space ewing and horton 2002 conducted a series of monte carlo simulations using random walks in cubic networks of various occupation fractions i e p 0 2488 0 28 0 33 0 5 and 1 and sizes i e l 8 16 32 64 128 and 256 in their simulations l represents the number of sites on each side of the lattice although they reported the scale dependence of diffusion coefficient and diffusive tortuosity they did not apply the finite size scaling analysis to scale their simulations since ewing and horton 2002 performed simulations at the critical occupation fraction p c 0 2488 we first fitted τ l ω ν and d l μ ν to the simulations at p p c and found ω 1 198 fig 3a and μ 1 643 fig 3b the optimized exponent μ ν 1 867 is very close to the theoretical value 1 807 reported by stauffer and aharony 1994 the exponent ω 1 198 however is much smaller than that found from two dimensional simulations of duda et al 2011 presented in fig 1 this is because the simulations of ewing and horton 2002 are in three dimensions while those of matyka et al 2008 and duda et al 2011 are two dimensional moreover the networks in the ewing and horton 2002 study are very homogenous composed of bonds of the same conductance however the 2 d medium from matyka et al 2008 and duda et al 2011 is rather relatively heterogeneous results of kogut and straley 1979 as well as feng et al 1987 indicated that the scaling exponent of transport modes such as hydraulic and electrical conductivity would be a function of the conductance distribution broadness in addition to the system dimensionality the broader the conductance or pore throat size distribution the greater the critical exponent accordingly one should expect the exponent ω to be greater for the simulations from matyka et al 2008 and duda et al 2011 than those from ewing and horton 2002 although the latter is in three dimensions and the former in two dimensions interestingly the exponent μ 1 643 is very close to the value of 1 6 reported by kirkpatrick 1973 for bond percolation in three dimensional lattices and 1 5 determined by havlin et al 1983 who performed monte carlo simulations of random walk on percolation clusters it is also near 1 59 the universal scaling exponent for diffusion in three dimensions reported by sahimi 2011 the theoretical value of 1 59 was determined assuming that only diffusion on the sample spanning cluster contributes significantly to d we show the simulated diffusive tortuosity versus p p c and l in fig 4a and b for the 3 d simulations of ewing and horton 2002 both plots look scattered similar to 2 d simulations presented in fig 2a and b although we found that τ stays nearly constant with increasing l at p 1 results indicate that its value increases as system size increases at p values smaller than 1 fig 4b results of finite size scaling analysis shown in fig 4c clearly demonstrate the perfect collapse in the data fig 5a and b display diffusion coefficient against p p c and l respectively as fig 5b shows d does not vary with l at p 1 however as p decreases from 1 to 0 2488 diffusion coefficient consistently decreases with scale similar to tortuosity simulations fig 4a and b the simulated data presented in fig 5a and b are scattered however one may find a quasi universal trend in the scale dependent diffusion coefficient using the finite size scaling analysis fig 5c results shown in figs 2 4 and 5 clearly demonstrate that if the heterogeneity of a system reflected in the scaling exponent ω or μ and critical occupation fraction p c are precisely captured the finite size scaling analysis provides a promising approach to accurately characterize the scale dependence of transport modes over orders of magnitude variation in length l 8 to 256 results also display that the finite size scaling analysis is valid over a wide range even far above the critical occupation fraction 5 conclusion in this short communication we studied the scale dependence of tortuosity τ and diffusion coefficient d in porous media we presented concepts from finite size scaling analysis and physics and applied them to understand how transport modes might vary with scale comparison with two and three dimensional simulations demonstrated that the finite size scaling analysis is a promising theoretic framework to characterize the scale dependence of tortuosity and diffusion more specifically the τ l and d l plots looked scattered however after applying the finite size scaling analysis the data collapsed together and showed a quasi universal trend based on which tortuosity or diffusion coefficient at any other scale can be determined if the occupation fraction and its critical value are known further investigations are still required to evaluate finite size scaling analysis applications to study the scale dependence of tortuosity and diffusion in soils and rocks declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

1346,petroleum coke is a potential source of vanadium v nickel ni and molybdenum mo to water resources in athabasca oil sands region aosr of northern alberta canada large stockpiles of this bitumen upgrading byproduct will be incorporated into mine closure landscapes and understanding the processes and conditions controlling the release and transport of these transition metals is critical for effective reclamation we performed a series of laboratory column experiments to quantify v ni and mo release from fluid petroleum coke receiving meteoric water mw oil sands process affected water ospw and acid rock drainage ard influents we found that influent water chemistry strongly influences metal release with variations among metals largely attributed to ph dependent aqueous speciation and surface reactions cumulative v ni and mo mass release was greatest for columns receiving the low ph ard influent additionally cumulative v and mo mass release were greater in columns receiving ospw compared to mw influent whereas cumulative ni mass release was greater in columns receiving mw compared to ospw influent nevertheless only a small proportion of total v ni and mo was released during the experiments with the majority occurring during the first 10 pore volumes pvs this study offers insight into geochemical controls on v ni and mo release from fluid petroleum coke that supports ongoing development of oil sands mine reclamation strategies for landscapes that contain petroleum coke keywords oil sands petroleum coke vanadium nickel molybdenum reclamation 1 introduction oil sands bitumen upgrading into synthetic crude oil within the athabasca oil sands region aosr of northern alberta canada involves several processes including vacuum distillation coking and hydro conversion coking involves the thermal cracking of long chain hydrocarbons in the non distillable bitumen fraction into light hydrocarbons including naphtha kerosene and gas oils petroleum coke coke a byproduct of the coking process was generated at an approximate rate of 170 kg per m3 of synthetic crude oil in 2019 aer 2019 fluid coking and delayed coking are the two principal coking methods used in the aosr the resulting fluid coke and delayed coke exhibit different physical and chemical properties with the former accounting for approximately 60 of current coke production aer 2019 approximately 1 13 107 t of coke were generated during bitumen upgrading in 2019 and coke stockpiles in the aosr have steadily increased over time reaching 1 32 108 t by the end of 2019 aer 2019 these coke stockpiles will be integrated into mine closure landscapes in the aosr simhayov et al 2017 where the disturbed footprint due to surface mining activities currently exceeds 990 km2 capp 2021 coke

have reported dissolved v and ni concentrations up to 3 mg l 1 and 120 μg l 1 respectively within fluid coke deposits nesbitt and lindsay 2017 nesbitt et al 2018 also dissolved mo concentrations exceeding 2 0 mg l 1 have been reported within these coke deposits robertson et al 2019 elevated metal concentrations in coke leachate are a potential risk to water quality in mine closure landscapes that contain coke nesbitt and lindsay 2017 nesbitt et al 2017 2018 robertson et al 2019 zubot et al 2012 although v ni and mo are essential micronutrients uptake and accumulation by plants and invertebrates found in the aosr has been reported baker et al 2012 nakata et al 2011 puttaswamy and liber 2011 2012 puttaswamy et al 2010 bulk x ray absorption spectroscopy xas measurements by nesbitt et al 2017 revealed that v iv and ni ii porphyrins dominate v and ni speciation within fluid petroleum coke solids subsequent micro focused xas measurements revealed accumulation of inorganic v iii v v and ni ii species at fluid coke particle surfaces nesbitt and lindsay 2017 nesbitt et al 2018 unlike v and ni bulk xas measurements have shown that mo iv sulfides and mo vi complexes dominate solid phase mo speciation with the latter more abundant in fresh petroleum coke solids sequential chemical extractions by swerhone 2018 revealed that 50 to 70 of total v ni and mo release was associated with the exchangeable fraction while water soluble reducible acid soluble and organic fractions comprised the balance field observations have shown that v and mo release is enhanced under oxic conditions at neutral to alkaline ph which are the geochemical conditions that exist within the mixing zone between meteoric water mw and oil sand process affected water ospw below the water table of a commercial scale deposit nesbitt and lindsay 2017 puttaswamy and liber 2011 robertson et al 2019 zubot et al 2012 conversely ni release from fluid coke increases under acidic ph and its mobility is limited under alkaline ph nesbitt et al 2018 previous studies have examined v ni and mo mobility in the presence of mw and ospw which represent two principal water types in mine closure landscapes the

limiting the release and transport of metals 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory columns experimental setup the laboratory column experiments utilized six acrylic columns measuring 0 225 m long with a 0 078 m inner diameter the columns were packed with 0 165 m fresh dry coke dc n 3 or fresh slurry coke sc n 3 placed vertically between two 0 03 m layers of acid washed sand 20 40 mesh ottawa sand to direct a homogeneous flow of water through the coke nylon mesh screen no 125 was used to separate the coke from the sand layers the columns were packed to ensure that the bulk density was consistent within and among columns each column was fitted with one inlet bottom and one outlet top port the inlet port was connected to a high precision low flow multi channel peristaltic pump model 2058 watson marlow inc using ptfe tubing the outlet port was connected in series with ptfe tubing to a sealed sampling cell and overflow waste jug before starting the experiment the columns were flushed for 48 h with co2 g which is highly soluble in water to minimize bubble entrapment during initial water saturation meteoric water and ospw are the two principal water compositions anticipated in coke deposits nesbitt et al 2017 robertson et al 2019 while localized ard generation associated with sulfide mineral oxidation in ftt deposits is possible kuznetsov et al 2015 lindsay et al 2019

or naoh was added to bring the ph within 0 3 of the target value then 0 5 g air dried coke was added to each amber vial and the amber bottles were sealed immediately with a gas impermeable rubber lined septa the amber vials were removed from the anaerobic chamber and placed on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm for 48 h after which the ph of the suspension was measured again the change in ph δph was then plotted against initial ph ph0 and the phpzc was determined graphically as described previously pourrezaei et al 2014 robertson et al 2019 2 2 2 cation exchange capacity the cation exchange capacity cec was determined for dc and sc using combined methods described by holden et al 2012 kaminsky 2014 and santamarina et al 2002 three different masses 1 2 and 3 g of each fresh and oven dried 60 c for 24 h dc and sc sample was combined with 50 ml of ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm in separate beakers after which the suspensions were titrated with 0 0001 n methylene blue the titration endpoint corresponded to the volume of methylene blue solution required to produce a blue halo around the sample suspensions pipetted onto filter paper as described by holden et al 2012 and kaminsky 2014 or the divergence from the one to one line on the titration curve described by santamarina et al 2002 final cec values were calculated using the equation reported by kaminsky 2014 2 2 3 particle size distribution particle size distributions for dc and sc were determined by passing 400 g of each material through standard test sieves arranged in descending order of mesh size based on astm d422 63 2007 e2 astm 2007 samples were shaken for 20 min after which the sample masses retained in each sieve were recorded and used to calculate percent passing each mesh size 2 2 4 specific surface area

four energy dispersive x ray spectrometers empa eds jeol jxa 8600 superprobe microanalyzer japan was used to investigate the internal chemical composition of entrained mineral particles within dc and sc samples thin sections of these samples were prepared according to previously described methods nesbitt and lindsay 2017 application of a 20 nm c coating was carried out before collection of backscattered electron bse images and quantitative eds analysis using a 15 kv acceleration voltage 2 2 6 elemental analyses bulk elemental analyses were determined for initial dc and sc samples from

ics2100 dionex corporation usa 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 statistical methods the pearson correlation was used to assess covariance of elemental concentrations for initial coke samples the data were first treated using a centered log ratio transformation and 5 significance level i e ρ 0 05 was used during interpretation 2 4 2 transport parameters a conservative tracer test was carried out at the end of the experiment to determine transport parameters the tracer solution containing 100 mg l 1 br was passed through the columns at the same flow rate as the influent solutions influent and effluent samples were collected four times daily and br concentrations were determined using an ion selective electrode orion 9635bnwp thermo scientific usa the electrode was calibrated using a 15 point curve spanning the range of expected effluent br concentrations transport parameters were determined by solving for the one dimensional advection dispersion equation c t d 2 c x 2 v c x 1 where c is the effluent tracer concentration mg l 1 t is time s d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient m2 s 1 x is distance m and v is the average linear pore water velocity m s 1 the flow rate m3 s 1 was monitored throughout the experiments and tracer test by weighing the waste reservoir over time the residence time was identified as the elapsed time for the effluent br concentration c to reach 50 of the influent concentration c0 column pvs were calculated from the residence time and average flow rate during the tracer test 2 4 3 geochemical modeling thermodynamic equilibrium modeling of influent and effluent chemistry was performed using a modified minteq v4 database within the phreeqci version 3 6 1 15 000 code gustafsson 2020 parkhurst and appelo 2013 thermodynamic constants for aqueous v species were added or revised as described by vessey et al 2020 table s1 data quality was assessed using speciated charge balances with errors exceeding 5 triggering repeat analyses modeled

interval s i m j i dvi m j i 3 the cumulative mass release m j was then calculated as the sum of m j i over time m j m j i 4 cumulative mass release was plotted versus pore volume to assess the influence of geochemical conditions on metal release over the experiment duration 3 results and discussion 3 1 fluid petroleum coke 3 1 1 physical characteristics coke solids exhibited a spherical to sub spherical morphology and typically ranged from 40 to 500 μm in diameter fig s1 based on psd results both dc and sc are classified as a moderately well sorted sand with low fines content with a uniformity coefficient of 2 table 2 despite these characteristics coke particles exhibited fracturing that could result from thermal expansion and contraction during the coking process or from physical breakdown during hydrotransport fig s1 fracturing was more commonly observed for sc samples suggesting a link to slurry preparation and hydrotransport inorganic particles observed at sc surfaces were less abundant for dc samples suggesting that fracturing contributes to their occurrence although ssa values were consistently low higher average value were observed for sc 6 5 0 48 m2 g 1 as compared to dc 0 25 0 18 m2 g 1 samples table 2 this ssa value for sc is generally consistent with previously reported values of 5 to 8 m2 g 1 for fluid coke samples nesbitt et al 2017 pourrezaei et al 2014 zubot et al 2012 average phpzc values for fresh dc and sc samples were 6 65 0 17 and 7 19 0 17 respectively table s3 s4 these values were generally consistent with previously reported values of 6 3 0 7 robertson et al 2019 and 6 5 0 3 pourrezaei et al 2014 for fluid coke samples consequently dc and sc particles will exhibit net positive and net negative surface charges when equilibrated with solutions exhibiting a ph below and above these phpzc values respectively 3 1 2 chemical characteristics the chemical composition of dc and sc samples table 3 fig s3 was similar and dominated by c 79 4 1 25 wt and s 8 02 0 15 wt elevated mean concentrations of several major elements including si 12 600 1010 mg kg 1 al 6980 147 mg kg 1 fe 5180 212 mg kg 1 ca 2030 201 mg kg 1 zr 2410 1140 mg kg 1 ti 1380 82 8 mg kg 1 k 1050 39 1 mg kg 1 and mg 799 43 5 mg kg 1 are likely associated with entrained solids nesbitt et al 2017 potentially hazardous metals including v 1370 47 1 mg kg 1 ni 538 16 1 mg kg 1 and mo 75 1 3 5 mg kg 1 were also detected although not quantified here har 1981 previously reported elevated concentrations of volatile elements including h 1 5 1 67 wt n 1 3 1 6 wt and o 2 3 2 5 wt are lost on ignition very similar volatile element concentrations also have been reported previously by chung et al 1996 and kessler and hendry 2006 solid phase concentrations of major and trace elements were generally consistent with previous studies of fluid coke table 3 exceptions included ni concentrations previously reported by zubot et al 2012 and mo concentrations previously reported by nesbitt et al 2017 and zubot et al 2012 nickel concentrations were 520 570 mg kg 1 for samples analyzed in this study while zubot et al 2012 reported concentrations of 35 68 mg kg 1 similarly mo concentrations were 71 85 mg kg 1 in this study compared to 7 6 29 mg kg 1 reported by zubot et al 2012 and nesbitt et al 2017 variations among studies may result from differences in bitumen feedstock sampling location weathering extent or analytical methods epma bse images of dc and sc samples prepared as thin sections revealed an inner structure comprised of multiple concentric layers consistent with previous studies nesbitt and lindsay 2017 nesbitt et al 2017 each layer included an inner 5 10 μm thick region and an outer 1 5 μm thick margin with differing chemical characteristics the epma eds results revealed that the inner region of individual layers was dominated by s al and si while the outer margin of these layers exhibited elevated k ca ti v mn and fe concentrations figs s3 s6 statistical analysis revealed a strong positive correlation r 0 97 between bulk c and s concentrations is attributed to their dominance of both dc and sc compositions similarly strong positive correlation of v and ni with both c r 0 95 and s r 0 97 is consistent with their occurrence in v iv and ni ii porphyrin complexes within fluid coke samples nesbitt and lindsay 2017 nesbitt et al 2017 2018 there was also a strong positive correlation between mo with c r 0 90 and s r 0 91 within coke bulk concentrations iron and ti exhibited a strong positive correlation r 0 86 which indicates their association with oxide phases epma eds spectra collected at the outer margins of individual layers exhibited relatively high ti and fe concentrations compared to the inner regions fig s3 in addition entrained grains of pyrite fes2 fig s6 and ti oxides fig s6 were observed the presence of the ti oxide polymorphs rutile tio2 and anatase tio2 in fluid coke particles was previously reported by nesbitt et al 2017 the presence of fe and ti bearing phases within coke may provide sorption sites for dissolved metals blackmore et al 1996 zubot et al 2012 strong positive correlation between si al k and mg r 0 80 0 96 was attributed to their co occurrence in entrained aluminosilicate phases within fluid coke particles fig s3 this finding is consistent with nesbitt et al 2017 who observed sub micron sized si bearing particles that also contained al k mg the positive correlation between ca and sr r 0 77 is indicative of carbonate minerals which have been detected in previous studies of fluid coke particles kessler and hendry 2006 nesbitt et al 2017 3 2 column experiments 3 2 1 transport parameters average linear pore water velocity and dispersivity were 4 0 10 7 m s 1 and 0 17 cm respectively for the dc mw column fig s7 similar values were observed for the sc mw column and the dc and sc columns receiving the ospw influent the apparent absence of br in effluent from the dc or sc columns receiving ard is attributed to br sorption at low ph based on similarities in physical properties of dc and sc and consistent flow rates among columns transport parameters are assumed similar based on breakthrough curves and flow rate porosity relationships residence times ranged from 6 8 d dc mw to 7 6 d sc ospw with slight differences attributed to minor variations in column packing table s2 3 2 2 ph ec and alkalinity influent ph remained relatively constant during the experiments for the mw 7 2 0 2 ospw 8 6 0 2 and ard solutions 2 1 0 1 fig 1 effluent ph decreased relative to influent ph for all columns column effluent ph values ranged from 4 48 5 40 for dc mw and 4 70 6 40 for sc mw and from 6 10 6 90 for the dc ospw and sc ospw columns effluent ph values ranged from 1 90 2 60 and 1 90 3 30 for the dc ard and sc ard columns respectively slightly higher initial effluent ph values in all columns are attributed to ligand exchange and acid neutralization reactions the relative ph decreases for columns receiving the mw and ospw influents may result from oxidative dissolution of pyrite or other acid generating reactions lindsay et al 2015 influent ec and alkalinity values were relatively consistent over time median influent ec values were 11 μs cm 1 for mw 4 8 ms cm 1 for ospw and 8 7 ms cm 1 for ard fig 1 median alkalinity for the mw and ospw influents were 12 and 710 mg l 1 as caco3 respectively whereas ard influent ph was consistently below 4 5 which was the endpoint for alkalinity titrations effluent and influent ec and alkalinity values were generally consistent for the dc ospw sc ospw dc ard and sc ard columns effluent ec values ranged from 4 3 5 6 ms cm 1 and 4 3 7 8 ms cm 1 for the dc ospw and sc ospw columns respectively these values were 7 8 9 0 ms cm 1 for the dc ard column and 8 0 12 ms cm 1 for the sc ard column in contrast initial effluent ec values for the dc mw and sc mw columns were substantially higher than the mw influent solution these ec values decreased over the first 10 pvs from 1100 to 76 μs cm 1 for dc mw and from 2600 to 250 μs cm 1 for sc mw ongoing decreases in ec values were observed for the dc mw and sc mw columns with effluent values approaching the influent over time like ec values large decreases in effluent alkalinity were observed during the first 10 pvs for the dc mw and sc mw columns fig 1 effluent alkalinity values decreased from 83 to 26 mg l 1 for dc mw and 630 to 95 mg l 1 for sc mw and after 20 pvs were generally consistent with influent values slight decreases in effluent alkalinity were observed during the first 2 pvs for the dc ospw and sc ospw columns after which differences between influent and effluent alkalinity values were minimal these temporal trends in effluent ec and alkalinity values are attributed to adsorption desorption and precipitation dissolution reactions during equilibration with mw and ospw influent solutions the corresponding contribution of dissolved ions was greatest at early time and more apparent for the dc mw and sc mw columns likely due to the relatively low ionic strength of this influent compared to ospw and ard 3 2 3 vanadium vanadium concentrations were consistently below detection i e 0 52 μg l 1 in the mw ospw and ard influents whereas effluent concentrations varied among columns and decreased with increasing pvs fig 2 tables s5 s10 the lowest effluent v concentrations were observed for dc mw 0 52 2 86 μg l 1 and dc ospw 0 52 17 0 μg l 1 whereas slightly higher concentrations were observed for sc mw 11 1 6760 μg l 1 median 24 7 μg l 1 effluent v concentrations for dc ard 56 4 3420 μg l 1 median 186 μg l 1 sc ospw 73 9 13 700 μg l 1 median 312 μg l 1 and sc ard 65 9 22 400 μg l 1 median 617 μg l 1 were consistently higher than the other columns in general higher effluent v concentrations were observed for dc compared to sc columns for a given influent composition this observation suggests differences in ssa and potentially that surface bound particles influence v release under different geochemical conditions vanadium release was also dependent upon influent chemistry with the magnitude of effluent v concentrations following the general order ard ospw mw this trend in v release among influent compositions is largely attributed to sorption nesbitt and lindsay 2017 thermodynamic modelling indicates that h2vo4 was the dominant aqueous v species in the mw and ospw columns whereas vo2 and vo2 were dominant for the ard columns fig 3 the predicted occurrence of both vo2 and vo2 suggests conditions favourable for reduction of v v to v iv under low ph conditions consistent undersaturation of all column effluents with respect to relevant v bearing phases e g v oh 3 s ca vo3 2 s supports the interpretation that sorption controlled v mobility within these columns comparison of effluent ph and phpzc values suggest that the net surface charge on both dc and sc was negative i e ph phpzc in the ospw columns and positive i e ph phpzc in the mw and ard columns nesbitt and lindsay 2017 observed similar relationships in v mobility within a commercial scale fluid petroleum coke deposit and suggested that the higher ionic strength of ospw 0 05 m compared to mw could further enhance v mobility our results similarly suggest that sorption reactions limited v mobility within the mw column relative to the ard and ospw columns 3 2 4 nickel influent ni concentrations were consistently below detection i e 1 4 μg l 1 like v effluent ni concentrations generally decreased with increasing pvs and varied among columns fig 2 tables s5 s10 however trends in the relative magnitude of effluent ni and v concentrations differed among columns and influent solutions the lowest concentrations were observed for dc mw 1 4 1520 μg l 1 median 16 3 μg l 1 and dc ospw 1 4 929 μg l 1 median 25 0 μg l 1 whereas sc ospw 10 5 113 μg l 1 median 62 3 μg l 1 and sc mw 9 72 655 μg l 1 median 97 0 μg l 1 exhibited slightly higher and similar effluent ni concentrations these concentrations were highest for dc ard 25 1 2600 μg l 1 median 114 μg l 1 and sc ard 38 5 8460 μg l 1 median 172 μg l 1 and were generally consistent during the experiment aqueous ni concentrations followed a general order ard mw ospw and compared to v relatively minor differences were noted between dc and sc with mw and ospw influents thermodynamic modeling indicated aqueous ni speciation within these influent solutions was dominated by ni2 45 while niso4 0 and nihco3 comprised the remainder fig 4 the proportion of nihco3 and niso4 0 in effluent from dc and sc columns receiving the mw and ospw influent decreased rapidly with declining effluent alkalinity and so4 2 concentrations fig s8 and ni2 dominated after 2 pvs modelling also indicated that ni2 and niso4 0 were present at approximately equal proportions in the ard influent and effluent modeled sis suggest conditions were not favourable for nio s nico3 s or ni oh 2 s precipitation fig s9 although nis s sis were not determined because h2s was absent from column effluents oxidative dissolution of sulfide minerals can proceed in the precent of o2 or fe iii lindsay et al 2015 nesbitt et al 2018 found evidence of both nio s and nis s in sc samples from an operational deposit suggests that dissolution of these phases could contribute to ni release weak positive correlations between effluent ni concentrations and both ph r 0 25 and alkalinity r 0 19 is consistent with the interpretation that ph dependent sorption reactions also influence ni release similar negative correlations between ph and dissolved ni concentrations were previously reported for sc leachates puttaswamy and liber 2011 and pore waters nesbitt et al 2018 net positive surface charges in dc and sc columns receiving mw and ard influents combined with the dominance of ni2 and niso4 0 aqueous species is consistent with higher ni concentrations in associated effluents in contrast ni2 sorption is favourable in ospw columns where dc and sc are characterized by a net negative surface charge 3 2 5 molybdenum consistent with v and ni influent mo concentrations were consistently below detection 0 79 μg l 1 and effluent concentrations generally decreased with increasing pvs fig 2 tables s5 s10 effluent mo concentrations were lower for dc mw 0 79 5 84 μg l 1 and sc mw 0 79 694 μg l 1 median 2 5 μg l 1 median concentrations were higher for dc ospw 0 79 63 9 μg l 1 median 23 μg l 1 and sc ospw 9 90 1340 μg l 1 median 27 μg l 1 and highest for dc ard 21 3 408 μg l 1 median 43 μg l 1 and sc ard 3 41 102 μg l 1 median 51 μg l 1 effluent mo concentrations were generally higher for sc compared to dc columns with mw and ospw influent with the largest differences observed over the first 5 pvs effluent mo concentrations exhibited a similar gradual decrease from 40 to 10 μg l 1 for dc ospw and sc ospw over the remainder of the experiment an opposite initial trend was observed for sc ard where effluent mo concentrations increased from 3 4 to 99 μg l 1 over the first 3 pvs and gradually decreased to 10 μg l 1 over the remaining pvs after a sharp initial decrease effluent mo concentrations for dc ard fluctuated between 21 and 48 μg l 1 from 4 to 31 pvs overall effluent mo concentrations followed the general order ard ospw mw thermodynamic modeling indicates that moo4 2 was consistently the predominant aqueous mo species in mw and ospw column influents and effluents whereas h2moo4 0 dominated for ard column influents and effluents fig 5 modelling also revealed consistent undersaturation of all influents and effluents with respect to nimoo4 s and camoo4 s fig s9 suggesting conditions were unfavorable for their precipitation additionally these models indicate that formation of polynuclear mo vi species including heptamolybdate ions i e h3mo7 o24 3 h2mo7 o24 4 hmo7 o24 5 is thermodynamically unfavorable robertson et al 2019 reported that mo mobility within fluid petroleum coke deposits is largely controlled by sorption reactions that are dependent upon both ph and ionic strength these authors observed increased mo mobility concomitant with increasing ph and ionic strength across a mixing zone between mw and ospw derived pore waters effluent mo concentrations for the current study followed similar trends with moo4 2 sorption onto net positively charged surfaces i e ph phpzc likely limiting mo release for dc mw and sc mw the higher effluent ph i e ph phpzc and ionic strength for dc ospw and sc ospw likely decreased potential for moo4 2 sorption finally the predominance of the neutral h2moo4 0 species would have enhanced mo mobility in the dc ard and sc ard columns 3 3 cumulative mass release differences in cumulative mass release for v ni and mo were observed between dc and sc columns and among mw ospw and ard columns table 4 cumulative mass release represented a small proportion of v 0 9 ni 0 7 and mo 1 1 in initial dc and sc solids trends in metal release tracked effluent metal concentrations with a majority of total v ni and mo release observed in the first 5 pvs for columns where maximum effluent metal concentrations were observed during the same interval fig 6 subsequent metal release followed trends in effluent concentrations which generally decreased during the experiments fig 2 cumulative v mass release was substantially higher for sc 5030 12 800 μg kg 1 compared to dc 3300 μg kg 1 and over 80 of total mass release for sc occurred over the first 5 pvs although cumulative ni mass release for dc 760 2110 μg kg 1 and sc 651 3550 μg kg 1 was similar the rate of ni release from sc mw and sc ospw was slower than sc ard and all dc columns the low proportions of total v and ni release are attributed to their common occurrence in porphyrin complexes within fluid petroleum coke particles nesbitt and lindsay 2017 nesbitt et al 2017 these highly stable organometallic complexes can be resistant to weathering over geologic time lewan and maynard 1982 zuliani et al 2016 despite lower cumulative mo mass release for dc 3 82 760 μg kg 1 and sc 514 869 μg kg 1 the proportion of total mo released during the column experiments was generally consistent with v and ni however consistent with trends in effluent mo concentrations cumulative mo mass release was substantially lower for dc mw 3 82 μg kg 1 and dc ospw 276 μg kg 1 compared to sc mw 514 μg kg 1 and sc ospw 869 μg kg 1 4 conclusions laboratory column experiments were conducted to assess long term trends in v ni and mo release from oil sands fluid petroleum coke under different geochemical conditions principal factors controlling effluent concentrations and cumulative mass release for these elements include ph ionic strength and surface area although reduction oxidation and precipitation dissolution reactions likely influenced v ni and mo release results indicated that sorption desorption reactions are a key control on effluent metal concentrations these reactions are strongly influenced by ph dependent surface charge and aqueous metal speciation cumulative metal release during the experiments accounted for less than 1 of initial v ni and mo contents within fluid petroleum coke contributions to total metal release generally occurred early in the experiments yet measurable effluent v ni and mo concentrations generally persisted over the entire duration considering both effluent concentrations and total release the results indicate that a combination of higher surface area circumneutral alkaline ph and elevated ionic strength are generally conducive to v and mo release and less favourable to ni release in contrast enhanced ni release may occur under mildly acidic conditions whereas extremely acidic conditions may favor v and ni release overall this study offers insight into relationships between metal release and geochemical conditions that could

1346,petroleum coke is a potential source of vanadium v nickel ni and molybdenum mo to water resources in athabasca oil sands region aosr of northern alberta canada large stockpiles of this bitumen upgrading byproduct will be incorporated into mine closure landscapes and understanding the processes and conditions controlling the release and transport of these transition metals is critical for effective reclamation we performed a series of laboratory column experiments to quantify v ni and mo release from fluid petroleum coke receiving meteoric water mw oil sands process affected water ospw and acid rock drainage ard influents we found that influent water chemistry strongly influences metal release with variations among metals largely attributed to ph dependent aqueous speciation and surface reactions cumulative v ni and mo mass release was greatest for columns receiving the low ph ard influent additionally cumulative v and mo mass release were greater in columns receiving ospw compared to mw influent whereas cumulative ni mass release was greater in columns receiving mw compared to ospw influent nevertheless only a small proportion of total v ni and mo was released during the experiments with the majority occurring during the first 10 pore volumes pvs this study offers insight into geochemical controls on v ni and mo release from fluid petroleum coke that supports

conversion coking involves the thermal cracking of long chain hydrocarbons in the non distillable bitumen fraction into light hydrocarbons including naphtha kerosene and gas oils petroleum coke coke a byproduct of the coking process was generated at an approximate rate of 170 kg per m3 of synthetic crude oil in 2019 aer 2019 fluid coking and delayed coking are the two principal coking methods used in the aosr the resulting fluid coke and delayed coke exhibit different physical and chemical properties with the former accounting for approximately 60 of current coke production aer 2019 approximately 1 13 107 t of coke were generated during bitumen upgrading in 2019 and coke stockpiles in the aosr have steadily increased over time reaching 1 32 108 t by the end of 2019 aer 2019 these coke stockpiles will be integrated into mine closure landscapes in the aosr simhayov et al 2017 where the disturbed footprint due to surface mining activities currently exceeds 990 km2 capp 2021 coke is a low density carbonaceous material that contains a wide range of major minor and trace elements including v mo and ni kessler and hendry 2006 nesbitt et al 2017 zubot et al 2012 previous studies have reported dissolved v and ni concentrations up to 3 mg l 1 and 120 μg l 1 respectively within fluid coke deposits nesbitt and lindsay 2017 nesbitt et al 2018 also dissolved mo concentrations exceeding 2 0 mg l 1 have been reported within these coke deposits robertson et al 2019 elevated metal concentrations in coke leachate are a potential risk to water quality in mine closure landscapes that contain coke nesbitt and lindsay 2017 nesbitt et al 2017 2018 robertson et al 2019 zubot et al 2012 although v ni and mo are essential micronutrients uptake and accumulation by plants and invertebrates found in the aosr has been reported baker et al 2012 nakata et al 2011 puttaswamy and liber 2011 2012 puttaswamy et al 2010 bulk x ray absorption spectroscopy xas measurements by nesbitt et al 2017 revealed that v iv and ni ii porphyrins dominate v and ni speciation within fluid petroleum coke solids subsequent micro focused xas measurements revealed accumulation of inorganic v iii v v and ni ii species at fluid coke particle surfaces nesbitt and lindsay 2017 nesbitt et al 2018 unlike v and ni bulk xas measurements have shown that mo iv sulfides and mo vi complexes dominate solid phase mo speciation with the latter more abundant in fresh petroleum coke solids sequential chemical extractions by swerhone 2018 revealed that 50 to 70 of total v ni and mo release was associated with the exchangeable fraction while water soluble reducible acid soluble and organic fractions comprised the balance field observations have shown that v and mo release is enhanced under oxic conditions at neutral to alkaline ph which are the geochemical conditions that exist within the mixing zone between meteoric water mw and oil sand process affected water ospw below the water table of a commercial scale deposit nesbitt and lindsay 2017 puttaswamy and liber 2011 robertson et al 2019 zubot et al 2012 conversely ni release from fluid coke increases under acidic ph and its mobility is limited under alkaline ph nesbitt et al 2018 previous studies have examined v ni and mo mobility in the presence of mw and ospw which represent two principal water types in mine closure landscapes the oxidative weathering of oil sands froth treatment tailings ftt also has a potential for acid rock drainage ard generation within these landscapes kuznetsov et al 2015 lindsay et al 2019 although ard is unlikely to represent a principal water type information on metal release from fluid coke that may interact with ard under acidic ph conditions would provide additional information to support mine closure planning laboratory column experiments were conducted to i examine geochemical controls on long term metal release and ii determine the timing and extent of long term metal release from fluid coke during interaction with different water types that could be encountered in oil sands mine closure landscapes the results of this study will improve the understanding of metal release i e v ni and mo and mobility within the oil sands mine closure landscape and will assist decision makers i e mine closure planners in developing strategies for integrating coke into closure landscapes while limiting the release and transport of metals 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory columns experimental setup the laboratory column experiments utilized six acrylic columns measuring 0 225 m long with a 0 078 m inner diameter the columns were packed with 0 165 m fresh dry coke dc n 3 or fresh slurry coke sc n 3 placed vertically between two 0 03 m layers of acid washed sand 20 40 mesh ottawa sand to direct a homogeneous flow of water through the coke nylon mesh screen no 125 was used to separate the coke from the sand layers the columns were packed to ensure that the bulk density was consistent within and among columns each column was fitted with one inlet bottom and one outlet top port the inlet port was connected to a high precision low flow multi channel peristaltic pump model 2058 watson marlow inc using ptfe tubing the outlet port was connected in series with ptfe tubing to a sealed sampling cell and overflow waste jug before starting the experiment the columns were flushed for 48 h with co2 g which is highly soluble in water to minimize bubble entrapment during initial water saturation meteoric water and ospw are the two principal water compositions anticipated in coke deposits nesbitt et al 2017 robertson et al 2019 while localized ard generation associated with sulfide mineral oxidation in ftt deposits is possible kuznetsov et al 2015 lindsay et al 2019 target compositions for the ospw and ard influent solutions were based on previous studies by dompierre et al 2016 and lindsay et al 2019 respectively and were prepared by dissolving reagent grade salts i e caso4 2h2o na2so4 nacl mgso4 7h2o fe2 so4 3 xh2o nahco3 kcl into deionized di water table 1 the simulated mw influent was prepared by bubbling di water with air overnight to ensure equilibration with atmospheric gases table 1 these solutions were stored in glass bottles and pumped upward through the columns to avoid gravity drainage all glassware was cleaned with 10 v v hydrochloric acid thoroughly rinsed with di water before use 2 2 solid sampling and analysis 2 2 1 ph point of zero charge the ph point of zero charge phpzc for dc and sc solids was determined using

laboratory products usa 5 vol h2 g balance n2 g to remove the buffering effect of dissolved co2 alam et al 2016 for each sample nine 40 ml amber vials were filled with 25 ml of the purged 0 1 m nacl solution and ph values in the vials were independently adjusted to 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 using small volumes of 0 1 or 1 n hcl or naoh these ph values were checked after 1 h and additional 0 1 n hcl or naoh was added to bring the ph within 0 3 of the target value then 0 5 g air dried coke was added to each amber vial and the amber bottles were sealed immediately with a gas impermeable rubber lined septa the amber vials were removed from the anaerobic chamber and placed on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm for 48 h after which the ph of the suspension was measured again the change in ph δph was then plotted against initial ph ph0 and the phpzc was determined graphically as described previously pourrezaei et al 2014 robertson et al 2019 2 2 2 cation exchange capacity the cation exchange capacity cec was determined for dc and sc using combined methods described by holden et al 2012 kaminsky 2014 and santamarina et al 2002 three different masses 1 2 and 3 g of each fresh and oven dried 60 c for 24 h dc and sc sample was combined with 50 ml of ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm in separate beakers after which the suspensions were titrated with 0 0001 n methylene blue the titration endpoint corresponded to the volume of methylene blue solution required to produce a blue halo around the sample suspensions pipetted onto filter paper as described by holden et al 2012 and kaminsky 2014 or the divergence from the one to one line on the titration curve described by santamarina et al 2002 final cec values were calculated using the equation reported by kaminsky 2014 2 2 3 particle size distribution particle size distributions for dc and sc were determined by passing 400 g of each material through standard test sieves arranged in descending order of mesh size based on astm d422 63 2007 e2 astm 2007 samples were shaken for 20 min after which the sample masses retained in each sieve were recorded and used to calculate percent passing each mesh size 2 2 4 specific surface area analysis the specific surface area ssa of oven dried dc and sc particles was determined by the brunauer emmett teller bet method brunauer et al 1938 using a surface area analyzer micromeritics asap 2020 georgia usa also the barrett joyncer halenda bjh method was used to determine intraparticle porosities for coke particles prior to analysis samples were heated at 60 c for 24 h to remove any moisture and absorbed gases 2 2 5 electron microanalyses scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi fe sem su8010 japan was performed to examine the morphology of coke particles surfaces freeze dried 50 c for 24 h samples of dc and sc were mounted to al stubs using conductive c tape secondary electron imaging was performed using a 3 kv acceleration voltage an electron microprobe analyzer fitted with four energy dispersive x ray spectrometers empa eds jeol jxa 8600 superprobe microanalyzer japan was used to investigate the internal chemical composition of entrained mineral particles within dc and sc samples thin sections of these samples were prepared according to previously described methods nesbitt and lindsay 2017 application of a 20 nm c coating was carried out before collection of backscattered electron bse images and quantitative eds analysis using a 15 kv acceleration voltage 2 2 6 elemental analyses bulk elemental analyses were determined for initial dc and sc samples from each column total c and s were determined by combustion and infrared detection of evolved co2 and so2 cs230 carbon sulfur determinator leco corporation usa following complete digestion by li borate fusion 4 h at 900 c concentrations of major and trace elements were quantified by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes perkin elmer optima 5300dv and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms perkin elmer nexion 2000 respectively a modified aqua regia method was used for quantification of as and se this method involved sample digestion 1 h at 80 c using a 1 1 1 mixture of hno3 hcl and di followed by icp ms analysis 2 3 water sampling and analysis column influent and effluent samples were collected weekly daily effluent sampling was also performed during the first pv to capture initial metal release samples were collected into polypropylene pp syringes norm ject henke sass wolf gmbh germany and immediately transferred directly into pp centrifuge tubes

ics2100 dionex corporation usa 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 statistical methods the pearson correlation was used to assess covariance of elemental concentrations for initial coke samples the data were first treated using a centered log ratio transformation and 5 significance level i e ρ 0 05 was used during interpretation 2 4 2 transport parameters a conservative tracer test was carried out at the end of the experiment to determine transport parameters the tracer solution containing 100 mg l 1 br was passed through the columns at the same flow rate as the influent solutions influent and effluent samples were collected four times daily and br concentrations were determined using an ion selective electrode orion 9635bnwp thermo scientific usa the electrode was calibrated using a 15 point curve spanning the range of expected effluent br concentrations transport parameters were determined by solving for the one dimensional advection dispersion equation c t d 2 c x 2 v c x 1 where c is the effluent tracer concentration mg l 1 t is time s d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient m2 s 1 x is distance m and v is the average linear pore water velocity m s 1 the flow rate m3 s 1 was monitored throughout the experiments and tracer test by weighing the waste reservoir over time the residence time was identified as the elapsed time for the effluent br concentration c to reach 50 of the influent concentration c0 column pvs were calculated from the residence time and average flow rate during the tracer test 2 4 3 geochemical modeling thermodynamic equilibrium modeling of influent and effluent chemistry was performed using a modified minteq v4 database within the phreeqci version 3 6 1 15 000 code gustafsson 2020 parkhurst and appelo 2013 thermodynamic constants for aqueous v species were added or revised as described by vessey et al 2020 table s1 data quality was assessed using speciated charge balances with errors exceeding 5 triggering repeat analyses modeled saturation indices sis and aqueous speciation supported data interpretation 2 4 4 cumulative mass release the change in mass storage μg δm j was calculated by subtracting cumulative mass input μg m j

interval s i m j i dvi m j i 3 the cumulative mass release m j was then calculated as the sum of m j i over time m j m j i 4 cumulative mass release was plotted versus pore volume to assess the influence of geochemical conditions on metal release over the experiment duration 3 results and discussion 3 1 fluid petroleum coke 3 1 1 physical characteristics coke solids exhibited a spherical to sub spherical morphology and typically ranged from 40 to 500 μm in diameter fig s1 based on psd results both dc and sc are classified as a moderately well sorted sand with low fines content with a uniformity coefficient of 2 table 2 despite these characteristics coke particles exhibited fracturing that could result from thermal expansion and contraction during the coking process or from physical breakdown during hydrotransport fig s1 fracturing was more commonly observed for sc samples suggesting a link to slurry preparation and hydrotransport inorganic particles observed at sc surfaces were less abundant for dc samples suggesting that fracturing contributes to their occurrence although ssa values were consistently low higher average value were observed for sc 6 5 0 48 m2 g 1 as compared to dc 0 25 0 18 m2 g 1 samples table 2 this ssa value for sc is generally consistent with previously reported values of 5 to 8 m2 g 1 for fluid coke samples nesbitt et al 2017 pourrezaei et al 2014 zubot et al 2012 average phpzc values for fresh dc and sc samples were 6 65 0 17 and 7 19 0 17 respectively table s3 s4 these values were generally consistent with previously reported values of 6 3 0 7 robertson et al 2019 and 6 5 0 3 pourrezaei et al 2014 for fluid coke samples consequently dc and sc particles will exhibit net positive and net negative surface charges when equilibrated with solutions exhibiting a ph below and above these phpzc values respectively 3 1 2 chemical characteristics the chemical composition of dc and sc samples table 3 fig s3 was similar and dominated by c 79 4 1 25 wt and s 8 02 0 15 wt elevated mean concentrations of several major elements including si 12 600 1010 mg kg 1 al 6980 147 mg kg 1 fe 5180 212 mg kg 1 ca 2030 201 mg kg 1 zr 2410 1140 mg kg 1 ti 1380 82 8 mg kg 1 k 1050 39 1 mg kg 1 and mg 799 43 5 mg kg 1 are likely associated with entrained solids nesbitt et al 2017 potentially hazardous metals including v 1370 47 1 mg kg 1 ni 538 16 1 mg kg 1 and mo 75 1 3 5 mg kg 1 were also detected although not quantified here har 1981 previously reported elevated concentrations of volatile elements including h 1 5 1 67 wt n 1 3 1 6 wt and o 2 3 2 5 wt are lost on ignition very similar volatile element concentrations also have been reported previously by chung et al 1996 and kessler and hendry 2006 solid phase concentrations of major and trace elements were generally consistent with previous studies of fluid coke table 3 exceptions included ni concentrations previously reported by zubot et al 2012 and mo concentrations previously reported by nesbitt et al 2017 and zubot et al 2012 nickel concentrations were 520 570 mg kg 1 for samples analyzed in this study while zubot et al 2012 reported concentrations of 35 68 mg kg 1 similarly mo concentrations were 71 85 mg kg 1 in this study compared to 7 6 29 mg kg 1 reported by zubot et al 2012 and nesbitt et al 2017 variations among studies may result from differences in bitumen feedstock sampling location weathering extent or analytical methods epma bse images of dc and sc samples prepared as thin sections revealed an inner structure comprised of multiple concentric layers consistent with previous studies nesbitt and lindsay 2017 nesbitt et al 2017 each layer included an inner 5 10 μm thick region and an outer 1 5 μm thick margin with differing chemical characteristics the epma eds results revealed that the inner region of individual layers was dominated by s al and si while the outer margin of these layers exhibited elevated k ca ti v mn and fe concentrations figs s3 s6 statistical analysis revealed a strong positive correlation r 0 97 between bulk c and s concentrations is attributed to their dominance of both dc and sc compositions similarly strong positive correlation of v and ni with both c r 0 95 and s r 0 97 is consistent with their occurrence in v iv and ni ii porphyrin complexes within fluid coke samples nesbitt and lindsay 2017 nesbitt et al 2017 2018 there was also a strong positive correlation between mo with c r 0 90 and s r 0 91 within coke bulk concentrations iron and ti exhibited a strong positive correlation r 0 86 which indicates their association with oxide phases epma eds spectra collected at the outer margins of individual layers exhibited relatively high ti and fe concentrations compared to the inner regions fig s3 in addition entrained grains of pyrite fes2 fig s6 and ti oxides fig s6 were observed the presence of the ti oxide polymorphs rutile tio2 and anatase tio2 in fluid coke particles was previously reported by nesbitt et al 2017 the presence of fe and ti bearing phases within coke may provide sorption sites for dissolved metals blackmore et al 1996 zubot et al 2012 strong positive correlation between si al k and mg r 0 80 0 96 was attributed to their co occurrence in entrained aluminosilicate phases within fluid coke particles fig s3 this finding is consistent with nesbitt et al 2017 who observed sub micron sized si bearing particles that also contained al k mg the positive correlation between ca and sr r 0 77 is indicative of carbonate minerals which have been detected in previous studies of fluid coke particles kessler and hendry 2006 nesbitt et al 2017 3 2 column experiments 3 2 1 transport parameters average linear pore water velocity and dispersivity were 4 0 10 7 m s 1 and 0 17 cm respectively for the dc mw column fig s7 similar values were observed for the sc mw column and the dc and sc columns receiving the ospw influent the apparent absence of br in effluent from the dc or sc columns receiving ard is attributed to br sorption at low ph based on similarities in physical properties of dc and sc and consistent flow rates among columns transport parameters are assumed similar based on breakthrough curves and flow rate porosity relationships residence times ranged from 6 8 d dc mw to 7 6 d sc ospw with slight differences attributed to minor variations in column packing table s2 3 2 2 ph ec and alkalinity influent ph remained relatively constant during the experiments for the mw 7 2 0 2 ospw 8 6 0 2 and ard solutions 2 1 0 1 fig 1 effluent ph decreased relative to influent ph for all columns column effluent ph values ranged from 4 48 5 40 for dc mw and 4 70 6 40 for sc mw and from 6 10 6 90 for the dc ospw and sc ospw columns effluent ph values ranged from 1 90 2 60 and 1 90 3 30 for the dc ard and sc ard columns respectively slightly higher initial effluent ph values in all columns are attributed to ligand exchange and acid neutralization reactions the relative ph decreases for columns receiving the mw and ospw influents may result from oxidative dissolution of pyrite or other acid generating reactions lindsay et al 2015 influent ec and alkalinity values were relatively consistent over time median influent ec values were 11 μs cm 1 for mw 4 8 ms cm 1 for ospw and 8 7 ms cm 1 for ard fig 1 median alkalinity for the mw and ospw influents were 12 and 710 mg l 1 as caco3 respectively whereas ard influent ph was consistently below 4 5 which was the endpoint for alkalinity titrations effluent and influent ec and alkalinity values were generally consistent for the dc ospw sc ospw dc ard and sc ard columns effluent ec values ranged from 4 3 5 6 ms cm 1 and 4 3 7 8 ms cm 1 for the dc ospw and sc ospw columns respectively these values were 7 8 9 0 ms cm 1 for the dc ard column and 8 0 12 ms cm 1 for the sc ard column in contrast initial effluent ec values for the dc mw and sc mw columns were substantially higher than the mw influent solution these ec values decreased over the first 10 pvs from 1100 to 76 μs cm 1 for dc mw and from 2600 to 250 μs cm 1 for sc mw ongoing decreases in ec values were observed for the dc mw and sc mw columns with effluent values approaching the influent over time like ec values large decreases in effluent alkalinity were observed during the first 10 pvs for the dc mw and sc mw columns fig 1 effluent alkalinity values decreased from 83 to 26 mg l 1 for dc mw and 630 to 95 mg l 1 for sc mw and after 20 pvs were generally consistent with influent values slight decreases in effluent alkalinity were observed during the first 2 pvs for the dc ospw and sc ospw columns after which differences between influent and effluent alkalinity values were minimal these temporal trends in effluent ec and alkalinity values are attributed to adsorption desorption and precipitation dissolution reactions during equilibration with mw and ospw influent solutions the corresponding contribution of dissolved ions was greatest at early time and more apparent for the dc mw and sc mw columns likely due to the relatively low ionic strength of this influent compared to ospw and ard 3 2 3 vanadium vanadium concentrations were consistently below detection i e 0 52 μg l 1 in the mw ospw and ard influents whereas effluent concentrations varied among columns and decreased with increasing pvs fig 2 tables s5 s10 the lowest effluent v concentrations were observed for dc mw 0 52 2 86 μg l 1 and dc ospw 0 52 17 0 μg l 1 whereas slightly higher concentrations were observed for sc mw 11 1 6760 μg l 1 median 24 7 μg l 1 effluent v concentrations for dc ard 56 4 3420 μg l 1 median 186 μg l 1 sc ospw 73 9 13 700 μg l 1 median 312 μg l 1 and sc ard 65 9 22 400 μg l 1 median 617 μg l 1 were consistently higher than the other columns in general higher effluent v concentrations were observed for dc compared to sc columns for a given influent composition this observation suggests differences in ssa and potentially that surface bound particles influence v release under different geochemical conditions vanadium release was also dependent upon influent chemistry with the magnitude of effluent v concentrations following the general order ard ospw mw this trend in v release among influent compositions is largely attributed to sorption nesbitt and lindsay 2017 thermodynamic modelling indicates that h2vo4 was the dominant aqueous v species in the mw and ospw columns whereas vo2 and vo2 were dominant for the ard columns fig 3 the predicted occurrence of both vo2 and vo2 suggests conditions favourable for reduction of v v to v iv under low ph conditions consistent undersaturation of all column effluents with respect to relevant v bearing phases e g v oh 3 s ca vo3 2 s supports the interpretation that sorption controlled v mobility within these columns comparison of effluent ph and phpzc values suggest that the net surface charge on both dc and sc was negative i e ph phpzc in the ospw columns and positive i e ph phpzc in the mw and ard columns nesbitt and lindsay 2017 observed similar relationships in v mobility within a commercial scale fluid petroleum coke deposit and suggested that the higher ionic strength of ospw 0 05 m compared to mw could further enhance v mobility our results similarly suggest that sorption reactions limited v mobility within the mw column relative to the ard and ospw columns 3 2 4 nickel influent ni concentrations were consistently below detection i e 1 4 μg l 1 like v effluent ni concentrations generally decreased with increasing pvs and varied among columns fig 2 tables s5 s10 however trends in the relative magnitude of effluent ni and v concentrations differed among columns and influent solutions the lowest concentrations were observed for dc mw 1 4 1520 μg l 1 median 16 3 μg l 1 and dc ospw 1 4 929 μg l 1 median 25 0 μg l 1 whereas sc ospw 10 5 113 μg l 1 median 62 3 μg l 1 and sc mw 9 72 655 μg l 1 median 97 0 μg l 1 exhibited slightly higher and similar effluent ni concentrations these concentrations were highest for dc ard 25 1 2600 μg l 1 median 114 μg l 1 and sc ard 38 5 8460 μg l 1 median 172 μg l 1 and were generally consistent during the experiment aqueous ni concentrations followed a general order ard mw ospw and compared to v relatively minor differences were noted between dc and sc with mw and ospw influents thermodynamic modeling indicated aqueous ni speciation within these influent solutions was dominated by ni2 45 while niso4 0 and nihco3 comprised the remainder fig 4 the proportion of nihco3 and niso4 0 in effluent from dc and sc columns receiving the mw and ospw influent decreased rapidly with declining effluent alkalinity and so4 2 concentrations fig s8 and ni2 dominated after 2 pvs modelling also indicated that ni2 and niso4 0 were present at approximately equal proportions in the ard influent and effluent modeled sis suggest conditions were not favourable for nio s nico3 s or ni oh 2 s precipitation fig s9 although nis s sis were not determined because h2s was absent from column effluents oxidative dissolution of sulfide minerals can proceed in the precent of o2 or fe iii lindsay et al 2015 nesbitt et al 2018 found evidence of both nio s and nis s in sc samples from an operational deposit suggests that dissolution of these phases could contribute to ni release weak positive correlations between effluent ni concentrations and both ph r 0 25 and alkalinity r 0 19 is consistent with the interpretation that ph dependent sorption reactions also influence ni release similar negative correlations between ph and dissolved ni concentrations were previously reported for sc leachates puttaswamy and liber 2011 and pore waters nesbitt et al 2018 net positive surface charges in dc and sc columns receiving mw and ard influents combined with the dominance of ni2 and niso4 0 aqueous species is consistent with higher ni concentrations in associated effluents in contrast ni2 sorption is favourable in ospw columns where dc and sc are characterized by a net negative surface charge 3 2 5 molybdenum consistent with v and ni influent mo concentrations were consistently below detection 0 79 μg l 1 and effluent concentrations generally decreased with increasing pvs fig 2 tables s5 s10 effluent mo concentrations were lower for dc mw 0 79 5 84 μg l 1 and sc mw 0 79 694 μg l 1 median 2 5 μg l 1 median concentrations were higher for dc ospw 0 79 63 9 μg l 1 median 23 μg l 1 and sc ospw 9 90 1340 μg l 1 median 27 μg l 1 and highest for dc ard 21 3 408 μg l 1 median 43 μg l 1 and sc ard 3 41 102 μg l 1 median 51 μg l 1 effluent mo concentrations were generally higher for sc compared to dc columns with mw and ospw influent with the largest differences observed over the first 5 pvs effluent mo concentrations exhibited a similar gradual decrease from 40 to 10 μg l 1 for dc ospw and sc ospw over the remainder of the experiment an opposite initial trend was observed for sc ard where effluent mo concentrations increased from 3 4 to 99 μg l 1 over the first 3 pvs and gradually decreased to 10 μg l 1 over the remaining pvs after a sharp initial decrease effluent mo concentrations for dc ard fluctuated between 21 and 48 μg l 1 from 4 to 31 pvs overall effluent mo concentrations followed the general order ard ospw mw thermodynamic modeling indicates that moo4 2 was consistently the predominant aqueous mo species in mw and ospw column influents and effluents whereas h2moo4 0 dominated for ard column influents and effluents fig 5 modelling also revealed consistent undersaturation of all influents and effluents with respect to nimoo4 s and camoo4 s fig s9 suggesting conditions were unfavorable for their precipitation additionally these models indicate that formation of polynuclear mo vi species including heptamolybdate ions i e h3mo7 o24 3 h2mo7 o24 4 hmo7 o24 5 is thermodynamically unfavorable robertson et al 2019 reported that mo mobility within fluid petroleum coke deposits is largely controlled by sorption reactions that are dependent upon both ph and ionic strength these authors observed increased mo mobility concomitant with increasing ph and ionic strength across a mixing zone between mw and ospw derived pore waters effluent mo concentrations for the current study followed similar trends with moo4 2 sorption onto net positively charged surfaces i e ph phpzc likely limiting mo release for dc mw and sc mw the higher effluent ph i e ph phpzc and ionic strength for dc ospw and sc ospw likely decreased potential for moo4 2 sorption finally the predominance of the neutral h2moo4 0 species would have enhanced mo mobility in the dc ard and sc ard columns 3 3 cumulative mass release differences in cumulative mass release for v ni and mo were observed between dc and sc columns and among mw ospw and ard columns table 4 cumulative mass release represented a small proportion of v 0 9 ni 0 7 and mo 1 1 in initial dc and sc solids trends in metal release tracked effluent metal concentrations with a majority of total v ni and mo release observed in the first 5 pvs for columns where maximum effluent metal concentrations were observed during the same interval fig 6 subsequent metal release followed trends in effluent concentrations which generally decreased during the experiments fig 2 cumulative v mass release was substantially higher for sc 5030 12 800 μg kg 1 compared to dc 3300 μg kg 1 and over 80 of total mass release for sc occurred over the first 5 pvs although cumulative ni mass release for dc 760 2110 μg kg 1 and sc 651 3550 μg kg 1 was similar the rate of ni release from sc mw and sc ospw was slower than sc ard and all dc columns the low proportions of total v and ni release are attributed to their common occurrence in porphyrin complexes within fluid petroleum coke particles nesbitt and lindsay 2017 nesbitt et al 2017 these highly stable organometallic complexes can be resistant to weathering over geologic time lewan and maynard 1982 zuliani et al 2016 despite lower cumulative mo mass release for dc 3 82 760 μg kg 1 and sc 514 869 μg kg 1 the proportion of total mo released during the column experiments was generally consistent with v and ni however consistent with trends in effluent mo concentrations cumulative mo mass release was substantially lower for dc mw 3 82 μg kg 1 and dc ospw 276 μg kg 1 compared to sc mw 514 μg kg 1 and sc ospw 869 μg kg 1 4 conclusions laboratory column experiments were conducted to assess long term trends in v ni and mo release from oil sands fluid petroleum coke under different geochemical conditions principal factors controlling effluent concentrations and cumulative mass release for these elements include ph ionic strength and surface area although reduction oxidation and precipitation dissolution reactions likely influenced v ni and mo release results indicated that sorption desorption reactions are a key control on effluent metal concentrations these reactions are strongly influenced by ph dependent surface charge and aqueous metal speciation cumulative metal release during the experiments accounted for less than 1 of initial v ni and mo contents within fluid petroleum coke contributions to total metal release generally occurred early in the experiments yet measurable effluent v ni and mo concentrations generally persisted over the entire duration considering both effluent concentrations and total release the results indicate that a combination of higher surface area circumneutral alkaline ph and elevated ionic strength are generally conducive to v and mo release and less favourable to ni release in contrast enhanced ni release may occur under mildly acidic conditions whereas extremely acidic conditions may favor v and ni release overall this study offers insight into relationships between metal release and geochemical conditions that could

1347,this study presents an interval multi objective fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming imficnp model combined with spatial water requirement of ecological vegetation sewr estimation for solving the problem of allocation of agricultural and ecological water in irrigation districts under uncertainties through techniques of remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis the ecological vegetation is subdivided into three types including forest land grassland and shrubland and the water requirement of ecological vegetation is extended from site specific sample to spatial decision making unit dmu which provides a set of spatial data for input parameters of constraints the imficnp model can be formulated through combination of interval parameter programming multi objective programming and fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming which can handle the conflicts of multiple objectives under uncertainties such as single uncertainty interval and fuzzy parameters and dual uncertainties fuzzy interval sets and finally generate optimal water allocation schemes for crop and ecological vegetation under different credibility levels the interval quadratic crop water production functions iqcwpfs are introduced to express the nonlinear relationships between crop yield and irrigation amount then this model is applied to a case study of huangyang irrigation district hid in shiyang river basin to demonstrate its applicability the results indicate that a higher credibility level is accompanied by less amount of water allocation and lower system benefit the amount of water allocation at the dmu is dominated by planting area of crops and ecological vegetation but there are few exceptions that optimal solutions are determined by the economic value in addition sewr enables to reflect spatial heterogeneity of the dmu at a larger scale imficnp model can coordinate conflicts among multiple objectives and it can tackle the violation of system constraints with fuzzy interval sets therefore these results can effectively balance the agricultural and ecological water management in irrigation districts and provide valuable basis for the sustainable development of arid and semi arid areas keywords spatial water requirement of ecological vegetation interval multi objective programming fuzzy interval sets credibility constrained programming nonlinear agricultural and ecological water allocation 1 introduction global water resources are under the crisis of water shortages due to negative effects of global warming rapid population growth serious ecological pollution and industrial market expansions cheng et al 2014 he and winde 2018 for example in arid and semi arid areas of northwest china the problems of water shortages and low water use efficiency exacerbate the contradictions among agricultural irrigation industrial production municipal use and ecological water requirement which limits the development of regional agriculture and industries han and zhang 2013 ren et al 2016 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a obviously the fragile and unbalanced ecological environment may cause severe consequences such as land desertification desert locust infestation and even huge sandstorm d odorico et al 2013 showler et al 2021 wang et al 2021a 2021b therefore how to coordinate different competing water users and allocate the limited water to agricultural irrigation and ecological vegetation rationally to ensure the sustainable development of agricultural farmlands and ecological environments have become a major challenge for decision makers and an urgent aim of china s 14th five year plan cai and rosegrant 2004 wang et al 2021a 2021b optimization water allocation model is an effective tool to provide reasonable water allocation scheme in fact water allocation requires to consider different perspectives and positions of decision makers which are often in conflicts and hard to coordinate therefore multi objective optimization model has been proven to coordinate various factors and providing optimal solutions in water resources management for example zhang et al 2019 established a model of irrigation water management considering the conditions of canal system and optimized three objectives of economic benefits canal water seepage and water allocation in multiple irrigation districts li et al 2019 studied optimal allocation of water energy and land resources based on six objectives economy environment energy food safety resource allocation and land policy in addition uncertain information often appears in the process of water resources management such as water supply water requirement of crops and vegetation crop prices and production costs marques et al 2005 zhang and guo 2017 guo et al 2019 thus uncertain methods including interval parameter programming fuzzy mathematical programming and stochastic mathematical programming are used to describe uncertainty and solve them maqsood et al 2005 nikoo et al 2012 kaviani et al 2015 xu et al 2019 dadmand et al 2020 lalehzari and kerachian 2021 for instance zhang et al 2015 proposed water management and pollution control schemes based on fuzzy credibility constrained programming to support the allocation of surface water and groundwater lu et al 2016 formulated a credibility constrained optimization model to measure a fuzzy event and the model was applied to agricultural irrigation management in south central china xu et al 2020 established a stochastic programming model with water scarcity risk upstream flood risk and downstream flood risk as objectives to obtain robust risk averse plans for multireservoir system under multiple risks among above methods fuzzy credibility constrained programming can tackle violated constraints that they are satisfied at a predefined credibility level in a fuzzy environment however in real world problems single uncertainty e g interval and fuzzy values is difficult to cope with complex parameters for example a triangular fuzzy number can be presented as b b 1 b 2 b 3 where b 1 is the least possible value b 2 is the main value and b 3 is the highest possible value in some cases when the boundary of fuzzy sets is unclear and b 1 b 2 and b 3 cannot be specified as deterministic value but with a range between the upper and lower bound thus fuzzy interval sets as a type of dual uncertainties need to be used instead of fuzzy sets to solve such a complex uncertainty in the model analogous to traditional fuzzy credibility constrained programming fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming was developed to tackle the constraint that existing violation probability under dual uncertain conditions based on fuzzy interval sets for example zhang et al 2018a 2018b used fuzzy interval sets to represent the uncertainty of water supply and precipitation and employed fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming method to optimize the monthly crop water allocation yue et al 2020 optimized the water allocation scheme and system benefit and fuzzy interval sets were introduced to reflect water supply and crop water demand however the majority of above methods were used to optimize agricultural water allocation few studies on ecological water allocation considering ecological water requirement have been undertaken ecological water requirement is the minimum water consumption under the condition of maintaining sustainability and stability of the regional ecosystem restoring fragile ecosystem and providing the maximum ecological services su and kang 2003 previous studies of ecological water requirement were divided into in canal and out canal ones sajedipour et al 2017 and the out canal ecological water requirement generally refers to the ecological water requirement of natural vegetation wang and cheng 2002 wang et al 2005 traditional methods are commonly used to estimate the water requirement of ecological vegetation such as area quota method water balance method and evapotranspiration method su and kang 2003 wang et al 2005 yang et al 2012 yang et al 2020 these methods only obtain results based on the site specific sample points and these results cannot represent spatial characteristics of the whole study area accurately therefore techniques of remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis are employed to estimate the water requirement of ecological vegetation it has ability in improving data accuracy identifying the crops or vegetation information more accurately and reflecting the spatial heterogeneity however most of studies still cannot fully reflect spatiotemporal variability and can only use spatial information on a specific element such as identification of vegetation types or vegetation coefficients yuan et al 2016 zolfagharnejad et al 2017 chi et al 2018 to overcome the limitations of previous studies a novel concept that spatializes all elements of estimating water requirement of ecological vegetation based on normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and potential evapotranspiration pet is introduced to estimate spatial water requirement of ecological vegetation sewr this method provides a good basis for the estimation of sewr and ecological water allocation therefore in response to above concerns this study aims to develop an interval multi objective fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming imficnp model combined with sewr estimation for solving the problem of allocation of agricultural and ecological water in irrigation districts under uncertain conditions the main content of this study includes the following sections 1 establishment of imficnp model through integration of the methods of interval parameter programming multi objective programming and fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming into an optimization model 2 formulation of the concept of sewr that spatializes all elements of estimating water requirement of ecological vegetation based on ndvi and pet the sewr of three types of ecological vegetation forest land grassland and shrubland was obtained based on decision making unit dmu 3 introduction of the iqcwpfs to express the nonlinear relationships between crop yield and irrigation amount 4 combination of the imficnp model with the sewr estimation and applied it to huangyang irrigation district hid in the shiyang river basin for managing agricultural and ecological water allocation the proposed model can tackle the conflicts of multiple objectives under single and dual uncertainties including interval fuzzy and fuzzy interval values it can also handle violated constraints that they are hold at a predefined credibility level moreover this study comes up with a new method for sewr estimation and provides effective and reliable information for ecological water monitoring in irrigation districts therefore optimal schemes can help alleviate water conflicts between agricultural and ecological sectors in irrigation districts and these findings are helpful for decision makers to manage limited water resources in arid and semi arid areas the framework of study system is shown in fig 1 the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes methodology of estimation of the sewr calculation of eco economic water productivity the formulation of imficnp model and its solution process section 3 provides problem statement modeling framework and data collection of study area the results analysis and discussions are presented in section 4 and we conclude the paper in section 5 2 development of methodology 2 1 estimation of sewr 2 1 1 spatial distribution of ecological vegetation and transpiration coefficient of vegetation t c to estimate the sewr the first step is to identify the types of spatial ecological vegetation by using rs satellite images the higher the resolution of land use types the more accurate the ecological vegetation will be in consequence rs data with high resolution as much as possible should be chosen when soil evaporation is not considered and only vegetation transpiration is considered the vegetation transpiration coefficient could be approximated as the following equation choudhury et al 1994 1 t c vi mean vi min vi max vi min where t c is the transpiration coefficient of vegetation vi is the vegetation index vi max vi min vi mean are the maximum minimum and average values of the vegetation index respectively ndvi has the most sensitive and relevant characteristics when differentiating and identifying vegetation types zhou 2014 so this study selects ndvi as the approximate calculation variable of t c 2 1 2 spatialized reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 generally pet data by rs has errors in values and the actual crop evapotranspiration is often overestimated therefore it is very important to carry out fitting and correction for pet data there is an assumption that the reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 calculated by penman monteith eq p m is highly accurate tang et al 2019 based on this assumption it is widely used in the calculation of et 0 however due to the limitation of meteorological stations for data collection et 0 obtained by traditional methods cannot represent the difference of crop evapotranspiration in complex surface land conditions in other words traditional methods cannot reflect the temporal and spatial variability of crop evapotranspiration therefore this study will linearly fit and correct the et 0 data obtained from several meteorological stations with the pet data by rs which can not only extend the traditional et 0 to the spatial scale but also ensure the accuracy of the pet data the form of the fitting equation is as follows 2 et 0 α pet θ where et 0 is the spatialized reference crop evapotranspiration mm α is the coefficient of first order θ is the constant 2 1 3 estimation of sewr according to the above steps it is possible to obtain key parameters for estimation of sewr namely the grid scale t c and et 0 similar to the area quota method the estimated results of sewr at each grid can be expressed as 3 w h 0 1 et 0 h t c h a h where w h is the water requirement of ecological vegetation of hth grid 104 m3 et 0 h is the spatialized reference crop evapotranspiration of hth grid mm t c h is the transpiration coefficient of vegetation of hth grid a h is the area of hth grid km2 when obtaining the water requirement of ecological vegetation of the entire district through the grid scale in a small scale area the regional water requirement of ecological vegetation is often underestimated due to insufficient accuracy or lack of measurement of rs data therefore if the grid water requirement of ecological vegetation is added directly the result will be smaller than the actual water requirement of ecological vegetation in order to estimate the water requirement of ecological vegetation correctly and reflect the spatial variability the study area is divided into multiple dmu according to the actual situation such as geographical condition vegetation distribution and other characteristics each dmu contains some grids by extracting and averaging the value of water requirement of ecological vegetation of each grid then the average water requirement of ecological vegetation of each dmu is obtained by multiplying the average water requirement of ecological vegetation and area of each dmu the water requirement of ecological vegetation of each dmu is obtained thereby obtaining the sewr of study area 2 2 calculation of eco economic water productivity eewp the eco economic water productivity eewp refers to the ratio of the output value to the water consumption of ecological vegetation it is proposed to describe the relationship between the amount of irrigation water and the benefits of ecological vegetation and its expression is 4 ev k pv k em k a k where ev k is the eewp cny m3 pv k is the output value cny em k is the irrigation quota of vegetation m3 hm2 a k is the area of vegetation hm2 ecological service value is generally used to describe the direct or indirect benefits of an area s ecological environment however to some extent only an empirical relationship between the equivalent factors of ecological service value and land area is established and the selection of equivalent factor is subjective eewp can bridge the relationship between ecological benefits and water input objectively which makes the calculation of ecological benefits more convenient it should be noted that this study only applies the eewp to small scale area like irrigation district because of the limitation of data sources 2 3 interval multi objective fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming imficnp 2 3 1 interval multi objective programming imp interval parameter programming ipp is an effective method to solve interval parameters or variables in objective functions and constraints in optimization models and can give a relatively stable solution the typical ipp model is 5 max f c x a x b x 0 where f is the objective function a b c are the interval coefficient x is the interval decision variable represents interval value and is the upper bound and is the lower bound due to the different positions of different decision makers there will be several trade offs and conflicting objectives thus multi objective programming mop is emerged aiming at the problem of multiple objectives under uncertainty an interval multi objective programming imop method is proposed it is written as follows 6 f max max f 1 x u max f 2 x u max f n x u u 1 u a u x u b x u 0 where f n x u is the objective function n is the number of objective functions u is the number of decision variables a u is the interval coefficient x u is the interval decision variables 2 3 2 fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming ficp when the uncertain problem needs to describe the risk and probability of violation and there are fuzzy parameters in the constraints thus fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp method is proposed this method can provide decision makers with more feasible results under different credibility levels based on credibility measure the fccp model is expressed as follows 7 max f cx cr ax b λ x 0 where f is the objective function a c is the coefficient b is the fuzzy coefficient x is the decision variable cr is the credibility measure λ is the credibility level fccp can deal with the above problems effectively but cannot deal with problems under more complex uncertainty especially when the boundary of fuzzy parameters is unclear fuzzy interval sets need to be used instead of fuzzy sets to solve more complex uncertainty features in the model the formation process of fuzzy interval sets is shown in fig 2 therefore the ficp model is expressed as follows 8 max f c x cr a x b λ x 0 where b is the fuzzy interval sets 2 3 3 imficnp once the uncertain model contains nonlinear multiple optimization objectives interval parameters fuzzy parameters and fuzzy interval sets in constraints and has to provide guidance for decision makers according to the credibility level to combine the above programming methods to formulate an interval multi objective fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming imficnp model is needed its representation is presented as follows 9 f x u max f 1 x u max f 2 x u max f n x u cr u 1 u a u x u b λ c u x u d u x u 0 where c u d u is the interval coefficient it is assumed that the fuzzy interval sets in the above model are triangular fuzzy numbers b b 1 b 2 b 3 b 1 b 1 b 2 b 2 b 3 b 3 the credibility constrained programming can be transformed into 10 cr u 1 u a u x u b 1 u 1 u a u x u b 1 2 b 2 b 1 u 1 u a u x u 2 b 2 b 1 b 1 u 1 u a u x u b 2 b 3 u 1 u a u x u 2 b 3 b 2 b 2 u 1 u a u x u b 3 0 u 1 u a u x u b 3 generally the credibility constrained programming model should avoid the medium and high risks in real situation so the credibility confidence level should be 0 5 1 0 according to the above equations we have 11 cr u 1 u a u x u b 2 b 2 b 1 u 1 u a u x u 2 b 2 b 1 λ u 1 u a u x u b 2 1 2 λ b 2 b 1 thus the imficnp model is transformed into imp model which can be solved by common model solutions 2 4 model solution process the imficnp model can tackle the uncertainties that may exist in the objective functions and constraints in multi objective problems at the same time by designing different credibility levels imficnp model can provide decision makers with decision schemes containing different violation risks it is also convenient for flexible transformation and concrete analysis under different situations the solution processes of imficnp model are summarized as follows step 1 formulate the imficnp model and transform the model into the upper and lower bound sub models according to the characteristics of interval parameters according to eq 5 let c u be the uth member of vector c a vu be the member of matrix a x u be the uth member of vector x assuming that the quantity of positive numbers are s 1 the quantity of negative numbers are s 2 and s 1 s 2 t in uncertain coefficients c u u 1 2 t let the first s 1 coefficients be the positive numbers thus we have c u 0 u s 1 1 s 1 2 t assuming that c u has the same sign in sub models the lower bound sub model is expressed as 12 max f u v s 1 c u x u u s 1 1 t c u x u u v s 1 a vu sign a vu x u u s 1 1 t a vu sign a vu x u b v v x u 0 u 1 2 t solving the above model we can obtain f opt x uopt u 1 2 s 1 and x uopt u s 1 1 s 1 2 t the upper bound sub model is expressed as 13 max f u v s 1 c u x u u s 1 1 t c u x u u v s 1 a vu sign a vu x u u s 1 1 t a vu sign a vu x u b v v x u 0 v 1 2 t x u x uopt u s 1 1 s 1 2 t similarly solving the above model we can obtain f opt x uopt u 1 2 s 1 and x uopt u s 1 1 s 1 2 t the final results are x uopt x uopt x uopt f opt f opt f opt step 2 calculate the maximum and minimum values of each objective of the upper and lower bound sub models under different credibility levels transform the multi objective model into a single objective model and use the minimum deviation method to solve it the transformation method of the objective function is presented as follows if the objective function is maximized 14 f n f n max f n f n max f n min if the objective function is minimized 15 f n f n f n min f n max f n min step 3 obtain the weight of each objective function in order to avoid the deviation from the objective reality caused by direct weighting this study compare and evaluate the importance of each objective by analytic hierarchy process ahp al harbi 2001 and finally determine the weight of each objective it is worth mentioning that in order to ensure the discussion of results is carried out at different credibility levels in the same multi objective model the weight of each objective function is constant at different credibility levels the final form of the objective function is 16 min f n 1 n ω n f n s t n 1 n ω n 1 step 4 substitute the data obtained by the step 2 and 3 into eq 16 to obtain the results under different credibility levels 3 case study 3 1 study area and problem statement huangyang irrigation district hid is located in the middle reaches of shiyang river basin 102 33 102 59 e 37 23 37 46 n wuwei city gansu province it is about 30 km away from the urban area it is a typical irrigation district that only uses surface water for irrigation and its water withdrawal mainly comes from huangyang river in the north of qilian mountains fig 3 shows the geographical location of hid and 29 dmus which is divided according to the spatial distribution of canal systems and land use types hid is temperate arid climate with little precipitation high evaporation and long sunshine hours crops planted in hid are classified as the first type and the second type crops shan et al 2021 the first type crops are defined because they have relationships between yield and water demand of crops through the measured data which is generally expressed by crop water production function the second type crops due to the lack of measured data are defined with only relationships between economic water productivity and water demand in hid the first crops include wheat maize potato beet and alfalfa and the second type crops consist of medicinal herbs crown pear and vegetables the main grain crops are wheat and maize and the main economic crop is crown pear recently the irrigation district is facing serious water shortage problem because of climate change intensification of human activities and rapid development of social economy there are conflicts of water use in various competing water use sectors the contradiction between water supply and demand for irrigation is very prominent and the ecological environment is deteriorating gradually the increase of water consumption in domestic and industrial sectors leads to a reduction of agricultural water and ecological water in study area which leads to the deterioration of ecological environment ultimately therefore how to plan a water allocation scheme that balances agricultural and ecological water allocation in irrigation district while considering the sewr has become a great challenge for institutional management of irrigation district when optimizing water allocation for crops and ecological vegetation the existence of uncertain factors such as water supply water requirement of crops and vegetation crop prices and production costs make the allocation scheme more complex therefore to solve the above problems optimal water allocation using uncertain programming method is necessary 3 2 modeling framework in this study the sewr in hid and the eewp are incorporated into the imficnp model and agricultural water and ecological water at different dmus are optimized to obtain the sustainable development of ecology and agriculture in hid the objective functions include the minimum of water loss during irrigation the maximum of net crop benefits the maximum of yields of main grain crops the maximum of ecological vegetation benefits and the balance of irrigation water consumption for each dmu the model considers uncertainties of crop prices sowing rates seed prices eewp water supply and water requirement these uncertainties are characterized by interval numbers fuzzy numbers and fuzzy interval sets therefore the developed model is formulated as follows and its symbolic definitions are shown in table 1 17

https www cnhnb com and news reports the sowing rates comes from public report the economic water productivity of the second type crops and eewp are obtained by statistical yearbooks as shown in table 3 the planting area of crops and ecological vegetation are shown in table 4 table 5 shows the estimated value of sewr in each dmu in hid determine the ecological vegetation area through data of land use types gong et al 2019 spatial resolution is 10 m and then use ndvi spatial resolution is 500 m time resolution is 16 days pet spatial resolution is 500 m time resolution is 8 days and et 0 to estimate the sewr these data come from nasa https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov search and the national meteorological science data center http data cma cn et 0 data used for pet fitting in this study are obtained from meteorological stations in minqin 52681 wuwei 52679 and yongchang 52674 in shiyang river basin and et 0 after fitting is verified by data from meteorological station in wushaoling 52787 the upper and lower bound of constraints of sewr are obtained by the estimated value multiplying by ratio which is empirically obtained since the sewr is an estimated value in 2019 which has the characteristics of fuzzy interval sets so fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming is used to characterize it 4 results analysis and discussions the sewr and eewp of hid in the shiyang river basin can be calculated according to the methods in sections 2 1 and 2 2 through inputting these parameters into the model of optimized irrigation water allocation optimal solutions can be generated based on solution method in section 2 4 in this study credibility levels are set as λ 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 0 9 1 0 and weighted factors of each objective are assigned as 0 063 0 313 0 250 0 313 and 0 063 then results of agricultural and ecological water allocation for each dmu in six scenarios with violated constraints are obtained therefore more details regarding results and discussions are shown below 4 1 optimal solutions of objective function values and water allocation fig 4 shows interval solutions of each objective under six credibility levels in general credibility level plays an important role in providing decision makers with options for different risk levels an increased credibility level leads to a smaller objective function value from λ 0 5 to λ 1 0 in other words as the constraint violation risk decreases the model becomes progressively more conservative and the decision maker is able to obtain less benefits a high economic payoff accompanied by high risk level while lower economic returns correspond to lower risk level also it should be noted that an abrupt change in the upper bounds of the second and third objective when the credibility level is 0 7 when at this risk level optimal solution is expressed as a reduction in the water allocation of main food crops i e wheat and maize and ecological vegetation which in turn reduces their yield and benefits more economic returns are obtained by giving more water to other crops e g economic crops thereby improving system economic returns fig 5 presents optimal solutions of agricultural and ecological water allocation under different credibility levels it can be clearly seen that a higher credibility level leads to less allocated water to irrigation district moreover as the credibility level increases the water allocation for agricultural and ecological purposes is decreased sequentially for example when λ is raised from 0 5 to 1 0 the amount of gross agricultural water allocation is decreased from 5048 31 5278 76 104 m3 to 4568 94 4809 33 104 m3 and the amount of gross ecological water allocation is decreased from 1059 03 1165 29 104 m3 to 950 65 1030 39 104 m3 thereby leading to a reduction in gross total water allocation by 587 76 604 33 104 m3 credibility levels offer scenarios showing water allocation options for different risk levels which can provide reliable reference for decision makers choices under different risk scenarios besides fig 5 also shows the net water allocation under different scenarios taking λ 0 8 as an example its gross water allocation for irrigation district is 5754 6 6085 07 104 m3 while the net water allocation is 3319 83 3510 48 104 m3 nearly 42 3 water losses occur during irrigation due to water evaporation canal seepage and deep percolation in the farmland resulting in the waste of water resources therefore in addition to optimal allocation of water resources managers should also pay attention to the improvement of irrigation water use efficiency such as canal lining improving irrigation method using micro irrigation sprinkler irrigation naturally it is also necessary to raise farmers awareness of water conservation and to establish a sound water conservation work mechanism for farmers table 6 provides optimal solutions of water allocation for different crops and vegetation under different credibility levels it can be seen that the allocated water for some crops e g medicinal herbs crown pears and vegetables under different scenarios don t have an obvious change even some crops and vegetation e g alfalfa forest land and shrubland have constant values or fixed water allocation intervals in fact these results are directly related to their planting area the proportion is so small that they are not sensitive to the change of credibility level taking the upper bound values under λ 1 to illustrate the results in each dmu the results of lower bound can be made a similar analysis the study system has the lowest violation risk under λ 1 because the constraints are completely satisfied figs 6 9 show the upper bound of optimal solutions for each dmu the upper bound of allocated amount of agricultural and ecological net water for each dmu are presented in fig 6 it can be seen that the total allocated water for 24th dmu is the largest that is 342 31 104 m3 and its area is the largest in addition although the total water allocation has significant differences among dmus and the allocated water for dmus range from 36 24 104 m3 to 342 31 104 m3 the majority of total net allocated water per unit area range from 0 165 104 m3 hm2 to 0 210 104 m3 hm2 indicating that the water allocation of each dmu is relatively balanced most of dmus have higher agricultural water allocation than ecological water allocation except 20th dmu which is consistent with the characteristics of the irrigation district the ecological vegetation water allocation in irrigation district is mainly distributed in the periphery of the irrigation area e g 18th 20th 24th and 29th dmus this is due to the large area of ecological vegetation in these dmus especially 18th and 20th dmus where the irrigation riverbanks are more densely covered with ecological vegetation and therefore have more ecological water allocation since the difference in planning area between grain crops and economic crops is large resulting in a larger difference in water allocation results thus the results for the two types of crops are presented separately figs 7 and 8 present the upper bound of net water allocation for grain crops and economic crops for each dmu for grain crops the water allocation for maize is the highest in each dmu followed by wheat this is because although wheat is planted on a large area maize produces more benefits per unit of water use in this case optimization model guides decision makers to allocate water to more economical grain crops for better payoffs potatoes are not considered because the planted area is small thus less water is allocated to 20th dmu for crop irrigation fig 9 presents the upper bound of ecological vegetation net water allocation for each dmu although the eewp of forest land and shrubland are higher than those of grassland the larger area of grassland allows it to receive a larger water allocation it is worth considering that irrigation districts usually focus on the expansion of arable land area at the expense of the value generated by the ecological environment which leads to ecological degradation such an adverse impact is difficult to repair and compensate in a short while therefore it is suggested that more ecological area should be added to irrigation districts especially the construction of ecological forests to maintain ecological sustainability 4 2 crop yields and system economic benefits fig 10 shows yield and system economic benefits of the first type crops as the credibility level rises decision space for water constraints becomes increasingly tight and crop yields are negatively affected which results in lower economic benefits it is obvious that crop yield and economic benefits present similar trends there is a significant decrease in wheat yields and benefits between λ 0 5 to λ 0 7 and no further change when λ 0 8 to λ 1 0 indicating that wheat yields and benefits are at the low limit of what the system can sustain however the results of maize show different variations from wheat the lower bounds of yield and benefits of maize keep unchanged when λ 0 5 0 8 while the upper bounds are unchanged at λ 0 7 0 8 which can also indicate that the upper and lower bounds of interval model behave differently in addition potato yields and benefits are not sensitive to changes in λ and therefore show a constant trend in fig 10 the upper bound of beet changes abruptly at λ 0 7 due to the complexity of mathematical model and the collected data is obtained from multiple sources although optimal solution of the upper bound sub model when λ 0 7 has an abrupt compared with solutions under other credibility levels system results are still optimal under this credibility level when λ 0 7 optimal solution is expressed as a reduction in the water allocation of maize and medicinal herbs which in turn reduces their yield and benefits more economic returns are obtained by giving more water to beet thereby improving system economic returns fig 10 also shows that the most significant yield reduction as the amount of water decreased indicating that it is quite sensitive to changes in irrigation water the upper bounds of yield and benefit of alfalfa decreased at λ 0 5 0 7 and stay unchanged in all other cases showing that the small area planted with alfalfa has relatively small impact on the whole system fig 11 shows economic benefits of the second type crops since medicinal herbs have a high economic water productivity they reflect a clear trend of decreasing benefits when λ rises while economic benefits of crown pear and vegetables are essentially unchanged in several scenarios 4 3 comparison of models to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the developed multi objective optimization model in addressing water allocation problems in irrigation districts four optimization models are formulated for comparison in this section based on interval objective models table 7 shows the objective functions credibility levels and their constraints of four models after solving the above models separately and substituting the model results as input parameters into each objective of imficnp model different objective values are obtained as shown in fig 12 it can be clearly seen that using the results of model 1 as input parameters the net crop benefits ob2 is the highest reaching 2 27 2 72 108 cny and using the results of model 2 as input parameters the ecological vegetation benefits ob4 is the highest reaching 3 86 4 27 106 cny however model l and 2 perform poorly in other objectives which is the defect that the single objective model cannot take other factors into account compared with model 1 and 2 the net crop benefits ob2 and ecological vegetation benefits ob4 obtained by model 3 and 4 are lower which are 2 19 2 64 108 cny and 2 89 3 20 106 cny for model 3 and 1 64 2 61 108 cny and 3 52 4 23 106 cny for model 4 respectively but they have considered both agricultural and ecological water use and a set of optimal allocation schemes have been formed in balance and coordination the imficnp model adds considerations to irrigation loss and water distribution balance based on models 3 and 4 which further reflects the advantages of the multi objective model to coordinate various objects making optimal allocation scheme more in line with the actual situation of the irrigation district and the decision makers actual demand in contrast the advantages of the model proposed in this study are obvious when dealing with the actual water allocation problem in irrigation districts in addition fig 13 shows the water allocation of the above models the ecological water in model 1 and 3 only account for 13 7 14 2 and 12 9 13 5 of the total amount of water allocation both focus on the agricultural water allocation but neglect the ecological water allocation such allocation schemes may lead to the deterioration of ecological environment of the irrigation district if the decision makers use these two schemes which is detrimental to the sustainable development of the regional ecology in contrast the ecological water in model 2 accounts for 21 1 21 4 of the total water allocation it pays too much attention to the ecological water allocation but neglects the agricultural water allocation in irrigation district due to the lack of agricultural water it may cause a reduction in crop yields and unable to guarantee the farmers incomes although model 4 considers the agricultural and ecological water allocation when the interval value is at the lower bound the total water allocation is only 4460 75 104 m3 the water supplied by irrigation district is not fully used which may cause two consequences one is the waste of resources caused by water resources residual guo et al 2019 the other is the decline of yield and economic benefits caused by insufficient water demand finally compared with the other four models the imficnp model not only guarantees supply of ecological water but also satisfies the demand for agricultural water as much as possible which is beneficial to the efficient development of agriculture and the sustainable development of ecology in irrigation district 5 conclusion an interval multi objective fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming imficnp model combined with the sewr estimation has been developed for optimal water allocation of agricultural and ecological water in irrigation districts under uncertainty the developed imficnp model can handle the conflicts in objective functions under single uncertainty and dual uncertainties such as interval parameters fuzzy parameters and interval fuzzy sets it can also formulate optimal water allocation schemes for agricultural irrigation and ecological sustainability in dmus under credibility levels the estimation of sewr is proposed to provide a basis for ecological water allocation in addition the iqcwpfs are introduced for expressing nonlinear relationships between crop yield and irrigation amount and the eewp is used to express the ratio of the output value to the water consumption of ecological vegetation the imficnp model has been applied to a real world case study of agricultural and ecological water allocation in hid shiyang river basin of northwest china eight crops and three types of vegetation have been considered in case study the results indicate that 1 with the increase of credibility levels both the objective values and allocated water amount will decrease which result in the decline of crop yields and economic benefits 2 crops and ecological vegetation with small planting area are not sensitive to the change of credibility levels 3 optimal water allocation schemes in dmus are mainly based on the planting area but there are few exceptions that allocation schemes depend on the economic value of crops and ecological vegetation 4 the imficnp model is more suitable for real world situations than other models with the same constraints when tackle the agricultural and ecological water allocation problems the results can provide theoretical basis and scientific guidance for balancing agricultural and ecological management in irrigation district this study has established a model combined with a new estimation method of sewr to solve the problem of agricultural and ecological water allocation in irrigation districts under multiple uncertainties the model considering sewr can also be applied to other similar irrigation districts to provide better water allocation schemes and ensure the sustainability of agricultural and ecological however by refining the water allocation process of ecological vegetation the

1347,this study presents an interval multi objective fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming imficnp model combined with spatial water requirement of ecological vegetation sewr estimation for solving the problem of allocation of agricultural and ecological water in irrigation districts under uncertainties through techniques of remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis the ecological vegetation is subdivided into three types including forest land grassland and shrubland and the water requirement of ecological vegetation is extended from site specific sample to spatial decision making unit dmu which provides a set of spatial data for input parameters of constraints the imficnp model can be formulated through combination of interval parameter programming multi objective programming and fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming which can handle the conflicts of multiple objectives under uncertainties such as single uncertainty interval and fuzzy parameters and dual uncertainties fuzzy interval sets and finally generate optimal water allocation schemes for crop and ecological vegetation under different credibility levels the interval quadratic crop water production functions iqcwpfs are introduced to express the nonlinear relationships between crop yield and irrigation amount then this model is applied to a case study of huangyang irrigation district hid in shiyang river basin to demonstrate its applicability the results indicate that a higher credibility level is accompanied by less amount of water allocation and lower system benefit the amount of water allocation at the dmu is dominated by planting area of crops and ecological vegetation but there are few exceptions that optimal solutions are determined by the economic value in addition sewr enables to reflect spatial heterogeneity of the dmu at a larger scale imficnp model can coordinate conflicts among multiple objectives and it can tackle the violation of system constraints with fuzzy interval sets therefore these results can effectively balance the agricultural and ecological water management in irrigation districts and provide valuable basis for the sustainable development of arid and semi arid areas keywords spatial water requirement of ecological vegetation interval multi objective programming fuzzy interval sets credibility constrained programming nonlinear agricultural and ecological water allocation 1 introduction global water resources are under the crisis of water shortages due to negative effects of global warming rapid population growth serious ecological pollution and industrial market expansions cheng et al 2014 he and winde 2018 for example in arid and semi arid areas of northwest china the problems of water shortages and low water use efficiency exacerbate the contradictions among agricultural irrigation industrial production municipal use and ecological water requirement which limits the development of regional agriculture and industries han and zhang 2013 ren et al 2016 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a obviously the fragile and unbalanced ecological environment may cause severe consequences such as land desertification desert locust infestation and even huge sandstorm d odorico et al 2013 showler et al 2021 wang et al 2021a 2021b therefore how to coordinate different competing water users and allocate the limited water to agricultural irrigation and ecological vegetation rationally to ensure the sustainable development of agricultural farmlands and ecological environments have become a major challenge for decision makers and an urgent aim of china s 14th five year plan cai and rosegrant 2004 wang et al 2021a 2021b optimization water allocation model is an effective tool to provide reasonable water allocation scheme in fact water allocation requires to consider different perspectives and positions of decision makers which are often in conflicts and hard to coordinate therefore multi objective optimization model has been proven to coordinate various factors and providing optimal solutions in water resources management for example zhang et al 2019 established a model of irrigation water management considering the conditions of canal system and optimized three objectives of economic benefits canal water seepage and water allocation in multiple irrigation districts li et al 2019 studied optimal allocation of water energy and land resources based on six objectives economy environment energy food safety resource allocation and land policy in addition uncertain information often appears in the process of water resources management such as water supply water requirement of crops and vegetation crop prices and production costs marques et al 2005 zhang and guo 2017 guo et al 2019 thus uncertain methods including interval parameter programming fuzzy mathematical programming and stochastic mathematical programming are used to describe uncertainty and solve them maqsood et al 2005 nikoo et al 2012 kaviani et al 2015 xu et al 2019 dadmand et al 2020 lalehzari and kerachian 2021 for instance zhang et al 2015 proposed water management and pollution control schemes based on fuzzy credibility constrained programming to support the allocation of surface water and groundwater lu et al 2016 formulated a credibility constrained optimization model to measure a fuzzy event and the model was applied to agricultural irrigation management in south central china xu et al 2020 established a stochastic programming model with water scarcity risk upstream flood risk and downstream flood risk as objectives to obtain robust risk averse plans for multireservoir system under multiple risks among above methods fuzzy credibility constrained programming can tackle violated constraints that they are satisfied at a predefined credibility level in a fuzzy environment however in real world problems single uncertainty e g interval and fuzzy values is difficult to cope with complex parameters for example a triangular fuzzy number can be presented as b b 1 b 2 b 3 where b 1 is the least possible value b 2 is the main value and b 3 is the highest possible value in some cases when the boundary of fuzzy sets is unclear and b 1 b 2 and b 3 cannot be specified as deterministic value but with a range between the upper and lower bound thus fuzzy interval sets as a type of dual uncertainties need to be used instead of fuzzy sets to solve such a complex uncertainty in the model analogous to traditional fuzzy credibility constrained programming fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming was developed to tackle the constraint that existing violation probability under dual uncertain conditions based on fuzzy interval sets for example zhang et al 2018a 2018b used fuzzy interval sets to represent the uncertainty of water supply and precipitation and employed fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming method to optimize the monthly crop water allocation yue et al 2020 optimized the water allocation scheme and system benefit and fuzzy interval sets were introduced to reflect water supply and crop water demand however the majority of above methods were used to optimize agricultural water allocation few studies on ecological water allocation considering ecological water requirement have been undertaken ecological water requirement is the minimum water consumption under the condition of maintaining sustainability and stability of the regional ecosystem restoring fragile ecosystem and providing the maximum ecological services su and kang 2003 previous studies of ecological water requirement were divided into in canal and out canal ones sajedipour et al 2017 and the out canal ecological water requirement generally refers to the ecological water requirement of natural vegetation wang and cheng 2002 wang et al 2005 traditional methods are commonly used to estimate the water requirement of ecological vegetation such as area quota method water balance method and evapotranspiration method su and kang 2003 wang et al 2005 yang et al 2012 yang et al 2020 these methods only obtain results based on the site specific sample points and these results cannot represent spatial characteristics of the whole study area accurately therefore techniques of remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis are employed to estimate the water requirement of ecological vegetation it has ability in improving data accuracy identifying the crops or vegetation information more accurately and reflecting the spatial heterogeneity however most of studies still cannot fully reflect spatiotemporal variability and can only use spatial information on a specific element such as identification of vegetation types or vegetation coefficients yuan et al 2016 zolfagharnejad et al 2017 chi et al 2018 to overcome the limitations of previous studies a novel concept that spatializes all elements of estimating water requirement of ecological vegetation based on normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and potential evapotranspiration pet is introduced to estimate spatial water requirement of ecological vegetation sewr this method provides a good basis for the estimation of sewr and ecological water allocation therefore in response to above concerns this study aims to develop an interval multi objective fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming imficnp model combined with sewr estimation for solving the problem of allocation of agricultural and ecological water in irrigation districts under uncertain conditions the main content of this study includes the following sections 1 establishment of imficnp model through integration of the methods of interval parameter programming multi objective programming and fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming into an optimization model 2 formulation of the concept of sewr that spatializes all elements of estimating water requirement of ecological vegetation based on ndvi and pet the sewr of three types of ecological vegetation forest land grassland and shrubland was obtained based on decision making unit dmu 3 introduction of the iqcwpfs to express the nonlinear relationships between crop yield and irrigation amount 4 combination of the imficnp model with the sewr estimation and applied it to huangyang irrigation district hid in the shiyang river basin for managing agricultural and ecological water allocation the proposed model can tackle the conflicts of multiple objectives under single and dual uncertainties including interval fuzzy and fuzzy interval values it can also handle violated constraints that they are hold at a predefined credibility level moreover this study comes up with a new method for sewr estimation and provides effective and reliable information for ecological water monitoring in irrigation districts therefore optimal schemes can help alleviate water conflicts between agricultural and ecological sectors in irrigation districts and these findings are helpful for decision makers to manage limited water resources in arid and semi arid areas the framework of study system is shown in fig 1 the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes methodology of estimation of the sewr calculation of eco economic water productivity the formulation of imficnp model and its solution process section 3 provides problem statement modeling framework and data collection of study area the results analysis and discussions are presented in section 4 and we conclude the paper in section 5 2 development of methodology 2 1 estimation of sewr 2 1 1 spatial distribution of ecological vegetation and transpiration coefficient of vegetation t c to estimate the sewr the first step is to identify the types of spatial ecological vegetation by using rs satellite images the higher the resolution of land use types the more accurate the ecological vegetation will be in consequence rs data with high resolution as much as possible should be chosen when soil evaporation is not considered and only vegetation transpiration is considered the vegetation transpiration coefficient could be approximated as the following equation choudhury et al 1994 1 t c vi mean vi min vi max vi min where t c is the transpiration coefficient of vegetation vi is the vegetation index vi max vi min vi mean are the maximum minimum and average values of the vegetation index respectively ndvi has the most sensitive and relevant characteristics when differentiating and identifying vegetation types zhou 2014 so this study selects ndvi as the approximate calculation variable of t c 2 1 2 spatialized reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 generally pet data by rs has errors in values and the actual crop evapotranspiration is often overestimated therefore it is very important to carry out fitting and correction for pet data there is an assumption that the reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 calculated by penman monteith eq p m is highly accurate tang et al 2019 based on this assumption it is widely used in the calculation of et 0 however due to the limitation of meteorological stations for data collection et 0 obtained by traditional methods cannot represent the difference of crop evapotranspiration in complex surface land conditions in other words traditional methods cannot reflect the temporal and spatial variability of crop evapotranspiration therefore this study will linearly fit and correct the et 0 data obtained from several meteorological stations with the pet data by rs which can not only extend the traditional et 0 to the spatial scale but also ensure the accuracy of the pet data the form of the fitting equation is as follows 2 et 0 α pet θ where et 0 is the spatialized reference crop evapotranspiration mm α is the coefficient of first order θ is the constant 2 1 3 estimation of sewr according to the above steps it is possible to obtain key parameters for estimation of sewr namely the grid scale t c and et 0 similar to the area quota method the estimated results of sewr at each grid can be expressed as 3 w h 0 1 et 0 h t c h a h where w h is the water requirement of ecological vegetation of hth grid 104 m3 et 0 h is the spatialized reference crop evapotranspiration of hth grid mm t c h is the transpiration coefficient of vegetation of hth grid a h is the area of hth grid km2 when obtaining the water requirement of ecological vegetation of the entire district through the grid scale in a small scale area the regional water requirement of ecological vegetation is often underestimated due to insufficient accuracy or lack of measurement of rs data therefore if the grid water requirement of ecological vegetation is added directly the result will be smaller than the actual water requirement of ecological vegetation in order to estimate the water requirement of ecological vegetation correctly and reflect the spatial variability the study area is divided into multiple dmu according to the actual situation such as geographical condition vegetation distribution and other characteristics each dmu contains some grids by extracting and averaging the value of water requirement of ecological vegetation of each grid then the average water requirement of ecological vegetation of each dmu is obtained by multiplying the average water requirement of ecological vegetation and area of each dmu the water requirement of ecological vegetation of each dmu is obtained thereby obtaining the sewr of study area 2 2 calculation of eco economic water productivity eewp the eco economic water productivity eewp refers to the ratio of the output value to the water consumption of ecological vegetation it is proposed to describe the relationship between the amount of irrigation water and the benefits of ecological vegetation and its expression is 4 ev k pv k em k a k where ev k is the eewp cny m3 pv k is the output value cny em k is the irrigation quota of vegetation m3 hm2 a k is the area of vegetation hm2 ecological service value is generally used to describe the direct or indirect benefits of an area s ecological environment however to some extent only an empirical relationship between the equivalent factors of ecological service value and land area is established and the selection of equivalent factor is subjective eewp can bridge the relationship between ecological benefits and water input objectively which makes the calculation of ecological benefits more convenient it should be noted that this study only applies the eewp to small scale area like irrigation district because of the limitation of data sources 2 3 interval multi objective fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming imficnp 2 3 1 interval multi objective programming imp interval parameter programming ipp is an effective method to solve interval parameters or variables in objective functions and constraints in optimization models and can give a relatively stable solution the typical ipp model is 5 max f c x a x b x 0 where f is the objective function a b c are the interval coefficient x is the interval decision variable represents interval value and is the upper bound and is the lower bound due to the different positions of different decision makers there will be several trade offs and conflicting objectives thus multi objective programming mop is emerged aiming at the problem of multiple objectives under uncertainty an interval multi objective programming imop method is proposed it is written as follows 6 f max max f 1 x u max f 2 x u max f n x u u 1 u a u x u b x u 0 where f n x u is the objective function n is the number of objective functions u is the number of decision variables a u is the interval coefficient x u is the interval decision variables 2 3 2 fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming ficp when the uncertain problem needs to describe the risk and probability of violation and there are fuzzy parameters in the constraints thus fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp method is proposed this method can provide decision makers with more feasible results under different credibility levels based on credibility measure the fccp model is expressed as follows 7 max f cx cr ax b λ x 0 where f is the objective function a c is the coefficient b is the fuzzy coefficient x is the decision variable cr is the credibility measure λ is the credibility level fccp can deal with the above problems effectively but cannot deal with problems under more complex uncertainty especially when the boundary of fuzzy parameters is unclear fuzzy interval sets need to be used instead of fuzzy sets to solve more complex uncertainty features in the model the formation process of fuzzy interval sets is shown in fig 2 therefore the ficp model is expressed as follows 8 max f c x cr a x b λ x 0 where b is the fuzzy interval sets 2 3 3 imficnp once the uncertain model contains nonlinear multiple optimization objectives interval parameters fuzzy parameters and fuzzy interval sets in constraints and has to provide guidance for decision makers according to the credibility level to combine the above programming methods to formulate an interval multi objective fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming imficnp model is needed its representation is presented as follows 9 f x u max f 1 x u max f 2 x u max f n x u cr u 1 u a u x u b λ c u x u d u x u 0 where c u d u is the interval coefficient it is assumed that the fuzzy interval sets in the above model are triangular fuzzy numbers b b 1 b 2 b 3 b 1 b 1 b 2 b 2 b 3 b 3 the credibility constrained programming can be transformed into 10 cr u 1 u a u x u b 1 u 1 u a u x u b 1 2 b 2 b 1 u 1 u a u x u 2 b 2 b 1 b 1 u 1 u a u x u b 2 b 3 u 1 u a u x u 2 b 3 b 2 b 2 u 1 u a u x u b 3 0 u 1 u a u x u b 3 generally the credibility constrained programming model should avoid the medium and high risks in real situation so the credibility confidence level should be 0 5 1 0 according to the above equations we have 11 cr u 1 u a u x u b 2 b 2 b 1 u 1 u a u x u 2 b 2 b 1 λ u 1 u a u x u b 2 1 2 λ b 2 b 1 thus the imficnp model is transformed into imp model which can be solved by common model solutions 2 4 model solution process the imficnp model can tackle the uncertainties that may exist in the objective functions and constraints in multi objective problems at the same time by designing different credibility levels imficnp model can provide decision makers with decision schemes containing different violation risks it is also convenient for flexible transformation and concrete analysis under different situations the solution processes of imficnp model are summarized as follows step 1 formulate the imficnp model and transform the model into the upper and lower bound sub models according to the characteristics of interval parameters according to eq 5 let c u be the uth member of vector c a vu be the member of matrix a x u be the uth member of vector x assuming that the quantity of positive numbers are s 1 the quantity of negative numbers are s 2 and s 1 s 2 t in uncertain coefficients c u u 1 2 t let the first s 1 coefficients be the positive numbers thus we have c u 0 u s 1 1 s 1 2 t assuming that c u has the same sign in sub models the lower bound sub model is expressed as 12 max f u v s 1 c u x u u s 1 1 t c u x u u v s 1 a vu sign a vu x u u s 1 1 t a vu sign a vu x u b v v x u 0 u 1 2 t solving the above model we can obtain f opt x uopt u 1 2 s 1 and x uopt u s 1 1 s 1 2 t the upper bound sub model is expressed as 13 max f u v s 1 c u x u u s 1 1 t c u x u u v s 1 a vu sign a vu x u u s 1 1 t a vu sign a vu x u b v v x u 0 v 1 2 t x u x uopt u s 1 1 s 1 2 t similarly solving the above model we can obtain f opt x uopt u 1 2 s 1 and x uopt u s 1 1 s 1 2 t the final results are x uopt x uopt x uopt f opt f opt f opt step 2 calculate the maximum and minimum values of each objective of the upper and lower bound sub models under different credibility levels transform the multi objective model into a single objective model and use the minimum deviation method to solve it the transformation method of the objective function is presented as follows if the objective function is maximized 14 f n f n max f n f n max f n min if the objective function is minimized 15 f n f n f n min f n max f n min step 3 obtain the weight of each objective function in order to avoid the deviation from the objective reality caused by direct weighting this study compare and evaluate the importance of each objective by analytic hierarchy process ahp al harbi 2001 and finally determine the weight of each objective it is worth mentioning that in order to ensure the discussion of results is carried out at different credibility levels in the same multi objective model the weight of each objective function is constant at different credibility levels the final form of the objective function is 16 min f n 1 n ω n f n s t n 1 n ω n 1 step 4 substitute the data obtained by the step 2 and 3 into eq 16 to obtain the results under different credibility levels 3 case study 3 1 study area and problem statement huangyang irrigation district hid is located in the middle reaches of shiyang river basin 102 33 102 59 e 37 23 37 46 n wuwei city gansu province it is about 30 km away from the urban area it is a typical irrigation district that only uses surface water for irrigation and its water withdrawal mainly comes from huangyang river in the north of qilian mountains fig 3 shows the geographical location of hid and 29 dmus which is divided according to the spatial distribution of canal systems and land use types hid is temperate arid climate with little precipitation high evaporation and long sunshine hours crops planted in hid are classified as the first type and the second type crops shan et al 2021 the first type crops are defined because they have relationships between yield and water demand of crops through the measured data which is generally expressed by crop water production function the second type crops due to the lack of measured data are defined with only relationships between economic water productivity and water demand in hid the first crops include wheat maize potato beet and alfalfa and the second type crops consist of medicinal herbs crown pear and vegetables the main grain crops are wheat and maize and the main economic crop is crown pear recently the irrigation district is facing serious water shortage problem because of climate change intensification of human activities and rapid development of social economy there are conflicts of water use in various competing water use sectors the contradiction between water supply and demand for irrigation is very prominent and the ecological environment is deteriorating gradually the increase of water consumption in domestic and industrial sectors leads to a reduction of agricultural water and ecological water in study area which leads to the deterioration of ecological environment ultimately therefore how to plan a water allocation scheme that balances agricultural and ecological water allocation in irrigation district while considering the sewr has become a great challenge for institutional management of irrigation district when optimizing water allocation for crops and ecological vegetation the existence of uncertain factors such as water supply water requirement of crops and vegetation crop prices and production costs make the allocation scheme more complex therefore to solve the above problems optimal water allocation using uncertain programming method is necessary 3 2 modeling framework in this study the sewr in hid and the eewp are incorporated into the imficnp model and agricultural water and ecological water at different dmus are optimized to obtain the sustainable development of ecology and agriculture in hid the objective functions include the minimum of water loss during irrigation the maximum of net crop benefits the maximum of yields of main grain crops the maximum of ecological vegetation benefits and the balance of irrigation water consumption for each dmu the model considers uncertainties of crop prices sowing rates seed prices eewp water supply and water requirement these uncertainties are characterized by interval numbers fuzzy numbers and fuzzy interval sets therefore the developed model is formulated as follows and its symbolic definitions are shown in table 1 17

estimate the sewr these data come from nasa https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov search and the national meteorological science data center http data cma cn et 0 data used for pet fitting in this study are obtained from meteorological stations in minqin 52681 wuwei 52679 and yongchang 52674 in shiyang river basin and et 0 after fitting is verified by data from meteorological station in wushaoling 52787 the upper and lower bound of constraints of sewr are obtained by the estimated value multiplying by ratio which is empirically obtained since the sewr is an estimated value in 2019 which has the characteristics of fuzzy interval sets so fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming is used to characterize it 4 results analysis and discussions the sewr and eewp of hid in the shiyang river basin can be calculated according to the methods in sections 2 1 and 2 2 through inputting these parameters into the model of optimized irrigation water allocation optimal solutions can be generated based on solution method in section 2 4 in this study credibility levels are set as λ 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 0 9 1 0 and weighted factors of each objective are assigned as 0 063 0 313 0 250 0 313 and 0 063 then results of agricultural and ecological water allocation for each dmu in six scenarios with violated constraints are obtained therefore more details regarding results and discussions are shown below 4 1 optimal solutions of objective function values and water allocation fig 4 shows interval solutions of each objective under six credibility levels in general credibility level plays an important role in providing decision makers with options for different risk levels an increased credibility level leads to a smaller objective function value from λ 0 5 to λ 1 0 in other words as the constraint violation risk decreases the model becomes progressively more conservative and the decision maker is able to obtain less benefits a high economic payoff accompanied by high risk level while lower economic returns correspond to lower risk level also it should be noted that an abrupt change in the upper bounds of the second and third objective when the credibility level is 0 7 when at this risk level optimal solution is expressed as a reduction in the water allocation of main food crops i e wheat and maize and ecological vegetation which in turn reduces their yield and benefits more economic returns are obtained by giving more water to other crops e g economic crops thereby improving system economic returns fig 5 presents optimal solutions of agricultural and ecological water allocation under different credibility levels it can be clearly seen that a higher credibility level leads to less allocated water to irrigation district moreover as the credibility level increases the water allocation for agricultural and ecological purposes is decreased sequentially for example when λ is raised from 0 5 to 1 0 the amount of gross agricultural water allocation is decreased from 5048 31 5278 76 104 m3 to 4568 94 4809 33 104 m3 and the amount of gross ecological water allocation is decreased from 1059 03 1165 29 104 m3 to 950 65 1030 39 104 m3 thereby leading to a reduction in gross total water allocation by 587 76 604 33 104 m3 credibility levels offer scenarios showing water allocation options for different risk levels which can provide reliable reference for decision makers choices under different risk scenarios besides fig 5 also shows the net water allocation under different scenarios taking λ 0 8 as an example its gross water allocation for irrigation district is 5754 6 6085 07 104 m3 while the net water allocation is 3319 83 3510 48 104 m3 nearly 42 3 water losses occur during irrigation due to water evaporation canal seepage and deep percolation in the farmland resulting in the waste of water resources therefore in addition to optimal allocation of water resources managers should also pay attention to the improvement of irrigation water use efficiency such as canal lining improving irrigation method using micro irrigation sprinkler irrigation naturally it is also necessary to raise farmers awareness of water conservation and to establish a sound water conservation work mechanism for farmers table 6 provides optimal solutions of water allocation for different crops and vegetation under different credibility levels it can be seen that the allocated water for some crops e g medicinal herbs crown pears and vegetables under different scenarios don t have an obvious change even some crops and vegetation e g alfalfa forest land and shrubland have constant values or fixed water allocation intervals in fact these results are directly related to their planting area the proportion is so small that they are not sensitive to the change of credibility level taking the upper bound values under λ 1 to illustrate the results in each dmu the results of lower bound can be made a similar analysis the study system has the lowest violation risk under λ 1 because the constraints are completely satisfied figs 6 9 show the upper bound of optimal solutions for each dmu the upper bound of allocated amount of agricultural and ecological net water for each dmu are presented in fig 6 it can be seen that the total allocated water for 24th dmu is the largest that is 342 31 104 m3 and its area is the largest in addition although the total water allocation has significant differences among dmus and the allocated water for dmus range from 36 24 104 m3 to 342 31 104 m3 the majority of total net allocated water per unit area range from 0 165 104 m3 hm2 to 0 210 104 m3 hm2 indicating that the water allocation of each dmu is relatively balanced most of dmus have higher agricultural water allocation than ecological water allocation except 20th dmu which is consistent with the characteristics of the irrigation district the ecological vegetation water allocation in irrigation district is mainly distributed in the periphery of the irrigation area e g 18th 20th 24th and 29th dmus this is due to the large area of ecological vegetation in these dmus especially 18th and 20th dmus where the irrigation riverbanks are more densely covered with ecological vegetation and therefore have more ecological water allocation since the difference in planning area between grain crops and economic crops is large resulting in a larger difference in water allocation results thus the results for the two types of crops are presented separately figs 7 and 8 present the upper bound of net water allocation for grain crops and economic crops for each dmu for grain crops the water allocation for maize is the highest in each dmu followed by wheat this is because although wheat is planted on a large area maize produces more benefits per unit of water use in this case optimization model guides decision makers to allocate water to more economical grain crops for better payoffs potatoes are not considered because the planted area is small thus less water is allocated to 20th dmu for crop irrigation fig 9 presents the upper bound of ecological vegetation net water allocation for each dmu although the eewp of forest land and shrubland are higher than those of grassland the larger area of grassland allows it to receive a larger water allocation it is worth considering that irrigation districts usually focus on the expansion of arable land area at the expense of the value generated by the ecological environment which leads to ecological degradation such an adverse impact is difficult to repair and compensate in a short while therefore it is suggested that more ecological area should be added to irrigation districts especially the construction of ecological forests to maintain ecological sustainability 4 2 crop yields and system economic benefits fig 10 shows yield and system economic benefits of the first type crops as the credibility level rises decision space for water constraints becomes increasingly tight and crop yields are negatively affected which results in lower economic benefits it is obvious that crop yield and economic benefits present similar trends there is a significant decrease in wheat yields and benefits between λ 0 5 to λ 0 7 and no further change when λ 0 8 to λ 1 0 indicating that wheat yields and benefits are at the low limit of what the system can sustain however the results of maize show different variations from wheat the lower bounds of yield and benefits of maize keep unchanged when λ 0 5 0 8 while the upper bounds are unchanged at λ 0 7 0 8 which can also indicate that the upper and lower bounds of interval model behave differently in addition potato yields and benefits are not sensitive to changes in λ and therefore show a constant trend in fig 10 the upper bound of beet changes abruptly at λ 0 7 due to the complexity of mathematical model and the collected data is obtained from multiple sources although optimal solution of the upper bound sub model when λ 0 7 has an abrupt compared with solutions under other credibility levels system results are still optimal under this credibility level when λ 0 7 optimal solution is expressed as a reduction in the water allocation of maize and medicinal herbs which in turn reduces their yield and benefits more economic returns are obtained by giving more water to beet thereby improving system economic returns fig 10 also shows that the most significant yield reduction as the amount of water decreased indicating that it is quite sensitive to changes in irrigation water the upper bounds of yield and benefit of alfalfa decreased at λ 0 5 0 7 and stay unchanged in all other cases showing that the small area planted with alfalfa has relatively small impact on the whole system fig 11 shows economic benefits of the second type crops since medicinal herbs have a high economic water productivity they reflect a clear trend of decreasing benefits when λ rises while economic benefits of crown pear and vegetables are essentially unchanged in several scenarios 4 3 comparison of models to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the developed multi objective optimization model in addressing water allocation problems in irrigation districts four optimization models are formulated for comparison in this section based on interval objective models table 7 shows the objective functions credibility levels and their constraints of four models after solving the above models separately and substituting the model results as input parameters into each objective of imficnp model different objective values are obtained as shown in fig 12 it can be clearly seen that using the results of model 1 as input parameters the net crop benefits ob2 is the highest reaching 2 27 2 72 108 cny and using the results of model 2 as input parameters the ecological vegetation benefits ob4 is the highest reaching 3 86 4 27 106 cny however model l and 2 perform poorly in other objectives which is the defect that the single objective model cannot take other factors into account compared with model 1 and 2 the net crop benefits ob2 and ecological vegetation benefits ob4 obtained by model 3 and 4 are lower which are 2 19 2 64 108 cny and 2 89 3 20 106 cny for model 3 and 1 64 2 61 108 cny and 3 52 4 23 106 cny for model 4 respectively but they have considered both agricultural and ecological water use and a set of optimal allocation schemes have been formed in balance and coordination the imficnp model adds considerations to irrigation loss and water distribution balance based on models 3 and 4 which further reflects the advantages of the multi objective model to coordinate various objects making optimal allocation scheme more in line with the actual situation of the irrigation district and the decision makers actual demand in contrast the advantages of the model proposed in this study are obvious when dealing with the actual water allocation problem in irrigation districts in addition fig 13 shows the water allocation of the above models the ecological water in model 1 and 3 only account for 13 7 14 2 and 12 9 13 5 of the total amount of water allocation both focus on the agricultural water allocation but neglect the ecological water allocation such allocation schemes may lead to the deterioration of ecological environment of the irrigation district if the decision makers use these two schemes which is detrimental to the sustainable development of the regional ecology in contrast the ecological water in model 2 accounts for 21 1 21 4 of the total water allocation it pays too much attention to the ecological water allocation but neglects the agricultural water allocation in irrigation district due to the lack of agricultural water it may cause a reduction in crop yields and unable to guarantee the farmers incomes although model 4 considers the agricultural and ecological water allocation when the interval value is at the lower bound the total water allocation is only 4460 75 104 m3 the water supplied by irrigation district is not fully used which may cause two consequences one is the waste of resources caused by water resources residual guo et al 2019 the other is the decline of yield and economic benefits caused by insufficient water demand finally compared with the other four models the imficnp model not only guarantees supply of ecological water but also satisfies the demand for agricultural water as much as possible which is beneficial to the efficient development of agriculture and the sustainable development of ecology in irrigation district 5 conclusion an interval multi objective fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming imficnp model combined with the sewr estimation has been developed for optimal water allocation of agricultural and ecological water in irrigation districts under uncertainty the developed imficnp model can handle the conflicts in objective functions under single uncertainty and dual uncertainties such as interval parameters fuzzy parameters and interval fuzzy sets it can also formulate optimal water allocation schemes for agricultural irrigation and ecological sustainability in dmus under credibility levels the estimation of sewr is proposed to provide a basis for ecological water allocation in addition the iqcwpfs are introduced for expressing nonlinear relationships between crop yield and irrigation amount and the eewp is used to express the ratio of the output value to the water consumption of ecological vegetation the imficnp model has been applied to a real world case study of agricultural and ecological water allocation in hid shiyang river basin of northwest china eight crops and three types of vegetation have been considered in case study the results indicate that 1 with the increase of credibility levels both the objective values and allocated water amount will decrease which result in the decline of crop yields and economic benefits 2 crops and ecological vegetation with small planting area are not sensitive to the change of credibility levels 3 optimal water allocation schemes in dmus are mainly based on the planting area but there are few exceptions that allocation schemes depend on the economic value of crops and ecological vegetation 4 the imficnp model is more suitable for real world situations than other models with the same constraints when tackle the agricultural and ecological water allocation problems the results can provide theoretical basis and scientific guidance for balancing agricultural and ecological management in irrigation district this study has established a model combined with a new estimation method of sewr to solve the problem of agricultural and ecological water allocation in irrigation districts under multiple uncertainties the model considering sewr can also be applied to other similar irrigation districts to provide better water allocation schemes and ensure the sustainability of agricultural and ecological however by refining the water allocation process of ecological vegetation the

1348,although groundwater is an important source for drinking and irrigation water worldwide particularly in arid countries they have been paid little attention to their contamination with microcystins mcs compared to surface water our study is the fourth one reporting existence of mcs in groundwater due to surface water and groundwater interaction dissolved mcs in groundwater were found with higher concentrations in summer 0 1 to 0 84 μg l 1 than in winter 0 0 06 μg l 1 in association with mcs detected in nearby surface nile water the chronic daily intake cdi of mcs for both adults and children 0 0 003 μg kg 1 body weight d 1 in groundwater were lower than the chronic reference dose rfd 0 003 μg kg 1 body weight d 1 during winter with hazard quotient less than 1 conversely cdi values exceeded the reference dose during summer for both adults 0 005 0 024 μg kg 1 body weight d 1 and children 0 012 0 05 μg kg 1 body weight d 1 with hazard quotient greater than 1 this indicates that mcs concentrations in these groundwater wells might pose adverse health effects to both adults and children during summer but not during winter the study provides evidence for the risk of cyanotoxins in groundwater close to cyanobacteria contaminated surface water therefore regular monitoring for cyanotoxins in groundwater supplies used for drinking water should be undertaken when cyanobacteria bloom events are noted in nearby surface waters graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cyanotoxins cyanobacteria drinking water health risk assessment 1 introduction freshwater sources have been experiencing eutrophication due to industrial and agricultural wastewater discharges that induce the formation of harmful cyanobacterial blooms hcbs most cyanobacteria species produce potent toxins called cyanotoxins including hepatotoxins neurotoxins and skin irritant toxins carmichael et al 2001 these cyanotoxins have serious health risk and even death in animals and humans dittmann and wiegand 2006 mcs are the most common and widespread hepatotoxins in natural water with over 270 variants have been identified so far bouaicha et al 2019 mcs can be found in drinking water mohamed and al shehri 2007 and may cause death from liver hemorrhage or liver failure upon acute exposure to high doses pouria et al 1998 mc toxin was classified as a group 2b carcinogen by the international agency for research on cancer iarc 2020 therefore world health organization who proposed guideline value of 1 μg l 1 for mc lr in drinking water who 2017 besides drinking water mcs can also deteriorate the irrigation water quality and negatively affect plant growth and yield with potential accumulation in edible vegetable plants mcelhiney et al 2001 mohamed and al shehri 2009 these accumulated toxins can be transferred to humans via consumption of contaminated edible plant parts campos et al 2021 although mcs mainly reside inside cyanobacterial cells spoof et al 2020 they can release to the surrounding water after cell lysis at the end of bloom events or algicide application leading to high concentrations of extracellular dissolved mcs up to 180 μg l 1 in natural water wijewickrama and manage 2019 surface water and groundwater systems are connected and inter related in most landscapes liu et al 2016 surface water may interact with nearby groundwater through groundwater inflow seepage loss or combination of the two processes winter et al 1998 groundwater inflow occurs when the stage of surface water body is lower than groundwater while surface water would move towards groundwater if the surface water body stage is higher than groundwater abesh 2019 such physical interaction between surface water and groundwater could implicate in migration of pollutants across these water resources kong et al 2018 several hazardous compounds like pharmaceuticals and pesticides were found to enter groundwater from surface water due to lake aquifer interaction wu et al 2014 lin et al 2015 most likely mcs can seep into the groundwater from near lakes containing heavy hcbs yang et al 2016 lack of photodegradation and low redox conditions in the groundwater make chemicals such as mcs more stable and harder to be degraded wu et al 2014 therefore there is a potential risk of mcs exposure for residents using groundwater for drinking and irrigation while there are a large number of studies on mcs in surface water information on mc concentration and distribution in groundwater near eutrophic lakes is still limited mohamed and al shehri 2009 tian et al 2013 yang et al 2016 egypt is an arid country with limited freshwater sources including nile river and groundwater gaber et al 2020 the major feeding sources of groundwater in egypt are nile river water rainwater seepage and irrigation water as the groundwater quality is greatly influenced by the type of water that feeds underground reservoirs elnashar 2014 chemical contaminants e g mcs in surface water can leach into the groundwater and impair its use for drinking or irrigation purposes therefore this study investigates for the first time the presence of mcs in groundwater in egypt and arid countries in africa and to link its existence to nearby surface waters furthermore the data of mcs concentrations obtained from study were used to estimate the potential risk of contaminated groundwater to human health 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling our study was carried out in sohag province upper egypt where cyanobacterial blooms and mcs are frequently detected in the nile river water mohamed 2016 the selected study area represents a part of the nile valley extending between latitude 26 05 58 to 27 00 00 n and longitude 31 10 8 to 32 1500 e fig 1 climatologically the study area belongs to the arid belt of egypt where it is characterized by long and hot summer warm winter and scarce rainfall temperature varies from 49 c in summer to 11 c the nile riverbed is sandy in the area of our study ghodeif et al 2016 and the quaternary aquifer in this area is formed from the nile alluvial deposits consisting of graded sand and gravel with thin interbeds of clay megahed and farrag 2019 surface water samples were collected from five sites in the nile river at different towns and groundwater samples were collected from three pumping wells closest to each river site fig 1 surface and groundwater samples were collected in triplicate using pre sterilized glass bottles during the period of july september 2019 i e the time of cyanobacteria dominance in winter water samples were collected during the period of january february 2019 as the conditions are not suitable for cyanobacterial growth and toxin production in surface nile water water samples were kept at 4 c until analysis 2 2 physico chemical analysis temperature ph and conductivity of water samples were measured in situ by multi parametric probe hi 991300 ph ec tds temperature hanna italy nitrate and soluble phosphate concentrations were determined in filtered water samples according to standard methods apha 1995 2 3 identification of cyanobacteria water samples to investigate cyanobacterial cells in surface and groundwater samples subsamples of a known volume 500 ml were preserved in 1 lugol s solution cyanobacterial species in the fixed samples were identified according to komárek and anagnostidis 2005 and total cyanobacterial cells were enumerated using sedgewick rafter counting chamber 2 4 microcystin analysis in water samples in our study total mcs intra and extracellular toxins were analyzed according to water quality monitoring programs proposed by sangolkar et al 2006 to determine dissolved mcs i e extracellular mcs in surface and groundwater samples an aliquot of water sample was passed through gf c filters to remove suspended solids and cyanobacterial cells the filtrate was used for determination of dissolved mcs while the filter with retained cells was used for determination of intracellular mcs the filtrate one liter was applied onto c 18 cartridges to concentrate mcs and mcs adsorbed on cartilages were then eluted with 80 methanol the organic solvent was evaporated and the volume of the remaining aqueous solution was adjusted with sterilized distilled water to 1 ml dissolved mc concentration was then determined directly in the remaining aqueous fraction by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa according to carmichael and an 1999 using available elisa kits for mcs purchased from abraxis warminster pa with a detection limit of 0 15 ng ml 1 each test was made in triplicate mcs within cyanobacterial cells in water samples were determined by extracting filters with retained cells in 80 methanol according to carmichael and an 1999 intracellular mcs were then detected in the aqueous fraction remained after evaporation of organic solvent by elisa as described above the final concentrations of mcs were calculated in relation to the original volume of water samples 2 5 risk assessment of microcystins in groundwater to evaluate the safety of mcs in groundwater and their potential health risks for adults and children chronic daily intake cdi was calculated using the following equation according to funari and testai 2008 1 cdi cwx ir x efxed bwx at where cw is the concentration of dissolved mcs in groundwater μg l 1 ir is the ingestion rate of water 2 l day for adults and1l day for children ef is the exposure frequency drinking water 365 days year ed is exposure duration 70 years bw is the average body weight 70 kg for adults and 15 kg for children at is the average time equal to ed multiplied by 365 days year the standard values of parameters applied in the above equation were used according to world health organization who 2017 the health risk assessment model recommended by united states environmental protection agency us epa was used to evaluate the non carcinogenic health risk of mcs in groundwater the non carcinogenic risk was described using a hazard quotient hq by the following formula 2 hq cdi rfd where rfd is the us epa chronic reference dose for mcs 0 003 μg kg 1 body weight bw d corbel et al 2016 the hq is usually used as a danger indicator hq 1 indicates that the exposure is higher than the rfd which is dangerous to the human health hi 1 indicates that the exposure level is lower than the rfd which is unlikely to be harmful 2 6 statistical analysis differences in mc concentrations among different sites and groundwater wells were compared using one way anova p 0 05 using spss 18 0 software for windows correlations between mc concentrations in surface water and groundwater were tested using spearman rank correlation coefficients to verify that mcs in groundwater are leached from nearby surface nile water 3 results 3 1 physico chemical quality of surface and groundwater samples as shown in table 1 surface water samples exhibited slightly alkaline ph 7 4 8 7 with values insignificantly p 0 1 0 3 varied among different sites at the nile river similarly all groundwater samples were slightly alkaline ph 7 3 8 1 conductivity differed significantly p 0 001 0 0 004 between surface 136 220 μs cm 1 and groundwater samples 401 924 μs cm 1 nitrate concentrations in surface groundwater samples were 0 3 1 2 mg l 1 and 7 8 31 2 mg l 1 respectively phosphate concentrations were higher in surface water 1 4 1 9 mg l 1 than groundwater 0 02 0 6 mg l 1 3 2 cyanobacteria and total microcystins in surface and groundwater cyanonbacteria were found with high cell densities 1 7 3 1 x 105cells l 1 in surface water samples at different nile sites during summer season table 2 the most dominant species in all sites were anabaena circinalis merismopedia glauca microcystis aeruginosa oscillatoria limnetica oscillatoria tenuis on the other hand in winter season cyanobacteria were present in surface nile water with low cell densities 0 1 0 4 x105cells l 1 and dominated by o limnetica the total cyanobacterial cell density in surface nile water showed positive correlations with nitrate r 0 85 phosphate r 0 8 ph r 0 4 and conductivity r 0 15 total mcs i e intracellular plus extracellular dissolved mcs in surface nile water were detected with high concentrations in summer 15 23 μg l 1 and low concentrations in winter 0 7 2 1 μg l 1 table 2 these toxin concentrations correlated significantly with the total cyanobacterial cell density r 0 83 table 2 the results also showed significant correlations between mc concentrations and ph r 0 4 conductivity r 0 15 phosphate r 0 5 and nitrate r 0 7 no cells of either cyanobacteria or other phytoplankton species were observed in all groundwater wells investigated therefore data not shown hence intracellular mcs were not accounted in groundwater and mcs detected in groundwater samples were considered as extracellular dissolved toxins 3 3 concentrations of dissolved microcystin in surface and groundwater concentrations of dissolved mcs i e extracellular mcs released from cells into the surrounding water in surface water varied significantly p 0 006 among the five nile sampling sites fig 2 these concentrations were lower in winter 0 03 0 06 μg l 1 than in summer 1 1 1 9 μg l 1 in association with total mcs detected at these sites r 0 9 table 2 fig 2 dissolved mcs in surface nile water also had positive correlations with ph r 0 8 conductivity r 0 1 phosphate r 0 6 and nitrate r 0 7 dissolved mcs in groundwater wells were positively correlated r 0 8 with those detected in the nearby surface nile water site fig 2 this is manifested by the increase of dissolved mcs in groundwater 0 1 1 6 μg l 1 when concentrations 1 1 to 1 9 μg l 1 were high in surface nile water in summer and their decrease in winter 0 0 03 μg l 1 coincident with their low concentrations 0 03 0 06 μg l 1 in nile water table 2 fig 2 additionally our results revealed that concentrations of dissolved mcs in groundwater showed negative correlation r 0 97 to 0 89 with the depth of wells fig 3 for instance for groundwater wells near nile site 4 the highest mc concentration 0 48 μg l 1 was obtained in gw1 s4 well with a depth of 11 m while the lowest 0 16 μg l 1 was detected in gw3 s1 with a depth of 47 m furthermore the results of present study also showed a negative correlation between mcs concentrations in groundwater and the distance of the wells from the nile river shore r 0 6 to 0 8 fig 4 on the other hand mcs in groundwaters showed weak correlations with ph r 0 4 conductivity r 0 2 phosphate r 0 01 and nitrate r 0 4 4 discussion 4 1 physico chemical quality and cyanobacteria in surface and groundwater samples the present study clearly revealed that surface nile water and nearby groundwaters were slightly alkaline ph 7 3 8 7 within the permissible limit of 6 5 to 8 5 drinking water by who 2011 conductivity of surface and groundwater samples was also close to the acceptable limit for drinking water 500 μs cm 1 nitrate concentrations in surface nile water 0 3 1 2 mg l 1 were below the who limit for drinking water 10 mg l 1 but they exceeded this limit in groundwaters 7 8 31 2 mg l 1 phosphate concentrations in surface and groundwater exceeded the who drinking water limit 0 01 mg l 1 these conditions along with high temperatures might lead to the presence of cyanobacteria with high cell densities in surface water samples at different nile sites during summer season these results agree with the findings and facts deduced by several authors who stated that freshwater bodies enriched with high nutrients exhibit a shift towards the dominance of cyanobacteria when other factors such as high temperatures 15 30 c ph 6 9 calm stable water conditions and salinity of not more than 4 ppt are prevalent in the environment mohamed et al 2015 okello et al 2010 similar to the cell density of cyanobacteria total mc concentrations in surface nile water also correlated with physico chemical parameters these results are thus in agreement with those obtained by oliver and ganf 2000 which reported that high mc concentrations contained in cyanobacterial blooms were related to the abundance of nutrients and favorable conditions for cyanobacterial growth in our study cyanobacterial populations in surface nile water were dominated by a circinalis mer glauca m aeruginosa o limnetica and o tenuis these species were previously identified in the same sites and found to produce mcs mohamed and al shehri 2010 mohamed 2016 our results also revealed a significant correlation between total mc concentrations and the cell density of these species in surface nile water these toxin concentrations 14 6 23 2 μg l 1 were higher in summer than winter 0 7 2 1 μg l 1 this was due to the presence of cyanobacteria in surface nile water with low cell densities dominated by o limnetica in winter low cell concentrations of cyanobacteria are due to low temperature 15 c in winter which is below the optimal temperature 20 3 c for the growth of many species lurling et al 2013 nevertheless oscillatoria can survive low temperature up to 7 c chu et al 2007 such linear relationship between mc production and the cell density of dominant cyanobacterial species was previously observed in the nile delta mohamed et al 2015 on the other hand our results demonstrated that all groundwater samples did not contain any cells of cyanobacteria or other phytoplankton species this is in concordance with the results of tian et al 2013 that revealed the absence of phytoplankton in groundwater wells near shaying river northern china this is reasonable finding because such photosynthetic organisms cannot survive under dark condition in groundwater wells 4 2 concentrations of dissolved microcystin in surface and groundwater dissolved mcs were detected in surface nile water at all sites during the present study with higher concentrations in summer than winter these toxin concentrations were associating with total mcs recorded in water samples of these sites the high concentrations of dissolved mcs obtained during summer in the present study can be compared with those concentrations detected previously in the nile delta water 1 2 4 5 μg l 1 mohamed et al 2015 generally mcs are well known to be contained within the cells and only released into surrounding water by cell lysis during senescence at the end of bloom or application of chemicals tsuji et al 2001 in our study the high concentrations of dissolved mcs recorded in surface water samples could be attributed to the natural cell lysis during senescence as no algicide application is practiced in this area of nile river the results of statistical analysis of correlation revealed a clear significant association between dissolved mcs in groundwater and nearby surface nile waters these results are consistent with those of other studies elsewhere in the world mohamed and al shehri 2009 tian et al 2013 yang et al 2016 concentrations of dissolved mcs in our groundwater wells 0 1 1 6 μg l 1 can be compared with those found in groundwater wells 0 3 1 8 μg l 1 in saudi arabia mohamed and al shehri 2009 and in groundwater wells 0 1 1 1 μg l 1 near lake chaohu china yang et al 2016 however our concentrations are slightly lower than concentration detected in groundwater 0 02 0 45 μg l 1 near shaying river in china tian et al 2013 the discrepancy in mc concentrations in groundwater between different studies may be due to the difference in lakebed and aquifer material that

groups in mc toxin upon deprotonation could bind with the clay mineral by ligand exchange and cation bridge pochodylo et al 2016 this way mcs can be adsorbed onto lake and aquifer sediments and the

mcs detected in groundwater could be leached out from surface nile water our study also demonstrated that concentrations of dissolved mcs in groundwater decreased with the well depth this contradicts the results of tian et al 2013 and yang et al 2016 which demonstrated that well depth did not significantly affect mc concentrations in groundwater this inconsistency between our results and tian s and yang s ones may be due to the difference of soil texture between such geologically different regions i e egypt china previously townsend and young 1995 reported that downward moving contaminants would be decreased with increasing thickness of clay in the subsurface above the well screen therefore the higher concentrations of mcs in shallower wells compared to lower concentrations in deeper wells could be due to the low clay in the unsaturated zone and the high clay in saturated zone which retarded the downward transport of mcs this supports the hypothesis that shallow groundwater is more susceptible to contaminants than deeper water nemcic jurec and jazbec 2017 furthermore mcs concentrations in groundwater correlated negatively with the distance of the wells from the nile river

1348,although groundwater is an important source for drinking and irrigation water worldwide particularly in arid countries they have been paid little attention to their contamination with microcystins mcs compared to surface water our study is the fourth one reporting existence of mcs in groundwater due to surface water and groundwater interaction dissolved mcs in groundwater were found with higher concentrations in summer 0 1 to 0 84 μg l 1 than in winter 0 0 06 μg l 1 in association with mcs detected in nearby surface nile water the chronic daily intake cdi of mcs for both adults and children 0 0 003 μg kg 1 body weight d 1 in groundwater were lower than the chronic reference dose rfd 0 003 μg kg 1 body weight d 1 during winter with hazard quotient less than 1 conversely cdi values exceeded the reference dose during summer for both adults 0 005 0 024 μg kg 1 body weight d 1 and children 0 012 0 05 μg kg 1 body weight d 1 with hazard quotient greater than 1 this indicates that mcs concentrations in these groundwater wells might pose adverse health effects to both adults and children during summer but not during winter the study provides evidence for the risk of cyanotoxins in groundwater close to cyanobacteria contaminated surface water therefore regular monitoring for cyanotoxins in groundwater supplies used for drinking water should be undertaken when cyanobacteria bloom events are noted in nearby surface waters graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cyanotoxins cyanobacteria drinking water health risk assessment 1 introduction freshwater sources have been experiencing eutrophication due to industrial and agricultural wastewater discharges that induce the formation of harmful cyanobacterial blooms hcbs most cyanobacteria species produce potent toxins called cyanotoxins including hepatotoxins neurotoxins and skin irritant toxins carmichael et al 2001 these cyanotoxins have serious health risk and even death in animals and humans dittmann and wiegand 2006 mcs are the most common and widespread hepatotoxins in natural water with over 270 variants have been identified so far bouaicha et al 2019 mcs can be found in drinking water mohamed and al shehri 2007 and may cause death from liver hemorrhage or liver failure upon acute exposure to high doses pouria et al 1998 mc toxin was classified as a group 2b carcinogen by the international agency for research on cancer iarc 2020 therefore world health organization who proposed guideline value of 1 μg l 1 for mc lr in drinking water who 2017 besides drinking water mcs can also deteriorate the irrigation water quality and negatively affect plant growth and yield with potential accumulation in edible vegetable plants mcelhiney et al 2001 mohamed and al shehri 2009 these accumulated toxins can be transferred to humans via consumption of contaminated edible plant parts campos et al 2021 although mcs mainly reside inside cyanobacterial cells spoof et al 2020 they can release to the surrounding water after cell lysis at the end of bloom events or algicide application leading to high concentrations of extracellular dissolved mcs up to 180 μg l 1 in natural water wijewickrama and manage 2019 surface water and groundwater systems are connected and inter related in most landscapes liu et al 2016 surface water may interact with nearby groundwater through groundwater inflow seepage loss or combination of the two processes winter et al 1998 groundwater inflow occurs when the stage of surface water body is lower than groundwater while surface water would move towards groundwater if the surface water body stage is higher than groundwater abesh 2019 such physical interaction between surface water and groundwater could implicate in migration of pollutants across these water resources kong et al 2018 several hazardous compounds like pharmaceuticals and pesticides were found to enter groundwater from surface water due to lake aquifer interaction wu et al 2014 lin et al 2015 most likely mcs can seep into the groundwater from near lakes containing heavy hcbs yang et al 2016 lack of photodegradation and low redox conditions in the groundwater make chemicals such as mcs more stable and harder to be degraded wu et al 2014 therefore there is a potential risk of mcs exposure for residents using groundwater for drinking and irrigation while there are a large number of studies on mcs in surface water information on mc concentration and distribution in groundwater near eutrophic lakes is still limited mohamed and al shehri 2009 tian et al 2013 yang et al 2016 egypt is an arid country with limited freshwater sources including nile river and groundwater gaber et al 2020 the major feeding sources of groundwater in egypt are nile river water rainwater seepage and irrigation water as the groundwater quality is greatly influenced by the type of water that feeds underground reservoirs elnashar 2014 chemical contaminants e g mcs in surface water can leach into the groundwater and impair its use for drinking or irrigation purposes therefore this study investigates for the first time the presence of mcs in groundwater in egypt and arid countries in africa and to link its existence to nearby surface waters furthermore the data of mcs concentrations obtained from study were used to estimate the potential risk of contaminated groundwater to human health 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling our study was carried out in sohag province upper egypt where cyanobacterial blooms and mcs are frequently detected in the nile river water mohamed 2016 the selected study area represents a part of the nile valley extending between latitude 26 05 58 to 27 00 00 n and longitude 31 10 8 to 32 1500 e fig 1 climatologically the study area belongs to the arid belt of egypt where it is characterized by long and hot summer warm winter and scarce rainfall temperature varies from 49 c in summer to 11 c the nile riverbed is sandy in the area of our study ghodeif et al 2016 and the quaternary aquifer in this area is formed from the nile alluvial deposits consisting of graded sand and gravel with thin interbeds of clay megahed and farrag 2019 surface water samples were collected from five sites in the nile river at different towns and groundwater samples were collected from three pumping wells closest to each river site fig 1 surface and groundwater samples were collected in triplicate using pre sterilized glass bottles during the period of july september 2019 i e the time of cyanobacteria dominance in winter water samples were collected during the period of january february 2019 as the conditions are not suitable for cyanobacterial growth and toxin production in surface nile water water samples were kept at 4 c until analysis 2 2 physico chemical analysis temperature ph and conductivity of water samples were measured in situ by multi parametric probe hi 991300 ph ec tds temperature hanna italy nitrate and soluble phosphate concentrations were determined in filtered water samples according to standard methods apha 1995 2 3 identification of cyanobacteria water samples to investigate cyanobacterial cells in surface and groundwater samples subsamples of a known volume 500 ml were preserved in 1 lugol s solution cyanobacterial species in the fixed samples were identified according to komárek and anagnostidis 2005 and total cyanobacterial cells were enumerated using sedgewick rafter counting chamber 2 4 microcystin analysis in water samples in our study total mcs intra and extracellular toxins were analyzed according to water quality monitoring programs proposed by sangolkar et al 2006 to determine dissolved mcs i e extracellular mcs in surface and groundwater samples an aliquot of water sample was passed through gf c filters to remove suspended solids and cyanobacterial cells the filtrate was used for determination of dissolved mcs while the filter with retained cells was used for determination of intracellular mcs the filtrate one liter was applied onto c 18 cartridges to concentrate mcs and mcs adsorbed on cartilages were then eluted with 80 methanol the organic solvent was evaporated and the volume of the remaining aqueous solution was adjusted with sterilized distilled water to 1 ml dissolved mc concentration was then determined directly in the remaining aqueous fraction by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa according to carmichael and an 1999 using available elisa kits for mcs purchased from abraxis warminster pa with a detection limit of 0 15 ng ml 1 each test was made in triplicate mcs within cyanobacterial cells in water samples were determined by extracting filters with retained cells in 80 methanol according to carmichael and an 1999 intracellular mcs were then detected in the aqueous fraction remained after evaporation of organic solvent by elisa as described above the final concentrations of mcs were calculated in relation to the original volume of water samples 2 5 risk assessment of microcystins in groundwater to evaluate the safety of mcs in groundwater and their potential health risks for adults and children chronic daily intake cdi was calculated using the following equation according to funari and testai 2008 1 cdi cwx ir x efxed bwx at where cw is the concentration of dissolved mcs in groundwater μg l 1 ir is the ingestion rate of water 2 l day for adults and1l day for children ef is the exposure frequency drinking water 365 days year ed is exposure duration 70 years bw is the average body weight 70 kg for adults and 15 kg for children at is the average time equal to ed multiplied by 365 days year the standard values of parameters applied in the above equation were used according to world health organization who 2017 the health risk assessment model recommended by united states environmental protection agency us epa was used to evaluate the non carcinogenic health risk of mcs in groundwater the non carcinogenic risk was described using a hazard quotient hq by the following formula 2 hq cdi rfd where rfd is the us epa chronic reference dose for mcs 0 003 μg kg 1 body weight bw d corbel et al 2016 the hq is usually used as a danger indicator hq 1 indicates that the exposure is higher than the rfd which is dangerous to the human health hi 1 indicates that the exposure level is lower than the rfd which is unlikely to be harmful 2 6 statistical analysis differences in mc concentrations among different sites and groundwater wells were compared using one way anova p 0 05 using spss 18 0 software for windows correlations between mc concentrations in surface water and groundwater were tested using spearman rank correlation coefficients to verify that mcs in groundwater are leached from nearby surface nile water 3 results 3 1 physico chemical quality of surface and groundwater samples as shown in table 1 surface water samples exhibited slightly alkaline ph 7 4 8 7 with values insignificantly p 0 1 0 3 varied among different sites at the nile river similarly all groundwater samples were slightly alkaline ph 7 3 8 1 conductivity differed significantly p 0 001 0 0 004 between surface 136 220 μs cm 1 and groundwater samples 401 924 μs cm 1 nitrate concentrations in surface groundwater samples were 0 3 1 2 mg l 1 and 7 8 31 2 mg l 1 respectively phosphate concentrations were higher in surface water 1 4 1 9 mg l 1 than groundwater 0 02 0 6 mg l 1 3 2 cyanobacteria and total microcystins in surface and groundwater cyanonbacteria were found with high cell densities 1 7 3 1 x 105cells l 1 in surface water samples at different nile sites during summer season table 2 the most dominant species in all sites were anabaena circinalis merismopedia glauca microcystis aeruginosa oscillatoria limnetica oscillatoria tenuis on the other hand in winter season cyanobacteria were present in surface nile water with low cell densities 0 1 0 4 x105cells l 1 and dominated by o limnetica the total cyanobacterial cell density in surface nile water showed positive correlations with nitrate r 0 85 phosphate r 0 8 ph r 0 4 and conductivity r 0 15 total mcs i e intracellular plus extracellular dissolved mcs in surface nile water were detected with high concentrations in summer 15 23 μg l 1 and low concentrations in winter 0 7 2 1 μg l 1 table 2 these toxin concentrations correlated significantly with the total cyanobacterial cell density r 0 83 table 2 the results also showed significant correlations between mc concentrations and ph r 0 4 conductivity r 0 15 phosphate r 0 5 and nitrate r 0 7 no cells of either cyanobacteria or other phytoplankton species were observed in all groundwater wells investigated therefore data not shown hence intracellular mcs were not accounted in groundwater and mcs detected in groundwater samples were considered as extracellular dissolved toxins 3 3 concentrations of dissolved microcystin in surface and groundwater concentrations of dissolved mcs i e extracellular mcs released from cells into the surrounding water in surface water varied significantly p 0 006 among the five nile sampling sites fig 2 these concentrations were lower in winter 0 03 0 06 μg l 1 than in summer 1 1 1 9 μg l 1 in association with total mcs detected at these sites r 0 9 table 2 fig 2 dissolved mcs in surface nile water also had positive correlations with ph r 0 8 conductivity r 0 1 phosphate r 0 6 and nitrate r 0 7 dissolved mcs in groundwater wells were positively correlated r 0 8 with those detected in the nearby surface nile water site fig 2 this is manifested by the increase of dissolved mcs in groundwater 0 1 1 6 μg l 1 when concentrations 1 1 to 1 9 μg l 1 were high in surface nile water in summer and their decrease in winter 0 0 03 μg l 1 coincident with their low concentrations 0 03 0 06 μg l 1 in nile water table 2 fig 2 additionally our results revealed that concentrations of dissolved mcs in groundwater showed negative correlation r 0 97 to 0 89 with the depth of wells fig 3 for instance for groundwater wells near nile site 4 the highest mc concentration 0 48 μg l 1 was obtained in gw1 s4 well with a depth of 11 m while the lowest 0 16 μg l 1 was detected in gw3 s1 with a depth of 47 m furthermore the results of present study also showed a negative correlation between mcs concentrations in groundwater and the distance of the wells from the nile river shore r 0 6 to 0 8 fig 4 on the other hand mcs in groundwaters showed weak correlations with ph r 0 4 conductivity r 0 2 phosphate r 0 01 and nitrate r 0 4 4 discussion 4 1 physico chemical quality and cyanobacteria in surface and groundwater samples the present study clearly revealed that surface nile water and nearby groundwaters were slightly alkaline ph 7 3 8 7 within the permissible limit of 6 5 to 8 5 drinking water by who 2011 conductivity of surface and groundwater samples was also close to the acceptable limit for drinking water 500 μs cm 1 nitrate concentrations in surface nile water 0 3 1 2 mg l 1 were below the who limit for drinking water 10 mg l 1 but they exceeded this limit in groundwaters 7 8 31 2 mg l 1 phosphate concentrations in surface and groundwater exceeded the who drinking water limit 0 01 mg l 1 these conditions along with high temperatures might lead to the presence of cyanobacteria with high cell densities in surface water samples at different nile sites during summer season these results agree with the findings and facts deduced by several authors who stated that freshwater bodies enriched with high nutrients exhibit a shift towards the dominance of cyanobacteria when other factors such as high temperatures 15 30 c ph 6 9 calm stable water conditions and salinity of not more than 4 ppt are prevalent in the environment mohamed et al 2015 okello et al 2010 similar to the cell density of cyanobacteria total mc concentrations in surface nile water also correlated with physico chemical parameters these results are thus in agreement with those obtained by oliver and ganf 2000 which reported that high mc concentrations contained in cyanobacterial blooms were related to the abundance of nutrients and favorable conditions for cyanobacterial growth in our study cyanobacterial populations in surface nile water were dominated by a circinalis mer glauca m aeruginosa o limnetica and o tenuis these species were previously identified in the same sites and found to produce mcs mohamed and al shehri 2010 mohamed 2016 our results also revealed a significant correlation between total mc concentrations and the cell density of these species in surface nile water these toxin concentrations 14 6 23 2 μg l 1 were higher in summer than winter 0 7 2 1 μg l 1 this was due to the presence of cyanobacteria in surface nile water with low cell densities dominated by o limnetica in winter low cell concentrations of cyanobacteria are due to low temperature 15 c in winter which is below the optimal temperature 20 3 c for the growth of many species lurling et al 2013 nevertheless oscillatoria can survive low temperature up to 7 c chu et al 2007 such linear relationship between mc production and the cell density of dominant cyanobacterial species was previously observed in the nile delta mohamed et al 2015 on the other hand our results demonstrated that all groundwater samples did not contain any cells of cyanobacteria or other phytoplankton species this is in concordance with the results of tian et al 2013 that revealed the absence of phytoplankton in groundwater wells near shaying river northern china this is reasonable finding because such photosynthetic organisms cannot survive under dark condition in groundwater wells 4 2 concentrations of dissolved microcystin in surface and groundwater dissolved mcs were detected in surface nile water at all sites during the present study with higher concentrations in summer than winter these toxin concentrations were associating with total mcs recorded in water samples of these sites the high concentrations of dissolved mcs obtained during summer in the present study can be compared with those concentrations detected previously in the nile delta water 1 2 4 5 μg l 1 mohamed et al 2015 generally mcs are well known to be contained within the cells and only released into surrounding water by cell lysis during senescence at the end of bloom or application of chemicals tsuji et al 2001 in our study the high concentrations of dissolved mcs recorded in surface water samples could be attributed to the natural cell lysis during senescence as no algicide application is practiced in this area of nile river the results of statistical analysis of correlation revealed a clear significant association between dissolved mcs in groundwater and nearby surface nile waters these results are consistent with those of other studies elsewhere in the world mohamed and al shehri 2009 tian et al 2013 yang et al 2016 concentrations of dissolved mcs in our groundwater wells 0 1 1 6 μg l 1 can be compared with those found in groundwater wells 0 3 1 8 μg l 1 in saudi arabia mohamed and al shehri 2009 and in groundwater wells 0 1 1 1 μg l 1 near lake chaohu china yang et al 2016 however our concentrations are slightly lower than concentration detected in groundwater 0 02 0 45 μg l 1 near shaying river in china tian et al 2013 the discrepancy in mc concentrations in groundwater between different studies may be due to the difference in lakebed and aquifer material that is the key parameter for lake groundwater interaction and controls the movement of contaminates in lake water to groundwater el zehairy et al 2018 in this respect we would refer to that the carboxyl groups in mc toxin upon deprotonation could bind with the clay mineral by ligand exchange and cation bridge pochodylo et al 2016 this way mcs can be adsorbed onto lake and aquifer sediments and the strength of this sorption increases with the increase of the clay content in these sediments chen et al 2006 xue et al 2020 eynard et al 2000 also reported that soil could not protect groundwater from

southern oscillation enso events has severely restricted water resources in many parts of sa bolaños et al 2021 moreover the economies of most south american countries such as brazil argentina mexico etc depend on agricultural productivity seo and mendelsohn 2008 regional variations in the amount of water and temperature are closely related to crop yields chaudhuri et al 2020 song et al 2021 the growth of temperature will shorten the life cycle of crops thus decrease the yields porter 2005 precipitation affects irrigation water consumption by influencing soil moisture surface flow and underground runoff tang et al 2007 jackson et al 2001 for instance the yield of wheat is uncertain through el niño and la niña periods in sonora mexico zavala and cota 2003 the growth cycle of cotton and mango on the northern coast of peru is shortened during el niño due to the increase in temperature caramanica et al 2020 additionally as precipitation and humidity accelerate during the ei niño phase there is an increase in the incidence of plant diseases for example cancrosis in argentine citrus canteros et al 2017 fusarium disease in brazilian and argentine wheat del ponte et al 2005 and several fungal diseases of peruvian corn potatoes wheat and beans rosenzweig and hillel 2008 so a more precise projection of precipitation and temperature of sa is desired for agriculture the precipitation and temperature of sa are found closely related to teleconnection patterns such as enso teleconnection patterns are the periodic large scale pattern and circulation anomalies that cross vast geographical areas through atmospheric circulation tedeschi et al 2013 pointed out sst anomalies in the pacific affect the precipitation over sa while temperature anomalies of sa were discovered relate to enso events llamedo et al 2017 therefore the study on the relationship between south american climate and teleconnection patterns is vital to the prediction of precipitation and temperature as well as to the water resources management of sa s agriculture the anomalous changes in the ocean and atmosphere such as enso affect the climate of remote regions through atmospheric circulation which is called teleconnection gershunov and barnett 1998 as early as the 19th century peruvian fishermen discovered that a warm current that occurs every few years along the east coast of the pacific ocean around christmas causing a large number of fish deaths and heavy losses for fishermen ros tonen and van boxel 1999 this phenomenon is known as el niño now some studies indicate that cai et al 2019 izumo et al 2010 kucharski et al 2015 kug and kang 2006 the interaction with the indian ocean and the atlantic ocean will also have feedback on the pacific ocean thus affecting the properties of enso likewise the values and trends of enso are influenced by the interaction between enso and other climate anomaly patterns garreaud et al 2020 ham et al 2013 such as indian ocean dipole iod saji et al 1999 and atlantic interdecadal variability amo levine et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to comprehensively consider multiple teleconnections factors when studying teleconnections previously mohammadi et al 2020 investigated the 4 tis nao enso amo pdo with precipitation patterns in peruvian the result shows that it is nao that correlates most with monthly rainfall and pdo influences the annual precipitation pattern more travasso et al 2003a found that it is the sst anomalies of the south atlantic associated with the diversification of crop yields in argentina most compared to other climate variabilities valtorta et al 2002 discovered that argentine heatwaves especially in the central area resulted in holando argentino cows produce less milk and the cattle hardly recovered from these events thoroughly in the past few decades the climate of sa has been influenced by enso events with an increase in extreme climate events like floods and droughts for example during 1999 and 2005 torrential precipitation occurred in venezuela garcía martínez and lópez 2005 rivas et al 2009 there were severe floods in pampas of argentina in 2000 and 2002 bilotto et al 2019 drought happened in amazon during 2005 and 2010 garcia et al 2018 heavy rainfall and humidity increasing caused by these extreme events have led to the monitoring of several fungal diseases in crops such as potatoes corns wheat and beans in peru seimon et al 2017 on the other hand there were still some positive effects of ei niño in the pampas region of argentina the enhancive precipitation led to increased crop yields by nearly 38 for beans 18 for corn 13 for wheat and 12 for sunflowers verón et al 2015 similarly ranching productivity rose by 7 in argentina travasso et al 2003b and uruguay rolla et al 2018 cai et al 2020 reviewed the correspondence between enso and the climate of sa systematically levine et al 2019 proposed and verified a conceptual hypothesis that sst affects soil moisture and co2 flux by influencing precipitation and temperature bruick et al 2019 focused the studies on the characteristics between enso and convection in subtropical of sa reboita et al 2021 compared the influence between the climate of sa and 8 teleconnection patterns such as enso amo and iod oñate valdivieso et al 2020 used oni as the enso index to study the relationship between drought of sa and large scale climate patterns while holmgren et al 2006 invested soi as the enso events index to carry out experiments about the growth rate of plants in semiarid sa vera et al 2018 described the seasonal cycle of precipitation of sa by the analysis of olr lupo et al 2017 emphasized that the pna and enso have an impact on the seasonal range prediction of sa however in the previous studies of teleconnection in sa the majority of research bruick et al 2019 cai et al 2020 levine et al 2019 focused on the effect between enso patterns and sa and few studies involved comprehensive tis in addition many studies andreoli and kayano 2005 valtorta et al 2002 zavala and cota 2003 attended on the abnormal events in a specific region and the length of data was short few of them analyzed the whole continent with decades of high resolution grid data therefore to fill the gap of previous studies the purpose of this research is to analyze the correlation between extensive teleconnection patterns and sa the detailed framework of this study is shown in fig 1 from fig 1 19 tis are considered and multiple grid climate data sets are adopted simultaneously among which gpcc and cpc data were high resolution data sets through correlation analysis lag period analysis and spatial analysis the main science problems will be addressed in this study are as follows 1 do precipitation and temperature in sa be affected by teleconnection patterns which tis influence climate in sa significantly 2 is there a lag in this influence how long is the lag duration 3 is there a difference among different grid point data gpcc cpc ncep reanalysis data about the correlation between tis and south american climate 4 which areas of sa are significantly correlated to tis these questions will be discussed in the following sections 2 data and method this study uses 19 tis from different teleconnection monitor centers in detail table 1 shows the 19 tis and their monitor center link the first 8 indices are the sst and their anomalies in 4 niño regions to monitor the enso phenomenon the near equatorial pacific has been divided into four regions trenberth 1997 as shown in fig 2 niño 1 2 region is from 0 to 10 s between 90 w and 80 w it is the least and the most eastern one of the 4 regions it is closest to sa where ei niño was first recognized by the local fishermen sst 1 2 and anom 1 2 have the largest variance in the 8 indices region niño 3 is the western and slightly northward of region 1 2 the latitude and longitude range is from 5 n to 5 s between 150 w 90 w it was the primary area to monitor and predict ei niño later on researchers trenberth 1997 found that the key region for the atmosphere and ocean interaction for enso is more westward so region niño 3 4 became the popular region for defining ei niño and la niño events niño 3 4 is a combination of part of niño 3 and niño 4 region from 5 n to 5 s between 170 w to 120 w which is filled with the shape of x the average sst across region niño 3 4 is widely used to define enso events for example if the mean of niño 3 4 sst exceeds 0 4 c of the average sst for a period of 6 months or longer then this is the ei niño event on the other hand if sst is under 0 4 c of the average sst for 6 months it is a la niña event de souza et al 2000 niño region 4 5 n 5 s 160 e to 150 w is the easternmost area among the 4 regions indices here

government bureau of meteorology monitors enso and iod indices the indian ocean is divided into two monitoring parts the iodw from 50 e to 70 e and from 10 s to 10 n and iode from 90 e to 110 e and from 10 s to 0 n in this study iodd is the difference of sst anomalies between iodw and iode the characteristic of the positive iod phase is that the sst in the east of the indian ocean is lower than the average temperature and sst of the tropical western indian ocean is higher than usual the minus iod period has the opposite characteristic among these 19 indices which one or multiple indices affect the climate over sa will be discussed in the following sections as for sa s climate this study uses two primary indices namely precipitation negrón juárez et al 2009 and temperature karimi et al 2020 to analyze their correlation with tis in this study 3 sets of data were downloaded namely the global precipitation climatology center gpcc precipitation the climate prediction center cpc precipitation and temperature and the national centers for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis precipitation and temperature data sets so there are 3 sets of precipitation and 2 sets of temperature data for gpcc precipitation data it is gauge based and with remote sensing combination gridded data menne et al 2012 this study downloads the full daily precipitation data v 2018 from 1982

popular reanalysis data sets in climate studies kalnay et al 1996 roberts et al 2019 so this study employed this reanalysis even though the resolution is lower than the first two sets the daily time series from 1948 to 2020 precipitation and temperature data were acquired from https psl noaa gov data gridded data ncep reanalysis html sa across the equator and most of the continent is in the southern hemisphere the latitude and longitude of sa are from 12 28ˊn to 53 54ˊs and 81 20ˊw to 34 46ˊw respectively most of sa has a tropical climate such as tropical rainforest desert and savanna climate characterized by heat and humidity in the meantime the south of sa 20 s 40 s has a subtropical monsoon climate and a temperate continental climate the andes have a plateau climate while the western of andes has a mediterranean and temperate marine climate zhang and yan 2014 the total amount of available freshwater resources is quite substantial but the uneven temporal and spatial distribution of water influences the quality and amount of water in different areas about 60 of sa s water is used for agricultural activities watson et al 1998 before conducting the correlation analysis this study briefly analyzed the seasonal precipitation and temperature to understand the sa climate fig 3 is the seasonal total precipitation over sa in fig 3 it is obvious that the overall precipitation exceeds 500 mm in the majority area of sa especially in djf and mam season the amazon basin has a 1000 mm total seasonal precipitation fig 4 shows the seasonal mean temperature over sa except for andes mountain and the southwest coast the seasonal mean temperature in sa is quite similar it is around 25 c to 30 c this is mainly because sa is located near the equator most of the area is between 10 n to 30 s with a typically tropical and subtropical climate rani et al 2021 in general the majority area of sa s climate is hot and humid the seasonal difference in mean temperature is not obvious in contrast the range of temperature shows an evident spatial variable over sa in fig 5 that is why the range of temperature is considered along with minimum mean and maximum temperature to analyze the correlation in the next section the seasonal temperature range is calculated from daily temperature data the daily temperature range was first computed daily maximum temperature minus daily minimum temperature then the seasonal mean of daily range was obtained and shown in fig 5 along with the andes the seasonal mean temperature range is higher than other areas which is over 12 5 c the brazilian plateau shows an evident larger range temperature during jja and son the andes and brazilian plateau have a high altitude so the range of temperature is greater than other areas of sa in this study the time series of sa s precipitation and temperature is from january 1982 to december 2016 mean and maximum monthly precipitation were calculated from gpcc cpc and ncep reanalysis daily time series data as shown in fig 1 the minimum mean and maximum of monthly min mean max and the range of temperature from were calculated cpc and necp reanalysis daily time series data respectively dong et al 2021 so the monthly length of precipitation and temperature is 420 from january 1982 to december 2016 the gridded precipitation and temperature variables over sa are noted as x x 1j x 2j x ij where i is the total amount of grids in sa j is the length of time series and equal to 420 here in order to analyze the lag time between tis and sa climate variables the time series of tis is from january 1981 to december 2016 the lag time l is assumed from 1 month to 12 months which means the delay time of teleconnection patterns would not affect sa s climate until l months the time series length of tis is corresponding to the climate variable which is 420 months 35 years tis are noted as t t 1 t 2 t j in this study pearson correlation coefficient r l is calculated in the following formula 1 r l n 1 j x mn x m t n l t n 1 j x mn x m 2 n 1 l j l t n l t 2 for every m 1 2 i and every l 0 1 2 where l is the lag period for example l 1 means the lag time is 1 month x is the mean of monthly climate variables with time series of n 1 2 j namely x 1 n n 1 j x n t is the mean of tis index with the time series n 1 l 2 l j l namely t 1 n l n 1 j t n l under the alternative hypothesis that there is a significant correlation between x and t ha ρ 0 and the null hypothesis is h0 ρ 0 li et al 2008 ma et al 2021 this study used t test to determine the significance between x and t the value of the t test is calculated as follows 2 t l r l n l 2 1 r l where r l is the correlation coefficient from eq 1 with the lag period of l months 3 results and discussion 3 1 correlation and lag period analysis a comparison of the correlation between the climate variables of sa and 19 tis is presented in figs 6 to 8 these 3 figures use the significantly correlated sc grids with p 0 05 to compute the absolute values of pearson s correlation coefficient and their mean value of all sc grids about the horizontal axis it is the lag period l since l begins with 0 so the first value of the x axis month 1 represents there is no lag time between tis and climate variables the second value month 2 means the lag duration is 1 month and so on no lag time l 0 month 1 means that the impact of tis on sa s climate occurs in the same month and 1 month lag duration means it takes 1 month for the effect of tis on the south american climate the result of the mean absolute correlation coefficient between precipitation and tis is shown in fig 6 for the 19 tis sst in 4 niño regions especially regions 1 2 and 3 significantly correlate to monthly mean and monthly extreme precipitation the mean absolute value of the correlation coefficient of sst 1 2 over sc grids is around 0 3 to 0 6 for teleconnection the mean correlation coefficient of the study area greater than 0 2 is acceptable siedlecki 2010 this is largely due to these two regions are the nearest area from the perspective of geographic location precipitation corresponding with the sst in niño region 1 2 and niño region 3 for example if sst in these two niño regions rises slp will increase and lead to a stronger walker circulation more water vapor evaporates into the atmosphere and is transported to sa under the influence of the westerlies which impact precipitation there except for 4 niño regions amo and nao have the largest correlation coefficient among the remaining 11 teleconnection patterns according to the correlation coefficient results the teleconnections with higher correlation coefficients are sst 2 sst 3 sst3 4 sst4 amo and nao the tis of the 4 niño regions mainly represent the temperature anomalies in the pacific while amo and nao mainly reflect the anomalies in the atlantic geographically sa lies on the east of the pacific and the west of the atlantic anomalies in these two oceans can affect the climate of sa more directly and quickly than other tis such as anomalies in the indian ocean where amo is the anomaly sst of atlantic and nao is the anomaly slp of north atlantic the correlation between amo and precipitation in sa is greater than that between nao and precipitation in sa because the spatial area of amo that reflects the differences of atlantic anomalies is large and its geographical location is closer to sa this is consistent with the pearson correlation coefficient results comparing the 3 sets of gridded precipitation data it is obvious that the ncep reanalyzed precipitation data shows the highest correlation coefficient with a monthly average correlation of 0 6 there is little difference between cpc and gpcc grid precipitation data and the correlation coefficient is about 0 5 cpc is slightly higher than gpcc this is largely due to gpcc and cpc are obtained from gauge based data while the observed precipitation data of south american sites are limited vera and silvestri 2009 and there may exist errors between the grid rainfall data sets obtained from sites and the actual precipitation li et al 2020 ncep reanalysis data is the initial field with a minimum error obtained by assimilation of various meteorological data based on a series of forecast models when observed data is missing or gridded data is needed reanalysis data is often used as observation data in climate studies sun et al 2018 according to the results the correlation coefficient between necp reanalysis precipitation data and tis such as sst1 2 amo nao etc in sa is better than that of gpcc and cpc precipitation data the correlation coefficients of the 3 sets of grid data show that there is a higher correlation coefficient between the mean of precipitation and tis than the maximum of precipitation for hysteresis this study calculates the lagging time l 0 1 0 11 which corresponds to the x coordinate month 1 2 12 it is obvious that there is a lag between different tis and precipitation for example as shown in fig 6 e the correlation coefficient between sst1 2 and monthly mean precipitation reaches its maximum 0 55 when the lag time is 1 month while sst3 reaches its maximum 0 43 when the lag time is 2 months in fig 6 a and c the lag time of sst1 2 is 2 months therefore the lag between different sources of precipitation data sets and different tis is different so it is necessary to carry out homologous calculation and analysis for specific data sets and indices figs 7 and 8 show the results of correlation coefficients between temperature and 19 tis fig 7 uses cpc grid daily temperature data of cpc and the temperature data in fig 8 is necp reanalysis temperature data comparing these two figures the correlation coefficient calculated from cpc temperature data is higher than that from necp reanalysis temperature data temperature results are different from precipitation it might attribute to the observed temperature data from hydrometeorological stations can be obtained more easily than the available precipitation data as the number of sites and the length of time series are different therefore cpc grid data is more robust than necp reanalysis data in the study on the characteristics of temperature in sa regarding the 19 tis the results are consistent with precipitation in figs 7 and 8 the most significant correlation is still the sst in the four niño regions in addition to the four regions other significant tis are amo iodw and nao sst in the four niño regions reflects the changes in the pacific ocean while amo and nao mainly reflect the abnormal changes in the atlantic ocean similar to the reasons that affect precipitation the abnormal shifts in these two areas directly affect the temperature in sa to some extent the anomaly of sst in the western indian ocean is relevant to the temperature of sa this is mainly because of the earth as a whole the anomalies of sst interact with the anomaly of the pacific and indian oceans through the atmospheric circulation especially walker circulation fernandes and rodrigues 2018 the results of this study show that there is a correlation between iodw and temperature in sa therefore in the future study about the forecast of temperature in sa the tis that can be considered include sst in four regions amo iodw and nao the temperature data are processed in different ways namely monthly maximum mean and minimum of tmax tmean tmin and trange the correlation coefficients results show that the monthly maximum temperature is less correlated to tis than the monthly mean and minimum temperature although the seasonal variation of trange in sa is obvious the correlation coefficient between trange and tis is not as significant as that of tmean and tmin in terms of the monthly mean of tmean the correlation coefficients between cpc and ncep temperature data sets and sst1 2 are 0 54 and 0 53 respectively meanwhile the correlation coefficients between tmin and cpc and ncep were 0 6 and 0 54 respectively from the perspective of sst1 2 the tmin of the monthly mean showed a stronger correlation than the tmean whereas when multiple tis are considered such as amo and iodw tmean performs better than tmin in the correlation coefficient results therefore in the following analysis of spatial correlation coefficients the results of cpc monthly mean of tmean are mainly retrieved even so in future research on temperature teleconnection in sa besides the mean temperature the minimum temperature can also be considered as one of the research contents the results of lag months show that there is a lag period between temperature and tis in sa which is different from the 1 2 months lag time of precipitation the lag time of tis for sa temperature is 2 3 months in fig 7 e when the lag time is 2 months the correlation coefficient 0 54 between sst1 2 and the monthly mean of tmean is the highest in short in the 19 tis they are sst in the 4 niño regions amo and nao that significantly correlate with the climate precipitation and temperature of sa iodw also has a significant correlation with the temperature of sa as for the selection of climate data sets necp reanalysis precipitation data is suggested and cpc grid temperature data is recommended in the study of teleconnection analysis in sa on the other hand an ensemble of the results from multiple data sets is encouraged sun et al 2018 in sa the teleconnection relationship of monthly mean precipitation is more significant than that of monthly extreme precipitation for temperature in addition to the monthly mean of tmean the monthly minimum value of tmean also has a significant correlation with tis the correlation between the climate in sa and tis is hysteretic with a lag duration of 1 2 months for precipitation and 2 3 months for temperature for example there is a lag between sst1 2 and the monthly mean of ncep reanalyzed precipitation with a 1 month lag time 3 2 spatial analysis as for the spatial correlation between precipitation and temperature in sa and tis combined with the above analysis this study selected several typical tis namely sst1 2 amo nao in order to present the dimensional results in the same resolution the cpc data sets are selected cpc monthly mean precipitation and cpc monthly mean of tmean to conduct spatial analysis are shown in figs 9 to 14 since in figs 5 7 the hysteresis has an obviously periodic with 6 months so the spatial correlation result only selects 6 months with the lagging time l 0 1 0 5 to display the spatial results 3 2 1 sst1 2 fig 9 shows the correlation coefficient and p value results between cpc reanalysis monthly mean precipitation data in sa and sst1 2 in the analysis above the lag period between precipitation and sst1 2 is 1 2 months which is also consistent with the spatial results in fig 9 i when the lag is 2 months most of sa 89 4 was significantly correlated with sst1 2 precipitation and sst1 2 in the orinoco plain the southern andes and southern patagonia show a significant negative correlation while the amazon basin and the brazilian plateau have a significant positive correlation fig 9 shows the correlation coefficient and p value between sst1 2 and the cpc gridded monthly mean of tmean according to fig 10 a e the temperature in sa has a significant correlation with sst1 2 when the lag period is 2 months as shown in fig 10 i except for a part of northeast sa where the temperature shows a negative correlation with sst1 2 the temperature in the rest of sa shows a significant positive correlation with sst1 2 especially in central and southern sa when sst1 2 anomaly rises usually correspond to ei niño years the deep cold water hardly supplies to the surface and the western trade wind is abated so when the walker circulation reaches the central pacific region the updraft formed a flip along latitude and the water vapor moves eastward in the sky and is brought into sa causing more rainfall in this region rainfall is often accompanied by an enhancement of warm airflow that is why the stability between warm advection and cold conditions related to precipitation produces relatively low amplitude temperature anomalies leading to regional temperature increases folland et al 1986 the north area of the equator is associated with the opposite effect resulting in reduced precipitation and lower temperatures in the northern sa the dry and cold weather in the northern area of the sa has led to a lack of irrigation water for agriculture the lack of water and the cold temperature has severely affected crop yields shrestha and wang 2020 yu et al 2020 thus affects the exports and economy of sa 3 2 2 amo the correlations between amo and climate variables in sa are presented in figs 11 and 12 contrast with fig 9 and 10 the sst1 2 in these two figures is substituted by amo similarly fig 11 is the spatial correlation result of precipitation and fig 12 is the correlation result of temperature different from sst1 2 there are more grids with p 0 05 in fig 11 more than half of sa has no significant relationship between precipitation and amo significant correlations were found in northwestern sa eastern brazil and southwestern patagonia the lag period of amo and precipitation is 1 month as shown in fig 11 h the proportion of significantly correlated grids p 0 05 is 34 7 the east of brazil has a negative correlation with amo while the rest areas like columbia and ecuador have a positive correlation the correlation coefficients between amo and temperature in sa are more significant than precipitation 53 2 63 1 of grids show a significant correlation when the lag period is 1 month the temperature in the amazon plain is significantly positively correlated with amo and the temperature in la plata plain is significantly negatively correlated with amo in fig 12 h as the intertropical convergence zone itcz moves northward when amo is abnormally warm bader and latif 2003 guo et al 2016 lu and delworth 2005 the monsoon rainfall in the basin decreases and the precipitation in eastern brazil declines so the precipitation in eastern brazil is negatively correlated with amo due to the intensification of the choco low water vapor was brought to middle and western colombia expanding precipitation of the area the process contributes to increased precipitation and streamflow in the atrato river matching with the findings of wang et al 2018 for the eastern part of brazil as rainfall decreases and temperatures rise the lack of irrigation water for economic crops such as coffee cocoa and sugar cane affects their production gomes et al 2020 high temperatures cause agricultural labor to be exposed to extreme temperatures and people may need more food to cope with hotter drier weather the reduction in economic crops export has caused brazil s gross domestic product gdp to decline camargo 2010 3 2 3 nao figs 13 and 14 show the correlation results between the nao and precipitation and temperature in sa the lag duration between nao and south american climate variables is different from the previous two tis when the lag period of nao is 5 months it is most significantly correlated with precipitation and temperature this is mainly because the region of nao is in the north atlantic and the pressure anomaly of nao affects itcz by affecting the sst and slp in the tropical region and thus affects the climate of sa so the lag period is longer than sst1 2 and amo in fig 13 l nao is negatively correlated with precipitation in sa especially in the plateau of brazil and the plain of la plata in fig 14 l the temperature in northeast brazil colombia and ecuador has no significant correlation with nao while the temperature in the rest of the region has a significant negative correlation with nao overall compared to the correlation coefficient results of sst1 2 and amo the correlation coefficient between nao and the climate of sa is not large whether it is 0 3 for precipitation or 0 2 for temperature therefore nao has a certain relationship with the climate of sa but overall it is not as large as the influence of the sst anomaly of the niño region and atlantic region on the climate of sa therefore from the perspective of space different tis have different correlations with climate variables among them sst1 2 is significantly correlated with precipitation and temperature in most regions of sa amo is significantly correlated most with temperatures but there are few regions significantly correlated with precipitation with a relatively lower correlation coefficient than sst1 2 nao is negatively correlated with precipitation and temperature in sa but the correlation coefficient is much smaller than that of sst1 2 and amo therefore when analyzing the spatial correlation of sa it is necessary to carry out corresponding calculations and analyses for specific tis 4 conclusions in this study the relationship between different tis and high resolution sa climate variables is systematically analyzed for the first attempt 19 tis and 3 sets of climate data sets from 1982 to 2016 of sa were collected and calculated through correlation coefficient calculation and results analysis the tis most significantly correlated with the climate of sa and the lag time of their impact on the climate of sa were obtained the main findings are as follows 1 it is true that the climate of sa is affected by tis among them the most significant teleconnection patterns are the sst in the pacific and the atlantic namely sst in the 4 niño regions and amo and the slp in the atlantic nao iodw also has a significant correlation with temperature in sa 2 the influence of tis on the climate of sa has a hysteresis the lag period for precipitation is 1 2 months and 2 3 months for temperature among them the lag time of sst1 2 nao and amo are 2 months 1 month and 5 months respectively 3 for 3 sets of climate data sets in sa precipitation data is suggested to be obtained from ncep reanalysis daily gridded data set and temperature data is proposed to acquire from cpc gridded data in the study of teleconnection however it is recommended to carry out ensemble analysis from multiple sets of data such as satellite data reanalysis data gauge based data sets to make the results of teleconnection research more robust 4 sst1 2 has a significant positive correlation between precipitation in the amazon plains and brazilian plateau while the precipitation shows a negative and temperature appears a positive correlation between sst1 2 in colombia and ecuador the dry and arid climate during ei niño phases in the northwest of sa would cause a shortage of water resources the lack of irrigation water leads to low yield crops precipitation is closely related to the surface water resources of sa it is meaningful to research the projection of high resolution climate variables in sa and screen out the corresponding tis however the climate of sa such as precipitation and temperature are affected by tis therefore in order to obtain an accurate prediction of climate variables in the future the relationship between tis and the climate of sa should be studied clearly more correlations such as non linear can be considered in further studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare

1349,oceanic heat anomalies affect climate in remote regions through the atmospheric cycle south america sa was the first region found associated with ei niño which affects the fishery agriculture forestry and livestock industry of sa as approximately 60 of the total water is used for agriculture climate changes in sa caused by ocean anomalies have led to the variability of available water especially for irrigation water where the precipitation is low and or the temperature is high the availability and quality of water resources are under pressure for instance droughts associated with la niña severely limited water supply and irrigation requirements between 25 s 40 s in west central argentina and central chile in order to study the relationship between ocean variability and the climate of sa 19 teleconnection indices ti related to ocean abnormity are considered the 19 indices are the sea surface temperature sst and their anomaly in 4 niño regions sst1 2 sst3 sst3 4 sst4

pacific north america pna atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo west and east of indian ocean dipole iodw iode and the difference between iodw and iode iodd high resolution gridded climate data 1982 2016 from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc the climate prediction center cpc and the national centers for environmental prediction ncep are applied for correlation analyses the results show that the 89 4 area of south american climate has a significant correlation with the sst in niño region 1 2 the mean correlation coefficient is 0 55 for ncep precipitation and 0 54 for cpc temperature the lag duration for the remote correlation is around 2 3 months it is the first attempt to analyze the correlation relationship based on 19 tis which can provide comprehensive insight into the climate of sa at a high resolution scale these findings are helpful for identifying the sensitive factors that affect climate in sa for projecting the climate variables of sa and for managing the irrigation water resources of sa keywords teleconnection precipitation south america sea surface temperature relationship 1 introduction the amazon parana plata and orinoco rivers collectively account for more than 30 of the freshwater in the atlantic ocean jackson et al 2001 however the spatial and temporal distribution of these water resources is uneven veiga and magrini 2013 when the precipitation declines and or temperature rises it puts pressure on available water and water quality mao et al 2020 paul et al 2019 from the perspective of statistics the drought related to el niño southern oscillation enso events has severely restricted water resources in many parts of sa bolaños et al 2021 moreover the economies of most south american countries such as brazil argentina mexico etc depend on agricultural productivity seo and mendelsohn 2008 regional variations in the amount of water and temperature are closely related to crop yields chaudhuri et al 2020 song et al 2021 the growth of temperature will shorten the life cycle of crops thus decrease the yields porter 2005 precipitation affects irrigation water consumption by influencing soil moisture surface flow and underground runoff tang et al 2007 jackson et al 2001 for instance the yield of wheat is uncertain through el niño and la niña periods in sonora mexico zavala and cota 2003 the growth cycle of cotton and mango on the northern coast of peru is shortened during el niño due to the increase in temperature caramanica et al 2020 additionally as precipitation and humidity accelerate during the ei niño phase there is an increase in the incidence of plant diseases for example cancrosis in argentine citrus canteros et al 2017 fusarium disease in brazilian and argentine wheat del ponte et al 2005 and several fungal diseases of peruvian corn potatoes wheat and beans rosenzweig and hillel 2008 so a more precise projection of precipitation and temperature of sa is desired for agriculture the precipitation and temperature of sa are found closely related to teleconnection patterns such as enso teleconnection patterns are the periodic large scale pattern and circulation anomalies that cross vast geographical areas through atmospheric circulation tedeschi et al 2013 pointed out sst anomalies in the pacific affect the precipitation over sa while temperature anomalies of sa were discovered relate to enso events llamedo et al 2017 therefore the study on the relationship between south american climate and teleconnection patterns is vital to the prediction of precipitation and temperature as well as to the water resources management of sa s agriculture the anomalous changes in the ocean and atmosphere such as enso affect the climate of remote regions through atmospheric circulation which is called teleconnection gershunov and barnett 1998 as early as the 19th century peruvian fishermen discovered that a warm current that occurs every few years along the east coast of the pacific ocean around christmas causing a large number of fish deaths and heavy losses for fishermen ros tonen and van boxel 1999 this phenomenon is known as el niño now some studies indicate that cai et al 2019 izumo et al 2010 kucharski et al 2015 kug and kang 2006 the interaction with the indian ocean and the atlantic ocean will also have feedback on the pacific ocean thus affecting the properties of enso likewise the values and trends of enso are influenced by the interaction between enso and other climate anomaly patterns garreaud et al 2020 ham et al 2013 such as indian ocean dipole iod saji et al 1999 and atlantic interdecadal variability amo levine et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to comprehensively consider multiple teleconnections factors when studying teleconnections previously mohammadi et al 2020 investigated the 4 tis nao enso amo pdo with precipitation patterns in peruvian the result shows that it is nao that correlates most with monthly rainfall and pdo influences the annual precipitation pattern more travasso et al 2003a found that it is the sst anomalies of the south atlantic associated with the diversification of crop yields in argentina most compared to other climate variabilities valtorta et al 2002 discovered that argentine heatwaves especially in the central area resulted in holando argentino cows produce less milk and the cattle hardly recovered from these events thoroughly in the past few decades the climate of sa has been influenced by enso events with an increase in extreme climate events like floods and droughts for example during 1999 and 2005 torrential precipitation occurred in venezuela garcía martínez and lópez 2005 rivas et al 2009 there were severe floods in pampas of argentina in 2000 and 2002 bilotto et al 2019 drought happened in amazon during 2005 and 2010 garcia et al 2018 heavy rainfall and humidity increasing caused by these extreme events have led to the monitoring of several fungal diseases in crops such as potatoes corns wheat and beans in peru seimon et al 2017 on the other hand there were still some positive effects of ei niño in the pampas region of argentina the enhancive precipitation led to increased crop yields by nearly 38 for beans 18 for corn 13 for wheat and 12 for sunflowers verón et al 2015 similarly ranching productivity rose by 7 in argentina travasso et al 2003b and uruguay rolla et al 2018 cai et al 2020 reviewed the correspondence between enso and the climate of sa systematically levine et al 2019 proposed and verified a conceptual hypothesis that sst affects soil moisture and co2 flux by influencing precipitation and temperature bruick et al 2019 focused the studies on the characteristics between enso and convection in subtropical of sa reboita et al 2021 compared the influence between the climate of sa and 8 teleconnection patterns such as enso amo and iod oñate valdivieso et al 2020 used oni as the enso index to study the relationship between drought of sa and large scale climate patterns while holmgren et al 2006 invested soi as the enso events index to carry out experiments about the growth rate of plants in semiarid sa vera et al 2018 described the seasonal cycle of precipitation of sa by the analysis of olr lupo et al 2017 emphasized that the pna and enso have an impact on the seasonal range prediction of sa however in the previous studies of teleconnection in sa the majority of research bruick et al 2019 cai et al 2020 levine et al 2019 focused on the effect between enso patterns and sa and few studies involved comprehensive tis in addition many studies andreoli and kayano 2005 valtorta et al 2002 zavala and cota 2003 attended on the abnormal events in a specific region and the length of data was short few of them analyzed the whole continent with decades of high resolution grid data therefore to fill the gap of previous studies the purpose of this research is to analyze the correlation between extensive teleconnection patterns and sa the detailed framework of this study is shown in fig 1 from fig 1 19 tis are considered and multiple grid climate data sets are adopted simultaneously among which gpcc and cpc data were high resolution data sets through correlation analysis lag period analysis and spatial analysis the main science problems will be addressed in this study are as follows 1 do precipitation and temperature in sa be affected by teleconnection patterns which tis influence climate in sa significantly 2 is there a lag in this influence how long is the lag duration 3 is there a difference among different grid point data gpcc cpc ncep reanalysis data about the correlation between tis and south american climate 4 which areas of sa are significantly correlated to tis these questions will be discussed in the following sections 2 data and method this study uses 19 tis from different teleconnection monitor centers in detail table 1 shows the 19 tis and their monitor center link the first 8 indices are the sst and their anomalies in 4 niño regions to monitor the enso phenomenon the near equatorial pacific has been divided into four regions trenberth 1997 as shown in fig 2 niño 1 2 region is from 0 to 10 s between 90 w and 80 w it is the least and the most eastern one of the 4 regions it is closest to sa where ei niño was first recognized by the local fishermen sst 1 2 and anom 1 2 have the largest variance in the 8 indices region niño 3 is the western and slightly northward of region 1 2 the latitude and longitude range is from 5 n to 5 s between 150 w 90 w it was the primary area to monitor and predict ei niño later on researchers trenberth 1997 found that the key region for the atmosphere and ocean interaction for enso is more westward so region niño 3 4 became the popular region for defining ei niño and la niño events niño 3 4 is a combination of part of niño 3 and niño 4 region from 5 n to 5 s between 170 w to 120 w which is filled with the shape of x the average sst across region niño 3 4 is widely used to define enso events for example if the mean of niño 3 4 sst exceeds 0 4 c of the average sst for a period of 6 months or longer then this is the ei niño event on the other hand if sst is under 0 4 c of the average sst for 6 months it is a la niña event de souza et al 2000 niño region 4 5 n 5 s 160 e to 150 w is the easternmost area among the 4 regions indices here

government bureau of meteorology monitors enso and iod indices the indian ocean is divided into two monitoring parts the iodw from 50 e to 70 e and from 10 s to 10 n and iode from 90 e to 110 e and from 10 s to 0 n in this study iodd is the difference of sst anomalies between iodw and iode the characteristic of the positive iod phase is that the sst in the east of the indian ocean is lower than the average temperature and sst of the tropical western indian ocean is higher than usual the minus iod period has the opposite characteristic among these 19 indices which one or multiple indices affect the climate over sa will be discussed in the following sections as for sa s climate this study uses two primary indices namely precipitation negrón juárez et al 2009 and temperature karimi et al 2020 to analyze their correlation with tis in this study 3 sets of data were downloaded namely the global precipitation climatology center gpcc precipitation the climate prediction center cpc precipitation and temperature and the national centers for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis precipitation and temperature data sets so there are 3 sets of precipitation and 2 sets of temperature data for gpcc precipitation data it is gauge based and with remote sensing combination gridded data menne et al 2012 this study downloads the full daily precipitation data v 2018 from 1982

popular reanalysis data sets in climate studies kalnay et al 1996 roberts et al 2019 so this study employed this reanalysis even though the resolution is lower than the first two sets the daily time series from 1948 to 2020 precipitation and temperature data were acquired from https psl noaa gov data gridded data ncep reanalysis html sa across the equator and most of the continent is in the southern hemisphere the latitude and longitude of sa are from 12 28ˊn to 53 54ˊs and 81 20ˊw to 34 46ˊw respectively most of sa has a tropical climate such as tropical rainforest desert and savanna climate characterized by heat and humidity in the meantime the south of sa 20 s 40 s has a subtropical monsoon climate and a temperate continental climate the andes have a plateau climate while the western of andes has a mediterranean and temperate marine climate zhang and yan 2014 the total amount of available freshwater resources is quite substantial but the uneven temporal and spatial distribution of water influences the quality and amount of water in different areas about 60 of sa s water is used for agricultural activities watson et al 1998 before conducting the correlation analysis this study briefly analyzed the seasonal precipitation and temperature to understand the sa climate fig 3 is the seasonal total precipitation over sa in fig 3 it is obvious that the overall precipitation exceeds 500 mm in the majority area of sa especially in djf and mam season the amazon basin has a 1000 mm total seasonal precipitation fig 4 shows the seasonal mean temperature over sa except for andes mountain and the southwest coast the seasonal mean temperature in sa is quite similar it is around 25 c to 30 c this is mainly because sa is located near the equator most of the area is between 10 n to 30 s with a typically tropical and subtropical climate rani et al 2021 in general the majority area of sa s climate is hot and humid the seasonal difference in mean temperature is not obvious in contrast the range of temperature shows an evident spatial variable over sa in fig 5 that is why the range of temperature is considered along with minimum mean and maximum temperature to analyze the correlation in the next section the seasonal temperature range is calculated from daily temperature data the daily temperature range was first computed daily maximum temperature minus daily minimum temperature then the seasonal mean of daily range was obtained and shown in fig 5 along with the andes the seasonal mean temperature range is higher than other areas which is over 12 5 c the brazilian plateau shows an evident larger range temperature during jja and son the andes and brazilian plateau have a high altitude so the range of temperature is greater than other areas of sa in this study the time series of sa s precipitation and temperature is from january 1982 to december 2016 mean and maximum monthly precipitation were calculated from gpcc cpc and ncep reanalysis daily time series data as shown in fig 1 the minimum mean and maximum of monthly min mean max and the range of temperature from were calculated cpc and necp reanalysis daily time series data respectively dong et al 2021 so the monthly length of precipitation and temperature is 420 from january 1982 to december 2016 the gridded precipitation and temperature variables over sa are noted as x x 1j x 2j x ij where i is the total amount of grids in sa j is the length of time series and equal to 420 here in order to analyze the lag time between tis and sa climate variables the time series of tis is from january 1981 to december 2016 the lag time l is assumed from 1 month to 12 months which means the delay time of teleconnection patterns would not affect sa s climate until l months the time series length of tis is corresponding to the climate variable which is 420 months 35 years tis are noted as t t 1 t 2 t j in this study pearson correlation coefficient r l is calculated in the following formula 1 r l n 1 j x mn x m t n l t n 1 j x mn x m 2 n 1 l j l t n l t 2 for every m 1 2 i and every l 0 1 2 where l is the lag period for example l 1 means the lag time is 1 month x is the mean of monthly climate variables with time series of n 1 2 j namely x 1 n n 1 j x n t is the mean of tis index with the time series n 1 l 2 l j l namely t 1 n l n 1 j t n l under the alternative hypothesis that there is a significant correlation between x and t ha ρ 0 and the null hypothesis is h0 ρ 0 li et al 2008 ma et al 2021 this study used t test to determine the significance between x and t the value of the t test is calculated as follows 2 t l r l n l 2 1 r l where r l is the correlation coefficient from eq 1 with the lag period of l months 3 results and discussion 3 1 correlation and lag period analysis a comparison of the correlation between the climate variables of sa and 19 tis is presented in figs 6 to 8 these 3 figures use the significantly correlated sc grids with p 0 05 to compute the absolute values of pearson s correlation coefficient and their mean value of all sc grids about the horizontal axis it is the lag period l since l begins with 0 so the first value of the x axis month 1 represents there is no lag time between tis and climate variables the second value month 2 means the lag duration is 1 month and so on no lag time l 0 month 1 means that the impact of tis on sa s climate occurs in the same month and 1 month lag duration means it takes 1 month for the effect of tis on the south american climate the result of the mean absolute correlation coefficient between precipitation and tis is shown in fig 6 for the 19 tis sst in 4 niño regions especially regions 1 2 and 3 significantly correlate to monthly mean and monthly extreme precipitation the mean absolute value of the correlation coefficient of sst 1 2 over sc grids is around 0 3 to 0 6 for teleconnection the mean correlation coefficient of the study area greater than 0 2 is acceptable siedlecki 2010 this is largely due to these two regions are the nearest area from the perspective of geographic location precipitation corresponding with the sst in niño region 1 2 and niño region 3 for example if sst in these two niño regions rises slp will increase and lead to a stronger walker circulation more water vapor evaporates into the atmosphere and is transported to sa under the influence of the westerlies which impact precipitation there except for 4 niño regions amo and nao have the largest correlation coefficient among the remaining 11 teleconnection patterns according to the correlation coefficient results the teleconnections with higher correlation coefficients are sst 2 sst 3 sst3 4 sst4 amo and nao the tis of the 4 niño regions mainly represent the temperature anomalies in the pacific while amo and nao mainly reflect the anomalies in the atlantic geographically sa lies on the east of the pacific and the west of the atlantic anomalies in these two oceans can affect the climate of sa more directly and quickly than other tis such as anomalies in the indian ocean where amo is the anomaly sst of atlantic and nao is the anomaly slp of north atlantic the correlation between amo and precipitation in sa is greater than that between nao and precipitation in sa because the spatial area of amo that reflects the differences of atlantic anomalies is large and its geographical location is closer to sa this is consistent with the pearson correlation coefficient results comparing the 3 sets of gridded precipitation data it is obvious that the ncep reanalyzed precipitation data shows the highest correlation coefficient with a monthly average correlation of 0 6 there is little difference between cpc and gpcc grid precipitation data and the correlation coefficient is about 0 5 cpc is slightly higher than gpcc this is largely due to gpcc and cpc are obtained from gauge based data while the observed precipitation data of south american sites are limited vera and silvestri 2009 and there may exist errors between the grid rainfall data sets obtained from sites and the actual precipitation li et al 2020 ncep reanalysis data is the initial field with a minimum error obtained by assimilation of various meteorological data based on a series of forecast models when observed data is missing or gridded data is needed reanalysis data is often used as observation data in climate studies sun et al 2018 according to the results the correlation coefficient between necp reanalysis precipitation data and tis such as sst1 2 amo nao etc in sa is better than that of gpcc and cpc precipitation data the correlation coefficients of the 3 sets of grid data show that there is a higher correlation coefficient between the mean of precipitation and tis than the maximum of precipitation for hysteresis this study calculates the lagging time l 0 1 0 11 which corresponds to the x coordinate month 1 2 12 it is obvious that there is a lag between different tis and precipitation for example as shown in fig 6 e the correlation coefficient between sst1 2 and monthly mean precipitation reaches its maximum 0 55 when the lag time is 1 month while sst3 reaches its maximum 0 43 when the lag time is 2 months in fig 6 a and c the lag time of sst1 2 is 2 months therefore the lag between different sources of precipitation data sets and different tis is different so it is necessary to carry out homologous calculation and analysis for specific data sets and indices figs 7 and 8 show the results of correlation coefficients between temperature and 19 tis fig 7 uses cpc grid daily temperature data of cpc and the temperature data in fig 8 is necp reanalysis temperature data comparing these two figures the correlation coefficient calculated from cpc temperature data is higher than that from necp reanalysis temperature data temperature results are different from precipitation it might attribute to the observed temperature data from hydrometeorological stations can be obtained more easily than the available precipitation data as the number of sites and the length of time series are different therefore cpc grid data is more robust than necp reanalysis data in the study on the characteristics of temperature in sa regarding the 19 tis the results are consistent with precipitation in figs 7 and 8 the most significant correlation is still the sst in the four niño regions in addition to the four regions other significant tis are amo iodw and nao sst in the four niño regions reflects the changes in the pacific ocean while amo and nao mainly reflect the abnormal changes in the atlantic ocean similar to the reasons that affect precipitation the abnormal shifts in these two areas directly affect the temperature in sa to some extent the anomaly of sst in the western indian ocean is relevant to the temperature of sa this is mainly because of the earth as a whole the anomalies of sst interact with the anomaly of the pacific and indian oceans through the atmospheric circulation especially walker circulation fernandes and rodrigues 2018 the results of this study show that there is a correlation between iodw and temperature in sa therefore in the future study about the forecast of temperature in sa the tis that can be considered include sst in four regions amo iodw and nao the temperature data are processed in different ways namely monthly maximum mean and minimum of tmax tmean tmin and trange the correlation coefficients results show that the monthly maximum temperature is less correlated to tis than the monthly mean and minimum temperature although the seasonal variation of trange in sa is obvious the correlation coefficient between trange and tis is not as significant as that of tmean and tmin in terms of the monthly mean of tmean the correlation coefficients between cpc and ncep temperature data sets and sst1 2 are 0 54 and 0 53 respectively meanwhile the correlation coefficients between tmin and cpc and ncep were 0 6 and 0 54 respectively from the perspective of sst1 2 the tmin of the monthly mean showed a stronger correlation than the tmean whereas when multiple tis are considered such as amo and iodw tmean performs better than tmin in the correlation coefficient results therefore in the following analysis of spatial correlation coefficients the results of cpc monthly mean of tmean are mainly retrieved even so in future research on temperature teleconnection in sa besides the mean temperature the minimum temperature can also be considered as one of the research contents the results of lag months show that there is a lag period between temperature and tis in sa which is different from the 1 2 months lag time of precipitation the lag time of tis for sa temperature is 2 3 months in fig 7 e when the lag time is 2 months the correlation coefficient 0 54 between sst1 2 and the monthly mean of tmean is the highest in short in the 19 tis they are sst in the 4 niño regions amo and nao that significantly correlate with the climate precipitation and temperature of sa iodw also has a significant correlation with the temperature of sa as for the selection of climate data sets necp reanalysis precipitation data is suggested and cpc grid temperature data is recommended in the study of teleconnection analysis in sa on the other hand an ensemble of the results from multiple data sets is encouraged sun et al 2018 in sa the teleconnection relationship of monthly mean precipitation is more significant than that of monthly extreme precipitation for temperature in addition to the monthly mean of tmean the monthly minimum value of tmean also has a significant correlation with tis the correlation between the climate in sa and tis is hysteretic with a lag duration of 1 2 months for precipitation and 2 3 months for temperature for example there is a lag between sst1 2 and the monthly mean of ncep reanalyzed precipitation with a 1 month lag time 3 2 spatial analysis as for the spatial correlation between precipitation and temperature in sa and tis combined with the above analysis this study selected several typical tis namely sst1 2 amo nao in order to present the dimensional results in the same resolution the cpc data sets are selected cpc monthly mean precipitation and cpc monthly mean of tmean to conduct spatial analysis are shown in figs 9 to 14 since in figs 5 7 the hysteresis has an obviously periodic with 6 months so the spatial correlation result only selects 6 months with the lagging time l 0 1 0 5 to display the spatial results 3 2 1 sst1 2 fig 9 shows the correlation coefficient and p value results between cpc reanalysis monthly mean precipitation data in sa and sst1 2 in the analysis above the lag period between precipitation and sst1 2 is 1 2 months which is also consistent with the spatial results in fig 9 i when the lag is 2 months most of sa 89 4 was significantly correlated with sst1 2 precipitation and sst1 2 in the orinoco plain the southern andes and southern patagonia show a significant negative correlation while the amazon basin and the brazilian plateau have a significant positive correlation fig 9 shows the correlation coefficient and p value between sst1 2 and the cpc gridded monthly mean of tmean according to fig 10 a e the temperature in sa has a significant correlation with sst1 2 when the lag period is 2 months as shown in fig 10 i except for a part of northeast sa where the temperature shows a negative correlation with sst1 2 the temperature in the rest of sa shows a significant positive correlation with sst1 2 especially in central and southern sa when sst1 2 anomaly rises usually correspond to ei niño years the deep cold water hardly supplies to the surface and the western trade wind is abated so when the walker circulation reaches the central pacific region the updraft formed a flip along latitude and the water vapor moves eastward in the sky and is brought into sa causing more rainfall in this region rainfall is often accompanied by an enhancement of warm airflow that is why the stability between warm advection and cold conditions related to precipitation produces relatively low amplitude temperature anomalies leading to regional temperature increases folland et al 1986 the north area of the equator is associated with the opposite effect resulting in reduced precipitation and lower temperatures in the northern sa the dry and cold weather in the northern area of the sa has led to a lack of irrigation water for agriculture the lack of water and the cold temperature has severely affected crop yields shrestha and wang 2020 yu et al 2020 thus affects the exports and economy of sa 3 2 2 amo the correlations between amo and climate variables in sa are presented in figs 11 and 12 contrast with fig 9 and 10 the sst1 2 in these two figures is substituted by amo similarly fig 11 is the spatial correlation result of precipitation and fig 12 is the correlation result of temperature different from sst1 2 there are more grids with p 0 05 in fig 11 more than half of sa has no significant relationship between precipitation and amo significant correlations were found in northwestern sa eastern brazil and southwestern patagonia the lag period of amo and precipitation is 1 month as shown in fig 11 h the proportion of significantly correlated grids p 0 05 is 34 7 the east of brazil has a negative correlation with amo while the rest areas like columbia and ecuador have a positive correlation the correlation coefficients between amo and temperature in sa are more significant than precipitation 53 2 63 1 of grids show a significant correlation when the lag period is 1 month the temperature in the amazon plain is significantly positively correlated with amo and the temperature in la plata plain is significantly negatively correlated with amo in fig 12 h as the intertropical convergence zone itcz moves northward when amo is abnormally warm bader and latif 2003 guo et al 2016 lu and delworth 2005 the monsoon rainfall in the basin decreases and the precipitation in eastern brazil declines so the precipitation in eastern brazil is negatively correlated with amo due to the intensification of the choco low water vapor was brought to middle and western colombia expanding precipitation of the area the process contributes to increased precipitation and streamflow in the atrato river matching with the findings of wang et al 2018 for the eastern part of brazil as rainfall decreases and temperatures rise the lack of irrigation water for economic crops such as coffee cocoa and sugar cane affects their production gomes et al 2020 high temperatures cause agricultural labor to be exposed to extreme temperatures and people may need more food to cope with hotter drier weather the reduction in economic crops export has caused brazil s gross domestic product gdp to decline camargo 2010 3 2 3 nao figs 13 and 14 show the correlation results between the nao and precipitation and temperature in sa the lag duration between nao and south american climate variables is different from the previous two tis when the lag period of nao is 5 months it is most significantly correlated with precipitation and temperature this is mainly because the region of nao is in the north atlantic and the pressure anomaly of nao affects itcz by affecting the sst and slp in the tropical region and thus affects the climate of sa so the lag period is longer than sst1 2 and amo in fig 13 l nao is negatively correlated with precipitation in sa especially in the plateau of brazil and the plain of la plata in fig 14 l the temperature in northeast brazil colombia and ecuador has no significant correlation with nao while the temperature in the rest of the region has a significant negative correlation with nao overall compared to the correlation coefficient results of sst1 2 and amo the correlation coefficient between nao and the climate of sa is not large whether it is 0 3 for precipitation or 0 2 for temperature therefore nao has a certain relationship with the climate of sa but overall it is not as large as the influence of the sst anomaly of the niño region and atlantic region on the climate of sa therefore from the perspective of space different tis have different correlations with climate variables among them sst1 2 is significantly correlated with precipitation and temperature in most regions of sa amo is significantly correlated most with temperatures but there are few regions significantly correlated with precipitation with a relatively lower correlation coefficient than sst1 2 nao is negatively correlated with precipitation and temperature in sa but the correlation coefficient is much smaller than that of sst1 2 and amo therefore when analyzing the spatial correlation of sa it is necessary to carry out corresponding calculations and analyses for specific tis 4 conclusions in this study the relationship between different tis and high resolution sa climate variables is systematically analyzed for the first attempt 19 tis and 3 sets of climate data sets from 1982 to 2016 of sa were collected and calculated through correlation coefficient calculation and results analysis the tis most significantly correlated with the climate of sa and the lag time of their impact on the climate of sa were obtained the main findings are as follows 1 it is true that the climate of sa is affected by tis among them the most significant teleconnection patterns are the sst in the pacific and the atlantic namely sst in the 4 niño regions and amo and the slp in the atlantic nao iodw also has a significant correlation with temperature in sa 2 the influence of tis on the climate of sa has a hysteresis the lag period for precipitation is 1 2 months and 2 3 months for temperature among them the lag time of sst1 2 nao and amo are 2 months 1 month and 5 months respectively 3 for 3 sets of climate data sets in sa precipitation data is suggested to be obtained from ncep reanalysis daily gridded data set and temperature data is proposed to acquire from cpc gridded data in the study of teleconnection however it is recommended to carry out ensemble analysis from multiple sets of data such as satellite data reanalysis data gauge based data sets to make the results of teleconnection research more robust 4 sst1 2 has a significant positive correlation between precipitation in the amazon plains and brazilian plateau while the precipitation shows a negative and temperature appears a positive correlation between sst1 2 in colombia and ecuador the dry and arid climate during ei niño phases in the northwest of sa would cause a shortage of water resources the lack of irrigation water leads to low yield crops precipitation is closely related to the surface water resources of sa it is meaningful to research the projection of high resolution climate variables in sa and screen out the corresponding tis however the climate of sa such as precipitation and temperature are affected by tis therefore in order to obtain an accurate prediction of climate variables in the future the relationship between tis and the climate of sa should be studied clearly more correlations such as non linear can be considered in further studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare
