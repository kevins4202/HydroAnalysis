16840,a complete plastic particle mass balance was established at sweden s second largest wastewater treatment plant it comprised material collected at its two bar screens a 20 mm and a 2 mm one in the influent water after the 20 mm screen the effluent water and the digested sludge macro and microplastics above 500 µm were analysed individually applying atr ftir while microplastics of 10 500 µm were analysed by µftir imaging with automated particle recognition masses of plastics 500 µm were determined by weighting while the mass of the smaller microplastics was estimated from the imaging the total plastic load on the plant was 202 2 kg d 1 of which the two screens retained 73 the remaining plastic mass was found in the sludge 13 6 and the effluent 0 4 the missing 12 7 could be caused by sampling and measuring uncertainties and potentially also fragmentation below the size detection limit of the analytical approach or by degradation the bar screens furthermore retained plastics smaller than the screen size indicating that this material should be taken into account also when solely looking at smaller particles the overall treatment efficiency of the plant was high 99 6 considering both macro and microplastics and 98 8 considering only microplastics 500 µm keywords wastewater treatment plant microplastic macroplastic plastics screening mass balance 1 introduction plastics have become an integrate part of human life due to their versatile applicability and excellent longevity the downside is that improper waste management has resulted in the accumulation of plastic pollution in the environment barnes et al 2009 derraik 2002 once present in the environment plastic debris is subject to environmental factors such as sunlight and mechanical stress which cause fragmentation into smaller pieces termed microplastics mp commonly defined as items smaller than 5 mm in their longest dimension arthur et al 2009 from there mp can get ingested by aquatic organisms cole et al 2013 derraik 2002 windsor et al 2019 upon which the mp itself or additives and absorbed pollutants within it might cause adverse effects on the organisms andrady 2011 browne et al 2013 zhang and chen 2020 in developed countries liquid waste from households institutions and industries is usually collected by sewer systems mp is present in the dry weather sewage e g due to primary mp added to cosmetics and personal care products carr et al 2016 and secondary mp released from breakdown of synthetic clothing during washing browne et al 2011 urban stormwater runoff is also conveyed in sewers either combined with the dry weather sewage or separately this water contains mp from atmospheric deposition traffic and weathering of plastic materials and enters the sewers during wet weather liu et al 2019a 2019c olesen et al 2019 the ubiquitous presence of mp in urban dry and wet weather runoff entails further research into possible sources and sinks in this context the fluxes of mp from wastewater treatment plants wwtps have received considerable attention liu et al 2020 mintenig et al 2017 simon et al 2018 most studies have investigated the presence of mp in inlet and effluent wastewater to assess the potential release of mp to the receiving environment indeed several studies have reported elevated concentrations of mp downstream of wwtps estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 habib et al 1998 magnusson and norén 2014 mccormick et al 2014 once mp have been through the wwtp there is a risk of them having been colonized by pathogens residing in the wastewater and so mp might become a vector for their spreading mccormick et al 2014 additionally some studies have investigated mp in sewage sludge carr et al 2016 ljung et al 2018 and found it to be a significant sink for mp in wwtps although studies show that the vast majority of mp is removed from the wastewater during treatment the sheer volume of treated wastewater has been argued to result in a significant discharge of mp to the aquatic environment ziajahromi et al 2016 early studies have primarily focused on enumeration and description by employing visual identification by stereo microscopy based on physical characterization of type morphology and colour andrady 2011 derraik 2002 this method however can be prone to bias relatively low magnification poor contrast e g when a particle has a colour similar to the background operator dependency and difficulty in distinguishing between natural fibres such as cotton and synthetic fibres make mp identification difficult sun et al 2019 it has been suggested to use a set of standardized criteria to improve characterization and avoid misidentification however even when these are used during visual sorting of suspected plastic particles plastics the risk for misidentification might still be as high as 70 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 and no chemical information necessary for identifying the type of polymers is obtained xu et al 2019 hence identification of visually sorted particles should always be accompanied by chemical analysis hidalgo ruz et al 2012 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and raman spectroscopy have been highlighted as the most prominent technologies for acquiring information on the chemical structure of particles the chemical fingerprint of unidentified particles obtained by these vibrational spectroscopic methods is commonly referenced to a library of spectra of known materials to identify them vianello et al 2013a a common practise is to perform visual inspection and separation of suspected mp followed by confirmation by atr ftir or raman spectroscopy bayo et al 2020 conley et al 2019 magni et al 2019 ziajahromi et al 2021 while particles 500 µm can readily be handled manually and thus analysed as single particles using these techniques this method becomes increasingly less feasible when particle size decreases methods for analysing mp 500 µm using focal plane array fpa ftir have been developed löder et al 2015 and improved upon to include mass estimation simon et al 2018 while the size and abundance of mp are of importance for the ingestion and biological impacts of mp cole et al 2013 prata et al 2020 these parameters are inadequate to describe the mp load from various sources this owes partly to the continuous fragmentation of mp decreasing their size while increasing abundance by using mass as a conserved base quantity measurements become independent of the change in apparent abundance several studies have hence suggested to report mp in terms of particle number size mass and polymer types in order to ensure comparability of results and their versatile application simon et al 2018 this study seeks to expand the knowledge on the dynamics of plastics inside wwtps by expanding the upper size limit of analysis and applying a mass balance approach for investigating their occurrence and fate to this end samples of bar screen material inlet wastewater digested sludge and effluent from a swedish wwtp were analysed for their content of plastics by fpa µftir imaging for mp of 10 500 µm and atr ftir for particles 500 µm 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and description of wwtp ryaverket is one of the largest wwtps in sweden handling wastewater from approximately 790 000 inhabitants as well as industries in the greater gothenburg area around 369 000 m3 of treated wastewater is discharged daily through göta älv into the kattegat sea the wwtp utilizes bar screens sand and grease traps primary settling activated sludge secondary settling nitrifying trickling filters and nitrifying moving bed biofilm reactors followed by post denitrification and finally tertiary mechanical filtration through disc filters hydrotech hsf2220 2fn with a mesh size of 15 µm in this wwtp fat oil and grease from the grease traps is skimmed and fed to the anaerobic digester together with fatty slurries from external sources tumlin and bertholds 2020 a full overview of the internal waste streams is found in figure s1 to investigate the fluxes of plastics to and from the wwtp five different samples were taken material from coarse 20 mm and fine 2 mm bar screens influent wastewater after the 20 mm screen digested sludge and effluent fatty slurries from external sources were not sampled sampling took place through april september 2018 exact dates are in supplementary material table s1 influent dry weather wastewater was sampled flow proportionally over 24 h using an isco 6700 portable sampler each day 5 l was sampled and stored in 1 l aluminium bottles on the same days bulk samples of material from bar screens and digested sludge were sampled and stored in glass jars two effluent samples were collected on the third day of the sampling campaign by continuously filtering from the effluent over the cause of a work day using a custom made filtration device filtering onto 10 µm stainless steel figure s2 the pump used contained no plastic or painted parts further details on the setup are found in liu et al 2019b in total three filters were used for each sample a flowmeter on the discharge line quantified the amount of filtered water which in both cases were 550 l for practical reasons it was not possible to completely avoid the use of plastic during sampling the autosampler used for sampling inlet wastewater contained teflon polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe tubes a polyvinylchloride pvc hose was needed to connect the custom filtration device to the effluent sampling point at the wastewater treatment plant equipment used for sampling bar screen material and sludge were metal while all sample containers were either glass or metal based on previous experience any potential contamination from these sources is expected to be minimal and were not further assessed liu et al 2020 2019c 2 2 sample preparation two litres of each influent wastewater sample were used for the identification of mp down to 10 µm to reduce the volume samples were filtered on a ø47 mm stainless steel filter with a 10 µm mesh and transferred into a 50 g l 1 sodium dodecyl sulphate sds solution by ultrasonication poornejad et al 2016 a glass covered magnetic stir bar was added and the samples were moderately stirred while heated to 50 c in a water bath for 48 h next a two step enzymatic digestion was applied to degrade proteinaceous and cellulosic material cole et al 2014 löder et al 2017 first proteinaceous material was degraded using 1 ml of alcalase 2 4 l fg novozymes bagsværd denmark in a 0 2 m tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane buffer solution at ph 8 2 while being stirred and incubated at 50 c for 48 h afterwards the buffer solution was replaced with an acetate buffer at ph 4 8 while 0 5 ml cellulase enzyme blend and 0 5 ml viscozyme l merck kgaa darmstadt germany were added and incubated at 50 c for another 48 h subsequently the samples were subjected to iron catalysed oxidation with hydrogen peroxide fenton reaction to further remove organic matter first the samples were transferred into 200 ml milli q water followed by 145 ml 50 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 while the source of iron ii was 62 ml 0 1 m iron sulphate feso4 the efficiency of the fenton reaction is highly dependent on temperature and ph bautista et al 2007 tagg et al 2017 therefore 0 1 m sodium hydroxide naoh was used to adjust the ph to 3 while the temperature was kept around 20 c by cooling the beaker with ice finally dense inorganic particles e g sand were removed through density separation using a zncl2 solution ρ 1 7 g cm 3 in 100 ml separator funnels imhof et al 2012 hereafter the samples were split into two size fractions by wet sieving with 15 g l 1 sds solution through a sieve with mesh sizes of 500 µm the particles in the filtrate were collected on a 10 µm steel filter and transferred into 50 v v ethanol by ultrasonication finally the ethanol water was completely evaporated into headspace vials using n2 before the volume was adjusted with 50 v v ethanol to 5 ml of particle concentrate to have enough particles for a representative analysis of microplastics above 500 µm the remaining 3 l of influent wastewater were wet sieved over a 500 µm sieve then the particles were oxidized with 10 h2o2 for 24 hours and dried at 55 c the effluent samples were transferred from the filters into 50 g l 1 sds solution by ultrasonication and subsequently followed the protocol described for wastewater samples likewise a 20 g subsample of digested sludge was extracted from a larger sample of approx 1 l upon mixing it thoroughly pre oxidized in 10 h2o2 for 24 hours upon which it followed the same protocol as the wastewater samples beforehand the water content of the digested sludge was determined with a mettler toledo moisture analyzer he73 2 2 1 bar screen material a subsample of approximately 100 g from each sample was dried to examine the water content then the coarse particles were sterilized and cleaned by oxidation with 10 h2o2 finally the samples were again dried and all particles which potentially might be of plastic were manually sorted out under a stereo microscope the sorted particles were further cleaned with ethanol prior to analysis the size cut off for the bar screen materials was 2 mm as coarse particles are retained on the bar screens a filter cake builds up which could result in a reduction in the effective size of the screening to investigate whether a significant amount of smaller particles were caught on the 2 mm bar screens the amount of particles 2 mm in these samples was quantified a subsample of 100 g bar screen material was dried and weighed afterwards the particles were dispersed in 10 g l 1 sds solution and mixed on a shaking table for 1 h finally the samples were wet sieved over a cascade of sieves ranging from 2 mm down to 20 µm the sieves were dried and weighed before and after sieving to quantify the mass of smaller particles the total mass of particles smaller than 2 mm on the bar screens was a few percent and it was hence deemed sufficient to estimate the amount of microplastics below 2 mm in the bar screen material assuming a similar fraction of plastics in the small particles as was found for the fraction above 2 mm 2 3 spectroscopic analysis in preparation for the spectroscopic analysis of the smaller size fraction 10 500 µm a subsample of particle concentrate was deposited onto an infrared transparent ø13 2 mm zinc selenide window held in a compression cell pike technologies which left an effective opening of ø10 mm the particle concentrate was homogenized by vortexing and a subsample extracted with a glass capillary micropipette added to the window and dried on a heating plate at 50 c subsamples were added repeatedly in small steps of 50 µl until the window was sufficiently covered by particles hereby avoiding particle agglomeration and overloading of the window this process was repeated until the window was sufficiently covered by particles in this way 4 12 of the sample concentrates were deposited per window three separate windows with subsamples were prepared per analysed sample to account for heterogeneity during subsampling the windows were analysed by µftir imaging using a cary 670 ftir spectrometer agilent technologies santa clara ca usa combined with a cary 620 ftir microscope equipped with a 15x cassegrain objective and a mercury cadmium telluride mct detector with a 128 128 focal plane array fpa yielding a 5 5 µm pixel resolution the samples were analysed in transmission mode applying a spectral range of 3750 850 cm 1 at 8 cm 1 spectral resolution with 30 co added scans the background was created by 120 co added scans after depositing the sub samples the whole effective area of the window 10 10 mm was scanned creating approximately 3 2 million spectra per scan which then were processed using the simple software formerly mphunter developed at aalborg university aalborg denmark in association with alfred wegner institute helgoland germany primpke et al 2020 each spectrum from the scan was correlated to more than 100 spectra of polymers and natural materials from a reference library the 1st thresholds the ones identifying if there is a microplastic particle see liu et al 2019a were varied to minimize the number of false positive and false negative identification based on an expert evaluation of the goodness of the spectra comparison the 2nd thresholds the ones deciding the size of a microplastic particle were varied and the particle size compared to a visual image of the scanned surface to optimize the size estimate the evaluation was done on a subset of the automatically detected particles liu et al 2019a primpke et al 2017 masses were estimated from the 2 dimensional images based on material density and an estimated thickness as described in simon et al 2018 all sorted out particles from the bar screen samples and particles 500 µm from wastewater and sludge samples were first photographed and then analysed using a cary 630 atr ftir spectrometer interpretation of the infrared spectra was done using software ominc 8 3 thermo fisher scientific inc ma usa in combination with commercial spectra libraries containing a wide variety of synthetic and natural materials vianello et al 2013b the masses of these particles were measured on an analytical balance mettler toledo xse205 d 0 01 mg 2 4 mitigation and assessment of contamination several precautions were taken to avoid contamination of the sample prior to analysis during sampling cotton work suits were worn to reduce contamination with fibres from synthetic materials cotton lab coats were likewise worn during sample preparation in the laboratory glassware and other equipment were flushed thrice with filtered 0 7 µm glass fibre water nuelle et al 2014 while the steel filters were muffled before use simon et al 2018 additionally the lab space was cleaned prior to sample preparation and the use of plastic equipment limited finally air born contamination was minimized by keeping beakers with samples covered with aluminium foil or glass watches during transfer in the lab and by conducting the sample preparation inside fume hoods all reagents were filtered through 0 7 µm glass fibre filters before use despite thorough care complete avoidance of contamination is seldom possible consequently triplicate laboratory blanks following the preparation protocol for wastewater and sludge six in total were prepared and analysed along with the respective samples filtered 0 7 µm gf filter milli q water was used as a medium for blank samples a similar volume of sub sample from the blanks were analysed as were for their respective samples the procedural blanks assess the contamination during sample preparation and analysis and the determined contamination hence refers to one sample preparation and not to the volume of filtered water processed possible contamination during sampling was not assessed 2 5 statistical analysis the normality of the size distribution of mp particles was assessed using shapiro wilk normality test a non parametric kruskal wallis test was performed to investigate whether there was significant difference in the size distribution between the influent wastewater and the other samples wilcoxon rank sum test was performed to assess differences in the mean of these samples a significance level of p 0 05 was applied for all statistical analysis using the software r v3 5 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 contamination analysis of 300 µl aliquots of the triplicate laboratory blanks for the wastewater protocol revealed a contamination by 13 mp particles this corresponded to a contamination of 83 9 ng or 4 33 items per processed sample four polymer types were identified pe pp polyester and ps with polyester accounting for 69 of the contamination by number and 77 by mass in the blanks following the sludge protocol the contamination was even lower seven mp particles were identified in triplicate deposits of 200 µl corresponding to 20 3 ng or 2 33 items per blank of the seven particles identified six were of polyester and one was of pa the contamination is expected to arise from occasional exposure to open air during sample preparation and not from the filtered milli q used as matrix for the blanks considering the mass of mp identified in the blanks for the wastewater protocol in relation to the real wastewater samples the possible contamination corresponds to just 1 20 of the average mass of mp found in similar sample aliquots the blanks from the sludge protocol contained just 0 04 of the average mp mass from the sludge samples due to a much greater amount of mp identified in these samples a study on another wwtp by mintenig et al 2017 reported contamination levels of 21 particles and 130 fibres in procedural blanks consisting of 150 l filtered 3 µm stainless steel filter tap water treated subsequent to samples of treated wastewater simon et al 2018 reported finding 2110 mp corresponding to 84 µg in triplicates of 1 l filtered demineralized water processed in parallel with samples of raw wastewater more recently liu et al 2019 found mp corresponding to 22 2 items with an estimated mass of 942 ng in triplicates of 100 l of filtered 1 2 µm glass fibre filter milli q water alongside stormwater samples following an protocol similar to the present one in the case of mintenig et al 2017 and simon et al 2018 reported mp concentrations were corrected by subtracting possible contamination or used as detection limit while liu et al 2019 did not correct the results due to the low levels of contamination detected the levels of contamination found in the present study were low compared to the amount of particles found in the samples on average corresponding to 1 2 and 0 04 of the plastics found in raw wastewater and sludge respectively therefore the results were not corrected for background contamination arising from the sample preparation 3 2 mass balance for plastics at ryaverket wastewater treatment plant in total 14 samples of six different kinds were analysed for their plastic content revealing a total of 3 909 plastic particles plastics ranked in order of abundance 2 455 were found in digested sludge 719 in effluent 576 in raw influent wastewater and 159 in bar screen material to establish the mass balance for plastics at the wwtp the concentration of plastics in each sample was multiplied by the respective flow of the liquid or mass streams during the period of sampling the range of the concentration in each kind of sample and corresponding flows is presented in table 1 details on individual values of plastic concentration and flow for each sample can be found in table s1 the overall mass balance was calculated using the average of the three independent samples two in the case of effluent samples and the average flow on the day of sampling fig 1 shows the mass balance for plastics at the wastewater treatment plant it shows that 201 2 kg of plastics entered the treatment plant daily while 0 7 kg was released through the effluent this corresponds to a removal efficiency of 99 6 the primary removal of plastics from the wastewater happened via the 20 mm and 2 mm bar screens with 38 2 and 35 2 respectively finally 13 6 of the plastics were recovered in the sludge fraction these measurements account for 87 3 of the load to the wastewater treatment plant the missing 12 7 of the plastic mass balance are expected to arise from sampling and measuring uncertainties and potentially by plastics loss in the digester and the activated sludge process tanks the latter can either be chemical biological degradation or simply a fragmentation below the size detection limit of the applied analytical technique there is a great variability of the daily wastewater flow where factors such as time of sampling and the weather can have a significant influence therefore it is important to report specifics about the time of sampling and antecedent weather patterns furthermore the digested sludge represents an average over several weeks due to the retention time in the digester these issues become of increasing importance when mp concentrations identified in small bulk samples are scaled to yearly discharges some of these uncertainties are evident when looking at variation in the plastic concentration in samples presented in table 1 no other studies have dealt specifically with the retention of mp in material from bar screens likely because the size extends beyond what is considered mp this study found that due to the build up of a filter cake retention of small particles can be expected and indeed 2 4 to 4 5 of the dry mass of 2 mm bar screen material consisted of particles below the actual size of the screens assuming a similar fraction of plastics in the small particles as was found for the fraction above 2 mm the removal of mp with 2 mm bar screen material was 2 6 kg d 1 corresponding to 4 6 of mp 2 mm of what was identified in the influent wastewater samples these findings highlight that bar screen material should be considered in future research dealing with the mass balance at wastewater treatment plants utilizing this technology even when targeting the mp 5 mm however as this study investigates the total mass balance of plastics in the wwtp this fraction only accounted for 1 3 of all the incoming plastics this indicates that the potential error from not directly measuring the content of small mp in the filter cake was small compared to the overall uncertainties considering only the small fraction of mp 500 µm the removal through sludge was 65 8 of the inlet mass highlighting this as a key process in the removal of small mp previous studies have reported comparable mp removal of 72 98 through sludge leslie et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017b it is estimated that 11 6 of the small mp were retained in the filter cake on the 2 mm bar screens finally the effluent samples contained mp corresponding to 1 2 giving a removal efficiency for mp 500 µm of 98 8 which falls in line with other studies reporting overall mp removal efficiencies of wwtps above 98 carr et al 2016 magnusson and norén 2014 murphy et al 2016 simon et al 2018 talvitie et al 2017a the 21 4 unaccounted for are most likely related to the previously explained analytical uncertainties in terms of numbers the average concentration of plastics in raw wastewater was 533 items l 1 in influent wastewater while the final effluent contained 4 items l 1 the highest concentration in terms of numbers were found in the sludge with 1 401 items g 1 dry weight dw in material from the 20 mm and 2 mm bar screens the concentrations were 0 20 and 0 28 items g 1 respectively the issues of reporting a concentration in terms of number are especially apparent when comparing the concentration of plastics found in bar screen materials despite a low number of plastics identified in these samples the contribution in terms of mass was much greater than in e g digested sludge due to the novelty of this research topic direct comparison with other studies can be difficult substantial differences in sampling methods sampled volumes sample preparation higher or lower size cut off and analytical techniques for mp identification have been applied in previous studies to better compare studies there is a need for standardization in the field as highlighted by e g hidalgo ruz et al 2012 and ziajahromi et al 2016 these issues are apparent when comparing reports on the concentration of mp in wwtps in a recent review on the occurrence and fate of mp in wastewater treatment plants gatidou et al 2019 reported influent concentrations varying from 1 7 216 particles l 1 likewise to the present study talvitie et al 2017 applied 24 hour flow proportional composite sampling and identified a similar concentration of mp of 630 900 items l 1 in influent samples although using a different sample preparation and analysis approach simon et al 2018 used a similar sample preparation and nearly identical analysis methods but reported much higher concentrations of mp between 2 223 18 285 particles l 1 in influent samples from ten danish wwtps similar variation is apparent when considering the mp concentration reported in effluent and sludge in this study the concentration of mp in the sludge samples was up to three orders of magnitude higher than those previously reported gatidou et al 2019 it seems unlikely that this difference is due to true variability in plastic contents of different wwtp sludge and more likely due to differences in analytical approaches the potential for the release of plastics to the environment from ryaverket wwtp can be estimated based on the mass balance considering the annual effluent flow an estimated 263 42 kg of mp y 1 is released into the environment through the outlet corresponding to a per capita release of 0 33 0 03 g capita 1 y 1 another potential pathway for the spreading of mp to the environment is the fertilization of agricultural fields with sewage sludge browne et al 2013 zubris and richards 2005 in sweden 34 of the sewage sludge was spread on agricultural fields in 2016 naturvårdsverket 2018 based on the mass balance established in this study a total of 3 372 1 530 kg of mp could hence annually be released to the terrestrial environment however in a study on the impact of using different amounts of sewage sludge as fertilization of a series of test fields in petersborg malmö ljung et al 2018 found the concentration to be 3 to 10 times lower than what it theoretically should be assuming that plastics could not break down in nature therefore more research is needed to understand the true impact of using sewages sludge for fertilization furthermore other potential sources for mp in agricultural fields such as littering and mulching should also be accounted for finally the flow of plastics with the bar screen material was 50 tons y 1 however as this material is incinerated the potential for release into the environment would only be through spills during transport to the incineration plant which is unlikely to happen at a meaningful scale 3 3 size distribution of plastics a boxplot of the size of identified plastics is presented in fig 2 a together with the d10 d50 and d90 for each sample type in fig 2b particle size distributions can be found in supplementary material figure s3 the size of the mp particles was defined by their major feret diameter determined by simple for mp 500 µm and manual measurement of the major dimension in imagej for plastics 500 µm a shapiro wilk normality test revealed that the size of the plastics was non normal distributed in all samples consequently a non parametric kruskal wallis test was used to compare the size distribution of plastics in the inlet with other sample types results of which are also shown in fig 2a the test revealed a significant p 0 05 difference in the size distribution of influent bar screen and sludge samples but an insignificant p 0 05 difference between influent and effluent samples a pairwise wilcoxon rank sum test showed that the mean size of plastics in the sludge was significantly larger than the ones in the influent and effluent while plastics in the bar screen material were significantly larger than the plastics in other matrices the large plastic particles on the screens originate from the wastewater the fact that large particles were not also found in the inlet wastewater is likely an artefact of the sampling as the concentration of large particles is low and the probability of finding one in the small volumes of inlet wastewater collected hence also low no significant difference between plastics in coarse and fine bar screen material was found it is furthermore worth noticing that plastics fitting the definition of mp 5 mm were identified in the 20 mm bar screen material again highlighting that these screening processes should not be overlooked in studies of mp at wwtps an example of identified plastics is shown in figure s4 one likely reason for the difference between the size of plastics in influent wastewater and sludge could be that the large mp are rare in wastewater compared to smaller ones talvitie et al 2017b although 24 hour flow proportional sampling ensures a degree of representability for the day of sampling the position of the intake of the autosampler could influence the size distribution as larger particles have a greater tendency to either sink or float these particles would however still be present in the wastewater reaching the treatment plant and end up in the sludge fraction during treatment furthermore while a wastewater sample represents a temporal span of one day the solid retention time during anaerobic digestion is several weeks meaning that the presence of mp particles with an extreme size is more likely to occur this is evident when looking at fig 2b where the sludge samples show not only a higher d90 value but also a greater spread than influent and effluent samples although the wastewater treatment plant applied disc filtration with a mesh size of 15 µm larger mp were identified in the effluent in a study of the disc filters at ryaverket wilén et al 2012 reported similar findings and attributed this to particles having non spherical shapes the characteristic was confirmed for mp by liu et al 2019b who reported the shape of mp identified in stormwater ponds as plump ellipsoids having a major to minor dimension ratio of 1 9 simon et al 2019 studied the removal of mp by a disc filter and likewise reported some particles in the effluent having larger dimensions than the filter mesh they contributed these findings to possible defects in the filter cloth due to mechanical stresses or unintended bypassing of wastewater in a study applying a similar methodology simon et al 2018 reported the median size of mp to be 48 µm with a d90 of 100 µm for raw wastewater and a median of 45 µm with a d90 of 91 µm for treated wastewater in a study on the retention of mp by disc filters with a 18 µm mesh simon et al 2019 found a median of 33 5 µm before and 47 9 µm after disc filtration these figures are slightly below what was found for raw and treated wastewater in this study other studies reported mp size as abundance in certain size ranges mintenig et al 2017 found 59 2 of mp identified in treated wastewater in the size range 50 100 µm making this the most abundant size fraction with only 8 5 of identified mp particles being above 200 µm applying similar ranges the abundance of mp within the size range 50 100 µm were 36 0 36 3 and 38 8 in wastewater sludge and effluent while the amount 200 µm in those samples were 5 9 9 3 and 6 7 similarly talvitie et al 2017b found that 70 of mp in treated wastewater was in the size range below 100 µm in the present study 78 4 70 0 and 76 6 of mp identified in wastewater sludge and effluent respectively were below 100 µm in studies applying manual sorting prior to spectroscopic analysis the size of the identified mp tended to be larger bayo et al 2020 magni et al 2019 in the size range 10 100 µm magni et al 2019 found 12 24 and 14 in raw wastewater sludge and treated wastewater respectively while reporting the highest abundance of 36 54 in the size range 100 500 µm bayo et al 2020 found the highest abundance of particles in the size range 400 600 µm accounting for 35 2 of all mp the explanation for this discrepancy is most likely differences in applied quantification methodologies as describe by hidalgo ruz et al 2012 and sun et al 2019 manual sorting can be prone to bias toward the larger size fraction due to the difficulties in identifying and handling small particles this shows that the abundancy of identified mp is highly dependent on the applied methodology in many cases making direct comparison impossible 3 4 polymer distribution of plastics the identified plastics could be categorized into 22 polymer groups the most diverse type of sample was digested sludge covering 18 polymer groups the least diverse sample type was 20 mm bar screen material covering only 7 polymer groups throughout all matrices the most common polymer types in terms of mass ranked by relative contribution were pe pp polyester pvc ps pu acrylic alkyd pa acrylic paints eva abs san epoxy pva pvac vinyl copolymer polycarbonate pan pu paints phenoxy resin and pla of these 97 of the total plastic mass were identified within the first six groups previous studies likewise reported pe pp polyester pvc ps and pu as polymer commonly found in wwtps mintenig et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 simon et al 2018 talvitie et al 2017a ziajahromi et al 2017 which coincidently are also the six most common polymers in the european plastic demand plastics europe 2019 for bar screen material only the total polymer mass was quantified and not the mass per polymer group fig 3 shows the relative distribution of polymers identified in each type of sample in terms of both particle count and mass as the range of identified plastics spans several orders of magnitude fig 2a some of the largest particles might dominate the polymer distribution in terms of mass this issue is further illustrated in fig 4 which shows the accumulated distribution of plastics in each sample ranked by mass the solid black line indicates half of the total plastic mass and shows that just 2 1 2 1 and 2 4 of the plastics accounted for 50 of the total plastic mass for influent wastewater sludge and effluent respectively consequently fig 3 also contains plots were the 10 and 25 least and most massive particles were removed an approach suggested by olesen et al 2018 in samples of influent wastewater the removal of 20 of the extreme values put a larger emphasis on less common polymer types as the few large particles tended to be of common polymers the polymer distribution in sludge samples becomes increasingly similar in terms of particle count and mass when removing extreme values indicating the presence of large particles dominating certain polymer types the effluent samples for example showed a large difference in polymeric distribution between particle count and mass especially for pvc the explanation for the difference is likely the size of the particles fig 4 shows a boxplot of the polymer specific size distribution for each sample type the figure indicates a clear difference in the size distribution of the pvc particles in the effluent compared to other polymer types a pairwise wilcoxon rank sum test revealed that the mean size of the pvc particles in the effluent samples was significantly higher p 0 05 than all other polymer types the same was true for the mean size of the pe particles when compared to polyester pp ps and the grouped polymers the reason why the difference in particles size for pe is less pronounced when considering the mass distribution shown in fig 4 is likely the difference in density of pe at 0 95 g cm 3 and pvc at 1 4 g cm 3 4 conclusions the total plastic mass removal efficiency taking all sizes entering the plant into account was 99 6 considering only the small mp 500 µm the removal efficiency became 98 8 behind the latter numbers was that the sludge retained 65 8 while 11 6 were retained at the 2 mm bar screens and 1 2 was found in the effluent 21 4 were unaccounted for in this mass balance a discrepancy believed caused by sampling and measuring uncertainties or fragmentation and degradation in the digester and process tanks the bar screen material retained much larger plastics than what was sampled in the influent wastewater sludge and effluent in terms of plastic particle numbers the bar screen material contributed little to the overall plastic load on ryaverket wwtp however in terms of plastic mass things were quite different here the material retained on the screen accounted for 73 of the total load the material on the 2 mm bar screen furthermore contained particles below 2 mm causing this screen to retain 4 6 of the microplastics mass load 5 mm ryaverket applies two screens a coarse 20 mm followed by a fine 2 mm one the latter caught about half of all screened plastic mass showing that wwtps benefit from being equipped with fine screens as this reduces the plastic load on the plant quite significantly having this additional 2 mm bar screen meant that ryaverket received just 46 of what it would have received had it only had a 20 mm bar screen this study shows that in order to establish a complete mass balance of plastics at wastewater treatment plants it is crucial to consider plastics larger than what is considered microplastics and to take plastics of all sizes into account at all

16840,a complete plastic particle mass balance was established at sweden s second largest wastewater treatment plant it comprised material collected at its two bar screens a 20 mm and a 2 mm one in the influent water after the 20 mm screen the effluent water and the digested sludge macro and microplastics above 500 µm were analysed individually applying atr ftir while microplastics of 10 500 µm were analysed by µftir imaging with automated particle recognition masses of plastics 500 µm were determined by weighting while the mass of the smaller microplastics was estimated from the imaging the total plastic load on the plant was 202 2 kg d 1 of which the two screens retained 73 the remaining plastic mass was found in the sludge 13 6 and the effluent 0 4 the missing 12 7 could be caused by sampling and measuring uncertainties and potentially also fragmentation below the size detection limit of the analytical approach or by degradation the bar screens furthermore retained plastics smaller than the screen size indicating that this material should be taken into account also when solely looking at smaller particles the overall treatment efficiency of the plant was high 99 6 considering both macro and microplastics and 98 8 considering only microplastics 500 µm keywords wastewater treatment plant microplastic macroplastic plastics screening mass balance 1 introduction plastics have become an integrate part of human life due to their versatile applicability and excellent longevity the downside is that improper waste management has resulted in the accumulation of plastic pollution in the environment barnes et al 2009 derraik 2002 once present in the environment plastic debris is subject to environmental factors such as sunlight and mechanical stress which cause fragmentation into smaller pieces termed microplastics mp commonly defined as items smaller than 5 mm in their longest dimension arthur et al 2009 from there mp can get ingested by aquatic organisms cole et al 2013 derraik 2002 windsor et al 2019 upon which the mp itself or additives and absorbed pollutants within it might cause adverse effects on the organisms andrady 2011 browne et al 2013 zhang and chen 2020 in developed countries liquid waste from households institutions and industries is usually collected by sewer systems mp is present in the dry weather sewage e g due to primary mp added to cosmetics and personal care products carr et al 2016 and secondary mp released from breakdown of synthetic clothing during washing browne et al 2011 urban stormwater runoff is also conveyed in sewers either combined with the dry weather sewage or separately this water contains mp from atmospheric deposition traffic and weathering of plastic materials and enters the sewers during wet weather liu et al 2019a 2019c olesen et al 2019 the ubiquitous presence of mp in urban dry and wet weather runoff entails further research into possible sources and sinks in this context the fluxes of mp from wastewater treatment plants wwtps have received considerable attention liu et al 2020 mintenig et al 2017 simon et al 2018 most studies have investigated the presence of mp in inlet and effluent wastewater to assess the potential release of mp to the receiving environment indeed several studies have reported elevated concentrations of mp downstream of wwtps estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 habib et al 1998 magnusson and norén 2014 mccormick et al 2014 once mp have been through the wwtp there is a risk of them having been colonized by pathogens residing in the wastewater and so mp might become a vector for their spreading mccormick et al 2014 additionally some studies have investigated mp in sewage sludge carr et al 2016 ljung et al 2018 and found it to be a significant sink for mp in wwtps although studies show that the vast majority of mp is removed from the wastewater during treatment the sheer volume of treated wastewater has been argued to result in a significant discharge of mp to the aquatic environment ziajahromi et al 2016 early studies have primarily focused on enumeration and description by employing visual identification by stereo microscopy based on physical characterization of type morphology and colour andrady 2011 derraik 2002 this method however can be prone to bias relatively low magnification poor contrast e g when a particle has a colour similar to the background operator dependency and difficulty in distinguishing between natural fibres such as cotton and synthetic fibres make mp identification difficult sun et al 2019 it has been suggested to use a set of standardized criteria to improve characterization and avoid misidentification however even when these are used during visual sorting of suspected plastic particles plastics the risk for misidentification might still be as high as 70 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 and no chemical information necessary for identifying the type of polymers is obtained xu et al 2019 hence identification of visually sorted particles should always be accompanied by chemical analysis hidalgo ruz et al 2012 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and raman spectroscopy have been highlighted as the most prominent technologies for acquiring information on the chemical structure of particles the chemical fingerprint of unidentified particles obtained by these vibrational spectroscopic methods is commonly referenced to a library of spectra of known materials to identify them vianello et al 2013a a common practise is to perform visual inspection and separation of suspected mp followed by confirmation by atr ftir or raman spectroscopy bayo et al 2020 conley et al 2019 magni et al 2019 ziajahromi et al 2021 while particles 500 µm can readily be handled manually and thus analysed as single particles using these techniques this method becomes increasingly less feasible when particle size decreases methods for analysing mp 500 µm using focal plane array fpa ftir have been developed löder et al 2015 and improved upon to include mass estimation simon et al 2018 while the size and abundance of mp are of importance for the ingestion and biological impacts of mp cole et al 2013 prata et al 2020 these parameters are inadequate to describe the mp load from various sources this owes partly to the continuous fragmentation of mp decreasing their size while increasing abundance by using mass as a conserved base quantity measurements become independent of the change in apparent abundance several studies have hence suggested to report mp in terms of particle number size mass and polymer types in order to ensure comparability of results and their versatile application simon et al 2018 this study seeks to expand the knowledge on the dynamics of plastics inside wwtps by expanding the upper size limit of analysis and applying a mass balance approach for investigating their occurrence and fate to this end samples of bar screen material inlet wastewater digested sludge and effluent from a swedish wwtp were analysed for their content of plastics by fpa µftir imaging for mp of 10 500 µm and atr ftir for particles 500 µm 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and description of wwtp ryaverket is one of the largest wwtps in sweden handling wastewater from approximately 790 000 inhabitants as well as industries in the greater gothenburg area around 369 000 m3 of treated wastewater is discharged daily through göta älv into the kattegat sea the wwtp utilizes bar screens sand and grease traps primary settling activated sludge secondary settling nitrifying trickling filters and nitrifying moving bed biofilm reactors followed by post denitrification and finally tertiary mechanical filtration through disc filters hydrotech hsf2220 2fn with a mesh size of 15 µm in this wwtp fat oil and grease from the grease traps is skimmed and fed to the anaerobic digester together with fatty slurries from external sources tumlin and bertholds 2020 a full overview of the internal waste streams is found in figure s1 to investigate the fluxes of plastics to and from the wwtp five different samples were taken material from coarse 20 mm and fine 2 mm bar screens influent wastewater after the 20 mm screen digested sludge and effluent fatty slurries from external sources were not sampled sampling took place through april september 2018 exact dates are in supplementary material table s1 influent dry weather wastewater was sampled flow proportionally over 24 h using an isco 6700 portable sampler each day 5 l was sampled and stored in 1 l aluminium bottles on the same days bulk samples of material from bar screens and digested sludge were sampled and stored in glass jars two effluent samples were collected on the third day of the sampling campaign by continuously filtering from the effluent over the cause of a work day using a custom made filtration device filtering onto 10 µm stainless steel figure s2 the pump used contained no plastic or painted parts further details on the setup are found in liu et al 2019b in total three filters were used for each sample a flowmeter on the discharge line quantified the amount of filtered water which in both cases were 550 l for practical reasons it was not possible to completely avoid the use of plastic during sampling the autosampler used for sampling inlet wastewater contained teflon polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe tubes a polyvinylchloride pvc hose was needed to connect the custom filtration device to the effluent sampling point at the wastewater treatment plant equipment used for sampling bar screen material and sludge were metal while all sample containers were either glass or metal based on previous experience any potential contamination from these sources is expected to be minimal and were not further assessed liu et al 2020 2019c 2 2 sample preparation two litres of each influent wastewater sample were used for the identification of mp down to 10 µm to reduce the volume samples were filtered on a ø47 mm stainless steel filter with a 10 µm mesh and transferred into a 50 g l 1 sodium dodecyl sulphate sds solution by ultrasonication poornejad et al 2016 a glass covered magnetic stir bar was added and the samples were moderately stirred while heated to 50 c in a water bath for 48 h next a two step enzymatic digestion was applied to degrade proteinaceous and cellulosic material cole et al 2014 löder et al 2017 first proteinaceous material was degraded using 1 ml of alcalase 2 4 l fg novozymes bagsværd denmark in a 0 2 m tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane buffer solution at ph 8 2 while being stirred and incubated at 50 c for 48 h afterwards the buffer solution was replaced with an acetate buffer at ph 4 8 while 0 5 ml cellulase enzyme blend and 0 5 ml viscozyme l merck kgaa darmstadt germany were added and incubated at 50 c for another 48 h subsequently the samples were subjected to iron catalysed oxidation with hydrogen peroxide fenton reaction to further remove organic matter first the samples were transferred into 200 ml milli q water followed by 145 ml 50 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 while the source of iron ii was 62 ml 0 1 m iron sulphate feso4 the efficiency of the fenton reaction is highly dependent on temperature and ph bautista et al 2007 tagg et al 2017 therefore 0 1 m sodium hydroxide naoh was used to adjust the ph to 3 while the temperature was kept around 20 c by cooling the beaker with ice finally dense inorganic particles e g sand were removed through density separation using a zncl2 solution ρ 1 7 g cm 3 in 100 ml separator funnels imhof et al 2012 hereafter the samples were split into two size fractions by wet sieving with 15 g l 1 sds solution through a sieve with mesh sizes of 500 µm the particles in the filtrate were collected on a 10 µm steel filter and transferred into 50 v v ethanol by ultrasonication finally the ethanol water was completely evaporated into headspace vials using n2 before the volume was adjusted with 50 v v ethanol to 5 ml of particle concentrate to have enough particles for a representative analysis of microplastics above 500 µm the remaining 3 l of influent wastewater were wet sieved over a 500 µm sieve then the particles were oxidized with 10 h2o2 for 24 hours and dried at 55 c the effluent samples were transferred from the filters into 50 g l 1 sds solution by ultrasonication and subsequently followed the protocol described for wastewater samples likewise a 20 g subsample of digested sludge was extracted from a larger sample of approx 1 l upon mixing it thoroughly pre oxidized in 10 h2o2 for 24 hours upon which it followed the same protocol as the wastewater samples beforehand the water content of the digested sludge was determined with a mettler toledo moisture analyzer he73 2 2 1 bar screen material a subsample of approximately 100 g from each sample was dried to examine the water content then the coarse particles were sterilized and cleaned by oxidation with 10 h2o2 finally the samples were again dried and all particles which potentially might be of plastic were manually sorted out under a stereo microscope the sorted particles were further cleaned with ethanol prior to analysis the size cut off for the bar screen materials was 2 mm as coarse particles are retained on the bar screens a filter cake builds up which could result in a reduction in the effective size of the screening to investigate whether a significant amount of smaller particles were caught on the 2 mm bar screens the amount of particles 2 mm in these samples was quantified a subsample of 100 g bar screen material was dried and weighed afterwards the particles were dispersed in 10 g l 1 sds solution and mixed on a shaking table for 1 h finally the samples were wet sieved over a cascade of sieves ranging from 2 mm down to 20 µm the sieves were dried and weighed before and after sieving to quantify the mass of smaller particles the total mass of particles smaller than 2 mm on the bar screens was a few percent and it was hence deemed sufficient to estimate the amount of microplastics below 2 mm in the bar screen material assuming a similar fraction of plastics in the small particles as was found for the fraction above 2 mm 2 3 spectroscopic analysis in preparation for the spectroscopic analysis of the smaller size fraction 10 500 µm a subsample of particle concentrate was deposited onto an infrared transparent ø13 2 mm zinc selenide window held in a compression cell pike technologies which left an effective opening of ø10 mm the particle concentrate was homogenized by vortexing and a subsample extracted with a glass capillary micropipette added to the window and dried on a heating plate at 50 c subsamples were added repeatedly in small steps of 50 µl until the window was sufficiently covered by particles hereby avoiding particle agglomeration and overloading of the window this process was repeated until the window was sufficiently covered by particles in this way 4 12 of the sample concentrates were deposited per window three separate windows with subsamples were prepared per analysed sample to account for heterogeneity during subsampling the windows were analysed by µftir imaging using a cary 670 ftir spectrometer agilent technologies santa clara ca usa combined with a cary 620 ftir microscope equipped with a 15x cassegrain objective and a mercury cadmium telluride mct detector with a 128 128 focal plane array fpa yielding a 5 5 µm pixel resolution the samples were analysed in transmission mode applying a spectral range of 3750 850 cm 1 at 8 cm 1 spectral resolution with 30 co added scans the background was created by 120 co added scans after depositing the sub samples the whole effective area of the window 10 10 mm was scanned creating approximately 3 2 million spectra per scan which then were processed using the simple software formerly mphunter developed at aalborg university aalborg denmark in association with alfred wegner institute helgoland germany primpke et al 2020 each spectrum from the scan was correlated to more than 100 spectra of polymers and natural materials from a reference library the 1st thresholds the ones identifying if there is a microplastic particle see liu et al 2019a were varied to minimize the number of false positive and false negative identification based on an expert evaluation of the goodness of the spectra comparison the 2nd thresholds the ones deciding the size of a microplastic particle were varied and the particle size compared to a visual image of the scanned surface to optimize the size estimate the evaluation was done on a subset of the automatically detected particles liu et al 2019a primpke et al 2017 masses were estimated from the 2 dimensional images based on material density and an estimated thickness as described in simon et al 2018 all sorted out particles from the bar screen samples and particles 500 µm from wastewater and sludge samples were first photographed and then analysed using a cary 630 atr ftir spectrometer interpretation of the infrared spectra was done using software ominc 8 3 thermo fisher scientific inc ma usa in combination with commercial spectra libraries containing a wide variety of synthetic and natural materials vianello et al 2013b the masses of these particles were measured on an analytical balance mettler toledo xse205 d 0 01 mg 2 4 mitigation and assessment of contamination several precautions were taken to avoid contamination of the sample prior to analysis during sampling cotton work suits were worn to reduce contamination with fibres from synthetic materials cotton lab coats were likewise worn during sample preparation in the laboratory glassware and other equipment were flushed thrice with filtered 0 7 µm glass fibre water nuelle et al 2014 while the steel filters were muffled before use simon et al 2018 additionally the lab space was cleaned prior to sample preparation and the use of plastic equipment limited finally air born contamination was minimized by keeping beakers with samples covered with aluminium foil or glass watches during transfer in the lab and by conducting the sample preparation inside fume hoods all reagents were filtered through 0 7 µm glass fibre filters before use despite thorough care complete avoidance of contamination is seldom possible consequently triplicate laboratory blanks following the preparation protocol for wastewater and sludge six in total were prepared and analysed along with the respective samples filtered 0 7 µm gf filter milli q water was used as a medium for blank samples a similar volume of sub sample from the blanks were analysed as were for their respective samples the procedural blanks assess the contamination during sample preparation and analysis and the determined contamination hence refers to one sample preparation and not to the volume of filtered water processed possible contamination during sampling was not assessed 2 5 statistical analysis the normality of the size distribution of mp particles was assessed using shapiro wilk normality test a non parametric kruskal wallis test was performed to investigate whether there was significant difference in the size distribution between the influent wastewater and the other samples wilcoxon rank sum test was performed to assess differences in the mean of these samples a significance level of p 0 05 was applied for all statistical analysis using the software r v3 5 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 contamination analysis of 300 µl aliquots of the triplicate laboratory blanks for the wastewater protocol revealed a contamination by 13 mp particles this corresponded to a contamination of 83 9 ng or 4 33 items per processed sample four polymer types were identified pe pp polyester and ps with polyester accounting for 69 of the contamination by number and 77 by mass in the blanks following the sludge protocol the contamination was even lower seven mp particles were identified in triplicate deposits of 200 µl corresponding to 20 3 ng or 2 33 items per blank of the seven particles identified six were of polyester and one was of pa the contamination is expected to arise from occasional exposure to open air during sample preparation and not from the filtered milli q used as matrix for the blanks considering the mass of mp identified in the blanks for the wastewater protocol in relation to the real wastewater samples the possible contamination corresponds to just 1 20 of the average mass of mp found in similar sample aliquots the blanks from the sludge protocol contained just 0 04 of the average mp mass from the sludge samples due to a much greater amount of mp identified in these samples a study on another wwtp by mintenig et al 2017 reported contamination levels of 21 particles and 130 fibres in procedural blanks consisting of 150 l filtered 3 µm stainless steel filter tap water treated subsequent to samples of treated wastewater simon et al 2018 reported finding 2110 mp corresponding to 84 µg in triplicates of 1 l filtered demineralized water processed in parallel with samples of raw wastewater more recently liu et al 2019 found mp corresponding to 22 2 items with an estimated mass of 942 ng in triplicates of 100 l of filtered 1 2 µm glass fibre filter milli q water alongside stormwater samples following an protocol similar to the present one in the case of mintenig et al 2017 and simon et al 2018 reported mp concentrations were corrected by subtracting possible contamination or used as detection limit while liu et al 2019 did not correct the results due to the low levels of contamination detected the levels of contamination found in the present study were low compared to the amount of particles found in the samples on average corresponding to 1 2 and 0 04 of the plastics found in raw wastewater and sludge respectively therefore the results were not corrected for background contamination arising from the sample preparation 3 2 mass balance for plastics at ryaverket wastewater treatment plant in total 14 samples of six different kinds were analysed for their plastic content revealing a total of 3 909 plastic particles plastics ranked in order of abundance 2 455 were found in digested sludge 719 in effluent 576 in raw influent wastewater and 159 in bar screen material to establish the mass balance for plastics at the wwtp the concentration of plastics in each sample was multiplied by the respective flow of the liquid or mass streams during the period of sampling the range of the concentration in each kind of sample and corresponding flows is presented in table 1 details on individual values of plastic concentration and flow for each sample can be found in table s1 the overall mass balance was calculated using the average of the three independent samples two in the case of effluent samples and the average flow on the day of sampling fig 1 shows the mass balance for plastics at the wastewater treatment plant it shows that 201 2 kg of plastics entered the treatment plant daily while 0 7 kg was released through the effluent this corresponds to a removal efficiency of 99 6 the primary removal of plastics from the wastewater happened via the 20 mm and 2 mm bar screens with 38 2 and 35 2 respectively finally 13 6 of the plastics were recovered in the sludge fraction these measurements account for 87 3 of the load to the wastewater treatment plant the missing 12 7 of the plastic mass balance are expected to arise from sampling and measuring uncertainties and potentially by plastics loss in the digester and the activated sludge process tanks the latter can either be chemical biological degradation or simply a fragmentation below the size detection limit of the applied analytical technique there is a great variability of the daily wastewater flow where factors such as time of sampling and the weather can have a significant influence therefore it is important to report specifics about the time of sampling and antecedent weather patterns furthermore the digested sludge represents an average over several weeks due to the retention time in the digester these issues become of increasing importance when mp concentrations identified in small bulk samples are scaled to yearly discharges some of these uncertainties are evident when looking at variation in the plastic concentration in samples presented in table 1 no other studies have dealt specifically with the retention of mp in material from bar screens likely because the size extends beyond what is considered mp this study found that due to the build up of a filter cake retention of small particles can be expected and indeed 2 4 to 4 5 of the dry mass of 2 mm bar screen material consisted of particles below the actual size of the screens assuming a similar fraction of plastics in the small particles as was found for the fraction above 2 mm the removal of mp with 2 mm bar screen material was 2 6 kg d 1 corresponding to 4 6 of mp 2 mm of what was identified in the influent wastewater samples these findings highlight that bar screen material should be considered in future research dealing with the mass balance at wastewater treatment plants utilizing this technology even when targeting the mp 5 mm however as this study investigates the total mass balance of plastics in the wwtp this fraction only accounted for 1 3 of all the incoming plastics this indicates that the potential error from not directly measuring the content of small mp in the filter cake was small compared to the overall uncertainties considering only the small fraction of mp 500 µm the removal through sludge was 65 8 of the inlet mass highlighting this as a key process in the removal of small mp previous studies have reported comparable mp removal of 72 98 through sludge leslie et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017b it is estimated that 11 6 of the small mp were retained in the filter cake on the 2 mm bar screens finally the effluent samples contained mp corresponding to 1 2 giving a removal efficiency for mp 500 µm of 98 8 which falls in line with other studies reporting overall mp removal efficiencies of wwtps above 98 carr et al 2016 magnusson and norén 2014 murphy et al 2016 simon et al 2018 talvitie et al 2017a the 21 4 unaccounted for are most likely related to the previously explained analytical uncertainties in terms of numbers the average concentration of plastics in raw wastewater was 533 items l 1 in influent wastewater while the final effluent contained 4 items l 1 the highest concentration in terms of numbers were found in the sludge with 1 401 items g 1 dry weight dw in material from the 20 mm and 2 mm bar screens the concentrations were 0 20 and 0 28 items g 1 respectively the issues of reporting a concentration in terms of number are especially apparent when comparing the concentration of plastics found in bar screen materials despite a low number of plastics identified in these samples the contribution in terms of mass was much greater than in e g digested sludge due to the novelty of this research topic direct comparison with other studies can be difficult substantial differences in sampling methods sampled volumes sample preparation higher or lower size cut off and analytical techniques for mp identification have been applied in previous studies to better compare studies there is a need for standardization in the field as highlighted by e g hidalgo ruz et al 2012 and ziajahromi et al 2016 these issues are apparent when comparing reports on the concentration of mp in wwtps in a recent review on the occurrence and fate of mp in wastewater treatment plants gatidou et al 2019 reported influent concentrations varying from 1 7 216 particles l 1 likewise to the present study talvitie et al 2017 applied 24 hour flow proportional composite sampling and identified a similar concentration of mp of 630 900 items l 1 in influent samples although using a different sample preparation and analysis approach simon et al 2018 used a similar sample preparation and nearly identical analysis methods but reported much higher concentrations of mp between 2 223 18 285 particles l 1 in influent samples from ten danish wwtps similar variation is apparent when considering the mp concentration reported in effluent and sludge in this study the concentration of mp in the sludge samples was up to three orders of magnitude higher than those previously reported gatidou et al 2019 it seems unlikely that this difference is due to true variability in plastic contents of different wwtp sludge and more likely due to differences in analytical approaches the potential for the release of plastics to the environment from ryaverket wwtp can be estimated based on the mass balance considering the annual effluent flow an estimated 263 42 kg of mp y 1 is released into the environment through the outlet corresponding to a per capita release of 0 33 0 03 g capita 1 y 1 another potential pathway for the spreading of mp to the environment is the fertilization of agricultural fields with sewage sludge browne et al 2013 zubris and richards 2005 in sweden 34 of the sewage sludge was spread on agricultural fields in 2016 naturvårdsverket 2018 based on the mass balance established in this study a total of 3 372 1 530 kg of mp could hence annually be released to the terrestrial environment however in a study on the impact of using different amounts of sewage sludge as fertilization of a series of test fields in petersborg malmö ljung et al 2018 found the concentration to be 3 to 10 times lower than what it theoretically should be assuming that plastics could not break down in nature therefore more research is needed to understand the true impact of using sewages sludge for fertilization furthermore other potential sources for mp in agricultural fields such as littering and mulching should also be accounted for finally the flow of plastics with the bar screen material was 50 tons y 1 however as this material is incinerated the potential for release into the environment would only be through spills during transport to the incineration plant which is unlikely to happen at a meaningful scale 3 3 size distribution of plastics a boxplot of the size of identified plastics is presented in fig 2 a together with the d10 d50 and d90 for each sample type in fig 2b particle size distributions can be found in supplementary material figure s3 the size of the mp particles was defined by their major feret diameter determined by simple for mp 500 µm and manual measurement of the major dimension in imagej for plastics 500 µm a shapiro wilk normality test revealed that the size of the plastics was non normal distributed in all samples consequently a non parametric kruskal wallis test was used to compare the size distribution of plastics in the inlet with other sample types results of which are also shown in fig 2a the test revealed a significant p 0 05 difference in the size distribution of influent bar screen and sludge samples but an insignificant p 0 05 difference between influent and effluent samples a pairwise wilcoxon rank sum test showed that the mean size of plastics in the sludge was significantly larger than the ones in the influent and effluent while plastics in the bar screen material were significantly larger than the plastics in other matrices the large plastic particles on the screens originate from the wastewater the fact that large particles were not also found in the inlet wastewater is likely an artefact of the sampling as the concentration of large particles is low and the probability of finding one in the small volumes of inlet wastewater collected hence also low no significant difference between plastics in coarse and fine bar screen material was found it is furthermore worth noticing that plastics fitting the definition of mp 5 mm were identified in the 20 mm bar screen material again highlighting that these screening processes should not be overlooked in studies of mp at wwtps an example of identified plastics is shown in figure s4 one likely reason for the difference between the size of plastics in influent wastewater and sludge could be that the large mp are rare in wastewater compared to smaller ones talvitie et al 2017b although 24 hour flow proportional sampling ensures a degree of representability for the day of sampling the position of the intake of the autosampler could influence the size distribution as larger particles have a greater tendency to either sink or float these particles would however still be present in the wastewater reaching the treatment plant and end up in the sludge fraction during treatment furthermore while a wastewater sample represents a temporal span of one day the solid retention time during anaerobic digestion is several weeks meaning that the presence of mp particles with an extreme size is more likely to occur this is evident when looking at fig 2b where the sludge samples show not only a higher d90 value but also a greater spread than influent and effluent samples although the wastewater treatment plant applied disc filtration with a mesh size of 15 µm larger mp were identified in the effluent in a study of the disc filters at ryaverket wilén et al 2012 reported similar findings and attributed this to particles having non spherical shapes the characteristic was confirmed for mp by liu et al 2019b who reported the shape of mp identified in stormwater ponds as plump ellipsoids having a major to minor dimension ratio of 1 9 simon et al 2019 studied the removal of mp by a disc filter and likewise reported some particles in the effluent having larger dimensions than the filter mesh they contributed these findings to possible defects in the filter cloth due to mechanical stresses or unintended bypassing of wastewater in a study applying a similar methodology simon et al 2018 reported the median size of mp to be 48 µm with a d90 of 100 µm for raw wastewater and a median of 45 µm with a d90 of 91 µm for treated wastewater in a study on the retention of mp by disc filters with a 18 µm mesh simon et al 2019 found a median of 33 5 µm before and 47 9 µm after disc filtration these figures are slightly below what was found for raw and treated wastewater in this study other studies reported mp size as abundance in certain size ranges mintenig et al 2017 found 59 2 of mp identified in treated wastewater in the size range 50 100 µm making this the most abundant size fraction with only 8 5 of identified mp particles being above 200 µm applying similar ranges the abundance of mp within the size range 50 100 µm were 36 0 36 3 and 38 8 in wastewater sludge and effluent while the amount 200 µm in those samples were 5 9 9 3 and 6 7 similarly talvitie et al 2017b found that 70 of mp in treated wastewater was in the size range below 100 µm in the present study 78 4 70 0 and 76 6 of mp identified in wastewater sludge and effluent respectively were below 100 µm in studies applying manual sorting prior to spectroscopic analysis the size of the identified mp tended to be larger bayo et al 2020 magni et al 2019 in the size range 10 100 µm magni et al 2019 found 12 24 and 14 in raw wastewater sludge and treated wastewater respectively while reporting the highest abundance of 36 54 in the size range 100 500 µm bayo et al 2020 found the highest abundance of particles in the size range 400 600 µm accounting for 35 2 of all mp the explanation for this discrepancy is most likely differences in applied quantification methodologies as describe by hidalgo ruz et al 2012 and sun et al 2019 manual sorting can be prone to bias toward the larger size fraction due to the difficulties in identifying and handling small particles this shows that the abundancy of identified mp is highly dependent on the applied methodology in many cases making direct comparison impossible 3 4 polymer distribution of plastics the identified plastics could be categorized into 22 polymer groups the most diverse type of sample was digested sludge covering 18 polymer groups the least diverse sample type was 20 mm bar screen material covering only 7 polymer groups throughout all matrices the most common polymer types in terms of mass ranked by relative contribution were pe pp polyester pvc ps pu acrylic alkyd pa acrylic paints eva abs san epoxy pva pvac vinyl copolymer polycarbonate pan pu paints phenoxy resin and pla of these 97 of the total plastic mass were identified within the first six groups previous studies likewise reported pe pp polyester pvc ps and pu as polymer commonly found in wwtps mintenig et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 simon et al 2018 talvitie et al 2017a ziajahromi et al 2017 which coincidently are also the six most common polymers in the european plastic demand plastics europe 2019 for bar screen material only the total polymer mass was quantified and not the mass per polymer group fig 3 shows the relative distribution of polymers identified in each type of sample in terms of both particle count and mass as the range of identified plastics spans several orders of magnitude fig 2a some of the largest particles might dominate the polymer distribution in terms of mass this issue is further illustrated in fig 4 which shows the accumulated distribution of plastics in each sample ranked by mass the solid black line indicates half of the total plastic mass and shows that just 2 1 2 1 and 2 4 of the plastics accounted for 50 of the total plastic mass for influent wastewater sludge and effluent respectively consequently fig 3 also contains plots were the 10 and 25 least and most massive particles were removed an approach suggested by olesen et al 2018 in samples of influent wastewater the removal of 20 of the extreme values put a larger emphasis on less common polymer types as the few large particles tended to be of common polymers the polymer distribution in sludge samples becomes increasingly similar in terms of particle count and mass when removing extreme values indicating the presence of large particles dominating certain polymer types the effluent samples for example showed a large difference in polymeric distribution between particle count and mass especially for pvc the explanation for the difference is likely the size of the particles fig 4 shows a boxplot of the polymer specific size distribution for each sample type the figure indicates a clear difference in the size distribution of the pvc particles in the effluent compared to other polymer types a pairwise wilcoxon rank sum test revealed that the mean size of the pvc particles in the effluent samples was significantly higher p 0 05 than all other polymer types the same was true for the mean size of the pe particles when compared to polyester pp ps and the grouped polymers the reason why the difference in particles size for pe is less pronounced when considering the mass distribution shown in fig 4 is likely the difference in density of pe at 0 95 g cm 3 and pvc at 1 4 g cm 3 4 conclusions the total plastic mass removal efficiency taking all sizes entering the plant into account was 99 6 considering only the small mp 500 µm the removal efficiency became 98 8 behind the latter numbers was that the sludge retained 65 8 while 11 6 were retained at the 2 mm bar screens and 1 2 was found in the effluent 21 4 were unaccounted for in this mass balance a discrepancy believed caused by sampling and measuring uncertainties or fragmentation and degradation in the digester and process tanks the bar screen material retained much larger plastics than what was sampled in the influent wastewater sludge and effluent in terms of plastic particle numbers the bar screen material contributed little to the overall plastic load on ryaverket wwtp however in terms of plastic mass things were quite different here the material retained on the screen accounted for 73 of the total load the material on the 2 mm bar screen furthermore contained particles below 2 mm causing this screen to retain 4 6 of the microplastics mass load 5 mm ryaverket applies two screens a coarse 20 mm followed by a fine 2 mm one the latter caught about half of all screened plastic mass showing that wwtps benefit from being equipped with fine screens as this reduces the plastic load on the plant quite significantly having this additional 2 mm bar screen meant that ryaverket received just 46 of what it would have received had it only had a 20 mm bar screen this study shows that in order to establish a complete mass balance of plastics at wastewater treatment plants it is crucial to consider plastics larger than what is considered microplastics and to take plastics of all sizes into account at all

16841,inorganic scaling is often an obstacle for implementing electrodialysis systems in general and for nutrient recovery from wastewater specifically in this work donnan dialysis was explored to prevent scaling and to prolong operation of an electrochemical system for tan total ammonia nitrogen recovery an electrochemical system was operated with and without an additional donnan dialysis cell while being supplied with synthetic influent and real digested black water for the same load ratio nitrogen load vs applied current while treating digested black water the system operated for a period three times longer when combined with a donnan cell furthermore the amount of nitrogen recovered was higher system performance was evaluated in terms of both tan recovery and energy efficiency at

ions was previously reported to interfere with electrodialysis process and therefore nutrient recovery as calcium and magnesium ions are more susceptible to the electric field and cems are more selective for divalent ions ping et al 2013 rijnaarts et al 2018 yang et al 2014 while some studies consider the concentration of calcium and magnesium negligible due to upstream precipitation such as struvite tarpeh et al 2018 thompson brewster et al 2017 it has been shown that under alkaline conditions low concentrations 0 02 m ca2 are sufficient to scale ion exchange membranes andreeva et al

ph neutrality ayala bribiesca et al 2006 casademont et al 2007 the cation exchanges membranes cem used in an es for tan recovery are not species selective and transport all cations which accumulate in

thompson brewster et al 2017 when scaling forms on the surface of ion exchange membranes the stack electrical resistance increases leading to an increase in energy input andreeva et al 2017 asraf snir

or even replace the scaled membranes andreeva et al 2018 thompson brewster et al 2017 the implementation of electrochemical systems for nutrient recovery applications are thus limited as so far no satisfactory solution has been identified andreeva et al 2018 thompson brewster et al 2017 during electrodialysis ammonium and other cations are transported toward the cathode and accumulate in a concentrated solution while ammonia can be extracted through a gas permeable membrane cations like sodium or potassium will continuously accumulate in this concentrated solution when current is constantly supplied donnan dialysis dd has been previously described to promote the exchange of ammonium in the feed with other cations such as na and k accumulated on the concentrate side cox and dinunzio 1977 rijnaarts et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2020b during donnan dialysis no current is applied and the ions move due to an electrochemical potential difference generated by a concentration gradient formed between the feed and the concentrate during electrodialysis campione et al 2018 chen et al 2020 rodrigues et al 2020b hence also bivalent cations accumulated in a concentrate solution can exchange with monovalent cations from the feed solution rodrigues et al 2020b in reverse electrodialysis rijnaarts et al 2019 used donnan dialysis as a pre treatment step to remove so4 2 from feedwater and were able to achieve 76 reduction of the bivalent ion content limiting the occurrence of scaling rijnaarts et al 2018 the purpose of this research was to assess wether donnan dialysis can be used as pre treatment for scaling mitigation when a complex ammonia rich influent is supplied to an es without further energy consumption and need for chemical addition 2 materials and methods

supplementary information appendix a a 1 experimental setup kuntke et al 2017 rodrigues et al 2020b an additional cell was introduced in the system for donnan dialysis presented in fig 1 the electrodialysis cell included a feed and a concentrated compartment 1 2 cm thickness each and separated by a cation exchange membrane fumasep fkb pk 130 fumatech bwt gmbh bietigheim bissingen germany

ratio load ratio ln is the ratio of applied current density to the tan loading the load ratio determines to a large extent the performance of the es system removal energy consumption coulombic efficiency rodríguez arredondo et al 2017 a load ratio of one means the amount of current applied to the system is equal to the total charge supplied as tan when ln 1 more tan is present than the electrons supplied to the cell conversely when ln 1 the system is supplied with an excess of current load ratio can be determined using the following formula l n j a m c tan influent q influent f where j is the current density a m 2 c tan influent is the concentration of tan mol l 1 in the influent q influent is the influent flow rate l l 1 f is the faraday constant c mol 1 and a m is the surface area of cem m2 2 4 chemical analysis samples were collected daily from influent and effluent of the dd cell effluent of the electrodialysis cell concentrate cathode and acid the samples were

was operated at a load ratio one at 10 a m 2 with and without the dd cell using digested black water as influent fig 2 shows the measured cell voltage and the potential losses in the cell including mea overpotential ηmea and cathode overpotential ηcathode ionic losses eion ph losses eph and the membranes potential emembrane of the ed cell at three distinct regions the potential losses were calculated as explained in the supporting information appendix a a 2 calculations after 12 h the measured voltage spiked to more than 5 v and the operation was therefore interrupted when operating the system with digested black water without a dd cell fig 2 this cell voltage of 5 v can be associated with ph change in the concentrate compartment and scaling formation when operating the system with donnan dialysis at the same conditions scaling was delayed by almost 30 h meaning the period of continuous operation was extended by more than three times that without donnan the potential losses showed an increase of the membrane resistance emembrane over time fig 2 by sem eds analysis of the cem it was clear that the membrane was scaled with calcium salts si appendix b figure a 1 some of the calcium present in the uasb reactor effluent influent of es precipitated in the form of calcium carbonate caco3 on the cem while operating with synthetic influent the es performed at a constant voltage of approximately 3 v both with and without donnan dialysis when supplied with digested black water it was not possible to operate the es system for more than 12 h at the same load ratio and current density again due to scaling on the cem as the membrane scales the effective area of the membrane where the ions can be exchanged is therefore reduced ayala bribiesca et al 2006 this limits the overall ion transport and in turn affects the tan recovery nevertheless within this 12 h stable period of operation 79 tan recovery was achieved a dd cell was introduced to overcome the scaling of the cem at the same load ratio ln 1 and at 10 a m 2 the tan recovery was 82 when using synthetic influent this experiment was carried out over 5 days when using digested black water the tan recovery was 72 5 over 36 h without dd 1 2 g ammonium were supplied 0 9 g were recovered in the acid and 0 3 g were found in the effluent with dd 2 8 g ammonium were supplied 2 1 g were recovered in the acid and 0 7 g were found in the effluent the tan recovery efficiency was affected by operating with real wastewater and by operating the ed combined with dd nevertheless as the system operated during a three times longer period with donnan although the tan recovery was reduced more influent was treated and consequently more nitrogen was recovered furthermore the energy consumption was nearly constant independent of donnan dialysis and the influent composition operating the system consumed around 8 kwh kgn 1 si figure a 2 the energy consumption can be explained when we look at the potential losses si figure a 2 ionic losses occur due to the transport of ions and are thus dependent on the conductivity of the solution the conductivity of the digested black water was 6 5 ms cm 1 on average resulting in higher potential losses compared to influents such as urine around 29 ms cm 1 or reject water around 12 ms cm 1 as previously shown rodrigues et al 2020a 2020b sleutels et al 2017 2013 the fluctuation of mea overpotential was not expected the mea overpotential is the difference between the measured anode potential and the theoretical anode potential if the contact between h2 gas and gas diffusion electrode is not efficient then the mea overpotential can increase post et al 2009 also scaling and biofouling of the cation exchange membrane in the mea can also cause an increase of the mea overpotential choi et al 2011 ping et al 2013 however we observed that the mea overpotential was independent of the influent supplied to the system si figure a 2 thus we suspect that the mea could have suffered some unexpected damage not further identified leading to a fluctuation in the potential loss 3 2 the performance was enhanced and the operation window was expanded by operating at higher load ratio we evaluated the es performance with dd cell regarding tan recovery efficiency and energy consumption for different nitrogen loading at constant current load ratio fig 3 fig 3 shows that the overall tan recovery and energy consumption of the es combined with donnan dialysis increased with load ratio this phenomenon is in accordance with the load ratio model previously established for electrochemical systems for tan recovery rodríguez arredondo et al 2017 at load ratio 1 3 tan recovery of 83 was achieved whereas for load ratio 1 5 the tan recovery was 85 as no significant improvement was observed for load ratio 1 5 no higher load ratio were tested the presented energy consumption is the average for each experiment operated with es including dd cell using filtered digested black water at load ratios 0 5 1 1 3 and 1 5 the average does not consider the last day of each experiment as the voltage ramped up and consequently the operation was interrupted si figure a 3 during stable operation the electrodialysis with donnan dialysis treated in total 2 4 l for load ratio 0 5 3 5 l for load ratio 1 5 2 l for load ratio 1 3 and 4 8 l for load ratio 1 5 the combined system consumed between 5 8 kwh kgn 1 for load ratio 0 5 and 12 2 kwh kgn 1 for load ratio 1 5 the es operated without the dd cell consumed around 7 5 kwh kgn 1 during the 12 h of operation at load ratio one 3 3 donnan dialysis enables ammonia recovery from a complex wastewater including calcium ions by regulating the ph at 9 7 fig 4 represents the average charge species transported over the cem on the electrodialysis cell a and over the cem in the dd cell b for different load ratio and a current density of 10 a m 2 fig 4 shows the average ion transport before the experiments were interrupted due to the extreme cell voltage increase the average transport for each ion was calculated up to the point that scaling was detected scaling affects the ion flux as previously demonstrated by asraf snir et al 2018 and can be detected by the voltage increase asraf snir et al 2018 overall ammonium is the dominant charge carrier highest ti followed by sodium and potassium shown in fig 4a the ionic composition of the influent and the load ratio affect the transport of charged species over the cem in the electrodialysis cell the relative ammonium transport decreased with increasing load ratio while the proton transport increased accordingly sodium 0 23 0 02 and potassium 0 16 0 01 transport remain constant probably due ion exchange during the donnan dialysis pre treatment once a gradient is formed between feed and concentrate potassium k and sodium na are exchanged with ammonium nh4 and protons h in the dd cell fig 4b for load ratio higher than one calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 are both transported to the concentrate compartment through the donnan and electrodialysis cems magnesium was only returned to the feed at load ratio 0 5 moreover calcium and magnesium only represented less than 5 of the charge exchange the desired transport of calcium ions to the feed did not occur in this study up to 4 mmol 150 mg of calcium was removed from the supplied influent by dd ed calcite caco3 precipitation occurs even at very low concentrations and ph just slightly above neutral conditions hasson et al 2010 this precipitation can occur simultaneously on the surface and at the pores of the membrane with a continuous electric field transporting cations through the cem a high enough concentration at the membrane solution interface induced precipitation ayala bribiesca et al 2006 belashova et al 2017 causing the obstruction of the membrane pores and possibly membrane dehydration in our system magnesium was also removed to a certain extent and while the analyzed membranes did not show any magnesium salt precipitates its contribution on facilitating calcium precipitation was previously demonstrated the considerable increase of membrane resistance si figure a 3 which is related to the increase of membrane potential is the result of scaling formation at the cation exchange membrane here cems become more resistant to ion transport and as a result water splitting at the surface of the membrane is enhanced andreeva et al 2018 asraf snir et al 2018 the high membrane potential coincides with an increase in the ph of the concentrate fig 5 is the average ph measured over each 12 h in feed and concentrate solutions for different load ratios fig 5 also shows that the average ph of the concentrate is approximately 10 during the first 12 h for load ratio 1 3 and 1 5 the ph of the concentrate was stable for almost three to four days at ph 9 7 with donnan dialysis conversely when operating without donnan dialysis the ph rapidly reached 11 6 a comparison of fig 5 with figure a 3 si reveals that the membrane loss increases sharply when the concentrate ph reached 12 donnan dialysis thus acts to a certain extent as a ph regulator an effect that is enhanced with increased load ratio the transport of protons for high load ratio in the electrodialysis cell combined with the protons exchanged in dd cell decreased the ph of the concentrate fig 5 although the ph was lower the concentration of calcium on the concentrate side increased with time reaching a saturation point earlier experiments have shown that calcium carbonate precipitates at a ph as low as 8 6 koutsoukos and kontoyannis 1984 söhnel and mullin 1982 after scaling precipitation the cem was restored with an acid cleaning in the experiments presented here donnan dialysis extended the operation period and therefore reduced the chemical need as the frequency of cleaning is reduced although donnan dialysis extended the operation period and therefore reduced the chemical need it can still be combined with a in situ cleaning to guarantee the long term operation of the es operation thompson brewster et al 2017 predicted the major scaling site occurring in electrochemical recovery of ammonium to be in the double layer on the concentrate side of the cem the model described how two different pre treatments can reduce the occurrence of scaling such as struvite thompson brewster et al 2017 in our study the predominant anion responsible for scaling was carbonate unlike previous studies that observed phosphate or sulfate precipitation asraf snir et al 2018 thompson brewster et al 2017 as the cem blocks anions we believe co2 formed in acidic conditions is transported by diffusion through the cem and forms carbonate under alkaline conditions in the concentrate solution legrand et al 2020 nikonenko et al 2003 paz garcia et al 2014 as previous work has shown the membrane structure and influent composition must be considered when designing an electrodialysis cell for nutrient recovery andreeva et al 2017 asraf snir et al 2018 belashova et al 2017 bivalent ions are present in several source separated wastewater streams such as black water and urine shi et al 2018 thompson brewster et al 2017 pre treatments that simultaneously minimize the application of chemicals maintain the overall energy demand and limit additional capital investments should be further investigated to prevent scaling and consequently improve the system performance asraf snir et al 2018 zabolotsky et al 1997 by combining electrodialysis and donnan dialysis we extended the operation of an electrochemical system supplied with a complex wastewater from 12 hour to 36 h at the same nitrogen load vs applied current the period of operation was further extended from 36 h up to 84 h by increasing the load ratio from 1 to 1 5 moreover the combined system was able to effectively remove the ammonium present in the influent to less than 100 mg l 1 in the effluent future research should include the performance of the system at higher current densities and the use of other more concentrated streams such as manure 4 conclusion donnan dialysis delayed the scaling effect on cation exchange membranes allowing the operation of an electrodialysis system for a longer period without interruption for cleaning at the same load ratio and current density the combined system operated for 24 h more than a stand alone electrochemical system before the cell voltage increased significantly here donnan dialysis acted as a ph regulator of the concentrate solution and consequently delayed calcite caco3 precipitation by increasing the current compared to the tan loading load ratio the operation window was further extended up to 72 h and consequently increasing the treatment capacity while maintaining a high tan recovery of 83 and consuming 9 7 kwh gn 1 associated content supporting information are available free of charge research data the

16841,inorganic scaling is often an obstacle for implementing electrodialysis systems in general and for nutrient recovery from wastewater specifically in this work donnan dialysis was explored to prevent scaling and to prolong operation of an electrochemical system for tan total ammonia nitrogen recovery an electrochemical system was operated with and without an additional donnan dialysis cell while being supplied with synthetic influent and real digested black water for the same load ratio nitrogen load vs applied current while treating digested black water the system operated for a period three times longer when combined with a donnan cell furthermore the amount of nitrogen recovered was higher system performance was evaluated in terms of both tan recovery and energy efficiency at different load ratios at a load ratio 1 3 and current density of 10 a m 2 a tan recovery of 83 was achieved while consuming 9 7 kwh kgn 1 keywords inorganic scaling ammonium recovery extended

et al 2008 gao et al 2019 maurer et al 2003 moges et al 2018 theregowda et al 2019 amongst all the nutrients present in wastewater phosphorus and nitrogen are of the utmost importance as they play a vital role in plant growth as phosphorus is a scarce nutrient considerable efforts were taken in the last two decades to recover it from our wastewater cordell et al 2009 egle et al 2016 wilfert et al

anammox at wastewater treatment plants wwtp ahn 2006 giddey et al 2013 rodríguez arredondo et al 2017 2015 these aforementioned nitrogen removal processes are energy intensive and contribute n2o emissions to the atmosphere in addition up to 2 of the energy produced worldwide is consumed by the haber bosch process kuntke et al 2017 kuntke et al 2018 shipman and symes 2017 source separation of wastewater has been investigated as a promising concept to allow for energy efficient wastewater treatment and nutrient recovery larsen et al 2015 zeeman and kujawa roeleveld 2011 phosphorus and

2019 moges et al 2018 an electrochemical system es has been proposed to recover the remaining ammonia and ammonium total ammonia nitrogen tan as it does not require chemical dosing and requires less energy than nh3 stripping chemical precipitation or adsorption kuntke et al 2018 lei et al 2007 rodríguez arredondo et al 2015 wasielewski et al 2016 however digested black water or urine although rich in nitrogen also contain other several ions incl ca2 mg2 k na co3 2 cl so4 2 po4 3 casademont et al 2008 choi et al 2011 luther et al 2015 rodríguez arredondo et al 2017 the presence of bivalent ions was previously reported to interfere with electrodialysis process and therefore nutrient recovery as calcium and magnesium ions are more susceptible to the electric field and cems are more selective for divalent ions ping et al 2013 rijnaarts et al 2018 yang et al 2014 while some studies consider the concentration of calcium and magnesium negligible due to upstream precipitation such as struvite tarpeh et al 2018 thompson brewster et al 2017 it has been shown that under alkaline conditions low concentrations 0 02 m ca2 are sufficient to scale ion exchange membranes andreeva et al 2017 luther et al 2015 pan et al 2020 shaposhnik et al 2002 moreover the presence of mg2 facilitates the formation of calcium carbonate even at very low concentrations of both ions and slightly above ph neutrality ayala bribiesca et al 2006 casademont et al 2007 the cation exchanges membranes cem used in an es for tan recovery are not species selective and transport all cations which accumulate in the concentrate cathode solution the alkaline ph in the concentrate results in the formation of inorganic scaling on the cem e g precipitation of insoluble salts such as calcite gypsum struvite etc thompson brewster et al 2017 when scaling forms on the surface of ion exchange membranes the stack electrical resistance increases leading to an increase in energy input andreeva et al 2017 asraf snir et al 2018 some solutions were proposed to address this problem such as filtration coagulation and flocculation the use of anti scalants and chemical cleaning of the membranes by in situ use of acidic or alkaline chemicals andreeva et al 2018 thompson brewster et al 2017 tran et al 2013 despite having several options all imply additional cost and or operational interruption in order to regenerate or even replace the scaled membranes andreeva et al 2018 thompson brewster et al 2017 the implementation of electrochemical systems for nutrient recovery applications are thus limited as so far no satisfactory solution has been identified andreeva et al 2018 thompson brewster et al 2017 during electrodialysis ammonium and other cations are transported toward the cathode and accumulate in a concentrated solution while ammonia can be extracted through a gas permeable membrane cations like sodium or potassium will continuously accumulate in this concentrated solution when current is constantly supplied donnan dialysis dd has been previously described to promote the exchange of ammonium in the feed with other cations such as na and k accumulated on the concentrate side cox and dinunzio 1977 rijnaarts et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2020b during donnan dialysis no current is applied and the ions move due to an electrochemical potential difference generated by a concentration gradient formed between the feed and the concentrate during electrodialysis campione et al 2018 chen et al 2020 rodrigues et al 2020b hence also bivalent cations accumulated in a concentrate solution can exchange with monovalent cations from the feed solution rodrigues et al 2020b in reverse electrodialysis rijnaarts et al 2019 used donnan dialysis as a pre treatment step to remove so4 2 from feedwater and were able to achieve 76 reduction of the bivalent ion content limiting the occurrence of scaling rijnaarts et al 2018 the purpose of this research was to assess wether donnan dialysis can be used as pre treatment for scaling mitigation when a complex ammonia rich influent is supplied to an es without further energy consumption and need for chemical addition 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the tan recovery system consisted of previously described electrodialysis ed cell and a transmembrane chemisorption tmcs module which is presented in full detail in the supplementary information appendix a a 1 experimental setup kuntke et al 2017 rodrigues et al 2020b an additional cell was introduced in the system for donnan dialysis presented in fig 1 the electrodialysis cell included a feed and a concentrated compartment 1 2 cm thickness each and separated by a cation exchange membrane fumasep fkb pk 130 fumatech bwt gmbh bietigheim bissingen germany the anode and cathode compartment included a platinum pt coated titanium mesh electrode measuring 9 8 cm x 9 8 cm 5 mg pt cm 2 magneto special anodes bv the netherlands in a 0 2 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm compartment the ion exchange membranes had a projected surface area of 100 cm2 the anode was separated from feed compartment by a membrane electrode assembly mea the concentrate compartment was separated from cathode compartment by an anion exchange membrane fumasep fab pk 130 fumatech bwt gmbh bietigheim bissingen germany the dd cell consisted of feed and concentrate compartments made of poly methyl methacrylate each compartment had a size of 21 cm x 21 cm x 2 5 cm and a machined flow field of 10 cm x 10 cm x 0 2 cm feed and concentrate compartments were separated by a 15 cm x 15 cm cem fumasep fkb pk 130 fumatech bwt gmbh during dd the influent was first supplied to the feed compartment of the dd cell in order to supply influent and recirculate feed concentrate cathode and acid solutions four masterflex peristaltic pumps masterflex l s metrohm applikon bv schiedam the netherlands were used the recirculation flow rate for feed concentrate cathode and acid was 160 ml min 1 the influent flow is presented in table 1 according to the used load ratio 2 2 experimental strategy the system was supplied with the effluent of a lab scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion reactor uasb reactor wetsus european center of excellence for sustainable water technology leeuwarden the netherlands used for phosphate recovery as calcium granules as described in cunha et al 2018 the addition of calcium to the reactor results in the production of calcium phosphate granules while removing 89 of the phosphate cunha et al 2018 furthermore 80 of the total cod is removed and around 0 5 g cod ch4 g 1 codtotal bw was produced cunha et al 2019 2018 the effluent digested black water consisted mainly of nh4 1 g l 1 cl 0 463 g l 1 na 0 290 g l 1 k 0 230 g l 1 ca2 0 046 g l 1 mg2 0 024

solids were retained in the uasb reactor the effluent of the uasb passed through a 10 micron filter before being supplied to the es with w and without w o dd the system was also operated with synthetic influent to compare the transport over the membrane synthetic influent mimicked the digested black water collected after the uasb reactor without bivalent cations and an organic carbon

for this research the experiments were carried out at a constant current density of 10 a m 2 choosing 10 a m 2 allowed to operate the es system continuously for a longer period considering the effluent flow rate l d 1 of the uasb reactor 2 3 calculations the calculations were based on earlier work and explained in detail in the supporting information appendix a a 2 calculations 2 3 1 load ratio load ratio ln is the ratio of applied current density to the tan loading the load ratio determines to a large extent the performance of the es system removal energy consumption coulombic efficiency rodríguez arredondo et al 2017 a load ratio of one means the amount of current applied to the system is equal to the total charge supplied as tan when ln 1 more tan is present than the electrons supplied to the cell conversely when ln 1 the system is supplied with an excess of current load ratio can be determined using the following formula l n j a m c tan influent q influent f where j is the current density a m 2 c tan influent is the concentration of tan mol l 1 in the influent q influent is the influent flow rate l l 1 f is the faraday constant c mol 1 and a m is the surface area of cem m2 2 4 chemical analysis samples were collected daily from influent and effluent of the dd cell effluent of the electrodialysis cell concentrate cathode and acid the samples were

oxygen demand cod using a cuvette test kit lck 414 and a spectrophotometer dr3900 hach nederland tiel the netherlands 3 results 3 1 donnan dialysis slows cem scaling allowing longer operation the es was operated at a load ratio one at 10 a m 2 with and without the dd cell using digested black water as influent fig 2 shows the measured cell voltage and the potential losses in the cell including mea overpotential ηmea and cathode overpotential ηcathode ionic losses eion ph losses eph and the membranes potential emembrane of the ed cell at three distinct regions the potential losses were calculated as explained in the supporting information appendix a a 2 calculations after 12 h the measured voltage spiked to more than 5 v and the operation was therefore interrupted when operating the system with digested black water without a dd cell fig 2 this cell voltage of 5 v can be associated with ph change in the concentrate compartment and scaling formation when operating the system with donnan dialysis at the same conditions scaling was delayed by almost 30 h meaning the period of continuous operation was extended by more than three times that without donnan the potential losses showed an increase of the membrane resistance emembrane over time fig 2 by sem eds analysis of the cem it was clear that the membrane was scaled with calcium salts si appendix b figure a 1 some of the calcium present in the uasb reactor effluent influent of es precipitated in the form of calcium carbonate caco3 on the cem while operating with synthetic influent the es performed at a constant voltage of approximately 3 v both with and without donnan dialysis when supplied with digested black water it was not possible to operate the es system for more than 12 h at the same load ratio and current density again due to scaling on the cem as the membrane scales the effective area of the membrane where the ions can be exchanged is therefore reduced ayala bribiesca et al 2006 this limits the overall ion transport and in turn affects the tan recovery nevertheless within this 12 h stable period of operation 79 tan recovery was achieved a dd cell was introduced to overcome the scaling of the cem at the same load ratio ln 1 and at 10 a m 2 the tan recovery was 82 when using synthetic influent this experiment was carried out over 5 days when using digested black water the tan recovery was 72 5 over 36 h without dd 1 2 g ammonium were supplied 0 9 g were recovered in the acid and 0 3 g were found in the effluent with dd 2 8 g ammonium were supplied 2 1 g were recovered in the acid and 0 7 g were found in the effluent the tan recovery efficiency was affected by operating with real wastewater and by operating the ed combined with dd nevertheless as the system operated during a three times longer period with donnan although the tan recovery was reduced more influent was treated and consequently more nitrogen was recovered furthermore the energy consumption was nearly constant independent of donnan dialysis and the influent composition operating the system consumed around 8 kwh kgn 1 si figure a 2 the energy consumption can be explained when we look at the potential losses si figure a 2 ionic losses occur due to the transport of ions and are thus dependent on the conductivity of the solution the conductivity of the digested black water was 6 5 ms cm 1 on average resulting in higher potential losses compared to influents such as urine around 29 ms cm 1 or reject water around 12 ms cm 1 as previously shown rodrigues et al 2020a 2020b sleutels et al 2017 2013 the fluctuation of mea overpotential was not expected the mea overpotential is the difference between the measured anode potential and the theoretical anode potential if the contact between h2 gas and gas diffusion electrode is not efficient then the mea overpotential can increase post et al 2009 also scaling and biofouling of the cation exchange membrane in the mea can also cause an increase of the mea overpotential choi et al 2011 ping et al 2013 however we observed that the mea overpotential was independent of the influent supplied to the system si figure a 2 thus we suspect that the mea could have suffered some unexpected damage not further identified leading to a fluctuation in the potential loss 3 2 the performance was enhanced and the operation window was expanded by operating at higher load ratio we evaluated the es performance with dd cell regarding tan recovery efficiency and energy consumption for different nitrogen loading at constant current load ratio fig 3 fig 3 shows that the overall tan recovery and energy consumption of the es combined with donnan dialysis increased with load ratio this phenomenon is in accordance with the load ratio model previously established for electrochemical systems for tan recovery rodríguez arredondo et al 2017 at load ratio 1 3 tan recovery of 83 was achieved whereas for load ratio 1 5 the tan recovery was 85 as no significant improvement was observed for load ratio 1 5 no higher load ratio were tested the presented energy consumption is the average for each experiment operated with es including dd cell using filtered digested black water at load ratios 0 5 1 1 3 and 1 5 the average does not consider the last day of each experiment as the voltage ramped up and consequently the operation was interrupted si figure a 3 during stable operation the electrodialysis with donnan dialysis treated in total 2 4 l for load ratio 0 5 3 5 l for load ratio 1 5 2 l for load ratio 1 3 and 4 8 l for load ratio 1 5 the combined system consumed between 5 8 kwh kgn 1 for load ratio 0 5 and 12 2 kwh kgn 1 for load ratio 1 5 the es operated without the dd cell consumed around 7 5 kwh kgn 1 during the 12 h of operation at load ratio one 3 3 donnan dialysis enables ammonia recovery from a complex wastewater including calcium ions by regulating the ph at 9 7 fig 4 represents the average charge species transported over the cem on the electrodialysis cell a and over the cem in the dd cell b for different load ratio and a current density of 10 a m 2 fig 4 shows the average ion transport before the experiments were interrupted due to the extreme cell voltage increase the average transport for each ion was calculated up to the point that scaling was detected scaling affects the ion flux as previously demonstrated by asraf snir et al 2018 and can be detected by the voltage increase asraf snir et al 2018 overall ammonium is the dominant charge carrier highest ti followed by sodium and potassium shown in fig 4a the ionic composition of the influent and the load ratio affect the transport of charged species over the cem in the electrodialysis cell the relative ammonium transport decreased with increasing load ratio while the proton transport increased accordingly sodium 0 23 0 02 and potassium 0 16 0 01 transport remain constant probably due ion exchange during the donnan dialysis pre treatment once a gradient is formed between feed and concentrate potassium k and sodium na are exchanged with ammonium nh4 and protons h in the dd cell fig 4b for load ratio higher than one calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 are both transported to the concentrate compartment through the donnan and electrodialysis cems magnesium was only returned to the feed at load ratio 0 5 moreover calcium and magnesium only represented less than 5 of the charge exchange the desired transport of calcium ions to the feed did not occur in this study up to 4 mmol 150 mg of calcium was removed from the supplied influent by dd ed calcite caco3 precipitation occurs even at very low concentrations and ph just slightly above neutral conditions hasson et al 2010 this precipitation can occur simultaneously on the surface and at the pores of the membrane with a continuous electric field transporting cations through the cem a high enough concentration at the membrane solution interface induced precipitation ayala bribiesca et al 2006 belashova et al 2017 causing the obstruction of the membrane pores and possibly membrane dehydration in our system magnesium was also removed to a certain extent and while the analyzed membranes did not show any magnesium salt precipitates its contribution on facilitating calcium precipitation was previously demonstrated the considerable increase of membrane resistance si figure a 3 which is related to the increase of membrane potential is the result of scaling formation at the cation exchange membrane here cems become more resistant to ion transport and as a result water splitting at the surface of the membrane is enhanced andreeva et al 2018 asraf snir et al 2018 the high membrane potential coincides with an increase in the ph of the concentrate fig 5 is the average ph measured over each 12 h in feed and concentrate solutions for different load ratios fig 5 also shows that the average ph of the concentrate is approximately 10 during the first 12 h for load ratio 1 3 and 1 5 the ph of the concentrate was stable for almost three to four days at ph 9 7 with donnan dialysis conversely when operating without donnan dialysis the ph rapidly reached 11 6 a comparison of fig 5 with figure a 3 si reveals that the membrane loss increases sharply when the concentrate ph reached 12 donnan dialysis thus acts to a certain extent as a ph regulator an effect that is enhanced with increased load ratio the transport of protons for high load ratio in the electrodialysis cell combined with the protons exchanged in dd cell decreased the ph of the concentrate fig 5 although the ph was lower the concentration of calcium on the concentrate side increased with time reaching a saturation point earlier experiments have shown that calcium carbonate precipitates at a ph as low as 8 6 koutsoukos and kontoyannis 1984 söhnel and mullin 1982 after scaling precipitation the cem was restored with an acid cleaning in the experiments presented here donnan dialysis extended the operation period and therefore reduced the chemical need as the frequency of cleaning is reduced although donnan dialysis extended the operation period and therefore reduced the chemical need it can still be combined with a in situ cleaning to guarantee the long term operation of the es operation thompson brewster et al 2017 predicted the major scaling site occurring in electrochemical recovery of ammonium to be in the double layer on the concentrate side of the cem the model described how two different pre treatments can reduce the occurrence of scaling such as struvite thompson brewster et al 2017 in our study the predominant anion responsible for scaling was carbonate unlike previous studies that observed phosphate or sulfate precipitation asraf snir et al 2018 thompson brewster et al 2017 as the cem blocks anions we believe co2 formed in acidic conditions is transported by diffusion through the cem and forms carbonate under alkaline conditions in the concentrate solution legrand et al 2020 nikonenko et al 2003 paz garcia et al 2014 as previous work has shown the membrane structure and influent composition must be considered when designing an electrodialysis cell for nutrient recovery andreeva et al 2017 asraf snir et al 2018 belashova et al 2017 bivalent ions are present in several source separated wastewater streams such as black water and urine shi et al 2018 thompson brewster et al 2017 pre treatments that simultaneously minimize the application of chemicals maintain the overall energy demand and limit additional capital investments should be further investigated to prevent scaling and consequently improve the system performance asraf snir et al 2018 zabolotsky et al 1997 by combining electrodialysis and donnan dialysis we extended the operation of an electrochemical system supplied with a complex wastewater from 12 hour to 36 h at the same nitrogen load vs applied current the period of operation was further extended from 36 h up to 84 h by increasing the load ratio from 1 to 1 5 moreover the combined system was able to effectively remove the ammonium present in the influent to less than 100 mg l 1 in the effluent future research should include the performance of the system at higher current densities and the use of other more concentrated streams such as manure 4 conclusion donnan dialysis delayed the scaling effect on cation exchange membranes allowing the operation of an electrodialysis system for a longer period without interruption for cleaning at the same load ratio and current density the combined system operated for 24 h more than a stand alone electrochemical system before the cell voltage increased significantly here donnan dialysis acted as a ph regulator of the concentrate solution and consequently delayed calcite caco3 precipitation by increasing the current compared to the tan loading load ratio the operation window was further extended up to 72 h and consequently increasing the treatment capacity while maintaining a high tan recovery of 83 and consuming 9 7 kwh gn 1 associated content supporting information are available free of charge research data the

2002 at a national scale our analysis provided evidence of a distinct water quality improvement with a gradual decrease in the frequency of prevalence of anoxic conditions an alleviation of the severity of heavy metal pollution whereas the cultural eutrophication has only been moderately mitigated between 2003 and 2018 we also identified significant spatial variation with relatively poorer water quality in eastern china where 17 2 of the sampling sites registered poor water quality conditions compared with only 4 6 in western china total phosphorus tp and ammonia nitrogen nh3 n are

secondary role 20 5 for tp 17 5 for nh3 n two indicator variables of urbanization urban areal extent and nighttime light intensity and farmland areal extent were the strongest predictors of riverine tp nh3 n levels and collectively accounted for most of the ambient nutrient variability we concluded that there is still a long way to go in order to eradicate eutrophication and realize acceptable

quality to capture the dynamics of china s river water quality a monthly sampling program has been conducted at 2424 sampling sites fig 1 by the chinese national environmental monitoring centre the sampling program resulted in a large dataset of 161 337 monthly samples covering a 16 year 2003 2018 period this dataset included twenty four 24 water quality variables listed as the environmental quality standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 while our focus here was on dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and eight heavy metals including copper cu zinc zn selenium se arsenic as mercury hg cadmium cd chromium cr and lead pb 2 1 2 meteorological data to obtain the local meteorological conditions over the spatial domain covered by the

html the wwtp database across china were obtained from a previous study by chen et al 2019 2 2 characterization of river water quality and bayesian modelling framework we adopted a two pronged approach to characterize the river water quality and potential drivers of impairment in china first based on the national river water quality dataset we evaluated water quality status and identified the critical variables causing water quality deterioration using the water quality index wqi det presented by huang et al 2019 given the extensive water quality impairment attributed to tp and nh3 n section 3 2 bayesian models were subsequently developed to examine the strength of the relationships between river tp nh3 n and watershed landscape features or surrogate variables of anthropogenic activities based on these bayesian models we used the posterior parameter patterns to characterize the critical covariates of river water quality impairment in china fig 2 wqi det is an adaptation of the traditional wqi to the five water quality classes of china s environmental quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 i excellent ii good iii moderate iv poor and v bad huang et al 2019 the index can numerically represent a broader range from extremely poor water quality to 100 excellent water quality in order to differentiate between bad and extremely bad water quality conditions wqi det w q i d e t j for a water sample j can be calculated as w q i d e t j min w q i d e t 1 j w q i d e t i j w q i d e t n j w q i d e t i j 100 max 0 c i j c i i c i v c i i 100 where c i j is the concentration of the environmental variable i of the water sample j c i i and c i v are the values concentrations of the variable i at class i and v respectively twelve 12 water quality variables were used to calculate wqi det i e n 12 and their concentrations were evaluated against the corresponding water quality classes table s2 we calculated a wqi det value for each of the 161 337 monthly water samples in the dataset we selected a total of 350 water quality sampling sites within six large river basins liao hai yellow yangtze huai and pearl to elucidate the relative importance of watershed landscape characteristics and proxy variables of human related activities on river water quality the corresponding surrounding catchments were derived by the water flow directions computed by the d8 model in arcgis figure s2 and had a surface area ranging from 436 to 143 539 km2 these sub watersheds were selected based on water flow pathways within the broader river basins and were characterized by different meteorological hydrological conditions and socio economic values sub watersheds in lowland areas were not selected due to their reciprocating water flow paths which rendered unclear watershed boundaries based on the delineated sub watershed boundaries the data for the meteorological conditions watershed landscape and anthropogenic activities for each sub watershed were obtained to provide the predictor variables for our bayesian modelling the first step of our water quality evaluation with wqi det revealed that water quality impairments was mainly caused by excessively high tp and nh3 n concentrations section 3 2 the relationship between the two response variables tp nh3 n and natural or anthropogenic predictors was established through bayesian modelling fig 2 we developed a total of fourteen 14 bayesian models including two national models for tp and nh3 n collectively based on the water quality data at 350 sub watersheds across six major river basins in china and twelve models to reproduce tp and nh3 n concentrations with suitable natural anthropogenic predictors within each of six selected river basins independently the governing equations of our bayesian modelling framework can be summarized as follows c k n c k σ 2 c k θ 0 i 1 n θ i x i k θ m n μ θ σ θ σ 2 g 0 001 0 001 μ θ i n 0 10000 σ θ i w ω ω k 1 k i 1 n where c k denotes the measured tp or nh3 n in site k within any of the modelled river basins or the entire studied spatial domain c k denotes the mean predicted tp or nh3 n in site k σ 2 denotes the model error variance with an associated precision 1 variance term drawn from a gamma g distribution defined by shape and scale parameters equal to 0 001 x i k represents the predictor variables i in site k θ θ 0 θ 1 θ i t is the vector of the regression coefficients drawn from a multivariate normal mn distribution with mean μ θ μ θ 0 μ θ 1 μ θ i t and covariance matrix σ θ which in turn is assigned an inverse wishart prior distribution with scale matrix ω representing an assessment of the magnitude order of the covariance matrix among the regression model parameters bouriga and féron 2013 ω 8 corresponds to the degrees of freedom for this distribution and was set equal to the rank of the σ θ matrix or no prior knowledge on the parameter covariance k 350 and n 8 are the number of sites and predictor variables respectively natural logarithm and arcsine square root transformations were used for both response and predictor variables to ensure that the assumption of normality for model residuals is met the relative contribution w i of each covariate x i to tp and nh3 n variability was calculated as follows θ i θ i θ i s d w i θ i i 1 n θ i where θ i θ i and θ i s d are the posterior standardized mean and standard deviation for the i regression coefficient respectively the suite of predictor variables used to characterize river nutrient variations are classified into natural and anthropogenic variables the natural predictors were elevation m and slope o to represent the natural conditions e g transportation rates with potential impacts on in stream attenuation annual precipitation mm yr and daily average air temperature c to represent the potential impact of weather conditions on flow rates and biogeochemical processes our anthropogenic predictor variables were area percentage of farmland and urban as a proxy of non point source pollution water treatment capacity of wwtps t d km2 to represent china s efforts to mitigate point source pollution nighttime light intensity to quantify the magnitude of human footprint compared with other proxy variables representing human footprint e g population density the nighttime light intensity had a finer spatio temporal granularity and was thus deemed more suitable for our modelling analysis we used the mallows cp criterion to identify the most parsimonious regression models for each river basin and thus our analysis is based on statistical constructs that effectively balance between complexity and performance mallows 2000 moreover as an additional security measure to control the collinearity problem we ensured that the final models included predictor variables with tolerance values greater than 0 5 tolerance is defined as 1 minus the squared multiple correlation of this variable with all other independent variables in the regression equation therefore the smaller the tolerance of a variable the more redundant is its contribution to the regression i e it is redundant with the contribution of other independent variables if the tolerance of any of the variables in the regression equation is equal to zero or very close to zero then the regression equation cannot be evaluated the matrix is ill conditioned and cannot be inverted bayesian modelling was implemented based on the python library of pymc3 specifically developed for bayesian statistical modelling and probabilistic machine learning https docs pymc io we also estimated the effective sampling size of the markov chain monte carlo mcmc chains to assess the quality of the representation of the posterior distribution higher values reflect better the posterior distribution of the parameters we estimated the gelman rubin index and the effective sampling size using the package coda in r plummer et al 2006 vehtari et al 2020 the models performed adequately showing convergence all parameters with gelman rubin estimate 1 05 and low correlation in the mcmc chains samples i e most parameters had an effective sample size 1000 3 results 3 1 characterization of river water quality impairment trends in china our results showed that china s river water quality displayed significant spatial variation with poorer water quality in eastern china fig 3 using the hu huanyong line hu line to distinguish between western and eastern china the frequency of poor water quality samples wqi det 40 was consistently higher in eastern china throughout our survey period 2003 2005 2006 2010 2011 2015 and 2016 2018 for example 17 2 of the sampling sites showed poor water quality in eastern china compared with only 4 6 in the western part of the country during the 2016 2018 period overall our results are on par with the national evaluation by the chinese ministry of ecology and environment during the same period which found that only 8 1 of sampling sites had extremely bad water quality i e worse than class v according to china s environmental quality standards for surface waters gb3838 2002 the ministry of ecology and environment 2020a among china s ten river basins hai and huai river basins had the poorest water quality with a similar median wqi det value of 61 8 in 2016 2018 fig 3d while the rest of the basins had wqi det values higher than 70 water quality in hai and huai river basins has significantly improved in recent years 2016 2018 namely the median wqi det value in hai river basin increased from 64 9 to 61 8 between 2003 2005 and 2016 2018 likewise huai river basin had a median wqi det value that increased from 46 1 to 61 8 in 2016 2018 poor water quality mainly occurred in downstream areas especially in coastal areas in 2016 2018 we found 24 4 30 of the 123 sampling sites in coastal areas 20 km buffer zone from the coastline showed poor water quality this proportion 24 4 is significantly higher than that registered in western china 4 6 six river basins songhua hai liao huai yellow and yangtze showed a positive slope k p 0 01 for the trend line of the median wqi det values fig 4 suggestive of a general water quality improvement during the 2003 2018 period the general water quality improvement in china s rivers was also reinforced by another parallel comparison of sites that have been consistently sampled throughout the 2003 2018 study period see section 1 in supporting information hai river basin was most severely polluted at the beginning of our study period with the lowest intercept 70 7 for the trend line but also showed significant water quality improvement with the highest slope k 9 52 or a 9 52 wqi det increase per year pearl river basin showed a slightly decreasing trend k 0 64 of the median wqi det but showed an increasing trend of the mean wqi det during 2003 2018 this implied that the overall water quality has not improved in pearl river basin but the frequency of extremely poor water quality extremely low wqi det samples is decreasing for visualization purposes the extremely wqi det values 1000 were omitted from the corresponding panel in fig 4 but their influence is manifested with the significant discrepancy between average and median values three river basins southwest southeast and continental did not show a clear changing pattern p 0 05 but their water quality is relatively satisfactory a clear pattern of decreasing wqi det trend p 0 01 from upstream to downstream sites was also found in yellow and yangtze rivers in particular water quality in yangtze river displayed a discernible decline between the middle and downstream areas yichang shanghai fig 5 liao hai and huai rivers did not show a clear changing pattern p 0 05 probably due to their high population density throughout the corresponding catchments areas interestingly pearl river showed relatively poor water quality at the upstream sites followed by a gradual water quality improvement downstream however three sites near the city of wuzhou displayed low wqi det values due to excessively high hg concentrations in april of 2018 fig 5 but the signature of this elevated hg incident dissipated downstream of the three sites the absolute number of water samples indicative of impaired conditions wqi det 0 showed a slightly decreasing trend from 2003 to 2015 but had an abrupt increase from 2016 and thereafter mainly stemming from the increased number of samples collected fig 6 a evidence of impaired water quality conditions was found in 30 6 741 2424 of all the sampling sites across china s rivers in a similar manner we used the relative frequency that each variable resulted in negative wqi det values to identify the most sensitive indicators of water quality impairment in china s rivers during the 2003 2018 period our results revealed a decreasing contribution of variables reflecting either the bioavailable oxygen do or the amount that can be consumed by reactions cod a fairly constant relative frequency of elevated nh3 n an increasing tp contribution to water quality impairment and a very small proportion of hm pollution fig 6a the decreasing proportion from 17 9 do and 22 2 cod in 2003 to 4 8 do and 5 3 cod in 2018 collectively offers a more optimistic perspective regarding the habitat suitability for a diverse range of biotic communities in fact only 20 sampling sites registered samples that reflected impaired water quality conditions due to do all located near large cities moreover there was a very low percentage 0 3 of severe hm hg as cd pb and se pollution recorded in 14 sampling sites during the end of our study period in stark contrast water quality impairment is primarily associated with elevated tp and nh3 n concentrations fig 6b among the 741 sampling sites with impaired conditions 648 sites registered excessively high tp nh3 n levels tp showed an increasing proportion from 9 86 in 2003 to 35 4 in 2018 in terms of the actual tp concentrations our analysis did not reveal distinctly declining trends except from the liao and yangtze river basins figure s3 in fact the vast majority of the ten river basins frequently displayed high tp concentrations 0 1 mg l during the 2016 2018 period evidence of statistically significant reduction in nh3 n levels was found in songhua hai huai yellow and yangtze river basins but high concentrations 0 5 mg nh3 n l continue to register with high frequency across all the major river basins figure s4 overall our attempt to characterize the river water quality in china provided evidence that tp and nh3 n are collectively responsible for 85 of the identified incidences of impaired water quality in recent years 2016 2018 3 2 covariates of nutrient variability in china s rivers comparison between measured and predicted values along the six large rivers liao hai yellow yangtze huai and pearl showed that our bayesian models were generally able to recreate both tp and nh3 n concentrations with p 0 01 and low predictive bias figures s5 and s6 among the covariates considered the anthropogenic predictors had a larger contribution 82 5 for tp and 79 5 for nh3 n compared with natural drivers 20 5 for tp and 17 5 for nh3 n when pooling the data from all six river basins together fig 7 a moreover the posterior regression coefficients related to anthropogenic drivers had distinctly lower coefficients of variation compared with those for the natural drivers which is suggestive of a higher degree of identification low uncertainty of the corresponding relationships with tp nh3 n concentrations table s3 among the four selected natural drivers elevation displayed a discernible contribution to nutrient variability ranging anywhere from 6 to 42 with only exception being the huai river in the latter basin slope appeared to be the strongest covariate of riverine tp and nh3 n levels by contrast precipitation and less so air temperature were weak predictors for both tp and nh3 n concentrations across the six studied basins regarding the selected anthropogenic drivers our analysis showed that the percentage of farmland and urban area and nighttime light intensity were critical covariates for tp and nh3 n riverine levels fig 7b table s3 the urban areal extent within any given watershed showed a consistently positive relationship with the two nutrient concentrations the same pattern held true for the farmland area except from the huai river where this relationship displayed a counterintuitive negative sign water treatment capacity had the lowest contribution average value 10 to both tp and nh3 n variability except from the yangtze river basin where a somewhat higher contribution 15 was registered fig 7a interestingly the nighttime light intensity had a distinct signature 35 on the two nutrient levels in yellow and pearl river basins as well as in all 350 sub watersheds 72 9 and 61 6 for tp and nh3 n when pooled together fig 7a the latter result is reinforced by the spatial variability of the water quality impairments where several hot spots of poor water quality were registered in four highly urbanized areas namely beijing tianjin nanjing shanghai kunming shenyang yellow and red colors in fig 8 a by contrast sampling sites close to cities in central or western china e g lanzhou with lower population density did not register severe water quality impairments the spatial pattern of water quality bears a great deal of resemblance to that of average nighttime light intensity during 2016 2018 with high values of the latter predictor variable representing higher population size and density fig 8b 4 discussion food security urbanization environmental degradation and climate change are major challenges facing china in the 21st century being the largest developing country china has experienced fast transition from centrally planned to market orientated economy during the past three decades which was accompanied by rapid urbanization and major land use conversion liu et al 2014 striving to achieve a food production increase by 30 50 to meet projected demands agriculture is increasingly intensified which has caused adverse environmental impacts and widespread degradation of surface waters cui et al 2018 liu and li 2017 to alleviate the pressure exerted from point and non point sources china has taken remedial measures to restore its precious freshwater sources consequently the construction of wastewater treatment plants has grown rapidly resulting in an increase from 40 to 90 of municipal wastewater being treated on the national scale within a time span of just over a decade tong et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 on the other hand tackling the problem of excess non point nutrient sources by reducing fertilizer application rates and implementing watershed beneficial management practices has had less clear results liu et al 2016 even more so little work has been done to evaluate the impact of all these remedial measures on the water quality of rivers at a national scale in this context the present study compiled a 16 year dataset of river water quality meteorological conditions and variables related to anthropogenic activities landscape features to evaluate the degree of success brought about by all the recent efforts to combat water pollution 4 1 how do anthropogenic factors and natural characteristics covary with china s river water quality our attempt to characterize the signature of anthropogenic activities required to parse out the role of natural factors such as meteorological conditions and landscape characteristics in shaping riverine water quality when considering all 350 sub watersheds across china our analysis was able to discern a weakly negative relationship between elevation and or slope and tp nh3 n concentrations figure s7 suggesting that sites in higher elevations and or steeper slopes registered lower nutrient levels the slope of the catchment determines the water velocity and erosion severity whereby mountainous rivers with higher slopes are expected to be subjected to faster flow velocities and more severe erosion and thus shorter water retention times compared with lowland rivers palmer and ruhi 2019 however our analysis did not render universal support to the latter hypothesis partly due to the confounding effects of anthropogenic drivers that tend to negatively covary with the catchment elevation or slope figures s7 s8 namely lowland low slope catchment areas are generally more urbanized with higher nutrient export figure s8 it is important to note though that the impacts of slope on water quality can also be influenced by the increasing number of dams in china due to their considerable capability to modulate nutrient retention maavara et al 2015 precipitation can determine the amount of inflowing water via surface and subsurface processes from urban areas or farmlands and may thus significantly modulate the degree of nutrient loading from non point sources stockwell et al 2020 recent research has shown that both particulate and bioavailable phosphorus loads can vary by orders of magnitude between wet and dry conditions long et al 2014 2015 emerging evidence also suggests that a significant fraction of the annual phosphorus loads can be generated during a small number of brief but intense precipitation events while the association of phosphorus with stormwater is plausible the flow concentration relationship can be profoundly modulated by factors such as watershed physiography land use patterns and antecedent conditions green et al 2007 an overarching precipitation concentration paradigm for nitrogen species is even less clear relative to that for phosphorus given that a greater proportion of total nitrogen is found in the dissolved phase due to relatively high solubility of nitrogen species such as nitrite and nitrate and can be transported by subsurface and groundwater flow pathways long et al 2014 our expectation of a positive association between tp nh3 n and precipitation manifested itself only in liao river table s3 this is because precipitation is highly correlated to elevation with a correlation coefficient of 0 99 figure s8 therefore elevation was selected as a covariate for the riverine nutrient levels instead of precipitation similarly air temperature can directly influence riverine thermal regimes and biogeochemical processes such as nitrification denitrification ammonification and sediment diagenesis rates van vliet et al 2013 xia et al 2018 yang et al 2020 although existing evidence suggests warmer temperatures result in higher recycling rates and consequently higher nutrient retention in rivers xia et al 2018 our analysis was not able to fully disentangle the temperature control on the ambient tp nh3 n levels given its covariance with other natural or anthropogenic predictor variables figures s7 s8 counter to the relatively minor role of the natural factors considered in our analysis the nighttime light intensity and the percentage of the urban area were the strongest predictors of riverine tp nh3 n levels and collectively accounted for most of the nutrient variability registered in the study sites these distinctly positive relationships across all the major subwatersheds could reflect the influence of a suite of factors associated with the urban environment such as inefficient stormwater management suboptimal operating wwtp performance underdeveloped sewers and sludge disposal facilities jiang et al 2018 qu et al 2019 in particular sustainable urban stormwater management is one of china s emerging challenges where the infrastructural investments have not been on par with the continuous population growth rapid urbanization and socio economic development taken together with the changing weather patterns and climate the urban pluvial flooding gradually becomes a regular hydrometeorological phenomenon that has repeatedly affected many megacities in china du et al 2015a 2015b liu and wang 2016 to address the broader impact of the on going urbanization and development process the chinese government has established a national initiative termed sponge cities as a holistic strategy that combines innovative technologies effective governance and broader community engagement to bring sustainable stormwater management into fruition jiang et al 2018 water treatment capacity of wwtps was another predictor considered to reproduce of the riverine nutrient variability the rationale behind the selection of this covariate reflected china s efforts in building municipal wwtps 5000 and enforce more stringent effluent discharge standards during the past decades huang et al 2019 the ministry of ecology and environment 2020b china may have now the world s largest municipal wastewater infrastructure with a daily treatment capacity of nearly 200 million m3 d and a wastewater treatment ratio of over 90 qu et al 2019 however our analysis suggests a positive covariance between tp nh3 n and wwtp treatment capacity table s3 while this finding simply suggests the wwtp treatment capacity may not be the most sensitive variable to recreate the recent riverine nutrient trends it could also reflect the fact that there are still considerable gaps in the design principles and operation performances of the treatment facilities lagged development of sewer systems disparity between the effluent discharge standards and the local conditions and environmental protection demands and lack of appropriate sludge disposal qu et al 2019 viewed from this perspective the water treatment capacity of wwtps alone is not sufficient to predict the response of riverine ecosystems and thus other surrogate variables of the urban environment percentage urban area nighttime light intensity displayed stronger covariance with the water quality non point source pollution from agriculture has been widely recognized as a critically important source of nutrients into surface waters due to intensive fertilization china s crop production maintained an average p fertilization rate of 80 kg ha in 2012 which was twice as high as what crops can assimilate liu et al 2016 recognizing the challenges to accurately estimate the magnitude of non point source pollution ongley et al 2010 shen et al 2012 we postulated that the area percentage of farmland could display a discernible positive covariance with riverine tp nh3 n concentrations although our proxy of non point source pollution from agriculture did not consistently register a distinct signature across the six river basins studied it does support our hypothesis when pooling all the watersheds together fig 7b even though significant progress has been made in terms of the n and p loading export from agriculture farming aquaculture livestock and poultry between 2007 1 598 109 kg tn and 1 087 108 kg tp and 2017 7 195 108 kg tn and 7 62 107 kg tp the ministry of ecology and environment 2020b there is still a lot of grounds to cover in order to effectively mitigate non point source pollution to further address this issue there are recommendations for a more efficient paradigm with p fertilizer management to address the dual challenge of p resource conservation and eutrophication mitigation which will sustain future food production and maintain the integrity of freshwater ecosystems liu et al 2016 in particular it has been argued that china could delay exhausting its p reserves by over 20 years by improving its agronomic p use efficiency defined as the ratio of the useful p output in products to the total p inputs in an ecosystem to the average level of 80 in developed countries without any major implications for the targeted crop yields withers et al 2014 4 2 challenges and on going research questions with the river water quality management in china our study provided evidence of a distinct water quality improvement in china s major rivers with a gradual decrease in the frequency of prevalence of anoxic conditions an alleviation of the severity of heavy metal pollution and moderate success with the mitigation of cultural eutrophication during the 2003 2018 period we also identified significant spatial variation with relatively poorer water quality in eastern china nearby the major metropolitan areas of beijing tianjin nanjing shanghai kunming and shenyang the fact that more than 85 of the identified incidences of impaired conditions are associated with high nutrient concentrations suggests that our efforts to control point and non point source pollution should be further intensified notwithstanding the significant progress of china s wastewater treatment plant sector the ubiquitous problems of the existing infrastructure underdeveloped sewers and sludge disposal facilities low sustainability of the treatment processes mismatch between effluent discharge standards and environmental protection demands represent one of the next management priorities with the increasing prevalence of agricultural non point source pollution best management practices bmps are an emerging imperative in our efforts to prevent or reduce water pollution founded upon the pollution control theory of source reduction interception repair bmps are increasingly applied in china s agricultural lands to mitigate non point source pollution and restore aquatic ecosystems with variant results nonetheless the design of bmps should accommodate recent conceptual and technical advancements regarding the life cycle non stationarity the variability in their starting operational efficiency differential response to storm events or seasonality dependence of operational performance on watershed geological conditions and expected decline in performance over time owing to different maintenance practices increase the uncertainty of bmp efficiency arhonditsis et al 2019b c liu et al 2018 except from the mitigation of external loading the complex interplay among instream physical e g flow regimes water temperature chemical e g adsorption desorption and biological e g microbial decomposition processes can profoundly modulate the ambient nutrient levels in particular sediment water interfaces have been the research focus of the nutrient cycling in rivers but recent evidence suggests that suspended particle water interfaces in the water column could also be hotspot of nutrient transformations xia et al 2018 suspended particles are key determinants in the transport reactivity and biological impacts of chemicals lin et al 2021 for example adsorption of dissolved phosphate onto inorganic particles particularly amorphous iron oxyhydroxides is considered a critical process to control bioavailable phosphate to relatively low levels pan et al 2013 depending on the reactivity of particles there are critical thresholds of suspended matter concentrations below which water quality problems could become more severe even if the exogenous nutrient loading control is successful another interesting perspective of the tight coupling external loading instream processes was recently offered by tong et al 2020 who argued that the growing imbalance between the rates of reduction of tn and tp external loading could lead to distinct differences in the nutrient stoichiometry e g tn tp ratios of the receiving waterbodies and ultimately impact the risks of harmful algal blooms and broader ecosystem integrity a final note of consideration involves the granularity of the assessment of the progress of china s river water quality as we move forward we advocate the assessment of the prevailing conditions using individual water quality snapshots based on samples collected regularly from different sites throughout the year rather than any type of data aggregation in time and or space the latter strategy may not be reflective of the wide range of spatiotemporal dynamics typically experienced in any riverine ecosystem nor does it allow us to evaluate our progress with ecosystem services at the degree of granularity required to assess the public sentiment it would seem paradoxical to expect a single valued average reflective of the central tendency of multiple samples to capture the degree of public satisfaction which is often determined by the occurrence of water quality extremes e g hypoxia leading to fish deaths harmful algal blooms notably while our delineation of the general trends based on yearly averages or medians painted a favourable picture regarding the riverine water quality in china the reality is that excessively high pollutant concentrations are even frequently experienced even in rivers that have demonstrably shown significant improvement figures s3 and s4 for example more than 30 and 50 of the samples collected from all the sites across the yellow river in 2018 registered nh3 n and po4 concentrations greater than 0 5 mg l and 0 1 mg l respectively similar or even higher exceedance frequencies are still experienced in other rivers huai yangtze with significant progress during our study period which reinforces the point that china needs to intensify its nutrient management policies qin et al 2020 the proposed assessment of the water quality status that revolves around extreme or maximum allowable pollutant levels has the conceptual advantage that not only tracks directly the actual incidences of water quality impairment but is also closely connected with the targeted ecosystem services offered from riverine ecosystems arhonditsis et al 2019a 5 conclusions china s river water quality patterns and underlying covariates were characterized at a national scale to evaluate the recent progress and on going challenges in river management our analysis revealed a distinct water quality improvement with a gradual decrease in the frequency of prevalence of anoxic conditions an alleviation of the severity of heavy metal pollution and moderate success with the mitigation of cultural eutrophication during 2003 2018 river water quality is poorer in eastern china compared with that in western china tp and nh3 n are collectively responsible for 85 of the identified incidences of impaired conditions our bayesian modelling results revealed that the frequency of water quality impairments predominantly displays stronger relationships with anthropogenic covariates 82 5 for tp 79 5 for nh3 n compared with natural factors 20 5 for tp 17 5 for nh3 n although considerable success was achieved in water quality restoration in china s rivers it is still challenging to eradicate eutrophication and realize acceptable ecological conditions the design of the remedial measures must be tailored to the site specific landscape characteristics meteorological conditions and should also consider the increasing importance of non point source pollution and internal nutrient loading

16842,food production systems urbanization and other anthropogenic activities dramatically alter natural hydrological and nutrient cycles and are primarily responsible for water quality impairments in china s rivers this study compiled a 16 year 2003 2018 dataset of river water quality 161 337 records from 2424 sites watershed landscape features and meteorological conditions to investigate the spatial water quality patterns and underlying drivers of river impairment defined as water quality worse than class v according to china s environmental quality standards for surface waters gb3838 2002 at a national scale our analysis provided evidence of a distinct water quality improvement with a gradual decrease in the frequency of prevalence of anoxic conditions an alleviation of the severity of heavy metal pollution whereas the cultural eutrophication has only been moderately mitigated between 2003 and 2018 we also identified significant spatial variation with relatively poorer water quality in eastern china where 17 2 of the sampling sites registered poor water quality conditions compared with only 4 6 in western china total phosphorus tp and ammonia nitrogen nh3 n are collectively responsible for 85 of the identified incidences of impaired conditions bayesian modelling was used to delineate the most significant covariates of tp nh3 n riverine levels in six large river basins liao hai yellow yangtze huai and pearl water quality impairments are predominantly shaped by anthropogenic drivers 82 5 for tp 79 5 for nh3 n whereas natural factors appear to play a secondary role 20 5 for tp 17 5 for nh3 n two indicator variables of urbanization urban areal extent and nighttime light intensity and farmland areal extent were the strongest predictors of riverine tp nh3 n levels and collectively accounted for most of the ambient nutrient variability we concluded that there is still a long way to go in order to eradicate eutrophication and realize acceptable ecological conditions the design of the remedial measures must be tailored to the site specific landscape characteristics meteorological conditions and should also consider the increasing importance

grill et al 2019 lehner et al 2011 palmer and ruhi 2019 however river ecosystems are globally experiencing considerable degradation due to a multitude of stressors including damming and water pollution lebreton et al 2017 maavara et al 2020 singh et al 2019 dam construction has resulted in 2 8 million dams worldwide that have substantially altered river connectivity and biogeochemical cycling lehner et al 2011 maavara et al 2020 2015 a global investigation on 12 million kilometers of rivers revealed that only 37 of rivers longer than 1000 km remain free flowing over their entire

elevated water security risks vörösmarty et al 2010 and one in three people worldwide do not have access to safe drinking water as reported by the sustainable development goal sdg of the united nations united nations 2020 china s rivers have been subjected to profound water quality impairments induced by the rapid and energy intensive economic development over the past several decades chen et al 2019 this water quality impairment is particularly disconcerting due to its potentially deleterious impacts on 1 4 billion population estimates of pollutant inputs into china s rivers vary considerably and may be up to 2 8 107 tonnes of dissolved nitrogen 3 106 tonnes of dissolved phosphorus chen et al 2019 and nearly 2 5 104 tonnes of antibiotics per year zhang et al 2015 a nationwide

china s water pollution has been responsible for a shortage of 40 billion tonnes of water per year tao and xin 2014 thus addressing river water quality and freshwater security issues in china is widely recognized as one of the emerging imperatives during the 21st century to shed light on the water quality patterns and underlying mechanisms in china s rivers numerous modelling studies of high

riverine nutrient over enrichment are of particular concern owing to its causal linkages with cultural eutrophication strokal et al 2016 while other pollutants e g antibiotics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are gradually receiving more attention li et al 2006 singh et al 2019 critical factors shaping river water quality are greatly diverse across geographical regions including hydrological regimes mainly driven by precipitation strokal et al 2016 yi et al 2017 watershed landscape features and anthropogenic activities such as land use ding et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 or wastewater treatment plants wwtps singh et al 2019 in the same context the establishment of the relationships between river water quality and covariates that reflect the intensity of anthropogenic activities and watershed natural characteristics within a watershed context represents a critical next step in advancing our contemporary understanding of the large scale water quality patterns and underlying drivers this piece of information can help us to identify hot spots and hot moments of water quality impairments and to optimize the design of restoration practices at a national scale to investigate the spatial water quality patterns and critical covariates of river impairment we compiled 16 year 2003 2018 datasets of river water quality watershed landscape features elevation slope land uses nighttime light intensity spatial distribution and treatment capacity of wastewater plants and meteorological conditions at a national scale to the best of our knowledge this is by far the most comprehensive dataset representing china s river water quality at a national scale our study first evaluates the river water quality in china in terms of the severity of cultural eutrophication i e nutrient concentrations hypoxia severity and heavy metal pollution we then develop bayesian models to delineate the most significant covariates of water quality in six large liao hai yellow yangtze huai and pearl river basins drawing upon the wide variability contained into our national dataset the delineation of the relationships between water quality and critical covariates can enhance our understanding of river response to anthropogenic stressors within a watershed context 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data a recent study by wang et al 2019 estimated that there are more than 20 000 rivers with a catchment area larger than 100 km2 in china s ten river basins fig 1 to map water quality in china s rivers we compiled the following national datasets 2 1 1 river water quality to capture the dynamics of china s river water quality a monthly sampling program has been conducted at 2424 sampling sites fig 1 by the chinese national environmental monitoring centre the sampling program resulted in a large dataset of 161 337 monthly samples covering a 16 year 2003 2018 period this dataset included twenty four 24 water quality variables listed as the environmental quality standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 while our focus here was on dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and eight heavy metals including copper cu zinc zn selenium se arsenic as mercury hg cadmium cd chromium cr and lead pb 2 1 2 meteorological data to obtain the local meteorological conditions over the spatial domain covered by the national stream network we used the chinese meteorological forcing dataset cmfd which has a fine spatio temporal resolution with gridded near surface meteorological data developed specifically for studies of land surface processes across china http data tpdc ac cn zh hans data 8028b944 daaa 4511 8769 965612652c49 the dataset has a spatial resolution of 0 1 and includes information for seven

html the wwtp database across china were obtained from a previous study by chen et al 2019 2 2 characterization of river water quality and bayesian modelling framework we adopted a two pronged approach to characterize the river water quality and potential drivers of impairment in china first based on the national river water quality dataset we evaluated water quality status and identified the critical variables causing water quality deterioration using the water quality index wqi det presented by huang et al 2019 given the extensive water quality impairment attributed to tp and nh3 n section 3 2 bayesian models were subsequently developed to examine the strength of the relationships between river tp nh3 n and watershed landscape features or surrogate variables of anthropogenic activities based on these bayesian models we used the posterior parameter patterns to characterize the critical covariates of river water quality impairment in china fig 2 wqi det is an adaptation of the traditional wqi to the five water quality classes of china s environmental quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 i excellent ii good iii moderate iv poor and v bad huang et al 2019 the index can numerically represent a broader range from extremely poor water quality to 100 excellent water quality in order to differentiate between bad and extremely bad water quality conditions wqi det w q i d e t j for a water sample j can be calculated as w q i d e t j min w q i d e t 1 j w q i d e t i j w q i d e t n j w q i d e t i j 100 max 0 c i j c i i c i v c i i 100 where c i j is the concentration of the environmental variable i of the water sample j c i i and c i v are the values concentrations of the variable i at class i and v respectively twelve 12 water quality variables were used to calculate wqi det i e n 12 and their concentrations were evaluated against the corresponding water quality classes table s2 we calculated a wqi det value for each of the 161 337 monthly water samples in the dataset we selected a total of 350 water quality sampling sites within six large river basins liao hai yellow yangtze huai and pearl to elucidate the relative importance of watershed landscape characteristics and proxy variables of human related activities on river water quality the corresponding surrounding catchments were derived by the water flow directions computed by the d8 model in arcgis figure s2 and had a surface area ranging from 436 to 143 539 km2 these sub watersheds were selected based on water flow pathways within the broader river basins and were characterized by different meteorological hydrological conditions and socio economic values sub watersheds in lowland areas were not selected due to their reciprocating water flow paths which rendered unclear watershed boundaries based on the delineated sub watershed boundaries the data for the meteorological conditions watershed landscape and anthropogenic activities for each sub watershed were obtained to provide the predictor variables for our bayesian modelling the first step of our water quality evaluation with wqi det revealed that water quality impairments was mainly caused by excessively high tp and nh3 n concentrations section 3 2 the relationship between the two response variables tp nh3 n and natural or anthropogenic predictors was established through bayesian modelling fig 2 we developed a total of fourteen 14 bayesian models including two national models for tp and nh3 n collectively based on the water quality data at 350 sub watersheds across six major river basins in china and twelve models to reproduce tp and nh3 n concentrations with suitable natural anthropogenic predictors within each of six selected river basins independently the governing equations of our bayesian modelling framework can be summarized as follows c k n c k σ 2 c k θ 0 i 1 n θ i x i k θ m n μ θ σ θ σ 2 g 0 001 0 001 μ θ i n 0 10000 σ θ i w ω ω k 1 k i 1 n where c k denotes the measured tp or nh3 n in site k within any of the modelled river basins or the entire studied spatial domain c k denotes the mean predicted tp or nh3 n in site k σ 2 denotes the model error variance with an associated precision 1 variance term drawn from a gamma g distribution defined by shape and scale parameters equal to 0 001 x i k represents the predictor variables i in site k θ θ 0 θ 1 θ i t is the vector of the regression coefficients drawn from a multivariate normal mn distribution with mean μ θ μ θ 0 μ θ 1 μ θ i t and covariance matrix σ θ which in turn is assigned an inverse wishart prior distribution with scale matrix ω representing an assessment of the magnitude order of the covariance matrix among the regression model parameters bouriga and féron 2013 ω 8 corresponds to the degrees of freedom for this distribution and was set equal to the rank of the σ θ matrix or no prior knowledge on the parameter covariance k 350 and n 8 are the number of sites and predictor variables respectively natural logarithm and arcsine square root transformations were used for both response and predictor variables to ensure that the assumption of normality for model residuals is met the relative contribution w i of each covariate x i to tp and nh3 n variability was calculated as follows θ i θ i θ i s d w i θ i i 1 n θ i where θ i θ i and θ i s d are the posterior standardized mean and standard deviation for the i regression coefficient respectively the suite of predictor variables used to characterize river nutrient variations are classified into natural and anthropogenic variables the natural predictors were elevation m and slope o to represent the natural conditions e g transportation rates with potential impacts on in stream attenuation annual precipitation mm yr and daily average air temperature c to represent the potential impact of weather conditions on flow rates and biogeochemical processes our anthropogenic predictor variables were area percentage of farmland and urban as a proxy of non point source pollution water treatment capacity of wwtps t d km2 to represent china s efforts to mitigate point source pollution nighttime light intensity to quantify the magnitude of human footprint compared with other proxy variables representing human footprint e g population density the nighttime light intensity had a finer spatio temporal granularity and was thus deemed more suitable for our modelling analysis we used the mallows cp criterion to identify the most parsimonious regression models for each river basin and thus our analysis is based on statistical constructs that effectively balance between complexity and performance mallows 2000 moreover as an additional security measure to control the collinearity problem we ensured that the final models included predictor variables with tolerance values greater than 0 5 tolerance is defined as 1 minus the squared multiple correlation of this variable with all other independent variables in the regression equation therefore the smaller the tolerance of a variable the more redundant is its contribution to the regression i e it is redundant with the contribution of other independent variables if the tolerance of any of the variables in the regression equation is equal to zero or very close to zero then the regression equation cannot be evaluated the matrix is ill conditioned and cannot be inverted bayesian modelling was implemented based on the python library of pymc3 specifically developed for bayesian statistical modelling and probabilistic machine learning https docs pymc io we also estimated the effective sampling size of the markov chain monte carlo mcmc chains to assess the quality of the representation of the posterior distribution higher values reflect better the posterior distribution of the parameters we estimated the gelman rubin index and the effective sampling size using the package coda in r plummer et al 2006 vehtari et al 2020 the models performed adequately showing convergence all parameters with gelman rubin estimate 1 05 and low correlation in the mcmc chains samples i e most parameters had an effective sample size 1000 3 results 3 1 characterization of river water quality impairment trends in china our results showed that china s river water quality displayed significant spatial variation with poorer water quality in eastern china fig 3 using the hu huanyong line hu line to distinguish between western and eastern china the frequency of poor water quality samples wqi det 40 was consistently higher in eastern china throughout our survey period 2003 2005 2006 2010 2011 2015 and 2016 2018 for example 17 2 of the sampling sites showed poor water quality in eastern china compared with only 4 6 in the western part of the country during the 2016 2018 period overall our results are on par with the national evaluation by the chinese ministry of ecology and environment during the same period which found that only 8 1 of sampling sites had extremely bad water quality i e worse than class v according to china s environmental quality standards for surface waters gb3838 2002 the ministry of ecology and environment 2020a among china s ten river basins hai and huai river basins had the poorest water quality with a similar median wqi det value of 61 8 in 2016 2018 fig 3d while the rest of the basins had wqi det values higher than 70 water quality in hai and huai river basins has significantly improved in recent years 2016 2018 namely the median wqi det value in hai river basin increased from 64 9 to 61 8 between 2003 2005 and 2016 2018 likewise huai river basin had a median wqi det value that increased from 46 1 to 61 8 in 2016 2018 poor water quality mainly occurred in downstream areas especially in coastal areas in 2016 2018 we found 24 4 30 of the 123 sampling sites in coastal areas 20 km buffer zone from the coastline showed poor water quality this proportion 24 4 is significantly higher than that registered in western china 4 6 six river basins songhua hai liao huai yellow and yangtze showed a positive slope k p 0 01 for the trend line of the median wqi det values fig 4 suggestive of a general water quality improvement during the 2003 2018 period the general water quality improvement in china s rivers was also reinforced by another parallel comparison of sites that have been consistently sampled throughout the 2003 2018 study period see section 1 in supporting information hai river basin was most severely polluted at the beginning of our study period with the lowest intercept 70 7 for the trend line but also showed significant water quality improvement with the highest slope k 9 52 or a 9 52 wqi det increase per year pearl river basin showed a slightly decreasing trend k 0 64 of the median wqi det but showed an increasing trend of the mean wqi det during 2003 2018 this implied that the overall water quality has not improved in pearl river basin but the frequency of extremely poor water quality extremely low wqi det samples is decreasing for visualization purposes the extremely wqi det values 1000 were omitted from the corresponding panel in fig 4 but their influence is manifested with the significant discrepancy between average and median values three river basins southwest southeast and continental did not show a clear changing pattern p 0 05 but their water quality is relatively satisfactory a clear pattern of decreasing wqi det trend p 0 01 from upstream to downstream sites was also found in yellow and yangtze rivers in particular water quality in yangtze river displayed a discernible decline between the middle and downstream areas yichang shanghai fig 5 liao hai and huai rivers did not show a clear changing pattern p 0 05 probably due to their high population density throughout the corresponding catchments areas interestingly pearl river showed relatively poor water quality at the upstream sites followed by a gradual water quality improvement downstream however three sites near the city of wuzhou displayed low wqi det values due to excessively high hg concentrations in april of 2018 fig 5 but the signature of this elevated hg incident dissipated downstream of the three sites the absolute number of water samples indicative of impaired conditions wqi det 0 showed a slightly decreasing trend from 2003 to 2015 but had an abrupt increase from 2016 and thereafter mainly stemming from the increased number of samples collected fig 6 a evidence of impaired water quality conditions was found in 30 6 741 2424 of all the sampling sites across china s rivers in a similar manner we used the relative frequency that each variable resulted in negative wqi det values to identify the most sensitive indicators of water quality impairment in china s rivers during the 2003 2018 period our results revealed a decreasing contribution of variables reflecting either the bioavailable oxygen do or the amount that can be consumed by reactions cod a fairly constant relative frequency of elevated nh3 n an increasing tp contribution to water quality impairment and a very small proportion of hm pollution fig 6a the decreasing proportion from 17 9 do and 22 2 cod in 2003 to 4 8 do and 5 3 cod in 2018 collectively offers a more optimistic perspective regarding the habitat suitability for a diverse range of biotic communities in fact only 20 sampling sites registered samples that reflected impaired water quality conditions due to do all located near large cities moreover there was a very low percentage 0 3 of severe hm hg as cd pb and se pollution recorded in 14 sampling sites during the end of our study period in stark contrast water quality impairment is primarily associated with elevated tp and nh3 n concentrations fig 6b among the 741 sampling sites with impaired conditions 648 sites registered excessively high tp nh3 n levels tp showed an increasing proportion from 9 86 in 2003 to 35 4 in 2018 in terms of the actual tp concentrations our analysis did not reveal distinctly declining trends except from the liao and yangtze river basins figure s3 in fact the vast majority of the ten river basins frequently displayed high tp concentrations 0 1 mg l during the 2016 2018 period evidence of statistically significant reduction in nh3 n levels was found in songhua hai huai yellow and yangtze river basins but high concentrations 0 5 mg nh3 n l continue to register with high frequency across all the major river basins figure s4 overall our attempt to characterize the river water quality in china provided evidence that tp and nh3 n are collectively responsible for 85 of the identified incidences of impaired water quality in recent years 2016 2018 3 2 covariates of nutrient variability in china s rivers comparison between measured and predicted values along the six large rivers liao hai yellow yangtze huai and pearl showed that our bayesian models were generally able to recreate both tp and nh3 n concentrations with p 0 01 and low predictive bias figures s5 and s6 among the covariates considered the anthropogenic predictors had a larger contribution 82 5 for tp and 79 5 for nh3 n compared with natural drivers 20 5 for tp and 17 5 for nh3 n when pooling the data from all six river basins together fig 7 a moreover the posterior regression coefficients related to anthropogenic drivers had distinctly lower coefficients of variation compared with those for the natural drivers which is suggestive of a higher degree of identification low uncertainty of the corresponding relationships with tp nh3 n concentrations table s3 among the four selected natural drivers elevation displayed a discernible contribution to nutrient variability ranging anywhere from 6 to 42 with only exception being the huai river in the latter basin slope appeared to be the strongest covariate of riverine tp and nh3 n levels by contrast precipitation and less so air temperature were weak predictors for both tp and nh3 n concentrations across the six studied basins regarding the selected anthropogenic drivers our analysis showed that the percentage of farmland and urban area and nighttime light intensity were critical covariates for tp and nh3 n riverine levels fig 7b table s3 the urban areal extent within any given watershed showed a consistently positive relationship with the two nutrient concentrations the same pattern held true for the farmland area except from the huai river where this relationship displayed a counterintuitive negative sign water treatment capacity had the lowest contribution average value 10 to both tp and nh3 n variability except from the yangtze river basin where a somewhat higher contribution 15 was registered fig 7a interestingly the nighttime light intensity had a distinct signature 35 on the two nutrient levels in yellow and pearl river basins as well as in all 350 sub watersheds 72 9 and 61 6 for tp and nh3 n when pooled together fig 7a the latter result is reinforced by the spatial variability of the water quality impairments where several hot spots of poor water quality were registered in four highly urbanized areas namely beijing tianjin nanjing shanghai kunming shenyang yellow and red colors in fig 8 a by contrast sampling sites close to cities in central or western china e g lanzhou with lower population density did not register severe water quality impairments the spatial pattern of water quality bears a great deal of resemblance to that of average nighttime light intensity during 2016 2018 with high values of the latter predictor variable representing higher population size and density fig 8b 4 discussion food security urbanization environmental degradation and climate change are major challenges facing china in the 21st century being the largest developing country china has experienced fast transition from centrally planned to market orientated economy during the past three decades which was accompanied by rapid urbanization and major land use conversion liu et al 2014 striving to achieve a food production increase by 30 50 to meet projected demands agriculture is increasingly intensified which has caused adverse environmental impacts and widespread degradation of surface waters cui et al 2018 liu and li 2017 to alleviate the pressure exerted from point and non point sources china has taken remedial measures to restore its precious freshwater sources consequently the construction of wastewater treatment plants has grown rapidly resulting in an increase from 40 to 90 of municipal wastewater being treated on the national scale within a time span of just over a decade tong et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 on the other hand tackling the problem of excess non point nutrient sources by reducing fertilizer application rates and implementing watershed beneficial management practices has had less clear results liu et al 2016 even more so little work has been done to evaluate the impact of all these remedial measures on the water quality of rivers at a national scale in this context the present study compiled a 16 year dataset of river water quality meteorological conditions and variables related to anthropogenic activities landscape features to evaluate the degree of success brought about by all the recent efforts to combat water pollution 4 1 how do anthropogenic factors and natural characteristics covary with china s river water quality our attempt to characterize the signature of anthropogenic activities required to parse out the role of natural factors such as meteorological conditions and landscape characteristics in shaping riverine water quality when considering all 350 sub watersheds across china our analysis was able to discern a weakly negative relationship between elevation and or slope and tp nh3 n concentrations figure s7 suggesting that sites in higher elevations and or steeper slopes registered lower nutrient levels the slope of the catchment determines the water velocity and erosion severity whereby mountainous rivers with higher slopes are expected to be subjected to faster flow velocities and more severe erosion and thus shorter water retention times compared with lowland rivers palmer and ruhi 2019 however our analysis did not render universal support to the latter hypothesis partly due to the confounding effects of anthropogenic drivers that tend to negatively covary with the catchment elevation or slope figures s7 s8 namely lowland low slope catchment areas are generally more urbanized with higher nutrient export figure s8 it is important to note though that the impacts of slope on water quality can also be influenced by the increasing number of dams in china due to their considerable capability to modulate nutrient retention maavara et al 2015 precipitation can determine the amount of inflowing water via surface and subsurface processes from urban areas or farmlands and may thus significantly modulate the degree of nutrient loading from non point sources stockwell et al 2020 recent research has shown that both particulate and bioavailable phosphorus loads can vary by orders of magnitude between wet and dry conditions long et al 2014 2015 emerging evidence also suggests that a significant fraction of the annual phosphorus loads can be generated during a small number of brief but intense precipitation events while the association of phosphorus with stormwater is plausible the flow concentration relationship can be profoundly modulated by factors such as watershed physiography land use patterns and antecedent conditions green et al 2007 an overarching precipitation concentration paradigm for nitrogen species is even less clear relative to that for phosphorus given that a greater proportion of total nitrogen is found in the dissolved phase due to relatively high solubility of nitrogen species such as nitrite and nitrate and can be transported by subsurface and groundwater flow pathways long et al 2014 our expectation of a positive association between tp nh3 n and precipitation manifested itself only in liao river table s3 this is because precipitation is highly correlated to elevation with a correlation coefficient of 0 99 figure s8 therefore elevation was selected as a covariate for the riverine nutrient levels instead of precipitation similarly air temperature can directly influence riverine thermal regimes and biogeochemical processes such as nitrification denitrification ammonification and sediment diagenesis rates van vliet et al 2013 xia et al 2018 yang et al 2020 although existing evidence suggests warmer temperatures result in higher recycling rates and consequently higher nutrient retention in rivers xia et al 2018 our analysis was not able to fully disentangle the temperature control on the ambient tp nh3 n levels given its covariance with other natural or anthropogenic predictor variables figures s7 s8 counter to the relatively minor role of the natural factors considered in our analysis the nighttime light intensity and the percentage of the urban area were the strongest predictors of riverine tp nh3 n levels and collectively accounted for most of the nutrient variability registered in the study sites these distinctly positive relationships across all the major subwatersheds could reflect the influence of a suite of factors associated with the urban environment such as inefficient stormwater management suboptimal operating wwtp performance underdeveloped sewers and sludge disposal facilities jiang et al 2018 qu et al 2019 in particular sustainable urban stormwater management is one of china s emerging challenges where the infrastructural investments have not been on par with the continuous population growth rapid urbanization and socio economic development taken together with the changing weather patterns and climate the urban pluvial flooding gradually becomes a regular hydrometeorological phenomenon that has repeatedly affected many megacities in china du et al 2015a 2015b liu and wang 2016 to address the broader impact of the on going urbanization and development process the chinese government has established a national initiative termed sponge cities as a holistic strategy that combines innovative technologies effective governance and broader community engagement to bring sustainable stormwater management into fruition jiang et al 2018 water treatment capacity of wwtps was another predictor considered to reproduce of the riverine nutrient variability the rationale behind the selection of this covariate reflected china s efforts in building municipal wwtps 5000 and enforce more stringent effluent discharge standards during the past decades huang et al 2019 the ministry of ecology and environment 2020b china may have now the world s largest municipal wastewater infrastructure with a daily treatment capacity of nearly 200 million m3 d and a wastewater treatment ratio of over 90 qu et al 2019 however our analysis suggests a positive covariance between tp nh3 n and wwtp treatment capacity table s3 while this finding simply suggests the wwtp treatment capacity may not be the most sensitive variable to recreate the recent riverine nutrient trends it could also reflect the fact that there are still considerable gaps in the design principles and operation performances of the treatment facilities lagged development of sewer systems disparity between the effluent discharge standards and the local conditions and environmental protection demands and lack of appropriate sludge disposal qu et al 2019 viewed from this perspective the water treatment capacity of wwtps alone is not sufficient to predict the response of riverine ecosystems and thus other surrogate variables of the urban environment percentage urban area nighttime light intensity displayed stronger covariance with the water quality non point source pollution from agriculture has been widely recognized as a critically important source of nutrients into surface waters due to intensive fertilization china s crop production maintained an average p fertilization rate of 80 kg ha in 2012 which was twice as high as what crops can assimilate liu et al 2016 recognizing the challenges to accurately estimate the magnitude of non point source pollution ongley et al 2010 shen et al 2012 we postulated that the area percentage of farmland could display a discernible positive covariance with riverine tp nh3 n concentrations although our proxy of non point source pollution from agriculture did not consistently register a distinct signature across the six river basins studied it does support our hypothesis when pooling all the watersheds together fig 7b even though significant progress has been made in terms of the n and p loading export from agriculture farming aquaculture livestock and poultry between 2007 1 598 109 kg tn and 1 087 108 kg tp and 2017 7 195 108 kg tn and 7 62 107 kg tp the ministry of ecology and environment 2020b there is still a lot of grounds to cover in order to effectively mitigate non point source pollution to further address this issue there are recommendations for a more efficient paradigm with p fertilizer management to address the dual challenge of p resource conservation and eutrophication mitigation which will sustain future food production and maintain the integrity of freshwater ecosystems liu et al 2016 in particular it has been argued that china could delay exhausting its p reserves by over 20 years by improving its agronomic p use efficiency defined as the ratio of the useful p output in products to the total p inputs in an ecosystem to the average level of 80 in developed countries without any major implications for the targeted crop yields withers et al 2014 4 2 challenges and on going research questions with the river water quality management in china our study provided evidence of a distinct water quality improvement in china s major rivers with a gradual decrease in the frequency of prevalence of anoxic conditions an alleviation of the severity of heavy metal pollution and moderate success with the mitigation of cultural eutrophication during the 2003 2018 period we also identified significant spatial variation with relatively poorer water quality in eastern china nearby the major metropolitan areas of beijing tianjin nanjing shanghai kunming and shenyang the fact that more than 85 of the identified incidences of impaired conditions are associated with high nutrient concentrations suggests that our efforts to control point and non point source pollution should be further intensified notwithstanding the significant progress of china s wastewater treatment plant sector the ubiquitous problems of the existing infrastructure underdeveloped sewers and sludge disposal facilities low sustainability of the treatment processes mismatch between effluent discharge standards and environmental protection demands represent one of the next management priorities with the increasing prevalence of agricultural non point source pollution best management practices bmps are an emerging imperative in our efforts to prevent or reduce water pollution founded upon the pollution control theory of source reduction interception repair bmps are increasingly applied in china s agricultural lands to mitigate non point source pollution and restore aquatic ecosystems with variant results nonetheless the design of bmps should accommodate recent conceptual and technical advancements regarding the life cycle non stationarity the variability in their starting operational efficiency differential response to storm events or seasonality dependence of operational performance on watershed geological conditions and expected decline in performance over time owing to different maintenance practices increase the uncertainty of bmp efficiency arhonditsis et al 2019b c liu et al 2018 except from the mitigation of external loading the complex interplay among instream physical e g flow regimes water temperature chemical e g adsorption desorption and biological e g microbial decomposition processes can profoundly modulate the ambient nutrient levels in particular sediment water interfaces have been the research focus of the nutrient cycling in rivers but recent evidence suggests that suspended particle water interfaces in the water column could also be hotspot of nutrient transformations xia et al 2018 suspended particles are key determinants in the transport reactivity and biological impacts of chemicals lin et al 2021 for example adsorption of dissolved phosphate onto inorganic particles particularly amorphous iron oxyhydroxides is considered a critical process to control bioavailable phosphate to relatively low levels pan et al 2013 depending on the reactivity of particles there are critical thresholds of suspended matter concentrations below which water quality problems could become more severe even if the exogenous nutrient loading control is successful another interesting perspective of the tight coupling external loading instream processes was recently offered by tong et al 2020 who argued that the growing imbalance between the rates of reduction of tn and tp external loading could lead to distinct differences in the nutrient stoichiometry e g tn tp ratios of the receiving waterbodies and ultimately impact the risks of harmful algal blooms and broader ecosystem integrity a final note of consideration involves the granularity of the assessment of the progress of china s river water quality as we move forward we advocate the assessment of the prevailing conditions using individual water quality snapshots based on samples collected regularly from different sites throughout the year rather than any type of data aggregation in time and or space the latter strategy may not be reflective of the wide range of spatiotemporal dynamics typically experienced in any riverine ecosystem nor does it allow us to evaluate our progress with ecosystem services at the degree of granularity required to assess the public sentiment it would seem paradoxical to expect a single valued average reflective of the central tendency of multiple samples to capture the degree of public satisfaction which is often determined by the occurrence of water quality extremes e g hypoxia leading to fish deaths harmful algal blooms notably while our delineation of the general trends based on yearly averages or medians painted a favourable picture regarding the riverine water quality in china the reality is that excessively high pollutant concentrations are even frequently experienced even in rivers that have demonstrably shown significant improvement figures s3 and s4 for example more than 30 and 50 of the samples collected from all the sites across the yellow river in 2018 registered nh3 n and po4 concentrations greater than 0 5 mg l and 0 1 mg l respectively similar or even higher exceedance frequencies are still experienced in other rivers huai yangtze with significant progress during our study period which reinforces the point that china needs to intensify its nutrient management policies qin et al 2020 the proposed assessment of the water quality status that revolves around extreme or maximum allowable pollutant levels has the conceptual advantage that not only tracks directly the actual incidences of water quality impairment but is also closely connected with the targeted ecosystem services offered from riverine ecosystems arhonditsis et al 2019a 5 conclusions china s river water quality patterns and underlying covariates were characterized at a national scale to evaluate the recent progress and on going challenges in river management our analysis revealed a distinct water quality improvement with a gradual decrease in the frequency of prevalence of anoxic conditions an alleviation of the severity of heavy metal pollution and moderate success with the mitigation of cultural eutrophication during 2003 2018 river water quality is poorer in eastern china compared with that in western china tp and nh3 n are collectively responsible for 85 of the identified incidences of impaired conditions our bayesian modelling results revealed that the frequency of water quality impairments predominantly displays stronger relationships with anthropogenic covariates 82 5 for tp 79 5 for nh3 n compared with natural factors 20 5 for tp 17 5 for nh3 n although considerable success was achieved in water quality restoration in china s rivers it is still challenging to eradicate eutrophication and realize acceptable ecological conditions the design of the remedial measures must be tailored to the site specific landscape characteristics meteorological conditions and should also consider the increasing importance of non point source pollution and internal nutrient loading

16843,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are compounds of emerging concern due to their persistence in the global water cycle and detection in drinking water sources however pfas have been poorly studied in bottled water especially in the united states this study investigated the occurrence of pfas and related factors in 101 uniquely labelled bottled water products for sale in the u s products were screened for 32 target pfas by solid phase extraction liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry spe lc ms ms fifteen of 32 measured analytes were detected consisting primarily of c3 c10 perfluorocarboxylic acids pfca and c3 c6 and c8 perfluorosulfonic acids pfsa pfas were detected above method detection limits in 39 101 tested products the σ32pfas concentrations detected were 0 17 18 87 ng l with a median of 0 98 ng l 97 of samples were below 5 ng l pfca 83 and short chain perfluoroalkyl acids pfaa containing 5 or less cf2 groups 67 were more prevalent on a mass basis than pfsa and longer chain pfaa respectively ultrashort chain pfpra measured for the first time in bottled water accounted for the greatest individual fraction of detected pfas mass 42 and was found almost exclusively in products labeled as spring water purified water products contained significantly less pfas than spring water products which was attributed to the use of reverse osmosis ro treatment in the majority of purified waters 25 35 compared to spring waters 1 45 ro treated products contained significantly lower σ32pfas long chain short chain and pfpra concentrations than products without ro

introduction bottled water is a major beverage product originating from a variety of sources including municipal drinking water systems wells and springs that may or may not receive additional treatments for potential contaminant removal or mineral supplements for taste in the united states bottled water accounts for a large and steadily increasing volume of personal consumption annual per capita consumption increased from 28 gallons 106 l in 2008 to over 42 gallons 159 l in 2018 rodwan 2019 due to its prevalent use and perception as a safe compliment to tap water ensuring bottled water is free of legacy and emerging contaminants is paramount to both the industry sector and public health per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a class of synthetic chemicals of increasing concern consisting of over 4700 uniquely identified fluorinated organic compounds oecd 2018 while pfas have desirable properties for manufacturing and consumer products such as high chemical stability and the ability to decrease aqueous surface tension their recalcitrance to degradation and simultaneously lipophobic and hydrophobic properties make pfas persistent and difficult to treat once they enter the environment buck et al 2011 pfas have been widely detected in public drinking water supplies and groundwaters in connection with point sources including industrial sites firefighting facilities using aqueous film forming foams afff landfills and wastewater treatment plants björnsdotter et al 2019 hu et al 2016 transport mechanisms including point and non point source discharge björnsdotter et al 2019 atmospheric deposition kwok et al 2010 and groundwater infiltration barzen hanson and field 2015 have led to detection of pfas throughout the global water cycle the shift in pfas production from long chain 6 cf2 groups to shorter chain chemistries further complicates their health concern on one hand shorter chain compounds have lower propensity for bioaccumulation than long chain homologues buck et al 2011 on the other they are also much more mobile in the environment less readily removed from water by sorptive processes and equally recalcitrant to environmental degradation brendel et al 2018 ultrashort chain pfas are perfluoroalkyl acids pfaa that contain 3 carbon atoms trifluoroacetic acid tfa a c2 perfluorocarboxylic acid pfca has been detected ubiquitously in precipitation and surface waters at sub and low part per billion concentration berg et al 2000 scheurer et al 2017 its widespread presence has been attributed to atmospheric degradation of precursor compounds such as fluoropolymers and hydrofluorocarbons berg et al 2000 frank et al 2002 in contrast the environmental distribution of other ultrashort chain homologs including c2 perfluoroethane sulfonic acid pfets and c3 perfluoropropanoic acid pfpra and perfluoropropane sulfonic acid pfprs is less clear ateia et al 2019 these compounds have been infrequently studied in aqueous matrices including groundwater barzen hanson and field 2015 rainwater kwok et al 2010 and finished drinking water björnsdotter et al 2019 at concentrations comparable or greater than their longer chain homologs despite this ultrashort chain pfas are infrequently measured in the literature and not included in regulatory analytical methods u s epa 2018 2019b as chronic exposure to pfas even at low part per trillion ppt levels has been implicated in deleterious human health impacts governments and regulatory bodies have moved to monitor and regulate concentrations of pfas in drinking water brendel et al 2018 guelfo and adamson 2018 the u s environmental protection agency epa issued a health advisory of 70 ng l for perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos in drinking water u s epa 2020 in the interim many individual u s states have enacted more stringent and enforceable pfas regulations michigan for example implemented maximum contaminant levels mcls for seven individual compounds the lowest of which were 8 ng l for pfoa 6 ng l for perfluorononanoic acid pfna michigan department of environment great lakes and energy 2020 the u s food and drug administration fda responsible for regulating bottled water nationally mandates annual testing for nearly all drinking water contaminants regulated by the u s epa u s fda 2020 however no such regulations currently exist for pfas in bottled water in the u s the pervasive nature of pfas may impact a variety of bottled water sources including protected groundwaters and treated municipal systems depending on source quality and desired product characteristics source waters may or may not undergo treatment before bottling common bottled water treatment processes include ultraviolet light uv ozonation microfiltration distillation reverse osmosis ro and granular activated carbon gac filtration for removal of microbial and chemical constituents diduch et al 2013 of these processes only ro and gac filtration are proven technologies for removing pfas from drinking water appleman et al 2014 pfas contamination in bottled water received national attention in 2019 when products for sale throughout the northeast u s were found to contain concentrations in excess of 100 ng l traced to a contaminated spring water source in massachusetts massachusetts department of public health 2019 following this event the international bottled water association ibwa industry trade group implemented a mandatory pfas monitoring program for its member companies with standards of quality set at 5 ng l for individual and 10 ng l for multiple compounds among the 18 analytes included in epa method 537 1 international bottled water association 2020 method 537 1 u s epa 2018 notably does not include short chain pfca or odd chained perfluorosulfonic acids pfsa leaving the occurrence of many common pfas liable to be undetermined the u s is the world s second largest bottled water market rodwan 2019 to date no peer reviewed studies have investigated pfas in u s bottled water the goals of this study were to assess the levels of pfas in bottled waters available to consumers in a major u s metropolitan region and analyze patterns of occurrence in relation to product characteristics here 101 uniquely labelled non carbonated bottled water products were sampled thirty two pfas including ultrashort chain pfpra and pfprs were screened at ppt levels using solid phase extraction spe and targeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms trends and patterns in pfas occurrence were investigated on the basis of product categorization stated water treatment processes and measured water quality parameters results from this study provide much needed insight into the occurrence of pfas and related factors in u s bottled water 2 methods and materials 2 1 sample selection and characterization bottled drinking water products that were non carbonated non nutritional and unflavored were purchased from 19 different retail food and beverage chains located in the baltimore metropolitan area a total of 101 uniquely labeled bottled water products were obtained spanning 66 brands and four marketed product categories spring n 45 purified n 35 alkaline n 15 and distilled n 6 spring water was used to broadly classify water derived from groundwater including wells sourced from aquifer water the majority of such products had no explicitly stated water treatment processes indicated on the packaging purified water was derived from a variety of sources frequently unstated or from municipal water systems but underwent subsequent treatment processes frequently ro distillation or not explicitly stated alkaline water a subset of purified water contained mineral addition to increase the ph above 9 5 this was sold as a separate product category from purified water and was hence categorized separately distilled water was sourced from either municipal water or groundwater underwent distillation water treatment and was sold in explicitly labelled gallon containers product categorizations and metadata including source type and explicitly stated water treatment processes were compiled to the best of the authors ability based on information available on labels and packaging supporting information si table s1 available product data varied widely with some products containing no more information than the marketed product type and corporate ownership bottled products ranged in volume from 10 fluid ounces 296 ml to one gallon 3785 ml geographic source water locations were available for 71 products representing 16 u s states and 7 international countries table s1 many products especially store brands utilized the same water sources and contract bottlers for their differently labeled products even though the same source water may have been sold under multiple brands all 101 products were counted as unique samples in subsequent enumerations unless otherwise stated since they represent distinct purchasing choices for consumers prior to analysis all products were deidentified to eliminate processing bias individual products were referred to by a coded number aliquots of each water product from the initial screening were portioned to measure water quality parameters at the time of pfas extraction electrical conductivity hach hq40d and ph mettler toledo sevencompact

days a detailed description of the anion analytical method is presented in the si 2 2 pfas extraction and analysis thirty two pfas table s2 were quantitated in this study pfca pfpra pfba pfpea pfhxa

milliporesigma st louis mo was diluted in methanol to prepare calibration standards the other 31 analytes and 20 isotopically labeled internal standards table s2 were purchased from wellington laboratories guelph on as methanolic solutions bottled water containers were stored unopened at room temperature away from sunlight until analysis upon analysis bottles were well shaken before opening water from each sample bottle 250 0 5 ml was poured directly into a new unopened 250 ml polypropylene pp screw cap bottle vwr radnor pa for spe following a protocol described by taniyasu et al 2005 with modifications detailed in the si lc ms grade methanol optima thermo fisher scientific waltham ma and type i ultrapure milli q water milli q advantage a10 milliporesigma were used for all reagent and eluent preparations briefly samples were acidified below ph 3 with h2so4 spiked with 2 5 ng of each internal standard extracted dropwise onto weak anion exchange cartridges oasis wax 6 ml 150 mg waters corporation milford ma eluted with methanol 0 5 nh4oh and evaporated to 0 5 ml pfas were measured by lc ms ms using selected reaction monitoring srm in negative mode thermo fisher tsq quantiva chromatographic separation was achieved using a solid core c18 column thermo fisher accucore and mobile phase consisting of a water methanol gradient with a 2 mm ammonium acetate and 0 1 v v acetic acid additive detailed analytical methodology a representative chromatogram of all analytes fig s1 and optimized ms ms parameters table s3 table s4 are presented in the si pfas were quantitated and reported as their acid form using relative response of analytes to their respective internal standards table s2 calibrated to a five point standard curve from 0 125 to 25 μg l calibration curves were fitted using linear regression with inverse concentration weighting and had r2 values greater than 0 99 in each analytical run 2 3 quality assurance and quality control quality control qc sampling and calculations were employed to ensure accurate and reproducible pfas measurements at concentrations approaching analytical limits of detection extraction blanks and spiked water samples 250 ml were prepared and analyzed across batches for qc table s5 blanks milli q water n 7 yielded infrequent and low levels of pfas detection a maximum single analyte concentration of 1 15 ng l 6 2 fts was observed in a single blank milli q water spiked with 2 4 ng l of pfas n 9 yielded analyte recoveries of 75 111 with the exception of 6 2 fts 157 recovery method detection limits mdls were calculated based on epa standard methods u s epa 2016 detailed in the si mdls table s5 were 0 11 1 04 ng l for all analytes except for pftria 2 82 ng l and 6 2 fts 10 31 ng l mdls for ultrashort chain pfpra and pfprs were 0 45 ng l and 0 11 ng l respectively sporadic elevated concentrations of 6 2 fts in qc samples led to its high mdl which may be attributed to background contamination in laboratory consumables given its widespread use in manufacturing wang et al 2013 mdls were treated as the lower limit of quantitation lloq for all analyses values greater than or equal to the mdl were quantitated and values below the mdl were reported as non detects all blank concentrations were less than or equal to mdl values and therefore no blank subtraction was employed on samples method performance in sample matrix was evaluated using spring waters fortified with 5 ng l of all pfas analytes n 4 average matrix recovery background concentration of non spiked samples subtracted was 81 103 for most analytes indicating low matrix bias compared to spiked milli q water table s5 recovery of pfpra was 90 and pfprs was 98 recoveries of fbsa 66 and fhxsa 69 were slightly below this range and can be attributed to their lack of isotopically labelled internal standards with both similar retention and functionality table s1 inter batch precision in matrix spikes was high with coefficients of variation c v below 11 for all analytes all 101 water products were analyzed for pfas in an initial screening approximately 20 n 21 of products were selected for replicate extractions and analyses using different bottles timestamped from the same bottling or expiration date table s6 products with total detected pfas concentrations greater than 2 ng l n 8 and an additional random selection of the remaining products n 11 underwent duplicate measurements duplicate bottle measurements were precise with differences in summed concentrations of all analyzed pfas no greater than 0 39 ng l table s6 two randomly selected products 3 and 89 were analyzed with five replicates to further examine potential for variability within manufactured bottled product batches in product 3 an average summed concentration of 1 5 ng l was measured with a 0 63 ng l range and a 16 c v in product 89 all five replicates yielded non detects these replicate measurements demonstrated reproducibility in the analytical method and also highlighted consistency in pfas concentrations measured in separate bottles from similar timestamps all product concentrations were reported as average values if replicates measurements were performed 2 4 statistical analysis mann whitney wilcoxon mww and kruskal wallis kw ranked sum tests were used to compare individual and summed pfas concentrations non parametrically on the basis of categorical groupings pairwise differences between significant kw groupings were calculated using pairwise wilcoxon ranked sum pwrs tests with the benjamini hochberg procedure for false discovery rate control for each compound non detects below calculated mdls were included in ranked sum calculations and equally assigned the average lowest ranking helsel 2011 significance was set at a threshold of p 0 05 using two tailed tests all statistical calculations were performed in r 3 results 3 1 occurrence of pfas in tested products pfas were detected in 39 of the 101 39 bottled water products analyzed with concentration profiles shown in fig 1 in aggregate 62 of all tested products had no detected pfas 20 had summed pfas concentrations σ32pfas less than 1 ng l 16 between 1 and 5 ng l and 3 above 12 ng l analytical results for all products are reported in table s6 fifteen of the 32 analytes tested were detected in at least one product above their mdls table 1 detected analytes were c3 c10 pfca c3 c6 and c8 pfsa 8 2 fts and fbsa the most frequently detected compounds were pfoa 25 of total samples pfpra 22 and pfbs 17 however differences in method sensitivity to analytes reflected in mdl values may potentially bias the detection frequency towards analytes with lower mdls and obscure the presence of low concentration analytes with higher detection limits at an equal lloq cutoff of 0 5 ng l above each detected analyte mdl there was a more even distribution of positive detects table 1 no compound was detected in more than 5 samples at this threshold with the exception of pfpra which was still detected in 19 samples for pfoa and pfbs the majority of detections were at trace levels between their mdl values and 0 5 ng l the abundance of each detected analyte relative to total measured pfas across all samples was reported in table 1 ultrashort chain pfpra accounted for the largest fraction of pfas 42 while no other analyte accounted for more than 12 of the total the next two largest contributors were long chain pfoa 12 and pfna 8 pfca were the dominant detected compound class 83 compared to pfsa 16 and other classes 1 total short chain perfluoroalkyl acids pfaa with less than 6 perfluorinated carbons were twice as abundant as long chain pfaa 32 table 1 3 2 product category comparisons several differences in pfas detection frequency were observed between the tested product categories table s7 among the most frequently detected pfas ultrashort chain pfpra was detected in 21 45 spring waters but only in 1 35 purified and in no distilled or alkaline waters similarly short chain pfbs was detected in 13 45 spring waters at a much higher frequency than any other product type in contrast long chain pfoa was detected most frequently in 4 6 distilled waters compared to 14 45 spring 4 15 alkaline and 3 35 purified waters in total pfas was detected in 4 6 distilled waters 25 45 spring waters 6 15 alkaline waters and 4 35 purified waters using ranked sum kw comparisons concentrations of pfpra pfbs pfhxs pfhpa pfoa pfna and all aggregate pfas concentrations were found to be significantly different p 0 05 between product types table s8 pwrs comparisons revealed that distilled water products contained significantly greater concentrations p 0 05 of pfhxs and pfna than all other waters and greater pfca long chain pfaa and σ32pfas than purified waters table s9 notably only long chain pfhxs pfhpa pfoa pfos and pfna were detected in distilled waters fig 1 additionally spring waters contained more pfpra and short chain pfaa than both alkaline and purified waters and more pfoa pfca long chain pfaa and σ32pfas than purified waters the distribution of aggregate concentrations between product categories are compared visually in fig 2 a one of the underlying factors potentially driving differences in pfas between product types was the water treatment that each product received of the water treatment processes presumed to be effective for pfas removal gac anion exchange ro and possibly distillation only distillation and ro had explicitly stated use on product labeling for each of these treatment processes products were categorized binarily as either explicitly having received the treatment or not the absence of information does not necessarily preclude the bottle from treatment but served as a conservative delineation products labeled as receiving ro treatment n 38 contained significantly less pfpra pfoa pfca short and long chain pfaa and σ32pfas than those that were not fig 2b table s10 in contrast products labeled as receiving distillation treatment n 16 which was not exclusive to distilled water products only contained significantly less pfpra and short chain pfaa than those that were not fig 2c table s10 measured water quality parameters table s11 did not reveal any generalizable associations with pfas concentrations whether on an individual compound or aggregate grouping basis additionally no spatial patterns in pfas concentrations were identified based on stated product source locations fig s2 3 3 investigation of products with high pfas concentrations the three products with highest measured pfas concentrations 32 66 69 all contained σ32pfas 12 ng l the highest individual concentrations of 12 15 detected compounds in this study except pfbs pfda and 8 2 fts were found among these three samples products 66 and 69 were both spring waters that shared the same bottler and source spring but were differently branded products with different bottling dates both had very similar pfas profiles σ32pfas 17 5 18 9 ng l fig 1 in contrast product 32 was a purified water from a municipal water source treated with ro it was notable that various water quality parameters measured in these products were among the highest of all products sampled table s11 products 66 and 69 were within the 96th percentile of measured nitrate concentrations 7 8 and 10 1 mg l respectively and 95th percentile of measured conductivity 516 and 658 μs cm respectively product 32 was within the 98th percentile of measured toc concentration 1 8 mg l additional samples of these higher concentration products were obtained to determine whether waters bottled across other dates of production were consistently contaminated with pfas single samples of products timestamped with unique expiration dates separated by a minimum of 2 weeks were analyzed for pfas and water quality table s12 these values were not incorporated into summaries or statistical comparisons in prior sections three samples of product 32 with timestamps spanning 19 5 months were acquired five samples of product 69 were acquired spanning 4 months product 66 was not further investigated since it had the same stated source as 69 for both products relative abundances of individual pfas were qualitatively consistent across all timestamps fig 3 in product 32 σ32pfas concentrations were also stable with a measured range of 10 9 12 0 ng l fig 3a in contrast the σ32pfas concentrations in product 69 varied more widely with a measured range of 10 5 21 3 ng l fig 3b similar variability was also reflected in measured water quality measured constituents were stable in product 32 but varied substantially in product 69 table s12 it was also observed that conductivity had a positive linear correlation with σ32pfas concentration in product 69 with good fit r2 0 98 between the five sampled timestamps fig s3 4 discussion 4 1 comparative occurrence of pfas in bottled water to the authors knowledge this is the first peer reviewed study to investigate occurrence of pfas in bottled water sold in the u s there are however limited non peer reviewed data for u s bottled water to which the findings of this study can be compared for context a 2016 fda survey of 30 bottled waters collected from retailers in the washington d c metropolitan area analyzed pfoa and pfos but neither were detected above the study s 4 ng l lloq u s fda 2016 no product from the present study contained more than 2 ng l of either c8 compound which would have yielded a similar absence of detection using the higher lloq of the fda survey consumer reports reported testing results for 35 nationally available noncarbonated water brands for 30 pfas using a modified epa 537 1 method and found only 2 samples 6 contained σ30pfas exceeding 1 ng l 1 21 4 64 ng l with majority of samples containing pfas between unspecified detection limits and 1 ng l felton 2020 in the present study a much larger fraction of samples 19 contained σ32pfas in excess of 1 ng l however when ultrashort chain c3 pfas were excluded from this total only 9 of samples were in excess of 1 ng l which is in close agreement with the consumer reports survey a small body of peer reviewed literature exists for pfas occurrence in bottled water sampled from fourteen different countries not including the u s table 2 with the exception of work by gellrich et al 2013 n 119 samples pfas measurements in bottled waters were generally a small component of larger studies investigating other drinking water sources or contaminants between studies there was a wide range of sample size n 4 119 number of measured analytes n 6 29 lloq 0 02 82 ng l and measured results table 2 that make quantitative comparison difficult pfas were detected in samples with frequencies from 0 to 100 and with a σpfas range of 0 08 118 ng l despite the variation in study design and analytical methods some qualitative comparisons can be made between peer reviewed studies a subset of pfaa most frequently including c4 6 8 pfsa and c5 10 pfca were common analytes to nearly all studies there was general agreement among past study results that detected pfca were more highly abundant than pfsa gellrich et al 2013 kaboré et al 2018 schwanz et al 2016 ünlü endirlik et al 2019 with the exception of work by le coadou et al 2017 that detected a greater fraction of pfsa compared to pfca our study found pfas mass was overwhelmingly pfca 83 versus pfsa 16 in agreement with most other studies across the reviewed global literature where frequency of detection could be determined pfas were detected above varying lloq values in 59 175 of 299 of sampled bottled waters compared to 39 in this study the maximum σ32pfas from the screening in our study including 18 9 ng l and excluding 14 8 ng l ultrashort chain c3 compounds not analyzed in the previous literature was within the published range described for other countries table 2 with the exception of results from schwanz et al 2016 the maximum σpfas found in any other single bottled water sample was 24 2 ng l in germany gellrich et al 2013 data collected by schwanz et al was notable in that exceptionally high concentrations of c14 16 and 18 pfca were detected in french and brazilian water products up to 29 ng l each with σ16pfas up to 118 ng l nearly an order of magnitude greater than σ32pfas reported in our results in comparison no pfas longer than c10 were detected in any sample from our study excluding concentrations of c16 and c18 pfca which were not analyzed in our study or detected in other bottled water studies the maximum σ14pfas of 67 7 ng l from schwanz et al is more comparable to the rest of the reported literature values overall current literature indicates that pfas have been widely detected in bottled water sampled in locations worldwide at low ppt concentrations however detection has not been ubiquitous in all sampled products results from this study demonstrate that bottled waters available in the u s are not exceptional in this regard compared to other countries it should be noted that this study was not evenly representative of the hundreds of different bottled water products available throughout the u s of the 73 studied products with identified water sources 49 were from the east coast of the u s including 24 from the state of pennsylvania representing a regional bias proximal to the purchase location fig s2 a more geographically diverse sampling campaign incorporating additional products and source locations may elucidate regional variations in bottled water pfas not observed in this study 4 2 factors influencing pfas presence in bottled water in this study lower measured concentrations of pfas in purified waters compared to spring waters fig 3a can likely be explained by the high usage of ro treatment in purified water products ro treatment was explicitly stated for 25 35 purified products compared to only 1 45 spring water products table s1 water treatment studies of ro have demonstrated almost complete rejection of pfas regardless of chain length including pfas as short as ultrashort chain tfa appleman et al 2014 scheurer et al 2017 although pfas concentrations were significantly lower in purified waters it should not be assumed that these trends necessarily extend to other contaminant classes as sources and treatments vary for example ikem 2010 found lower concentrations of trihalomethanes in u s spring waters compared to purified and tap water likely a result of chlorination treatment employed by municipal water sources the measured pfas in distilled waters were unexpected products that underwent distillation contained less short chain pfaa than untreated fig 2c and only long chain pfas were detected in labelled distilled water products fig 1 this was seemingly counterintuitive since more effective separation would be expected for longer chain homologs with greater differential vapor pressure and anionic speciation at environmental ph rayne and forest 2010 however these results must be interpreted in the context of the sample size given the limited number of distilled water products n 6 tested and low overall detection frequency in distillation treated products 7 16 regardless the presence of long chain pfas indicate that distilled water products cannot be assumed to be pfas free this may be relevant to environmental sampling where distilled water could be used as a readily accessible analytical blank it may also be important when considering exposures for susceptible populations such as children who are exposed to distilled waters in infant formula and room humidifiers although significant differences in pfas content were observed between stated bottled water product classifications further research is needed to validate hypothesized causal links only finished products were measured in this study and definitive connections to specific sources waters could not be determined for all products measuring changes in pfas from known source waters to bottled products would provide a more definitive understanding of intermediate treatment process efficacy furthermore production information such as source water type location and an exhaustive listing of water treatments used were not available for all tested products the detection of low ppt pfas in 39 of bottled waters including over half of the spring waters that in most instances would be absent of effective treatment provides telling evidence of their pervasive detection across wide geographical areas fig s2 even in water assumed to be protected from contamination hu et al 2016 found strong positive spatial associations throughout the u s between pfas in municipal drinking water supplies and the presence of industrial facilities afff sites and wastewater treatment plants within the same watershed they also determined that pfas was detected over twice as frequently in drinking supplies sourced from groundwater compared to surface water hu et al 2016 pfaa may be found in non industrial areas far down gradient from known point sources due to their high mobility in water björnsdotter et al 2019 wei et al 2018 for example detected pfas in 100 of 102 groundwater samples σ14pfas of 2 7 560 ng l collected from non industrial groundwater sites additionally it has been postulated by others that dispersed sources such as precipitation may also contribute to observed concentrations of pfas in groundwaters björnsdotter et al 2019 wei et al 2018 the possibility of additional systematic pfas contamination from the bottling and packaging process was considered but appears unlikely ünlü endirlik et al 2019 found no significant differences in pfas concentrations between identical water products in plastic versus glass packaging suggesting that plastic bottles are not significant contributors to pfas this is also supported by the comparatively few number of pfas detections in purified waters versus spring waters in this study despite these products using similar plastic bottles in the most contaminated products from this study products 32 and 69 elevated levels of measured water quality constituents toc nitrate conductivity relative to other samples anecdotally illustrate that pfas contamination in bottled water can co occur with other inputs from human impact elevated nitrate for example could indicate agricultural activity power and schepers 1989 while elevated toc could indicate waste upgradient to a source water masoner et al 2014 across extended intervals of bottling dates stable pfas concentrations in bottled waters e g 32 may suggest a steady contaminant flux in source waters variable concentrations with consistent pfas profiles e g 69 could suggest seasonal dilution of a contaminated source with uncontaminated water as exemplified by product 69 fig s3 contaminated products that demonstrate a strong correlation between pfas and other readily measured water quality parameters could be more frequently monitored using these parameters as surrogates this however this would need to be tested and validated on a case by case basis 4 3 implications of ultrashort chain pfaa detection to date ultrashort chain pfaa excluding tfa have been poorly studied in drinking water and drinking water sources this may be due to perceived analytical challenges of highly polar compounds the perception of lower human health risks due to decreased bioaccumulation potential and lack of current regulatory scrutiny compared to longer chain homologs ateia et al 2019 björnsdotter et al 2020 mak et al 2009 reported unspecified trace concentrations of pfpra and pfprs 5 ng l in japanese tap water that were dwarfed in concentration by longer chain compounds björnsdotter et al 2019 reported detections of pfpra up to 28 ng l and pfprs 0 18 ng l in two treated drinking water samples from sweden accounting for up to 84 of σ29 pfas kaboré et al 2018 detected trace 1 ng l concentrations of pfprs in 100 n 24 of tap waters from ivory coast and burkina faso these concentrations were approximately the same order of magnitude of the maximum pfpra and pfprs screened in this study table 1 much higher concentrations of c3 pfaa up to 63 μg l have been found in contaminated groundwaters downgradient of point sources such as afff landfill leachate and hazardous waste management facilities as co contaminants with a variety of longer chain pfas barzen hanson and field 2015 björnsdotter et al 2019 additionally pfpra was found with near ubiquity in several rainwater sampling studies scott et al 2006 detected pfpra in 92 n 181 of north american rainwater samples with concentrations up to 120 ng l in maryland separately kwok et al 2010 detected pfpra in every tested rainwater sample n 52 which was the most abundant of 20 tested pfas with concentrations up to 45 3 ng l the high mass abundance of pfpra in this study 41 5 relative to other pfas may be related to its mobility in the built and natural environment pfpra is much less amenable to sorption processes than longer chain homologs ateia et al 2019 in groundwater this could enable low concentrations of the substance to be detected at great distances from its initial source björnsdotter et al 2019 in water treatment systems sorptive processes such as gac and ion exchange are proven to be less effective removing short chain pfaa compared to long chain pfaa appleman et al 2014 it was notable that only a single purified and ro treated bottled water product contained a pfpra detection table s7 which can be attributed to the overall efficacy of ro in pfas removal and process s lack of chain length bias appleman et al 2014 even though pfpra may be effectively removed from ro treated water it is concentrated in reject brine that may be returned to the water cycle through wastewater discharge without effective capture substances with persistent mobile and toxic pmt characteristics such as c3 pfaa are receiving greater attention as potentially irreversible sources of toxic exposure in water hale et al 2020 rüdel et al 2020 for example the european chemicals agency recently identified short chain pfbs and hfpo da as substances of very high concern svhc based on characteristics including persistence ability for long range transport and difficulty in removal in the environment hale et al 2020 in contrast to long chain pfas that may bioaccumulate in organisms shorter chain compounds such as pfpra may accumulate in the global water cycle over time without breakdown or sequestration however many highly mobile compounds that may already be ubiquitous in the environment are underreported due to analytical challenges of measuring small highly polar compounds hale et al 2020 in contrast to even more polar compounds such as tfa that may require specialized ion exchange scheurer et al 2017 or normal phase chromatography rüdel et al 2020 for analysis c3 pfas could be measured by traditional reverse phase lc without major method modification more widespread inclusion of these analytes in drinking water measurements would provide a more complete pfas mass balance and help close the knowledge gap that can inform future regulatory decision making 4 4 pfas regulation and health guidance in the u s pfas regulations or guidance have been proposed and or enacted for municipal tap water at the state level currently no such regulations exist for bottled water which is regulated as a food product by the fda since u s fda standards for bottled water are intended to follow epa contaminant limits in drinking water u s fda 2020 pfas levels measured in this study were compared to known regulatory guidelines for context the maximum detected concentrations of pfoa and pfos 2 ng l each were over an order of magnitude lower than the 70 ng l epa lifetime advisory level concentrations were also below current u s state level mcls though the upper bound samples were only two to three fold lower than the most stringent regulations product 69 contained up to 3 2 ng l of pfna over half of the 6 ng l mcl in michigan michigan department of environment great lakes and energy 2020 the sum of pfoa pfos pfna pfhxs pfhpa and pfda in 69 totaled up to 7 2 ng l one third of the 20 ng l 6 compound summative mcl for these compounds in massachusetts massachusetts department of environmental protection 2020 in comparison to the 5 ng l individual and 10 ng l summative standards of quality required by the ibwa for its member companies international bottled water association 2020 product 69 was found to be in exceedance in 2 5 timestamped samples σ18pfas 10 3 11 1 ng l health based pfas ingestion guidelines established in the e u and u s can also benchmark pfas exposure in bottled water the u s epa established non cancer chronic reference doses rfds for three individual pfas pfoa pfos and pfbs from 20 to 300 ng kg day which represent maximum acceptable intake without known deleterious health effects u s epa 2021 using an epa recommended 95th percentile all ages drinking water ingestion rate of 37 ml kg day u s epa 2019a and assuming exclusive consumption of bottled water theoretical maximum pfas exposure rates from bottled water in this study were calculated compared to these rfds table s13 bottled water exposures of 0 032 0 053 ng kg day for individual compounds were between two to four orders of magnitude lower than rfds there has however been criticism that these rfds are not protective against immunotoxic effects such as decreased vaccine response and increased childhood infections these studies have suggested that the rfds should potentially be one to two orders of magnitude lower grandjean and budtz jørgensen 2013 pachkowski et al 2019 recently the european food safety authority efsa recommended a tolerable weekly intake twi threshold of 4 4 ng kg week for the combination of four prevalent pfas pfoa pfos pfna and pfhxs efsa 2020 this value is substantially lower than that of the epa and considers decreased immune response the critical risk assessment outcome efsa 2020 the calculated maximum exposure rate of 1 59 ng kg week for bottled water table s13 was below the twi threshold by a factor of three considering that other modes of ingestion such as food air and dust deposition also contribute to human pfas intake products with comparably high concentrations may be a major contributor toward this threshold exceedance five products in this study would have exposure values within an order of magnitude of the twi while the remaining 95 of products would have exposure values over 20 fold less although 39 of bottled water products in this study contained measurable pfas the majority did not contain measured pfas at concentrations exceeding contemporary guidance results of this study do however support the need for a standardized framework to screen source waters used to produce bottled waters for potentially infrequent but elevated levels of pfas moreover as analytical methods toxicological understanding and treatment technologies continue to improve regulations and health based guidelines are likely to undergo revision levels of pfas considered tolerable today may or may not continue to be so in the future it should be noted that the σ32pfas values reported in this study while useful aggregate metrics are not an exhaustive measure of total pfas reported concentrations and detection frequencies in this and other studies are limited by the number of analytes tested and sensitivity of the analytical method potentially underestimating the amount of pfas in a sample for example over half of the detected pfas mass in this study 53 8 would not have been found using the widely accepted epa method 537 1 due to exclusion of short chain pfaa and odd chain pfsa conversely the σpfas values could be orders of magnitude greater if c2 tfa was analyzed given its ubiquity in the global water cycle berg et al 2000 this summation also does not distinguish between differences in compound functionality or chain length as many health based metrics do although longer chain pfaa represent the majority of current regulatory focus buck et al 2011 other unmeasured pfas may become increasingly relevant over time to this end future studies may consider using non targeted high resolution ms for data acquisition providing a digital sample archive that could be retrospectively screened for additional pfas and contaminants of interest 5 conclusions pfas were detected in 39 101 uniquely labelled bottled water samples fifteen of 32 targeted analytes were detected in at least one sample the majority of which were pfca c10 and pfsa c8 pfca were over five times more abundant than pfsa and short chain pfaa 6 cf2 were over twice as abundant than long chain pfaa on a mass basis the majority of samples 97 contained σ32pfas concentrations below 5 ng l purified water products contained significantly less σ32pfas than spring water products which was attributed to the presence of water treatment in purified products products specifically labelled as having received ro treatment contained significantly less σ32pfas than those without such indication ultrashort chain c3 pfpra and pfprs were quantitated for the first time in bottled water pfpra was the most abundant of all measured pfas detected in 22 101 samples and accounting for 42 of measured sample mass abundance pfpra was almost exclusively detected in spring waters 95 of detections and was lower in purified and ro treated products measured concentrations of pfas in u s bottled waters were consistent with products investigated internationally no

and longer chain pfaa respectively ultrashort chain pfpra measured for the first time in bottled water accounted for the greatest individual fraction of detected pfas mass 42 and was found almost exclusively in products labeled as spring water purified water products contained significantly less pfas than spring water products which was attributed to the use of reverse osmosis ro treatment in the majority of purified waters 25 35 compared to spring waters 1 45 ro treated products contained significantly lower σ32pfas long chain short chain and pfpra concentrations than products without ro

introduction bottled water is a major beverage product originating from a variety of sources including municipal drinking water systems wells and springs that may or may not receive additional treatments for potential contaminant removal or mineral supplements for taste in the united states bottled water accounts for a large and steadily increasing volume of personal consumption annual per capita consumption increased from 28 gallons 106 l in 2008 to over 42 gallons 159 l in 2018 rodwan 2019 due to its prevalent use and perception as a safe compliment to tap water ensuring bottled water is free of legacy and emerging contaminants is paramount to both the industry sector and public health per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a class of synthetic chemicals of increasing concern consisting of over 4700 uniquely identified fluorinated organic compounds oecd 2018 while pfas have desirable properties for manufacturing and consumer products such as high chemical stability and the ability to decrease aqueous surface tension their recalcitrance to degradation and simultaneously lipophobic and hydrophobic properties make pfas persistent and difficult to treat once they enter the environment buck et al 2011 pfas have been widely detected in public drinking water supplies and groundwaters in connection with point sources including industrial sites firefighting facilities using aqueous film forming foams afff landfills and wastewater treatment plants björnsdotter et al 2019 hu et al 2016 transport mechanisms including point and non point source discharge björnsdotter et al 2019 atmospheric deposition kwok et al 2010 and groundwater infiltration barzen hanson and field 2015 have led to detection of pfas throughout the global water cycle the shift in pfas production from long chain 6 cf2 groups to shorter chain chemistries further complicates their health concern on one hand shorter chain compounds have lower propensity for bioaccumulation than long chain homologues buck et al 2011 on the other they are also much more mobile in the environment less readily removed from water by sorptive processes and equally recalcitrant to environmental degradation brendel et al 2018 ultrashort chain pfas are perfluoroalkyl acids pfaa that contain 3 carbon atoms trifluoroacetic acid tfa a c2 perfluorocarboxylic acid pfca has been detected ubiquitously in precipitation and surface waters at sub and low part per billion concentration berg et al 2000 scheurer et al 2017 its widespread presence has been attributed to atmospheric degradation of precursor compounds such as fluoropolymers and hydrofluorocarbons berg et al 2000 frank et al 2002 in contrast the environmental distribution of other ultrashort chain homologs including c2 perfluoroethane sulfonic acid pfets and c3 perfluoropropanoic acid pfpra and perfluoropropane sulfonic acid pfprs is less clear ateia et al 2019 these compounds have been infrequently studied in aqueous matrices including groundwater barzen hanson and field 2015 rainwater kwok et al 2010 and finished drinking water björnsdotter et al 2019 at concentrations comparable or greater than their longer chain homologs despite this ultrashort chain pfas are infrequently measured in the literature and not included in regulatory analytical methods u s epa 2018 2019b as chronic exposure to pfas even at low part per trillion ppt levels has been implicated in deleterious human health impacts governments and regulatory bodies have moved to monitor and regulate concentrations of pfas in drinking water brendel et al 2018 guelfo and adamson 2018 the u s environmental protection agency epa issued a health advisory of 70 ng l for perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos in drinking water u s epa 2020 in the interim many individual u s states have enacted more stringent and enforceable pfas regulations michigan for example implemented maximum contaminant levels mcls for seven individual compounds the lowest of which were 8 ng l for pfoa 6 ng l for perfluorononanoic acid pfna michigan department of environment great lakes and energy 2020 the u s food and drug administration fda responsible for regulating bottled water nationally mandates annual testing for nearly all drinking water contaminants regulated by the u s epa u s fda 2020 however no such regulations currently exist for pfas in bottled water in the u s the pervasive nature of pfas may impact a variety of bottled water sources including protected groundwaters and treated municipal systems depending on source quality and desired product characteristics source waters may or may not undergo treatment before bottling common bottled water treatment processes include ultraviolet light uv ozonation microfiltration distillation reverse osmosis ro and granular activated carbon gac filtration for removal of microbial and chemical constituents diduch et al 2013 of these processes only ro and gac filtration are proven technologies for removing pfas from drinking water appleman et al 2014 pfas contamination in bottled water received national attention in 2019 when products for sale throughout the northeast u s were found to contain concentrations in excess of 100 ng l traced to a contaminated spring water source in massachusetts massachusetts department of public health 2019 following this event the international bottled water association ibwa industry trade group implemented a mandatory pfas monitoring program for its member companies with standards of quality set at 5 ng l for individual and 10 ng l for multiple compounds among the 18 analytes included in epa method 537 1 international bottled water association 2020 method 537 1 u s epa 2018 notably does not include short chain pfca or odd chained perfluorosulfonic acids pfsa leaving the occurrence of many common pfas liable to be undetermined the u s is the world s second largest bottled water market rodwan 2019 to date no peer reviewed studies have investigated pfas in u s bottled water the goals of this study were to assess the levels of pfas in bottled waters available to consumers in a major u s metropolitan region and analyze patterns of occurrence in relation to product characteristics here 101 uniquely labelled non carbonated bottled water products were sampled thirty two pfas including ultrashort chain pfpra and pfprs were screened at ppt levels using solid phase extraction spe and targeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms trends and patterns in pfas occurrence were investigated on the basis of product categorization stated water treatment processes and measured water quality parameters results from this study provide much needed insight into the occurrence of pfas and related factors in u s bottled water 2 methods and materials 2 1 sample selection and characterization bottled drinking water products that were non carbonated non nutritional and unflavored were purchased from 19 different retail food and beverage chains located in the baltimore metropolitan area a total of 101 uniquely labeled bottled water products were obtained spanning 66 brands and four marketed product categories spring n 45 purified n 35 alkaline n 15 and distilled n 6 spring water was used to broadly classify water derived from groundwater including wells sourced from aquifer water the majority of such products had no explicitly stated water treatment processes indicated on the packaging purified water was derived from a variety of sources frequently unstated or from municipal water systems but underwent subsequent treatment processes frequently ro distillation or not explicitly stated alkaline water a subset of purified water contained mineral addition to increase the ph above 9 5 this was sold as a separate product category from purified water and was hence categorized separately distilled water was sourced from either municipal water or groundwater underwent distillation water treatment and was sold in explicitly labelled gallon containers product categorizations and metadata including source type and explicitly stated water treatment processes were compiled to the best of the authors ability based on information available on labels and packaging supporting information si table s1 available product data varied widely with some products containing no more information than the marketed product type and corporate ownership bottled products ranged in volume from 10 fluid ounces 296 ml to one gallon 3785 ml geographic source water locations were available for 71 products representing 16 u s states and 7 international countries table s1 many products especially store brands utilized the same water sources and contract bottlers for their differently labeled products even though the same source water may have been sold under multiple brands all 101 products were counted as unique samples in subsequent enumerations unless otherwise stated since they represent distinct purchasing choices for consumers prior to analysis all products were deidentified to eliminate processing bias individual products were referred to by a coded number aliquots

acid additive detailed analytical methodology a representative chromatogram of all analytes fig s1 and optimized ms ms parameters table s3 table s4 are presented in the si pfas were quantitated and reported as their acid form using relative response of analytes to their respective internal standards table s2 calibrated to a five point standard curve from 0 125 to 25 μg l calibration curves were fitted using linear regression with inverse concentration weighting and had r2 values greater than 0 99 in each analytical run 2 3 quality assurance and quality control quality control qc sampling and calculations were employed to ensure accurate and reproducible pfas measurements at concentrations approaching analytical limits of detection extraction blanks and spiked water samples 250 ml were prepared and analyzed across batches for qc table s5 blanks milli q water n 7 yielded infrequent and low levels of pfas detection a maximum single analyte concentration of 1 15 ng l 6 2 fts was observed in a single blank milli q water spiked with 2 4 ng l of pfas n 9 yielded analyte recoveries of 75 111 with the exception of 6 2 fts 157 recovery method detection limits mdls were calculated based on epa standard methods u s epa 2016 detailed in the si mdls table s5 were 0 11 1 04 ng l for all analytes except for pftria 2 82 ng l and 6 2 fts 10 31 ng l mdls for ultrashort chain pfpra and pfprs were 0 45 ng l and 0 11 ng l respectively sporadic elevated concentrations of 6 2 fts in qc samples led to its high mdl which may be attributed to background contamination in laboratory consumables given its widespread use in manufacturing wang et al 2013 mdls were treated as the lower limit of quantitation lloq for all analyses values greater than or equal to the mdl were quantitated and values below the mdl were reported as non detects all blank concentrations were less than or equal to mdl values and therefore no blank subtraction was employed on samples method performance in sample matrix was evaluated using spring waters fortified with 5 ng l of all pfas analytes n 4 average matrix recovery background concentration of non spiked samples subtracted was 81 103 for most analytes indicating low matrix bias compared to spiked milli q water table s5 recovery of pfpra was 90 and pfprs was 98 recoveries of fbsa 66 and fhxsa 69 were slightly below this range and can be attributed to their lack of isotopically labelled internal standards with both similar retention and functionality table s1 inter batch precision in matrix spikes was high with coefficients of variation c v below 11 for all analytes all 101 water products were analyzed for pfas in an initial screening approximately 20 n 21 of products were selected for replicate extractions and analyses using different bottles timestamped from the same bottling or expiration date table s6 products with total detected pfas concentrations greater than 2 ng l n 8 and an additional random selection of the remaining products n 11 underwent duplicate measurements duplicate bottle measurements were precise with differences in summed concentrations of all analyzed pfas no greater than 0 39 ng l table s6 two randomly selected products 3 and 89 were analyzed with five replicates to further examine potential for variability within manufactured bottled product batches in product 3 an average summed concentration of 1 5 ng l was measured with a 0 63 ng l range and a 16 c v in product 89 all five replicates yielded non detects these replicate measurements demonstrated reproducibility in the analytical method and also highlighted consistency in pfas concentrations measured in separate bottles from similar timestamps all product concentrations were reported as average values if replicates measurements were performed 2 4 statistical analysis mann whitney wilcoxon mww and kruskal wallis kw ranked sum tests were used to compare individual and summed pfas concentrations non parametrically on the basis of categorical groupings pairwise differences between significant kw groupings were calculated using pairwise wilcoxon ranked sum pwrs tests with the benjamini hochberg procedure for false discovery rate control for each compound non detects below calculated mdls were included in ranked sum calculations and equally assigned the average lowest ranking helsel 2011 significance was set at a threshold of p 0 05 using two tailed tests all statistical calculations were performed in r 3 results 3 1 occurrence of pfas in tested products pfas were detected in 39 of the 101 39 bottled water products analyzed with concentration profiles shown in fig 1 in aggregate 62 of all tested products had no detected pfas 20 had summed pfas concentrations σ32pfas less than 1 ng l 16 between 1 and 5 ng l and 3 above 12 ng l analytical results for all products are reported in table s6 fifteen of the 32 analytes tested were detected in at least one product above their mdls table 1 detected analytes were c3 c10 pfca c3 c6 and c8 pfsa 8 2 fts and fbsa the most frequently detected compounds were pfoa 25 of total samples pfpra 22 and pfbs 17 however differences in method sensitivity to analytes reflected in mdl values may potentially bias the detection frequency towards analytes with lower mdls and obscure the presence of low concentration analytes with higher detection limits at an equal lloq cutoff of 0 5 ng l above each detected analyte mdl there was a more even distribution of positive detects table 1 no compound was detected in more than 5 samples at this threshold with the exception of pfpra which was still detected in 19 samples for pfoa and pfbs the majority of detections were at trace levels between their mdl values and 0 5 ng l the abundance of each detected analyte relative to total measured pfas across all samples was reported in table 1 ultrashort chain pfpra accounted for the largest fraction of pfas 42 while no other analyte accounted for more than 12 of the total the next two largest contributors were long chain pfoa 12 and pfna 8 pfca were the dominant detected compound class 83 compared to pfsa 16 and other classes 1 total short chain perfluoroalkyl acids pfaa with less than 6 perfluorinated carbons were twice as abundant as long chain pfaa 32 table 1 3 2 product category comparisons several differences in pfas detection frequency were observed between the tested product categories table s7 among the most frequently detected pfas ultrashort chain pfpra was detected in 21 45 spring waters but only in 1 35 purified and in no distilled or alkaline waters similarly short chain pfbs was detected in 13 45 spring waters at a much higher frequency than any other product type in contrast long chain pfoa was detected most frequently in 4 6 distilled waters compared to 14 45 spring 4 15 alkaline and 3 35 purified waters in total pfas was detected in 4 6 distilled waters 25 45 spring waters 6 15 alkaline waters and 4 35 purified waters using ranked sum kw comparisons concentrations of pfpra pfbs pfhxs pfhpa pfoa pfna and all aggregate pfas concentrations were found to be significantly different p 0 05 between product types table s8 pwrs comparisons revealed that distilled water products contained significantly greater concentrations p 0 05 of pfhxs and pfna than all other waters and greater pfca long chain pfaa and σ32pfas than purified waters table s9 notably only long chain pfhxs pfhpa pfoa pfos and pfna were detected in distilled waters fig 1 additionally spring waters contained more pfpra and short chain pfaa than both alkaline and purified waters and more pfoa pfca long chain pfaa and σ32pfas than purified waters the distribution of aggregate concentrations between product categories are compared visually in fig 2 a one of the underlying factors potentially driving differences in pfas between product types was the water treatment that each product received of the water treatment processes presumed to be effective for pfas removal gac anion exchange ro and possibly distillation only distillation and ro had explicitly stated use on product labeling for each of these treatment processes products were categorized binarily as either explicitly having received the treatment or not the absence of information does not necessarily preclude the bottle from treatment but served as a conservative delineation products labeled as receiving ro treatment n 38 contained significantly less pfpra pfoa pfca short and long chain pfaa and σ32pfas than those that were not fig 2b table s10 in contrast products labeled as receiving distillation treatment n 16 which was not exclusive to distilled water products only contained significantly less pfpra and short chain pfaa than those that were not fig 2c table s10 measured water quality parameters table s11 did not reveal any generalizable associations with pfas concentrations whether on an individual compound or aggregate grouping basis additionally no spatial patterns in pfas concentrations were identified based on stated product source locations fig s2 3 3 investigation of products with high pfas concentrations the three products with highest measured pfas concentrations 32 66 69 all contained σ32pfas 12 ng l the highest individual concentrations of 12 15 detected compounds in this study except pfbs pfda and 8 2 fts were found among these three samples products 66 and 69 were both spring waters that shared the same bottler and source spring but were differently branded products with different bottling dates both had very similar pfas profiles σ32pfas 17 5 18 9 ng l fig 1 in contrast product 32 was a purified water from a municipal water source treated with ro it was notable that various water quality parameters measured in these products were among the highest of all products sampled table s11 products 66 and 69 were within the 96th percentile of measured nitrate concentrations 7 8 and 10 1 mg l respectively and 95th percentile of measured conductivity 516 and 658 μs cm respectively product 32 was within the 98th percentile of measured toc concentration 1 8 mg l additional samples of these higher concentration products were obtained to determine whether waters bottled across other dates of production were consistently contaminated with pfas single samples of products timestamped with unique expiration dates separated by a minimum of 2 weeks were analyzed for pfas and water quality table s12 these values were not incorporated into summaries or statistical comparisons in prior sections three samples of product 32 with timestamps spanning 19 5 months were acquired five samples of product 69 were acquired spanning 4 months product 66 was not further investigated since it had the same stated source as 69 for both products relative abundances of individual pfas were qualitatively consistent across all timestamps fig 3 in product 32 σ32pfas concentrations were also stable with a measured range of 10 9 12 0 ng l fig 3a in contrast the σ32pfas concentrations in product 69 varied more widely with a measured range of 10 5 21 3 ng l fig 3b similar variability was also reflected in measured water quality measured constituents were stable in product 32 but varied substantially in product 69 table s12 it was also observed that conductivity had a positive linear correlation with σ32pfas concentration in product 69 with good fit r2 0 98 between the five sampled timestamps fig s3 4 discussion 4 1 comparative occurrence of pfas in bottled water to the authors knowledge this is the first peer reviewed study to investigate occurrence of pfas in bottled water sold in the u s there are however limited non peer reviewed data for u s bottled water to which the findings of this study can be compared for context a 2016 fda survey of 30 bottled waters collected from retailers in the washington d c metropolitan area analyzed pfoa and pfos but neither were detected above the study s 4 ng l lloq u s fda 2016 no product from the present study contained more than 2 ng l of either c8 compound which would have yielded a similar absence of detection using the higher lloq of the fda survey consumer reports reported testing results for 35 nationally available noncarbonated water brands for 30 pfas using a modified epa 537 1 method and found only 2 samples 6 contained σ30pfas exceeding 1 ng l 1 21 4 64 ng l with majority of samples containing pfas between unspecified detection limits and 1 ng l felton 2020 in the present study a much larger fraction of samples 19 contained σ32pfas in excess of 1 ng l however when ultrashort chain c3 pfas were excluded from this total only 9 of samples were in excess of 1 ng l which is in close agreement with the consumer reports survey a small body of peer reviewed literature exists for pfas occurrence in bottled water sampled from fourteen different countries not including the u s table 2 with the exception of work by gellrich et al 2013 n 119 samples pfas measurements in bottled waters were generally a small component of larger studies investigating other drinking water sources or contaminants between studies there was a wide range of sample size n 4 119 number of measured analytes n 6 29 lloq 0 02 82 ng l and measured results table 2 that make quantitative comparison difficult pfas were detected in samples with frequencies from 0 to 100 and with a σpfas range of 0 08 118 ng l despite the variation in study design and analytical methods some qualitative comparisons can be made between peer reviewed studies a subset of pfaa most frequently including c4 6 8 pfsa and c5 10 pfca were common analytes to nearly all studies there was general agreement among past study results that detected pfca were more highly abundant than pfsa gellrich et al 2013 kaboré et al 2018 schwanz et al 2016 ünlü endirlik et al 2019 with the exception of work by le coadou et al 2017 that detected a greater fraction of pfsa compared to pfca our study found pfas mass was overwhelmingly pfca 83 versus pfsa 16 in agreement with most other studies across the reviewed global literature where frequency of detection could be determined pfas were detected above varying lloq values in 59 175 of 299 of sampled bottled waters compared to 39 in this study the maximum σ32pfas from the screening in our study including 18 9 ng l and excluding 14 8 ng l ultrashort chain c3 compounds not analyzed in the previous literature was within the published range described for other countries table 2 with the exception of results from schwanz et al 2016 the maximum σpfas found in any other single bottled water sample was 24 2 ng l in germany gellrich et al 2013 data collected by schwanz et al was notable in that exceptionally high concentrations of c14 16 and 18 pfca were detected in french and brazilian water products up to 29 ng l each with σ16pfas up to 118 ng l nearly an order of magnitude greater than σ32pfas reported in our results in comparison no pfas longer than c10 were detected in any sample from our study excluding concentrations of c16 and c18 pfca which were not analyzed in our study or detected in other bottled water studies the maximum σ14pfas of 67 7 ng l from schwanz et al is more comparable to the rest of the reported literature values overall current literature indicates that pfas have been widely detected in bottled water sampled in locations worldwide at low ppt concentrations however detection has not been ubiquitous in all sampled products results from this study demonstrate that bottled waters available in the u s are not exceptional in this regard compared to other countries it should be noted that this study was not evenly representative of the hundreds of different bottled water products available throughout the u s of the 73 studied products with identified water sources 49 were from the east coast of the u s including 24 from the state of pennsylvania representing a regional bias proximal to the purchase location fig s2 a more geographically diverse sampling campaign incorporating additional products and source locations may elucidate regional variations in bottled water pfas not observed in this study 4 2 factors influencing pfas presence in bottled water in this study lower measured concentrations of pfas in purified waters compared to spring waters fig 3a can likely be explained by the high usage of ro treatment in purified water products ro treatment was explicitly stated for 25 35 purified products compared to only 1 45 spring water products table s1 water treatment studies of ro have demonstrated almost complete rejection of pfas regardless of chain length including pfas as short as ultrashort chain tfa appleman et al 2014 scheurer et al 2017 although pfas concentrations were significantly lower in purified waters it should not be assumed that these trends necessarily extend to other contaminant classes as sources and treatments vary for example ikem 2010 found lower concentrations of trihalomethanes in u s spring waters compared to purified and tap water likely a result of chlorination treatment employed by municipal water sources the measured pfas in distilled waters were unexpected products that underwent distillation contained less short chain pfaa than untreated fig 2c and only long chain pfas were detected in labelled distilled water products fig 1 this was seemingly counterintuitive since more effective separation would be expected for longer chain homologs with greater differential vapor pressure and anionic speciation at environmental ph rayne and forest 2010 however these results must be interpreted in the context of the sample size given the limited number of distilled water products n 6 tested and low overall detection frequency in distillation treated products 7 16 regardless the presence of long chain pfas indicate that distilled water products cannot be assumed to be pfas free this may be relevant to environmental sampling where distilled water could be used as a readily accessible analytical blank it may also be important when considering exposures for susceptible populations such as children who are exposed to distilled waters in infant formula and room humidifiers although significant differences in pfas content were observed between stated bottled water product classifications further research is needed to validate hypothesized causal links only finished products were measured in this study and definitive connections to specific sources waters could not be determined for all products measuring changes in pfas from known source waters to bottled products would provide a more definitive understanding of intermediate treatment process efficacy furthermore production information such as source water type location and an exhaustive listing of water treatments used were not available for all tested products the detection of low ppt pfas in 39 of bottled waters including over half of the spring waters that in most instances would be absent of effective treatment provides telling evidence of their pervasive detection across wide geographical areas fig s2 even in water assumed to be protected from contamination hu et al 2016 found strong positive spatial associations throughout the u s between pfas in municipal drinking water supplies and the presence of industrial facilities afff sites and wastewater treatment plants within the same watershed they also determined that pfas was detected over twice as frequently in drinking supplies sourced from groundwater compared to surface water hu et al 2016 pfaa may be found in non industrial areas far down gradient from known point sources due to their high mobility in water björnsdotter et al 2019 wei et al 2018 for example detected pfas in 100 of 102 groundwater samples σ14pfas of 2 7 560 ng l collected from non industrial groundwater sites additionally it has been postulated by others that dispersed sources such as precipitation may also contribute to observed concentrations of pfas in groundwaters björnsdotter et al 2019 wei et al 2018 the possibility of additional systematic pfas contamination from the bottling and packaging process was considered but appears unlikely ünlü endirlik et al 2019 found no significant differences in pfas concentrations between identical water products in plastic versus glass packaging suggesting that plastic bottles are not significant contributors to pfas this is also supported by the comparatively few number of pfas detections in purified waters versus spring waters in this study despite these products using similar plastic bottles in the most contaminated products from this study products 32 and 69 elevated levels of measured water quality constituents toc nitrate conductivity relative to other samples anecdotally illustrate that pfas contamination in bottled water can co occur with other inputs from human impact elevated nitrate for example could indicate agricultural activity power and schepers 1989 while elevated toc could indicate waste upgradient to a source water masoner et al 2014 across extended intervals of bottling dates stable pfas concentrations in bottled waters e g 32 may suggest a steady contaminant flux in source waters variable concentrations with consistent pfas profiles e g 69 could suggest seasonal dilution of a contaminated source with uncontaminated water as exemplified by product 69 fig s3 contaminated products that demonstrate a strong correlation between pfas and other readily measured water quality parameters could be more frequently monitored using these parameters as surrogates this however this would need to be tested and validated on a case by case basis 4 3 implications of ultrashort chain pfaa detection to date ultrashort chain pfaa excluding tfa have been poorly studied in drinking water and drinking water sources this may be due to perceived analytical challenges of highly polar compounds the perception of lower human health risks due to decreased bioaccumulation potential and lack of current regulatory scrutiny compared to longer chain homologs ateia et al 2019 björnsdotter et al 2020 mak et al 2009 reported unspecified trace concentrations of pfpra and pfprs 5 ng l in japanese tap water that were dwarfed in concentration by longer chain compounds björnsdotter et al 2019 reported detections of pfpra up to 28 ng l and pfprs 0 18 ng l in two treated drinking water samples from sweden accounting for up to 84 of σ29 pfas kaboré et al 2018 detected trace 1 ng l concentrations of pfprs in 100 n 24 of tap waters from ivory coast and burkina faso these concentrations were approximately the same order of magnitude of the maximum pfpra and pfprs screened in this study table 1 much higher concentrations of c3 pfaa up to 63 μg l have been found in contaminated groundwaters downgradient of point sources such as afff landfill leachate and hazardous waste management facilities as co contaminants with a variety of longer chain pfas barzen hanson and field 2015 björnsdotter et al 2019 additionally pfpra was found with near ubiquity in several rainwater sampling studies scott et al 2006 detected pfpra in 92 n 181 of north american rainwater samples with concentrations up to 120 ng l in maryland separately kwok et al 2010 detected pfpra in every tested rainwater sample n 52 which was the most abundant of 20 tested pfas with concentrations up to 45 3 ng l the high mass abundance of pfpra in this study 41 5 relative to other pfas may be related to its mobility in the built and natural environment pfpra is much less amenable to sorption processes than longer chain homologs ateia et al 2019 in groundwater this could enable low concentrations of the substance to be detected at great distances from its initial source björnsdotter et al 2019 in water treatment systems sorptive processes such as gac and ion exchange are proven to be less effective removing short chain pfaa compared to long chain pfaa appleman et al 2014 it was notable that only a single purified and ro treated bottled water product contained a pfpra detection table s7 which can be attributed to the overall efficacy of ro in pfas removal and process s lack of chain length bias appleman et al 2014 even though pfpra may be effectively removed from ro treated water it is concentrated in reject brine that may be returned to the water cycle through wastewater discharge without effective capture substances with persistent mobile and toxic pmt characteristics such as c3 pfaa are receiving greater attention as potentially irreversible sources of toxic exposure in water hale et al 2020 rüdel et al 2020 for example the european chemicals agency recently identified short chain pfbs and hfpo da as substances of very high concern svhc based on characteristics including persistence ability for long range transport and difficulty in removal in the environment hale et al 2020 in contrast to long chain pfas that may bioaccumulate in organisms shorter chain compounds such as pfpra may accumulate in the global water cycle over time without breakdown or sequestration however many highly mobile compounds that may already be ubiquitous in the environment are underreported due to analytical challenges of measuring small highly polar compounds hale et al 2020 in contrast to even more polar compounds such as tfa that may require specialized ion exchange scheurer et al 2017 or normal phase chromatography rüdel et al 2020 for analysis c3 pfas could be measured by traditional reverse phase lc without major method modification more widespread inclusion of these analytes in drinking water measurements would provide a more complete pfas mass balance and help close the knowledge gap that can inform future regulatory decision making 4 4 pfas regulation and health guidance in the u s pfas regulations or guidance have been proposed and or enacted for municipal tap water at the state level currently no such regulations exist for bottled water which is regulated as a food product by the fda since u s fda standards for bottled water are intended to follow epa contaminant limits in drinking water u s fda 2020 pfas levels measured in this study were compared to known regulatory guidelines for context the maximum detected concentrations of pfoa and pfos 2 ng l each were over an order of magnitude lower than the 70 ng l epa lifetime advisory level concentrations were also below current u s state level mcls though the upper bound samples were only two to three fold lower than the most stringent regulations product 69 contained up to 3 2 ng l of pfna over half of the 6 ng l mcl in michigan michigan department of environment great lakes and energy 2020 the sum of pfoa pfos pfna pfhxs pfhpa and pfda in 69 totaled up to 7 2 ng l one third of the 20 ng l 6 compound summative mcl for these compounds in massachusetts massachusetts department of environmental protection 2020 in comparison to the 5 ng l individual and 10 ng l summative standards of quality required by the ibwa for its member companies international bottled water association 2020 product 69 was found to be in exceedance in 2 5 timestamped samples σ18pfas 10 3 11 1 ng l health based pfas ingestion guidelines established in the e u and u s can also benchmark pfas exposure in bottled water the u s epa established non cancer chronic reference doses rfds for three individual pfas pfoa pfos and pfbs from 20 to 300 ng kg day which represent maximum acceptable intake without known deleterious health effects u s epa 2021 using an epa recommended 95th percentile all ages drinking water ingestion rate of 37 ml kg day u s epa 2019a and assuming exclusive consumption of bottled water theoretical maximum pfas exposure rates from bottled water in this study were calculated compared to these rfds table s13 bottled water exposures of 0 032 0 053 ng kg day for individual compounds were between two to four orders of magnitude lower than rfds there has however been criticism that these rfds are not protective against immunotoxic effects such as decreased vaccine response and increased childhood infections these studies have suggested that the rfds should potentially be one to two orders of magnitude lower grandjean and budtz jørgensen 2013 pachkowski et al 2019 recently the european food safety authority efsa recommended a tolerable weekly intake twi threshold of 4 4 ng kg week for the combination of four prevalent pfas pfoa pfos pfna and pfhxs efsa 2020 this value is substantially lower than that of the epa and considers decreased immune response the critical risk assessment outcome efsa 2020 the calculated maximum exposure rate of 1 59 ng kg week for bottled water table s13 was below the twi threshold by a factor of three considering that other modes of ingestion such as food air and dust deposition also contribute to human pfas intake products with comparably high concentrations may be a major contributor toward this threshold exceedance five products in this study would have exposure values within an order of magnitude of the twi while the remaining 95 of products would have exposure values over 20 fold less although 39 of bottled water products in this study contained measurable pfas the majority did not contain measured pfas at concentrations exceeding contemporary guidance results of this study do however support the need for a standardized framework to screen source waters used to produce bottled waters for potentially infrequent but elevated levels of pfas moreover as analytical methods toxicological understanding and treatment technologies continue to improve regulations and health based guidelines are likely to undergo revision levels of pfas considered tolerable today may or may not continue to be so in the future it should be noted that the σ32pfas values reported in this study while useful aggregate metrics are not an exhaustive measure of total pfas reported concentrations and detection frequencies in this and other studies are limited by the number of analytes tested and sensitivity of the analytical method potentially underestimating the amount of pfas in a sample for example over half of the detected pfas mass in this study 53 8 would not have been found using the widely accepted epa method 537 1 due to exclusion of short chain pfaa and odd chain pfsa conversely the σpfas values could be orders of magnitude greater if c2 tfa was analyzed given its ubiquity in the global water cycle berg et al 2000 this summation also does not distinguish between differences in compound functionality or chain length as many health based metrics do although longer chain pfaa represent the majority of current regulatory focus buck et al 2011 other unmeasured pfas may become increasingly relevant over time to this end future studies may consider using non targeted high resolution ms for data acquisition providing a digital sample archive that could be retrospectively screened for additional pfas and contaminants of interest 5 conclusions pfas were detected in 39 101 uniquely labelled bottled water samples fifteen of 32 targeted analytes were detected in at least one sample the majority of which were pfca c10 and pfsa c8 pfca were over five times more abundant than pfsa and short chain pfaa 6 cf2 were over twice as abundant than long chain pfaa on a mass basis the majority of samples 97 contained σ32pfas concentrations below 5 ng l purified water products contained significantly less σ32pfas than spring water products which was attributed to the presence of water treatment in purified products products specifically labelled as having received ro treatment contained significantly less σ32pfas than those without such indication ultrashort chain c3 pfpra and pfprs were quantitated for the first time in bottled water pfpra was the most abundant of all measured pfas detected in 22 101 samples and accounting for 42 of measured sample mass abundance pfpra was almost exclusively detected in spring waters 95 of detections and was lower in purified and ro treated products measured concentrations of pfas in u s bottled waters were consistent with products investigated internationally no enforceable national regulations exist for pfas in u s bottled water the occurrence of some products that approach levels of concern warrants consideration of monitoring pfas in bottled water

16844,continual and accelerating declines in hydrological connectivity threaten ecosystem processes biodiversity and services throughout the world therefore there is an increasing demand for user driven tools that assess hydrological connectivity from an effective perspective we developed the connectivity assessment tool 1 0 cast1 0 which takes the threshold behaviors of focal ecological indicators into account allows quantifying effective hydrological connectivity and its regime shift we illustrate the use of cast1 0 for the case of poyang lake china it was found that the response of effective hydrological connectivity to inundation depth flow velocity and water temperature follows a dynamic threshold effect the evaluation of connected objects based on specific niches provides a valuable metric for recognizing potential habitat patches and links this study provides a sound basis for assessing hydrological connectivity in a meaningful way promising to provide novel insights into maintaining and restoring biodiversity and associated ecosystem services around the world graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrological connectivity habitat suitability threshold effect ecological indicator floodplain 1 introduction hydrological connectivity defined as the water mediated transfer of matter energy and or organisms within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle is critical for promoting the formation development and stability of natural water systems and the conservation of biodiversity in general crooks sanjayan 2006 pringle 2001 the connectivity of rivers throughout the world has been weakened affecting many of the fundamental processes and functions characteristic of healthy rivers and leading to the rapid decline of biodiversity and essential ecosystem services belletti et al 2020 couto et al 2021 grill et al 2019 su et al 2021 there is a growing need for more robust and objective quantification of hydrological connectivity to knit together disciplinary interests across hydrologic geomorphic and ecologic perspectives covino 2017 however the structural complexity of most subtropical floodplains and their seasonal inundation patterns creates significant challenges to characterizing or quantifying hydrological connectivity relevant research of hydrological connectivity encompasses three aspects including structural connectivity functional connectivity process based connectivity and effective connectivity rinderer et al 2018 structural connectivity refers to the passage of water from one part of the landscape to another lexartza artza and wainwright 2009 while functional connectivity focuses on how structural elements interact with catchment processes to produce runoff bracken et al 2013 more recently there has developed a wide consensus that hydrological connectivity is species specific and should be measured from an effective perspective that is not only the spatial arrangement of the adjacency or contiguity characteristics structural and functional connectivity but the behavioral response of the focal species and sediment suspension to the physical structure of the continuum effective connectivity should also be taken into account li et al 2021 however the lack of a consensus framework for quantifying effective connectivity has made the operationalization of the concept difficult changes in hydrological connectivity lead to changes in such key hydrodynamic parameters as inundation depth flow velocity and water temperature which have a significant impact on the hydrologic cycle sediment transport and population dynamic of waterbirds fish phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates fig 1 first of all hydrological connectivity controls the timing extent and duration of flooding liu et al 2020 tan et al 2019 flow velocity and water temperature are the main factors affecting the incipient motion and flocculation of sediment particles jiang et al 2002 li et al 2016 habitat suitability for waterbirds is largely related to their body dimensions especially the length of their legs beak and neck and the depth of feeding water aharon rotman et al 2017 due to low temperatures and high velocity juvenile fish born in river mainstreams usually need to enter lakes for food taking advantage of river flooding and backflow then return to the mainstream after maturity abrial et al 2019 mckey et al 2016 water temperature is an essential condition for phytoplankton photosynthesis and is closely related to the rate of intracellular enzyme reaction plant anabolism and respiration woolway et al 2020 zohary et al 2020 meanwhile low flow velocity prolongs the residence time of eutrophic water providing a long growth and reproduction period for phytoplankton and vice versa tian et al 2021 moreover hydrological connectivity directly affects the migration foraging and reproductive behavior of macroinvertebrates in a hydrologic and hydrodynamic manner that is through flood extent and duration inundation depth flow velocity and water temperature and reshapes the macroinvertebrate food web by indirectly changing the water environment via nutrients pollutants dissolved oxygen and water transparency gallardo et al 2008 at the same time the sediment transport and spatial temporal dynamics of habitat suitability respond to changes in inundation depth flow velocity and water temperature following a threshold behavior liu et al 2020 that is any of the relevant hydrodynamic parameters can trigger strong feedbacks in community structure biological abundance and biodiversity when its changes exceed the ecological resilience of the focal species saco et al 2020 in order to successfully integrate habitat suitability and sediment suspension behavior the assessment of hydrological connectivity should depend on the wet dry pattern e g distribution of wet and dry patches inundation depth flow velocity water temperature and so on we have developed a new connectivity assessment tool 1 0 cast1 0 that takes the threshold behaviors of key ecological indicators into account and quantifies the effective hydrological connectivity of floodplains it evaluates as well connectivity improvements provided by new potential habitat sites that may be added in the floodplain through habitat creation or restoration this study is expected to provide a novel insight into assessing hydrological connectivity in a meaningful way 2 study site a case study of poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china was conducted to evaluate the application prospects of cast1 0 poyang lake is located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river it receives inflow from five tributaries in the south and empties into yangtze river via an outlet at its northern extremity influenced by the typical subtropical monsoon climate the lake level with considerable annual variation 8 22 m shapes an extensive floodplain of more than 3000 km2 that consists of seasonally inundated wetlands sub lakes rivers and the main lake from april to may the floodplain is recharged not only by the five rivers upstream but also by the main lake downstream displaying a two way hydraulic characteristic from june to september all units in the floodplain are submerged and merge into one single water body from october to november the water body shrinks from the upland to the lowland of the floodplain displaying a one way hydraulic characteristic from december to the next march nearly all sub lakes become isolated and the water volume is dominated by precipitation evaporation and infiltration these unique hydrologic hydrodynamic characteristics provide vital habitats for waterbirds fish phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates making poyang lake one of the world s most important wetlands in recent years the expansion and shrinkage patterns of the poyang lake floodplain have experienced significant changes due to the combined effects of climate change hydraulic project construction and sand mining activities these changes have altered the original habitat suitability putting degrading wetlands at risk of environmental deterioration biomass losses and biodiversity reduction there is an urgent need to research the spatial variation in hydrological processes that result in the development of habitats and communities from the perspective of effective hydrological connectivity to provide a basis for the delineation of reservoirs and the restoration of degraded wetlands 3 methods 3 1 connectivity assessment tool the new cast1 0 software provides quantitative metrics of effective hydrological connectivity fig 2 cast1 0 was developed using matlab based on a geostatistical analysis script rewritten by trigg et al 2013 this geostatistical analysis approach quantifies the probability of connection between each pixel at a specified distance and enables characterization of spatial temporal patterns of connected objects that can be used to interpret transitions and thresholds in flow processes we recommend articles by tan et al 2019 and li et al 2019 for additional information cast1 0 contains five functional modules the ecological indicator user parameters input options output options and results preview in the first module six ecological indicators are recommended including hydrology waterbirds fish sediment suspension phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates along with the required parameter of wet dry pattern users can choose one or more hydrodynamic parameters from inundation depth flow velocity and water temperature as criteria of habitat suitability for the selected ecological indicators and set their thresholds georeferenced images tif format or points with latitude longitude information xlsx or txt format both meet the input requirement of the source type users can process interpolation projection transformation clipping and pixel resampling via the preprocessing function except for the interpolation images cast1 0 will output two types of results to the specified folder once the calculation is completed 1 the connected object connob which is defined as a cluster of valid pixels with the same attributes inundation depth flow velocity and water temperature if the attributes of a connob satisfy the requirement of a species the connob refers to a suitable habitat patches cells etc within which all pixels are considered connected there is no effective connectivity between different connobs 2 the connectivity function cf which quantifies the possibility of a surface hydrological connection between rivers or lakes and their floodplain in the horizontal direction and enables characterization of spatial and temporal patterns that can be used to interpret transitions and thresholds in flow processes the probability p expressed in the cf can be calculated by the following algorithm p n z c p r j 1 n i u j z c 1 where i u j z c is an index for determining whether the variable z u j at the position u j exceeds the threshold z c if z u j z c then i u j z c 1 or otherwise zero all positions in the computation domain are estimated from the starting position u 1 the higher the spatial entropy of the computational domain the faster the p n z c approaches zero as n increases therefore the value of the connectivity function in any given distance is the proportion of connected points in a specific direction within the distance range the last module provides separate previews of cf values going w e n s nw se and ne sw the software is available online this framework differs from traditional hydrological connectivity assessment methods which take into account only the wet dry pattern it defines effective units by integrating the flow velocity threshold of sediment suspension as well as the inundation depth flow velocity and water temperature thresholds of suitable habitats for waterbirds fish phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates for example to assess the potential distribution of phytoplankton pixels with a flow velocity of 0 0 30 m s and water temperature from 20 to 30 are considered effective defined as 1 otherwise ineffective defined as 0 recommended parameters and their thresholds can be found in the software manual the effective hydrological connectivity can then be calculated based on the binary data a habitat that is well suited to a species or community should be both abundant and well connected that is effective hydrological connectivity may be low if habitat patches are poorly connected even if their total area is large 3 2 mike 21 using mike 21 a 2d depth averaged finite volume flow model of poyang lake developed by li et al 2017 the water level velocity and temperature in waterbodies during 2015 were simulated observed daily hydrologic data on lake inflows and outlet discharge and temperature were used to provide the boundary conditions for the mike 21 the hydrometeorological input data included the daily discharge of five tributaries the water level at the hukou gage station precipitation evaporation air temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed and direction the model was validated with extensive field measurements and remote sensing data in 2015 for the modeled water levels the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ens varied from 0 95 to 0 99 the determination coefficient r2 ranged from 0 97 to 0 99 and the root mean square error rmse was less than 0 5 m indicating a close agreement with field observations the water temperatures were also predicted satisfactorily producing ens r2 and an rmse within the ranges of 0 92 0 96 0 94 0 99 and 1 5 1 9 respectively there is also a close agreement between the modeled and observed velocity with a relatively low discrepancy 0 20 m s at a shallow water depth 2 m below the surface of the lake li et al 2018 detailed information on the model setup calibration and validation can be found in li et al 2017 4 results 4 1 threshold effect according to the main flow direction of poyang lake an n s connectivity analysis was conducted using 8 way connectivity 8d which allows cells connected by an edge and corner vertex the connob spatial distribution and cf curves are illustrated in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 a the threshold of inundation depth had a greater impact during the dry period on hydrological connectivity than it did during the flood period during the dry period large areas of the southern sub lakes and eastern bays disconnected from the main lake when the depth threshold changed from 0 m to 0 5 m with the largest connob decreasing from 1422 88 km2 to 213 60 km2 as the depth threshold increased a considerable portion of the valid units became invalid and the main watercourse was no longer continuous it can be seen from the cf curve in fig 3 a that an abrupt change of hydrological connectivity was likely to occur when the depth threshold changed from 0 to 0 5 m the inundation depth had a minor effect on the hydrological connectivity during the flood period when the depth threshold was 2 0 m the largest connob was only 187 61 km2 smaller than when the depth threshold was 0 m when the threshold was 3 0 m some valid units in the alluvial delta of the west bank became invalid the southern sub lakes were disconnected from the main lake until the threshold was greater than 4 0 m during a flood event the regime shift of hydrological connectivity was likely to occur when the depth threshold went from 3 0 to 4 0 m since dish shaped lakes in the west the relatively closed bays in the east and sub lakes in the south have insufficient water mobility the impact of flow velocity threshold on hydrological connectivity was mainly manifested in the impact on the central and northern watercourses the impact on the southern lake was greater than the impact on the northern lake whether during a dry event or a flood event the northern watercourse was disconnected from the central watercourse when the flow velocity threshold was greater than 0 20 m s in comparison when the threshold was greater than 0 30 m s the northern watercourse also lost spatial continuity with the largest connob decreasing by 75 dry period and 85 flood period from the perspective of cf curves the hydrological connectivity of poyang lake changed dramatically when the flow velocity threshold increased from 0 10 m s to 0 20 m s during the flood period the temperature threshold had a greater impact on poyang lake s hydrological connectivity during the flood period than it did during the dry period during the dry period large connobs were mainly located in the main watercourses the northeastern bay became the largest connob when the temperature threshold reached 6 c while the northern and central watercourses maintained upstream downstream connectivity the temperature threshold had an obvious impact on the hydrological connectivity during a flood event when the temperature threshold was greater than 29 c for every 1 c increase the area of the largest connob decreased on average by 76 meanwhile poyang lake is divided into several main connobs such as the northwestern floodplain the southwestern floodplain the northeastern bay the southeastern bay and the southern sub lakes that are isolated from each other during the flood period poyang lake s hydrological connectivity underwent a sudden change when the temperature threshold reached 28 29 c 4 2 potential habitat the sediment incipient velocity and the thresholds of the key hydrodynamic parameters crucial to habitat quality were determined based on literature research results of which can be found in the shared cast1 0 user manual these thresholds were mainly derived from field observations and experiments given the variations in the hydrodynamic threshold required by different species and ecological factors with different characteristics this study broadens the threshold ranges to meet the hydrodynamic requirements of more ecological indicators for suitable habitats thereby improving the universal applicability of the assessment results afterward the inundation pattern the possibility of sediment suspension as well as the appearance of potential habitats for waterbirds fish phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates found at poyang lake in 2015 were analyzed as shown in fig 4 as the figure illustrates the inundation frequency of the eastern bays southern sub lakes and main watercourses was higher and the sandy hills alluvial cones and natural levees in the western floodplain had a lower inundation frequency potential waterbird habitats were mainly distributed in the southern alluvial deltas and on the edges of the northern dish shaped lakes however the eastern bays and main watercourses were not suitable habitats for waterbird due to the large inundation depth and difficulty in feeding contrary to the distribution pattern of potential waterbird habitats the eastern bays and main watercourses were the primary habitats for fish except for a few dish shaped lakes most of the floodplains acted less frequently as fish habitats because they were at suitable inundation depths for only short periods the lake bed with the highest occurrence of sediment suspension had the same spatial distribution as the lake bed with the most severe erosion yao et al 2018 which was mainly found in the main watercourses particularly the northern watercourse affected by the morphology the central lake eastern bays and southern sub lakes form relatively closed slow flow regions which increase the risk of algal blooms however because poyang lake is an open and interactive system with frequent water exchange the overall probability of algal blooms is not high in addition the main watercourses are not suitable as macroinvertebrate habitats due to their deep inundation depths and fast flow velocity because of their short inundation durations and shallow depths the highlands in the floodplain and at the edge of the lake also are unsuitable as macroinvertebrate habitats although most other habitats are relatively suitable for macroinvertebrates no region is suitable all year round as shown in fig 5 the annual change in the area of the potential waterbird habitat is relatively stable except for summer in the flood period especially from june to july the inundation depth of almost all floodplains exceeds the maximum feeding depth of waterbirds and the potential habitat area is close to zero rather potential fish habitats mainly appear in the flood period especially from june to july with an average area of more than 3000 km2 the average area of fish habitats in other months is only 417 70 km2 and the smallest area is less than 20 km2 influenced by the subtropical monsoon climate the inflow from the poyang lake basin increases from may to june accelerating the flow velocity which is likely to cause sediment suspension in the dry period from november to december the area where sediment suspension may occur is also large it may be due to the emptying effect of the rapid decline in the yangtze river s water level on poyang lake from may to october suitable flow velocity and water temperature provide favorable conditions for phytoplankton growth and reproduction restricted by low temperatures it is almost impossible for phytoplankton to appear from december to march of the following year there is no obvious regularity in the annual changes in the area of potential macroinvertebrate habitat the area during the dry and flood period is relatively small meanarea 1396 83 km2 with large fluctuations sdarea 904 98 km2 the area during the rising and recession period is relatively large meanarea 2396 43 km2 with small fluctuations sdarea 421 10 km2 5 discussion 5 1 cast vs other tools the growing demand for ecological protection has motivated researchers to develop many habitat suitability models to predict the potential habitat distribution of specific species such as openmodeller de souza muñoz et al 2009 and biomapper hirzel et al 2002 based on presence absence data of the focal species in a set of sampled locations and independent ecogeographical variables these may express topographical features ecological data or human superstructures these models build a presentation of the fundamental ecological requirements for a species and extrapolate these requirements into a geographical region sampling the presence absence data is a crucial part of the process the following two possible scenarios often increase the uncertainty of this method 1 the species could not be detected limited by observation methods or timing even though it was present 2 the species is absent because of historical reasons such as alien invasion even though the habitat is suitable in addition the most important point is that these models usually do not consider the connectivity among habitats some patches presumably were not colonized because of their isolation or too small to sustain a viable colony in the long term given this researchers developed a variety of connectivity assessment tools such as conefor saura and torné 2009 connectivity analysis toolkit carroll et al 2012 and fragstats mcgarigal and marks 1995 these tools can facilitate the maintenance of demographic flows genetic flows nutrient and hydraulic flows and the resilience of populations to landscape conversion and climate change compared with the effective hydrological connectivity in this study the biggest difference of these tools is that they pay more attention to landscape connectivity assuming that there is a link corridor between two nodes patches and evaluate the probabilities of direct dispersal between nodes and the link importance to overall connectivity by considering the different movement abilities and mortality risk of a species through different land cover types this assumption does not apply to aquatic organisms such as fish phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates that inhabit the water bodies of the floodplain while distance is not a limitation for long distance migratory waterbirds in addition potential habitat distribution is an important output of these tools ultimately whether the predicted habitat belongs to structural functional or effective connectivity depends on the evaluation basis and quality of nodes input to the tool with the advancement of computer technology physics based models such as phabsim waddle 2001 mesohabsim parasiewicz 2001 river2d steffler and blackburn 2002 and casimir benjankar et al 2011 can also simulate the eco hydrological process of floodplains and riverine systems unfortunately it usually focuses on a specific species and requires professional modeling knowledge and a large number of field observations and is very difficult to realize in ungauged remote regions in summary the cast1 0 has the following advantages 1 the whole process from data reading to pre processing to geostatistical analysis and finally to the preview of results can be realized with only one button without the need for complex parameter adjustment and professional programming foundation 2 realize effective hydrological connectivity and potential habitat assessment in one tool because the hydrological connectivity status is an important reference for the evaluation of the habitat quality of aquatic organisms 3 it couples key hydrodynamic parameters as the basis for the assessment of effective hydrological connectivity habitat suitability different from tools that only take the wet dry pattern into account the most significant disadvantage of this tool is that our analysis does not investigate fundamental niches and all thresholds of these key hydrodynamic parameters come from literature research although we try to select the results of studies in our study site and similar water systems when conducting literature research we also consider the habitat suitability of different species not genera such as waterbirds and different attributes of ecological indicators such as sediment particle size there is still no guarantee that the assessment has complete universality therefore cast1 0 provides a methodological framework for effective hydrological connectivity assessment considering habitat suitability of focal species which ecological indicators should be selected and how to determine the thresholds of these indicators relies on the criteria and responsibility of the user although there are deficiencies cast1 0 still has great practical value and wide application prospects 1 as potential habitats connobs are crucial for the biodiversity conservation provide a valuable reference for decision makers to delimit reservoirs and develop specific protection strategies for different species 2 the cf clustering feature can indicate the water level threshold at which the overall connectivity may undergo abrupt changes providing a scientific basis for hydrological regulation with the goal of optimizing effective hydrological connectivity 3 it is possible to evaluate the possibility of material energy and information exchanges between important geographic units and recognize the potential connected paths by calculating the connection frequency between key pixels and other pixels modifying the attributes of these paths is conducive to maintaining biodiversity and improving water quality water quality is an important indicator for evaluating ecosystem health and it is often affected by flow velocity normally the greater the flow velocity the more conducive to the diffusion and elimination of pollutants and the better the water quality but for poyang lake the flow velocity is greatest in the dry season and the water quality is often poor due to the low water volume and environmental capacity in addition the impact of basin pollution on water quality is usually greater than the impact of hydrological connectivity therefore this study did not take water quality as a typical ecological indicator for evaluating effective hydrological connectivity in the future improvement of cast we will try to couple the relationship between water quality and other parameters such as water environmental capacity vegetation type and sediment nutrient considering the variations in different hydrological periods and regions 5 2 interpretation of the case study inundation depth flow velocity and water temperature are key hydrodynamic parameters that affect the quality of aquatic habitats as well as important indicators for effective hydrological connectivity this study quantified their thresholds for poyang lake s typical ecological factors through literature research and analyzed the temporal and spatial dynamics of connob based on these thresholds these connobs provide potential habitats for ecological indicators the fragmentation of connobs indicates that the connectivity between habitats is blocked and the material transport energy flow and biological migration between patches are restricted which is detrimental to the survival and reproduction of species or populations at the same time the fragmentation of the habitat will also increase the boundary of the patch and produce physical edge effects campomizzi et al 2013 the edge of the habitat patch will show different ecological characteristics from the center thus changing the spatial distribution of the biological community for example different species of waterbirds such as the little egret gray heron and oriental white stork have strict minimum area requirements before they will breed when the habitat patch area is smaller than that minimum it is unsuitable for these species reproduction and they will not live in the patch jones et al 2013 in this paper the assessment of effective hydrological connectivity based on key hydrodynamic parameter thresholds provides an important basis for wetland biodiversity conservation however these thresholds are limited to specific types of water bodies and specific species and cannot be directly adopted without distinction for example the suitable inundation depths for different species of fish or the same fish with different body lengths are not the same du et al 2010 in addition fish spawning hatching of fish eggs fattening of juvenile fish and migration of adults require different flow velocities and water temperatures dadras et al 2017 ecological indicators have certain adaptability and survival strategies to respond to environmental changes for different types of water bodies such as rivers lakes and oceans the environmental factors that stimulate inhibit the occurrence and development of ecological indicators differ as do their thresholds therefore inundation depth flow velocity and water temperature are not the only parameters for affecting habitat quality and evaluating effective hydrological connectivity this study provides a new perspective for assessing the hydrological connectivity and predicting potential habitats in poyang lake it is expected that this framework can be promoted to other floodplains by combining more sensitive environmental elements and thresholds of local ecological indicators in poyang lake we found that fish habitats and phytoplankton habitats have a large overlapping area during the flood event in july fig 6 there is also a large overlap between phytoplankton habitats and macroinvertebrate habitats in the flood and recession period october however the results of this study cannot completely support these common sense conclusions for example it is difficult to find the predator prey relationship between waterbirds and fish phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates from the overlapping pattern of habitats during the dry period january that s because winter s low temperatures inhibit the distribution of phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates the potential fish habitat predicted in this study is mainly for fish with a body length of more than 20 cm which generally cannot be preyed upon by waterbirds on the other hand in addition to the hydrodynamic parameters an assessment of the equality of waterbird habitats must consider the distance from human disturbance the timing and rate of water level recession and the availability of food sources 6 conclusions this study developed an assessment tool for effective hydrological connectivity that has been successfully used on poyang lake it provides a new perspective for biodiversity conservation and habitat restoration in this region and is expected to be applied to similar floodplains the main conclusions include 1 the response of hydrological connectivity to inundation depth flow velocity and water temperature follows a dynamic threshold effect 2 the evaluation of connected objects based on specific niche provides a valuable metric for recognizing potential habitat patches and links 3 the spatial relationship among habitats for different ecological indicators shows evident seasonal variations declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no financial

16844,continual and accelerating declines in hydrological connectivity threaten ecosystem processes biodiversity and services throughout the world therefore there is an increasing demand for user driven tools that assess hydrological connectivity from an effective perspective we developed the connectivity assessment tool 1 0 cast1 0 which takes the threshold behaviors of focal ecological indicators into account allows quantifying effective hydrological connectivity and its regime shift we illustrate the use of cast1 0 for the case of poyang lake china it was found that the response of effective hydrological connectivity to inundation depth flow velocity and water temperature follows a dynamic threshold effect the evaluation of connected objects based on specific niches provides a valuable metric for recognizing potential habitat patches and links this study provides a sound basis for assessing hydrological connectivity in a meaningful way promising to provide novel insights into maintaining and restoring biodiversity and associated ecosystem services around the world graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrological connectivity habitat suitability threshold effect ecological indicator floodplain 1 introduction hydrological connectivity defined as the water mediated transfer of matter energy and or organisms within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle is critical for promoting the formation development and stability of natural water systems and the conservation of biodiversity in general crooks sanjayan 2006 pringle 2001 the connectivity of rivers throughout the world has been weakened affecting many of the fundamental processes and functions characteristic of healthy rivers and leading to the rapid decline of biodiversity and essential ecosystem services belletti et al 2020 couto et al 2021 grill et al 2019 su et al 2021 there is a growing need for more robust and objective quantification of hydrological connectivity to knit together disciplinary interests across hydrologic geomorphic and ecologic perspectives covino 2017 however the structural complexity of most subtropical floodplains and their seasonal inundation patterns creates significant challenges to characterizing or quantifying hydrological connectivity relevant research of hydrological connectivity encompasses three aspects including structural connectivity functional connectivity process based connectivity and effective connectivity rinderer et al 2018 structural connectivity refers to the passage of water from one part of the landscape to another lexartza artza and wainwright 2009 while functional connectivity focuses on how structural elements interact with catchment processes to produce runoff bracken et al 2013 more recently there has developed a wide consensus that hydrological connectivity is species specific and should be measured from an effective perspective that is not only the spatial arrangement of the adjacency or contiguity characteristics structural and functional connectivity but the behavioral response of the focal species and sediment suspension to the physical structure of the continuum effective connectivity should also be taken into account li et al 2021 however the lack of a consensus framework for quantifying effective connectivity has made the operationalization of the concept difficult changes in hydrological connectivity lead to changes in such key hydrodynamic parameters as inundation depth flow velocity and water temperature which have a significant impact on the hydrologic cycle sediment transport and population dynamic of waterbirds fish phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates fig 1 first of all hydrological connectivity controls the timing extent and duration of flooding liu et al 2020 tan et al 2019 flow velocity and water temperature are the main factors affecting the incipient motion and flocculation of sediment particles jiang et al 2002 li et al 2016 habitat suitability for waterbirds is largely related to their body dimensions especially the length of their legs beak and neck and the depth of feeding water aharon rotman et al 2017 due to low temperatures and high velocity juvenile fish born in river mainstreams usually need to enter lakes for food taking advantage of river flooding and backflow then return to the mainstream after maturity abrial et al 2019 mckey et al 2016 water temperature is an essential condition for phytoplankton photosynthesis and is closely related to the rate of intracellular enzyme reaction plant anabolism and respiration woolway et al 2020 zohary et al 2020 meanwhile low flow velocity prolongs the residence time of eutrophic water providing a long growth and reproduction period for phytoplankton and vice versa tian et al 2021 moreover hydrological connectivity directly affects the migration foraging and reproductive behavior of macroinvertebrates in a hydrologic and hydrodynamic manner that is through flood extent and duration inundation depth flow velocity and water temperature and reshapes the macroinvertebrate food web by indirectly changing the water environment via nutrients pollutants dissolved oxygen and water transparency gallardo et al 2008 at the same time the sediment transport and spatial temporal dynamics of habitat suitability respond to changes in inundation depth flow velocity and water temperature following a threshold behavior liu et al 2020 that is any of the relevant hydrodynamic parameters can trigger strong feedbacks in community structure biological abundance and biodiversity when its changes exceed the ecological resilience of the focal species saco et al 2020 in order to successfully integrate habitat suitability and sediment suspension behavior the assessment of hydrological connectivity should depend on the wet dry pattern e g distribution of wet and dry patches inundation depth flow velocity water temperature and so on we have developed a new connectivity assessment tool 1 0 cast1 0 that takes the threshold behaviors of key ecological indicators into account and quantifies the effective hydrological connectivity of floodplains it evaluates as well connectivity improvements provided by new potential habitat sites that may be added in the floodplain through habitat creation or restoration this study is expected to provide a novel insight into assessing hydrological connectivity in a meaningful way 2 study site a case study of poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china was conducted to evaluate the application prospects of cast1 0 poyang lake is located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river it receives inflow from five tributaries in the south and empties into yangtze river via an outlet at its northern extremity influenced by the typical subtropical monsoon climate the lake level with considerable annual variation 8 22 m shapes an extensive floodplain of more than 3000 km2 that consists of seasonally inundated wetlands sub lakes rivers and the main lake from april to may the floodplain is recharged not only by the five rivers upstream but also by the main lake downstream displaying a two way hydraulic characteristic from june to september all units in the floodplain are submerged and merge into one single water body from october to november the water body shrinks from the upland to the lowland of the floodplain displaying a one way hydraulic characteristic from december to the next march nearly all sub lakes become isolated and the water volume is dominated by precipitation evaporation and infiltration these unique hydrologic hydrodynamic characteristics provide vital habitats for waterbirds fish phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates making poyang lake one of the world s most important wetlands in recent years the expansion and shrinkage patterns of the poyang lake floodplain have experienced significant changes due to the combined effects of climate change hydraulic project construction and sand mining activities these changes have altered the original habitat suitability putting degrading wetlands at risk of environmental deterioration biomass losses and biodiversity reduction there is an urgent need to research the spatial variation in hydrological processes that result in the development of habitats and communities from the perspective of effective hydrological connectivity to provide a basis for the delineation of reservoirs and the restoration of degraded wetlands 3 methods 3 1 connectivity assessment tool the new cast1 0 software provides quantitative metrics of effective hydrological connectivity fig 2 cast1 0 was developed using matlab based on a geostatistical analysis script rewritten by trigg et al 2013 this geostatistical analysis approach quantifies the probability of connection between each pixel at a specified distance and enables characterization of spatial temporal patterns of connected objects that can be used to interpret transitions and thresholds in flow processes we recommend articles by tan et al 2019 and li et al 2019 for additional information cast1 0 contains five functional modules the ecological indicator user parameters input options output options and results preview in the first module six ecological indicators are recommended including hydrology waterbirds fish sediment suspension phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates along with the required parameter of wet dry pattern users can choose one or more hydrodynamic parameters from inundation depth flow velocity and water temperature as criteria of habitat suitability for the selected ecological indicators and set their thresholds georeferenced images tif format or points with latitude longitude information xlsx or txt format both meet the input requirement of the source type users can process interpolation projection transformation clipping and pixel resampling via the preprocessing function except for the interpolation images cast1 0 will output two types of results to the specified folder once the calculation is completed 1 the connected object connob which is defined as a cluster of valid pixels with the same attributes inundation depth flow velocity and water temperature if the attributes of a connob satisfy the requirement of a species the connob refers to a suitable habitat patches cells etc within which all pixels are considered connected there is no effective connectivity between different connobs 2 the connectivity function cf which quantifies the possibility of a surface hydrological connection between rivers or lakes and their floodplain in the horizontal direction and enables characterization of spatial and temporal patterns that can be used to interpret transitions and thresholds in flow processes the probability p expressed in the cf can be calculated by the following algorithm p n z c p r j 1 n i u j z c 1 where i u j z c is an index for determining whether the variable z u j at the position u j exceeds the threshold z c if z u j z c then i u j z c 1 or otherwise zero all positions in the computation domain are estimated from the starting position u 1 the higher the spatial entropy of the computational domain the faster the p n z c approaches zero as n increases therefore the value of the connectivity function in any given distance is the proportion of connected points in a specific direction within the distance range the last module provides separate previews of cf values going w e n s nw se and ne sw the software is available online this framework differs from traditional hydrological connectivity assessment methods which take into account only the wet dry pattern it defines effective units by integrating the flow velocity threshold of sediment suspension as well as the inundation depth flow velocity and water temperature thresholds of suitable habitats for waterbirds fish phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates for example to assess the potential distribution of phytoplankton pixels with a flow velocity of 0 0 30 m s and water temperature from 20 to 30 are considered effective defined as 1 otherwise ineffective defined as 0 recommended parameters and their thresholds can be found in the software manual the effective hydrological connectivity can then be calculated based on the binary data a habitat that is well suited to a species or community should be both abundant and well connected that is effective hydrological connectivity may be low if habitat patches are poorly connected even if their total area is large 3 2 mike 21 using mike 21 a 2d depth averaged finite volume flow model of poyang lake developed by li et al 2017 the water level velocity and temperature in waterbodies during 2015 were simulated observed daily hydrologic data on lake inflows and outlet discharge and temperature were used to provide the boundary conditions for the mike 21 the hydrometeorological input data included the daily discharge of five tributaries the water level at the hukou gage station precipitation evaporation air temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed and direction the model was validated with extensive field measurements and remote sensing data in 2015 for the modeled water levels the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ens varied from 0 95 to 0 99 the determination coefficient r2 ranged from 0 97 to 0 99 and the root mean square error rmse was less than 0 5 m indicating a close agreement with field observations the water temperatures were also predicted satisfactorily producing ens r2 and an rmse within the ranges of 0 92 0 96 0 94 0 99 and 1 5 1 9 respectively there is also a close agreement between the modeled and observed velocity with a relatively low discrepancy 0 20 m s at a shallow water depth 2 m below the surface of the lake li et al 2018 detailed information on the model setup calibration and validation can be found in li et al 2017 4 results 4 1 threshold effect according to the main flow direction of poyang lake an n s connectivity analysis was conducted using 8 way connectivity 8d which allows cells connected by an edge and corner vertex the connob spatial distribution and cf curves are illustrated in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 a the threshold of inundation depth had a greater impact during the dry period on hydrological connectivity than it did during the flood period during the dry period large areas of the southern sub lakes and eastern bays disconnected from the main lake when the depth threshold

not apply to aquatic organisms such as fish phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates that inhabit the water bodies of the floodplain while distance is not a limitation for long distance migratory waterbirds in addition potential habitat distribution is an important output of these tools ultimately whether the predicted habitat belongs to structural functional or effective connectivity depends on the evaluation basis and quality of nodes input to the tool with the advancement of computer technology physics based models such as phabsim waddle 2001 mesohabsim parasiewicz 2001 river2d steffler and blackburn 2002 and casimir benjankar et al 2011 can also simulate the eco hydrological process of floodplains and riverine systems unfortunately it usually focuses on a specific species and requires professional modeling knowledge and a large number of field observations and is very difficult to realize in ungauged remote regions in summary the cast1 0 has the following advantages 1 the whole process from data reading to pre processing to geostatistical analysis and finally to the preview of results can be realized with only one button without the need for complex parameter adjustment and professional programming foundation 2 realize effective hydrological connectivity and potential habitat assessment in one tool because the hydrological connectivity status is an important reference for the evaluation of the habitat quality of aquatic organisms 3 it couples key hydrodynamic parameters as the basis for the assessment of effective hydrological connectivity habitat suitability different from tools that only take the wet dry pattern into account the most significant disadvantage of this tool is that our analysis does not investigate fundamental niches and all thresholds of these key hydrodynamic parameters come from literature research although we try to select the results of studies in our study site and similar water systems when conducting literature research we also consider the habitat suitability of different species not genera such as waterbirds and different attributes of ecological indicators such as sediment particle size there is still no guarantee that the assessment has complete universality therefore cast1 0 provides a methodological framework for effective hydrological connectivity assessment considering habitat suitability of focal species which ecological indicators should be selected and how to determine the thresholds of these indicators relies on the criteria and responsibility of the user although there are deficiencies cast1 0 still has great practical value and wide application prospects 1 as potential habitats connobs are crucial for the biodiversity conservation provide a valuable reference for decision makers to delimit reservoirs and develop specific protection strategies for different species 2 the cf clustering feature can indicate the water level threshold at which the overall connectivity may undergo abrupt changes providing a scientific basis for hydrological regulation with the goal of optimizing effective hydrological connectivity 3 it is possible to evaluate the possibility of material energy and information exchanges between important geographic units and recognize the potential connected paths by calculating the connection frequency between key pixels and other pixels modifying the attributes of these paths is conducive to maintaining biodiversity and improving water quality water quality is an important indicator for evaluating ecosystem health and it is often affected by flow velocity normally the greater the flow velocity the more conducive to the diffusion and elimination of pollutants and the better the water quality but for poyang lake the flow velocity is greatest in the dry season and the water quality is often poor due to the low water volume and environmental capacity in addition the impact of basin pollution on water quality is usually greater than the impact of hydrological connectivity therefore this study did not take water quality as a typical ecological indicator for evaluating effective hydrological connectivity in the future improvement of cast we will try to couple the relationship between water quality and other parameters such as water environmental capacity vegetation type and sediment nutrient considering the variations in different hydrological periods and regions 5 2 interpretation of the case study inundation depth flow velocity and water temperature are key hydrodynamic parameters that affect the quality of aquatic habitats as well as important indicators for effective hydrological connectivity this study quantified their thresholds for poyang lake s typical ecological factors through literature research and analyzed the temporal and spatial dynamics of connob based on these thresholds these connobs provide potential habitats for ecological indicators the fragmentation of connobs indicates that the connectivity between habitats is blocked and the material transport energy flow and biological migration between patches are restricted which is detrimental to the survival and reproduction of species or populations at the same time the fragmentation of the habitat will also increase the boundary of the patch and produce physical edge effects campomizzi et al 2013 the edge of the habitat patch will show different ecological characteristics from the center thus changing the spatial distribution of the biological community for example different species of waterbirds such as the little egret gray heron and oriental white stork have strict minimum area requirements before they will breed when the habitat patch area is smaller than that minimum it is unsuitable for these species reproduction and they will not live in the patch jones et al 2013 in this paper the assessment of effective hydrological connectivity based on key hydrodynamic parameter thresholds provides an important basis for wetland biodiversity conservation however these thresholds are limited to specific types of water bodies and specific species and cannot be directly adopted without distinction for example the suitable inundation depths for different species of fish or the same fish with different body lengths are not the same du et al 2010 in addition fish spawning hatching of fish eggs fattening of juvenile fish and migration of adults require different flow velocities and water temperatures dadras et al 2017 ecological indicators have certain adaptability and survival strategies to respond to environmental changes for different types of water bodies such as rivers lakes and oceans the environmental factors that stimulate inhibit the occurrence and development of ecological indicators differ as do their thresholds therefore inundation depth flow velocity and water temperature are not the only parameters for affecting habitat quality and evaluating effective hydrological connectivity this study provides a new perspective for assessing the hydrological connectivity and predicting potential habitats in poyang lake it is expected that this framework can be promoted to other floodplains by combining more sensitive environmental elements and thresholds of local ecological indicators in poyang lake we found that fish habitats and phytoplankton habitats have a large overlapping area during the flood event in july fig 6 there is also a large overlap between phytoplankton habitats and macroinvertebrate habitats in the flood and recession period october however the results of this study cannot completely support these common sense conclusions for example it is difficult to find the predator prey relationship between waterbirds and fish phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates from the overlapping pattern of habitats during the dry period january that s because winter s low temperatures inhibit the distribution of phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates the potential fish habitat predicted in this study is mainly for fish with a body length of more than 20 cm which generally cannot be preyed upon by waterbirds on the other hand in addition to the hydrodynamic parameters an assessment of the equality of waterbird habitats must consider the distance from human disturbance the timing and rate of water level recession and the availability of food sources 6 conclusions this study developed an assessment tool for effective hydrological connectivity that has been successfully used on poyang lake it provides a new perspective for biodiversity conservation and habitat restoration in this region and is expected to be applied to similar floodplains the main conclusions include 1 the response of hydrological connectivity to inundation depth flow velocity and water temperature follows a dynamic threshold effect 2 the evaluation of connected objects based on specific niche provides a valuable metric for recognizing potential habitat patches and links 3 the spatial relationship among habitats for different ecological indicators shows evident seasonal variations declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no financial
