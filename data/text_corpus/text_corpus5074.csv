25370,this study develops a model to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of stream algae on a basin scale by integrating an existing periphyton model into a distributed hydrothermal model to calculate the daily periphyton biomass throughout the natori river basin the influence of inorganic phosphorus on periphyton growth is incorporated into the periphyton model the inorganic phosphorus concentration is simulated using the distributed pollute model depending on land use data to determine the phosphorus load the model had a root mean square error rmse 14 1mg m2 for periphyton biomass in the entire basin this model shows that periphyton biomass tends to increase in the summer season with high water temperature and to decrease in the spring season with high discharge this model can be applied to understand large spatial and temporal areas of the environment in a temperate catchment keywords hydrothermal model runoff phosphorus attached algae natori river basin 1 introduction stocking and overfishing are known causes of biodiversity loss in freshwater ecosystems through extinction of the regional population or hybridization naylor et al 2000 to reduce the negative impacts it is necessary to understand the potential biomass in the river and to determine an appropriate level of stocking additionally because river organisms determine their habitat distribution depending on local environmental factors to estimate the biomass or biological density in a river it is necessary to quantify the relationship between river organisms and environmental factors for this purpose the two following studies are given as examples first huet 1954 showed an association between the flow rate and fish fauna second arai et al 2015 demonstrated the variation of benthic invertebrates in headwaters associated with water temperature variation it is especially significant to estimate the biomass of periphyton which are a primary producer in stream ecosystems to estimate the macroinvertebrates and fishes located at the upper trophic levels of the ecosystem pyramid mark et al 1998 there have been many attempts to estimate the temporal periphyton and phytoplankton biomass based on physicochemical processes e g photosynthesis assimilation detachment in a given stream reach for example biggs and close 1989 also showed the model of periphyton biomass dynamics with velocity and nutrient in time series and concluded the importance of the flow history chapra et al 2014 used a simple model expressing the impact of nutrient for periphyton biomass well to evaluate the features of periphyton growth at survey points in the midstream of the yahagi river in japan toda et al 2007 developed a model to estimate the periphyton biomass in consideration of the carrying capacity at those points matsunashi et al 2012 developed a similar model using the nutrient concentrations suspended substance ss and dissolved organic carbon doc and applied this model to urban rivers and mountain stream rivers most previous studies have only focused on exploration at a smaller scale such as the reach scale since the availability of factors conventionally used to estimate periphyton dynamics e g discharge and nutrients is limited in space and time within a river network resulting in limited predictions of periphyton as well observed values of various influencing factors were used in most of the previous studies to simulate periphyton biomass in streams horner et al 1983 saravia et al 1998 in few studies lumped or empirical models were used to simulate nutrient concentrations to predict dynamics of periphyton toda et al 2007 matsunashi et al 2012 chapra et al 2014 however the distribution of the factors that influence periphyton biomass in streams such as stream discharge water temperature nutrient concentrations and others in space and time depend on spatial and temporal variation of rainfall temperature and various physical properties of catchment therefore a better simulation for prediction of periphyton dynamics in stream can be done coupling a nutrient simulation model with a distributed hydrological model here we developed a spatiotemporal distribution model of stream periphyton throughout the natori river catchment in northeastern japan using an existing dynamic periphyton model uehlinger et al 1996 and distributed hydrological model kazama et al 2007 coupled with a nutrient simulation in order to facilitates the sptiotemporal simulation of periphyton biomasses in stream due to spatiotemporal changes in climate and physical properties of catchments water velocity water temperature and nutrient concentrations are among the most important factors influencing the periphyton biomass in streams mcintire 1973 mcintire and colby 1978 horner et al 1983 we estimated the daily periphyton biomass using the inputs of discharge or the volumetric flow rate of water through a given cross sectional area water temperature and nutrient concentration computed using the hydrological model the model was calibrated by estimating parameters using the observed data of stream periphyton estimated periphyton biomasses were then compared with the observed data from different stream reaches and seasons within the catchment we finally applied these parameters to the entire river meshes on the catchment and estimated the spatiotemporal periphyton biomass on the catchment scale 2 study area and observation we studied the natori river catchment fig 1 located in miyagi prefecture northeastern japan 38 10 20 n 140 30 58 e the catchment area is 939km2 and the length of the natori river is 55 0km the water source of the river is mt kamuro which is located along the border of miyagi prefecture and yamagata prefecture the natori river merges with the various sizes of tributaries whose water source is the ou mountains and flows through sendai city to the east eventually reaching the pacific ocean in the upstream region a large quantity of snow accumulates in the winter as the mountainous area exceeds 1000m altitude midstream region is an urban area of sendai city and the downstream region is low altitude plains with prevailing paddy field the nutrients generated from residential and agricultural activities in the middle and lower reaches of the river have significant impact on periphyton biomass in the stream this nutrient term is the advantage point in a basin with different land uses such as natori river basin modeling periphyton variability is important for ecological management of the basin we observed periphyton on 8 stream reaches in the same catchment from july 2014 to july 2016 excluding the winter season we set a quadrat 5 5cm on the flat part of the cobbles to quantitatively collect the periphyton within the quadrat with a nylon brush after collection we placed the periphyton into a bottle filled with tap water without chlorine we poured neutral formalin into the bottle to maintain the periphyton longer the formalin concentration in the bottle was approximately 5 we also collected river water to analyze the nutrient concentration in our laboratory we analyzed the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp using a quaatro 2hr bltec corporation this is one of the most popular equipment for water quality analysis and is used widely in japanese agencies the periphyton biomass was estimated by analyzing chlorophyll a using the acetone extraction method with a spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu corporation the acetone extraction method is a fundamental method fluorescence spectrophotometer is often used to know the periphyton biomass roughly but the main purpose is to separate diatoms green algae and blue green algae to evaluate the amount the acetone extraction is common we calculated the chlorophyll a biomass using the formula developed by jeffrey and humphrey 1975 the inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were observed at 8 survey points in the natori river basin from july 2014 to july 2016 fig 2 shows the observation results the periphyton in the river take in inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus at a rate of 17 1 hillebrand and sommer 1999 phosphorus was the limiting factor of periphyton growth at 67 observation times which was more than half of the total 110 observations in fig 2 therefore phosphorus can be considered the limiting factor in the natori river basin and we estimated the periphyton biomass using the inorganic phosphorus concentration however nitrogen was the limiting factor of periphyton growth at station st 1 st 4 st 6 and st 8 in fig 2 the cause for the nitrogen limiting at st 1 and st 4 which are located in the mountains depends on the geological features unique to the mountains in the natori river basin as an example there are nitrogen limiting points in the mountains of the naruse river basin which is located in the same prefecture as the natori river nakamura et al 2010 moreover the causes of nitrogen limitation at st 6 and st 8 are due to fish cultures near st 6 and the large hot spring city near st 8 respectively 3 models the methodology adopted in the present study is shown by the conceptual diagram of fig 3 the distributed hydrological model dynamic periphyton and distributed nutrient runoff model were integrated in this study to estimate periphyton biomasses in stream due to changes in climate and physical properties of catchment detail of the methods used in the present study are given in following sections 3 1 distributed hydrological model the current velocity water depth and water temperature were calculated using the distributed hydrological model kazama et al 2007 the model was developed considering the physical properties of the study catchment and its accuracy in the study catchment was verified in number of previous studies kazama et al 2007 meteorological data from three stations sendai zao and nikkawa were used as inputs to the models including air temperature and precipitation these data could be obtained from the automated meteorological data acquisition system amedas established by the japan meteorological agency rainfall and temperature are the most important parameters that define not only the surface runoff and stream flow but also water temperature and nutrient concentration in stream therefore the spatial distribution of rainfall and temperature over the catchment was used for simulation of those parameters the spatial distributions of air temperature and precipitation were calculated using inverse distance weighting idw interpolation method the idw predicts a value for any unmeasured location by using the measured values surrounding the prediction location with an assumption that the measured values closest to the prediction location have more influence on the predicted value than those farther away therefore it gives greater weights to points closest to the prediction location in the present study air temperature and precipitation at unmeasured location were estimated from at least three stations surrounding the location the distributed hydrological model was separated into the slope and river parts for the slope part the water flow consisted of direct flow base flow and snow accumulation melt which were calculated using the kinematic wave method the storage function method and the degree day method the kinematic wave method is more efficient in simulation of runoff in hill slopes jirayoot et al 1992 the degree day snowmelt model is the simplest but very reliable in prediction of snowmelt from only temperature data hock 2003 while the storage function approach can simulate base flow reliably only using the hydraulic stages of stream and aquifer harada et al 2000 these methods have been widely used in most of the operational runoff models for their parsimoniousness and accuracy in prediction wmo 1986 for the river part the dynamic wave method was used considering the large fluctuation of stream flow the velocity water depth and water temperature were calculated with high precision we calculated these environmental data in observation period in our study 3 2 dynamic periphyton model we adopted a modified version of the dynamic periphyton model developed by uehlinger et al 1996 for a mountain stream located in switzerland described as follows 1 d x d t μ m a x x 1 1 k x i n v x i i k i exp β t t 0 n n k n c d e t q x x 0 k f l o o d x x 0 where x is the periphyton biomass mg m2 and t is time days therefore dx dt is the daily increase or decrease in periphyton biomass the modified version considers a nutrient effect n n kn which can express growth of the periphyton biomass by nutrient in a large basin with different land uses the modified version of the uehlinger s equation was adopted in this study as it was able to model the effect different land used on nutrient concentration in the natori river four pieces of data are input in uehlinger s equation daily mean discharge q nutrient concentration n daily mean water temperature t computed using the hydrological model and daily integrated light intensity i which was calculated using the equation of the proportional relationship between the hours of sunlight and light intensity koga 1990 using this equation we calculated the temporal periphyton biomass at each river mesh in the studied catchment the coefficients kx inv m2 mg ki e m2 β 1 c kn mg m3 cdet s m3 day and kflood 1 day indicate the half saturation constant for periphyton half saturation constant for the daily integrated light intensity temperature dependence of growth half saturation constant for the nutrient concentration detachment of periphyton and catastrophic detachment of periphyton respectively in our setting the coefficient kflood is effective when the discharge exceeds the top 5 of annual discharge otherwise kflood is 0 the maximum specific growth rate μ max and reference temperature t0 are set to 1 day and 20 c the same values as in uehlinger et al 1996 the reference periphyton biomass x0 indicates the minimum biomass we set x0 as 0 6mg m2 which was the minimum biomass based on the periphyton biomass observed at st 2 in october 16 2014 in october 14 2014 flooding occurred in the natori river catchment because of a typhoon the daily discharge calculated using the hydrological model on the date at st 2 was the largest during 2014 suggesting that the setting of the minimum value of periphyton biomass is reasonable 3 3 distributed nutrient runoff model the distributed nutrient runoff model describes the nutrient concentration in the stream using a one dimensional advection diffusion equation 2 a n t v a n x x a d n x l i n where a is the cross sectional area of the stream m2 n is the nutrient concentration mg m3 v is the current velocity m s d is the diffusion coefficient m2 s and lin is the nutrient load per unit river length and unit time mg m s the diffusion coefficient is estimated by the following equation tamagawa et al 1999 3 d h v 2 92 10 3 b h 2 62 where h v and b are water depth velocity and channel width respectively in the hillslope section the nutrient concentration was simulated using the one dimensional advection equation if the mesh of interest included the stream nutrients in this grid flow into the stream otherwise nutrients flow on the surface most of the nutrients on the hillslope section eventually flow into the stream while a portion of the total nutrients infiltrates and flows as groundwater the nutrient base flow eventually reaches the stream as input to the model we used non point source loads from the selected land uses paddy field upland land forest and urban with their basic units of nutrient pollution loading with reference to iseri et al 2013 and the point source loads from the three waste water treatment plants with reference to japanese sewerage statistics 2014 and akiu hot spring iseri et al 2013 had many detailed data of unit load for different land uses the unit load is not depending on different temporal condition the land use profile in the natori river basin has also not changed therefore unit pollution load values derived by iseri et al 2013 was used the load of akiu hot spring was determined by calibration it is assumed that phosphorus accumulates during no rainfall conditions and flows into the next mesh we built the deposition and sweep flow model with reference to hijioka and furumai 2001 and nohara et al 2003 4 d s d t a b s l 5 l k s q q c q q c 0 q q c where s is the load accumulation amount mg mesh a is the load accumulation rate mg mesh hour b is the damping coefficient 1 h l is the emission amount mg mesh hour k is the flow rate 1 mm q is rainfall mm hour qc is the reference rainfall mm hour b k and qc were set to 0 12 h 0 054 mm and 1 5mm as in nohara et al 2003 the load accumulation rate of the urban and forest area was set to 22 5mg mesh hour and that of the paddy field and upland land was set 58 5mg mesh hour with reference to iseri et al 2013 a portion of the nutrients infiltrate and flow as groundwater and a portion of the nutrients is absorbed into the soil the nutrients absorbed into the soil is decreased by desorption to dissolved load or decomposition by organisms the advection model in groundwater considering these processes was used here iseri et al 2013 6 l o u t c r p a 7 a d c p h d t l i n l o u t k c p h r s c s c 0 s c 0 s c h max a 8 a d s c h max d t k c p h r s c s c 0 s c 0 s c h max a k d s c h max a where lin is the nutrient load from the upstream mesh mg day lout is the nutrient load in the downstream mesh mg mesh cp is the phosphorus concentration mg m3 sc is the accumulated load in the soil mg m3 h is the water depth m h max is the maximum water depth m r is the outflow height m and a is the area of the mesh m2 the adsorption desorption speed k the damping coefficient of accumulation in the soil k d the adsorption equilibrium constant r and the adsorption saturation amount sc0 were set to 1 day 0 1 day 0 002 and 7500mg m3 as in the iseri et al 2013 all model parameters are indicated in table 1 4 results 4 1 dynamic nutrient model it is necessary to set the initial value of inorganic phosphorus in the distributed nutrient runoff model the initial value in july 2014 was set as 0 0068mg l which was the average observed inorganic phosphorus concentration of all survey points we confirmed that there was no influence on the calculated value if the initial values were varied within the range of the observed value the spatiotemporal inorganic phosphorus was estimated in the natori river basin from july 2014 to july 2016 the accuracy of the model was verified based on the observed values at the survey points the rmse of the simulation results was 0 0061mg l in fig 4 the inorganic phosphorus in the downstream was estimated to be higher than that in the upstream in fig 4 this tendency is similar to the actual inorganic phosphorus distribution however the observed value of inorganic phosphorus is underestimated when the limiting factor is nitrogen as shown in fig 5 this indicates a small error in model simulation 4 2 dynamic periphyton model the spatiotemporal distribution of stream periphyton was estimated in the natori river basin using the dynamic periphyton model coupled with nutrient simulation fig 6 six parameters of the dynamic periphyton model were adopted in the case of the combination with the smallest rmse of the simulation result excluding st 6 kx 0 6m2 mg ki 1 0e m2 β 0 1 c kn 6 0 10 5 mg m3 cdet 0 001s m3 day 0 4 day the rmse of the periphyton analysis using these parameters was 15 14mg m2 figs 7 14 show the analysis periphyton result at each survey point during the analysis 4 3 spatial periphyton estimation we calculated average periphyton biomass during the analysis period fig 15 shows the average periphyton biomass per unit area m2 during the analysis period according to fig 15 the periphyton biomass per unit area was estimated to be relatively high in the downstream where inorganic phosphorous was increase to the downstream through the urban areas in the catchment the observed periphyton biomass is also relatively high in the downstream region therefore the spatial periphyton estimation showed good accuracy fig 16 shows the average periphyton biomass per mesh 250 250m during the analysis period the total biomass per mesh is defined as the value multiplied by biomass per unit area to river width and mesh length because the value multiplied by the mesh length to river width expresses the projected area of sunlight on the river surface 4 4 total periphyton estimation in the entire basin fig 17 shows the total estimated periphyton biomass in the entire river basin the highest total monthly average periphyton biomass in the entire basin was 65 0kg and the lowest monthly average periphyton biomass was 22 5kg as shown in fig 17 the biomass in the summer with high water temperature was more abundant than the biomass in other seasons the biomass in the winter with low river discharge was relatively high 5 discussion the rmse value of the simulation of dynamic nutrient model in this study was 0 0061mg l in previous studies estimating the nutrient concentration in an entire river basin e g the tsurumi river in tokyo japan nohara et al 2003 and the zuibaiji river in western japan iseri et al 2013 the rmse was approximately 0 1mg l therefore the accuracy of this nutrient model is generally satisfactory although the study basin is different from our study the model underestimated the observed value at st 1 st 4 and st 7 fig 4 however the limiting factor for periphyton growth at st 1 st 4 and st 7 is mainly nitrogen fig 2 the calculated periphyton biomass is higher when the calculated phosphorus concentration is higher under the same conditions with other input data such as the river discharge and temperature if the distributed nutrient runoff model accurately estimates the inorganic phosphorus concentration at the survey points where inorganic phosphorus is excessive in terms of periphyton growth such as st 1 st 4 and st 7 there is a possibility that the calculated periphyton biomass is overestimated the results indicate that there is a small error in model simulations when the limiting factor is nitrogen the simulation results figs 7 14 of the dynamic periphyton model revealed that the calculated values were close to the observed values less than 30mg m2 a total of 60 out of the 111 observation data under 30mg m2 are located in the range of the standard deviation of the calculated value this is due to the estimation of the parameters in the dynamic periphyton model which meets the low periphyton biomass because the plots under 30mg m2 observed biomass represent approximately 80 of all observation data for example the analysis results at st 2 and st 3 were less than 30mg m2 during the analysis period while the observed biomass was greater than 30mg m2 and was not accurately estimated in november 2014 or september 2015 at st 2 and november 2014 or october 2015 at st 3 in figs 8 and 9 strong detachment process by flood makes some underestimating values of periphyton biomass over the 30mg m2 at all the stations especially st 5 should have more biomass with the weak flood effect as shown in fig 11 however the dynamic periphyton model expressed the periphyton growth at st 7 fig 13 between april and may 2015 when the periphyton biomass less than 10mg m2 was observed and between july and september 2015 when the periphyton biomass greater the 30mg m2 was observed the periphyton growth at st 7 was largely expressed compared with at st 2 and st 3 because the estimated inorganic phosphorus concentration at st 7 was approximately twice that at st 2 and st 3 a similar concentration of inorganic phosphorus was observed and calculated at st 7 and st 8 however the estimated average periphyton biomass during the analysis period at st 7 was 1 26 times that at st 8 st 8 is located in the downstream from the confluence of the natori river and goishi river thus the discharge at st 8 is greater than at st 7 which is located in the upstream from the confluence as shown in figs 13 and 14 therefore the estimated average periphyton biomass at st 7 is greater than at st 8 because the periphyton biomass at st 8 is more detached than that at st 7 this estimation agrees with the observations therefore this dynamic periphyton model could express the change in periphyton biomass depending on river discharge the periphyton biomass at st 1 and st 4 was accurately estimated as shown in figs 7 and 10 st 1 and st 4 are survey points where inorganic phosphorus was underestimated in the distributed nutrient runoff model the dynamic periphyton model using the distributed nutrient runoff model which underestimated the inorganic phosphorus concentration at st 1 and st 4 does not lead the underestimation of the periphyton biomass at the same survey points this is because nitrogen is the limiting factor for periphyton growth at these points as shown in fig 2 likewise the dynamic periphyton model generally and accurately expressed the periphyton biomass at st 6 where nitrogen is the limiting factor of periphyton growth as shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 12 on the other hand the periphyton biomass at st 7 where phosphorus is the limiting factor in fig 2 was somewhat underestimated as shown in fig 13 one of the reasons for the underestimation of the periphyton biomass at st 6 is the underestimation of the inorganic phosphorus concentration at that survey point there is a possibility that if the distributed nutrient runoff model more accurately expresses the inorganic phosphorus concentration at the survey points where phosphorus is the limiting factor the accuracy of the dynamic periphyton model is improved however the distributed nutrient runoff model has good accuracy at st 2 and st 3 compared with that at st 6 but the dynamic periphyton model does not expresses the periphyton biomass over the 30mg m2 at st 2 and st 3 there is also room for improvement in the periphyton growth equation of the dynamic periphyton model especially eq 1 the model simulations of the spatial distribution of periphyton in streams fig 15 show that the periphyton biomass per unit area at st 8 was estimated to be 1 8 times that at st 4 from fig 16 at st 4 located in the upstream area and st 8 located in the downstream area the periphyton biomass per mesh at st 8 was estimated to be 14 9 times that at st 4 moreover the periphyton biomass per mesh in the downstream of the natori river is 1 2 times to that in the downstream of the hirose river which means that the periphyton biomass per unit area is almost the same in the downstream of the hirose river and natori rivers the total estimated periphyton biomass in the entire river basin fig 17 showed that the total monthly average periphyton biomass in the spring was lower because of the high discharge caused by melting snow the total monthly average periphyton biomass in november 2015 was the second lowest after april 2015 because of large scale flooding the average total biomass in the entire basin during the analysis period was approximately 43kg and this biomass was 28 tons in terms of wet weight the stocking number of sweet fish was approximately 6000 in the natori river basin in 2009 and they consumed 0 12 tons of periphyton per day which is less than 1 of the total estimated periphyton biomass in the entire basin therefore there is sufficient primary production in the natori river basin 959km2 to support sweet fish in the stream ecosystem 6 conclusions a spatiotemporal periphyton model using the distributed hydrological model and distributed nutrient runoff model was developed for the natori river basin in northeastern japan this study obtained the following conclusions 1 the distributed nutrient runoff model was based on the land use of the natori river basin the rmse of the simulation result was 0 0061mg l the accuracy of this nutrient model is generally satisfactory compared with previous studies the estimated distribution of inorganic phosphorus was similar to the actual inorganic phosphorus distribution 2 the six parameters in the dynamic periphyton model were estimated using the observed biomass in the natori river basin the rmse of the simulation was 15 14mg m2 the periphyton model expressed observed periphyton biomass of less than 30mg m2 with good accuracy but underestimated observed biomass of more than 30mg m2 the challenge for the future is to express in more detail the process of rapid growth from low initial biomass 3 in the upstream region the periphyton biomass per unit area was estimated to be relatively low and in the downstream region it was estimated to be relatively high this tendency is similar to the distribution of the observed periphyton biomass therefore the spatial periphyton estimation showed good accuracy the periphyton biomass per unit mesh in the downstream of the natori river was 1 2 times to that in the downstream of the hirose river it means that periphyton biomass per unit area was similar in the downstream of the hirose river and natori river 4 the proposed model estimated the total periphyton biomass in the entire river basin the biomass in summer with high water temperature and in winter with low river discharge was more abundant than that in other seasons the total average biomass in the natori river basin was 28 tons in terms of wet weight which is sufficient to support the ecosystem of sweet fish in the natori river basin still the model has some limitations because the model parameters are obtained from the natori river basin we can apply the model to only small basin less than 1000km2 basins in temperate zone and stable river bed however the developed model can contribute to the environmental assessment of land use change impact and can identify vulnerable areas from a temporal and spatial view point also the model can find out more important parameters by sensitivity analysis easily and can propose policy conserving the environment additionally the model can provide results for many fields such as science and engineering for application use on the other hand there are some problems with using the model at a local scale comparison with a microprocess model is needed to understand the applicability of this model to modify the model more applications to and samples from basins with different conditions are necessary respectively acknowledgements this research was partially supported by the ministry of education culture sports

into the bottle to maintain the periphyton longer the formalin concentration in the bottle was approximately 5 we also collected river water to analyze the nutrient concentration in our laboratory we analyzed the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp using a quaatro 2hr bltec corporation this is one of the most popular equipment for water quality analysis and is used widely in japanese agencies the periphyton biomass was estimated by analyzing chlorophyll a using the acetone extraction method with a spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu corporation the acetone extraction method is a fundamental method fluorescence spectrophotometer is often used to know the periphyton biomass roughly but the main purpose is to separate diatoms green algae and blue green algae to evaluate the amount the acetone extraction is common we calculated the chlorophyll a biomass using the formula developed by jeffrey and humphrey 1975 the inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were observed at 8 survey points in the natori river basin from july 2014 to july 2016 fig 2 shows the observation results the periphyton in the river take in inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus at a rate of 17 1 hillebrand and sommer 1999 phosphorus was the limiting factor of periphyton growth at 67 observation times which was more than half of the total 110 observations in fig 2 therefore phosphorus can be considered the limiting factor in the natori river basin and we estimated the periphyton biomass using the inorganic phosphorus concentration however nitrogen was the limiting factor of periphyton growth at station st 1 st 4 st 6 and st 8 in fig 2 the cause for the nitrogen limiting at st 1 and st 4 which are located in the mountains depends on the geological features unique to the mountains in the natori river basin as an example there are nitrogen limiting points in the mountains of the naruse river basin which is located in the same prefecture as the natori river nakamura et al 2010 moreover the causes of nitrogen limitation at st 6 and st 8 are due to fish cultures near st 6 and the large hot spring city near st 8 respectively 3 models the methodology adopted in the present study is shown by the conceptual diagram of fig 3 the distributed hydrological model dynamic periphyton and distributed nutrient runoff model were integrated in this study to estimate periphyton biomasses in stream due to changes in climate and physical properties of catchment detail of the methods used in the present study are given in following sections 3 1 distributed hydrological model the current velocity water depth and water temperature were calculated using the distributed hydrological model kazama et al 2007 the model was developed considering the physical properties of the study catchment and its accuracy in the study catchment was verified in number of previous studies kazama et al 2007 meteorological data from three stations sendai zao and nikkawa were used as inputs to the models including air temperature and precipitation these data could be obtained from the automated meteorological data acquisition system amedas established by the japan meteorological agency rainfall and temperature are the most important parameters that define not only the surface runoff and stream flow but also water temperature and nutrient concentration in stream therefore the spatial distribution of rainfall and temperature over the catchment was used for simulation of those parameters the spatial distributions of air temperature and precipitation were calculated using inverse distance weighting idw interpolation method the idw predicts a value for any unmeasured location by using the measured values surrounding the prediction location with an assumption that the measured values closest to the prediction location have more influence on the predicted value than those farther away therefore it gives greater weights to points closest to the prediction location in the present study air temperature and precipitation at unmeasured location were estimated from at least three stations surrounding the location the distributed hydrological model was separated into the slope and river parts for the slope part the water flow consisted of direct flow base flow and snow accumulation melt which were calculated using the kinematic wave method the storage function method and the degree day method the kinematic wave method is more efficient in simulation of runoff in hill slopes jirayoot et al 1992 the degree day snowmelt model is the simplest but very reliable in prediction of snowmelt from only temperature data hock 2003 while the storage function approach can simulate base flow reliably only using the hydraulic stages of stream and aquifer harada et al 2000 these methods have been widely used in most of the operational runoff models for their parsimoniousness and accuracy in prediction wmo 1986 for the river part the dynamic wave method was used considering the large fluctuation of stream flow the velocity water depth and water temperature were calculated with high precision we calculated these environmental data in observation period in our study 3 2 dynamic periphyton model we adopted a modified version of the dynamic periphyton model developed by uehlinger et al 1996 for a mountain stream located in switzerland described as follows 1 d x d t μ m a x x 1 1 k x i n v x i i k i exp β t t 0 n n k n c d e t q x x 0 k f l o o d x x 0 where x is the periphyton biomass mg m2 and t is time days therefore dx dt is the daily increase or decrease in periphyton biomass the modified version considers a nutrient effect n n kn which can express growth of the periphyton biomass by nutrient in a large basin with different land uses the modified version of the uehlinger s equation was adopted in this study as it was able to model the effect different land used on nutrient concentration in the natori river four pieces of data are input in uehlinger s equation daily mean discharge q nutrient concentration n daily mean water temperature t computed using the hydrological model and daily integrated light intensity i which was calculated using the equation of the proportional relationship between the hours of sunlight and light intensity koga 1990 using this equation we calculated the temporal periphyton biomass at each river mesh in the studied catchment the coefficients kx inv m2 mg ki e m2 β 1 c kn mg m3 cdet s m3 day and kflood 1 day indicate the half saturation constant for periphyton half saturation constant for the daily integrated light intensity temperature dependence of growth half saturation constant for the nutrient concentration detachment of periphyton and catastrophic detachment of periphyton respectively in our setting the coefficient kflood is effective when the discharge exceeds the top 5 of annual discharge otherwise kflood is 0 the maximum specific growth rate μ max and reference temperature t0 are set to 1 day and 20 c the same values as in uehlinger et al 1996 the reference periphyton biomass x0 indicates the minimum biomass we set x0 as 0 6mg m2 which was the minimum biomass based on the periphyton biomass observed at st 2 in october 16 2014 in october 14 2014 flooding occurred in the natori river catchment because of a typhoon the daily discharge calculated using the hydrological model on the date at st 2 was the largest during 2014 suggesting that the setting of the minimum value of periphyton biomass is reasonable 3 3 distributed nutrient runoff model the distributed nutrient runoff model describes the nutrient concentration in the stream using a one dimensional advection diffusion equation 2 a n t v a n x x a d n x l i n where a is the cross sectional area of the stream m2 n is the nutrient concentration mg m3 v is the current velocity m s d is the diffusion coefficient m2 s and lin is the nutrient load per unit river length and unit time mg m s the diffusion coefficient is estimated by the following equation tamagawa et al 1999 3 d h v 2 92 10 3 b h 2 62 where h v and b are water depth velocity and channel width respectively in the hillslope section the nutrient concentration was simulated using the one dimensional advection equation if the mesh of interest included the stream nutrients in this grid flow into the stream otherwise nutrients flow on the surface most of the nutrients on the hillslope section eventually flow into the stream while a portion of the total nutrients infiltrates and flows as groundwater the nutrient base flow eventually reaches the stream as input to the model we used non point source loads from the selected land uses paddy field upland land forest and urban with their basic units of nutrient pollution loading with reference to iseri et al 2013 and the point source loads from the three waste water treatment plants with reference to japanese sewerage statistics 2014 and akiu hot spring iseri et al 2013 had many detailed data of unit load for different land uses the unit load is not depending on different temporal condition the land use profile in the natori river basin has also not changed therefore unit pollution load values derived by iseri et al 2013 was used the load of akiu hot spring was determined by calibration it is assumed that phosphorus accumulates during no rainfall conditions and flows into the next mesh we built the deposition and sweep flow model with reference to hijioka and furumai 2001 and nohara et al 2003 4 d s d t a b s l 5 l k s q q c q q c 0 q q c where s is the load accumulation amount mg mesh a is the load accumulation rate mg mesh hour b is the damping coefficient 1 h l is the emission amount mg mesh hour k is the flow rate 1 mm q is rainfall mm hour qc is the reference rainfall mm hour b k and qc were set to 0 12 h 0 054 mm and 1 5mm as in nohara et al 2003 the load accumulation rate of the urban and forest area was set to 22 5mg mesh hour and that of the paddy field and upland land was set 58 5mg mesh hour with reference to iseri et al 2013 a portion of the nutrients infiltrate and flow as groundwater and a portion of the nutrients is absorbed into the soil the nutrients absorbed into the soil is decreased by desorption to dissolved load or decomposition by organisms the advection model in groundwater considering these processes was used here iseri et al 2013 6 l o u t c r p a 7 a d c p h d t l i n l o u t k c p h r s c s c 0 s c 0 s c h max a 8 a d s c h max d t k c p h r s c s c 0 s c 0 s c h max a k d s c h max a where lin is the nutrient load from the upstream mesh mg day lout is the nutrient load in the downstream mesh mg mesh cp is the phosphorus concentration mg m3 sc is the accumulated load in the soil mg m3 h is the water depth m h max is the maximum water depth m r is the outflow height m and a is the area of the mesh m2 the adsorption desorption speed k the damping coefficient of accumulation in the soil k d the adsorption equilibrium constant r and the adsorption saturation amount sc0 were set to 1 day 0 1 day 0 002 and 7500mg m3 as in the iseri et al 2013 all model parameters are indicated in table 1 4 results 4 1 dynamic nutrient model it is necessary to set the initial value of inorganic phosphorus in the distributed nutrient runoff model the initial value in july 2014 was set as 0 0068mg l which was the average observed inorganic phosphorus concentration of all survey points we confirmed that there was no influence on the calculated value if the initial values were varied within the range of the observed value the spatiotemporal inorganic phosphorus was estimated in the natori river basin from july 2014 to july 2016 the accuracy of the model was verified based on the observed values at the survey points the rmse of the simulation results was 0 0061mg l in fig 4 the inorganic phosphorus in the downstream was estimated to be higher than that in the upstream in fig 4 this tendency is similar to the actual inorganic phosphorus distribution however the observed value of inorganic phosphorus is underestimated when the limiting factor is nitrogen as shown in fig 5 this indicates a small error in model simulation 4 2 dynamic periphyton model the spatiotemporal distribution of stream periphyton was estimated in the natori river basin using the dynamic periphyton model coupled with nutrient simulation fig 6 six parameters of the dynamic periphyton model were adopted in the case of the combination with the smallest rmse of the simulation result excluding st 6 kx 0 6m2 mg ki 1 0e m2 β 0 1 c kn 6 0 10 5 mg m3 cdet 0 001s m3 day 0 4 day the rmse of the periphyton analysis using these parameters was 15 14mg m2 figs 7 14 show the analysis periphyton result at each survey point during the analysis 4 3 spatial periphyton estimation we calculated average periphyton biomass during the analysis period fig 15 shows the average periphyton biomass per unit area m2 during the analysis period according to fig 15 the periphyton biomass per unit area was estimated to be relatively high in the downstream where inorganic phosphorous was increase to the downstream through the urban areas in the catchment the observed periphyton biomass is also relatively high in the downstream region therefore the spatial periphyton estimation showed good accuracy fig 16 shows the average periphyton biomass per mesh 250 250m during the analysis period the total biomass per mesh is defined as the value multiplied by biomass per unit area to river width and mesh length because the value multiplied by the mesh length to river width expresses the projected area of sunlight on the river surface 4 4 total periphyton estimation in the entire basin fig 17 shows the total estimated periphyton biomass in the entire river basin the highest total monthly average periphyton biomass in the entire basin was 65 0kg and the lowest monthly average periphyton biomass was 22 5kg as shown in fig 17 the biomass in the summer with high water temperature was more abundant than the biomass in other seasons the biomass in the winter with low river discharge was relatively high 5 discussion the rmse value of the simulation of dynamic nutrient model in this study was 0 0061mg l in previous studies estimating the nutrient concentration in an entire river basin e g the tsurumi river in tokyo japan nohara et al 2003 and the zuibaiji river in western japan iseri et al 2013 the rmse was approximately 0 1mg l therefore the accuracy of this nutrient model is generally satisfactory although the study basin is different from our study the model underestimated the observed value at st 1 st 4 and st 7 fig 4 however the limiting factor for periphyton growth at st 1 st 4 and st 7 is mainly nitrogen fig 2 the calculated periphyton biomass is higher when the calculated phosphorus concentration is higher under the same conditions with other input data such as the river discharge and temperature if the distributed nutrient runoff model accurately estimates the inorganic phosphorus concentration at the survey points where inorganic phosphorus is excessive in terms of periphyton growth such as st 1 st 4 and st 7 there is a possibility that the calculated periphyton biomass is overestimated the results indicate that there is a small error in model simulations when the limiting factor is nitrogen the simulation results figs 7 14 of the dynamic periphyton model revealed that the calculated values were close to the observed values less than 30mg m2 a total of 60 out of the 111 observation data under 30mg m2 are located in the range of the standard deviation of the calculated value this is due to the estimation of the parameters in the dynamic periphyton model which meets the low periphyton biomass because the plots under 30mg m2 observed biomass represent approximately 80 of all observation data for example the analysis results at st 2 and st 3 were less than 30mg m2 during the analysis period while the observed biomass was greater than 30mg m2 and was not accurately estimated in november 2014 or september 2015 at st 2 and november 2014 or october 2015 at st 3 in figs 8 and 9 strong detachment process by flood makes some underestimating values of periphyton biomass over the 30mg m2 at all the stations especially st 5 should have more biomass with the weak flood effect as shown in fig 11 however the dynamic periphyton model expressed the periphyton growth at st 7 fig 13 between april and may 2015 when the periphyton biomass less than 10mg m2 was observed and between july and september 2015 when the periphyton biomass greater the 30mg m2 was observed the periphyton growth at st 7 was largely expressed compared with at st 2 and st 3 because the estimated inorganic phosphorus concentration at st 7 was approximately twice that at st 2 and st 3 a similar concentration of inorganic phosphorus was observed and calculated at st 7 and st 8 however the estimated average periphyton biomass during the analysis period at st 7 was 1 26 times that at st 8 st 8 is located in the downstream from the confluence of the natori river and goishi river thus the discharge at st 8 is greater than at st 7 which is located in the upstream from the confluence as shown in figs 13 and 14 therefore the estimated average periphyton biomass at st 7 is greater than at st 8 because the periphyton biomass at st 8 is more detached than that at st 7 this estimation agrees with the observations therefore this dynamic periphyton model could express the change in periphyton biomass depending on river discharge the periphyton biomass at st 1 and st 4 was accurately estimated as shown in figs 7 and 10 st 1 and st 4 are survey points where inorganic phosphorus was underestimated in the distributed nutrient runoff model the dynamic periphyton model using the distributed nutrient runoff model which underestimated the inorganic phosphorus concentration at st 1 and st 4 does not lead the underestimation of the periphyton biomass at the same survey points this is because nitrogen is the limiting factor for periphyton growth at these points as shown in fig 2 likewise the dynamic periphyton model generally and accurately expressed the periphyton biomass at st 6 where nitrogen is the limiting factor of periphyton growth as shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 12 on the other hand the periphyton biomass at st 7 where phosphorus is the limiting factor in fig 2 was somewhat underestimated as shown in fig 13 one of the reasons for the underestimation of the periphyton biomass at st 6 is the underestimation of the inorganic phosphorus concentration at that survey point there is a possibility that if the distributed nutrient runoff model more accurately expresses the inorganic phosphorus concentration at the survey points where phosphorus is the limiting factor the accuracy of the dynamic periphyton model is improved however the distributed nutrient runoff model has good accuracy at st 2 and st 3 compared with that at st 6 but the dynamic periphyton model does not expresses the periphyton biomass over the 30mg m2 at st 2 and st 3 there is also room for improvement in the periphyton growth equation of the dynamic periphyton model especially eq 1 the model simulations of the spatial distribution of periphyton in streams fig 15 show that the periphyton biomass per unit area at st 8 was estimated to be 1 8 times that at st 4 from fig 16 at st 4 located in the upstream area and st 8 located in the downstream area the periphyton biomass per mesh at st 8 was estimated to be 14 9 times that at st 4 moreover the periphyton biomass per mesh in the downstream of the natori river is 1 2 times to that in the downstream of the hirose river which means that the periphyton biomass per unit area is almost the same in the downstream of the hirose river and natori rivers the total estimated periphyton biomass in the entire river basin fig 17 showed that the total monthly average periphyton biomass in the spring was lower because of the high discharge caused by melting snow the total monthly average periphyton biomass in november 2015 was the second lowest after april 2015 because of large scale flooding the average total biomass in the entire basin during the analysis period was approximately 43kg and this biomass was 28 tons in terms of wet weight the stocking number of sweet fish was approximately 6000 in the natori river basin in 2009 and they consumed 0 12 tons of periphyton per day which is less than 1 of the total estimated periphyton biomass in the entire basin therefore there is sufficient primary production in the natori river basin 959km2 to support sweet fish in the stream ecosystem 6 conclusions a spatiotemporal periphyton model using the distributed hydrological model and distributed nutrient runoff model was developed for the natori river basin in northeastern japan this study obtained the following conclusions 1 the distributed nutrient runoff model was based on the land use of the natori river basin the rmse of the simulation result was 0 0061mg l the accuracy of this nutrient model is generally satisfactory compared with previous studies the estimated distribution of inorganic phosphorus was similar to the actual inorganic phosphorus distribution 2 the six parameters in the dynamic periphyton model were estimated using the observed biomass in the natori river basin the rmse of the simulation was 15 14mg m2 the periphyton model expressed observed periphyton biomass of less than 30mg m2 with good accuracy but underestimated observed biomass of more than 30mg m2 the challenge for the future is to express in more detail the process of rapid growth from low initial biomass 3 in the upstream region the periphyton biomass per unit area was estimated to be relatively low and in the downstream region it was estimated to be relatively high this tendency is similar to the distribution of the observed periphyton biomass therefore the spatial periphyton estimation showed good accuracy the periphyton biomass per unit mesh in the downstream of the natori river was 1 2 times to that in the downstream of the hirose river it means that periphyton biomass per unit area was similar in the downstream of the hirose river and natori river 4 the proposed model estimated the total periphyton biomass in the entire river basin the biomass in summer with high water temperature and in winter with low river discharge was more abundant than that in other seasons the total average biomass in the natori river basin was 28 tons in terms of wet weight which is sufficient to support the ecosystem of sweet fish in the natori river basin still the model has some limitations because the model parameters are obtained from the natori river basin we can apply the model to only small basin less than 1000km2 basins in temperate zone and stable river bed however the developed model can contribute to the environmental assessment of land use change impact and can identify vulnerable areas from a temporal and spatial view point also the model can find out more important parameters by sensitivity analysis easily and can propose policy conserving the environment additionally the model can provide results for many fields such as science and engineering for application use on the other hand there are some problems with using the model at a local scale comparison with a microprocess model is needed to understand the applicability of this model to modify the model more applications to and samples from basins with different conditions are necessary respectively acknowledgements this research was partially supported by the ministry of education culture sports

25371,due to increasing habitat fragmentation and concern about its ecological effects there has been an upsurge in the use of landscape connectivity estimates in conservation planning measuring connectivity is challenging resulting in a limited understanding of the efficacy of connectivity estimation techniques and the conditions under which they perform best we evaluated the performance of four commonly used connectivity metrics euclidean distance least cost paths lcp length and cost and circuit theory s resistance distance over a variety of simulated landscapes we developed an agent based model simulating the dispersal of individuals with different behavioural traits across landscapes varying in their spatial structure the outcomes of multiple dispersal attempts were used to obtain true connectivity these true connectivity measures were then compared to estimates generated using the connectivity metrics employing the simulated landscapes as cost surfaces the four metrics differed in the strength of their correlation with true connectivity resistance distance showed the strongest correlation closely followed by lcp cost with euclidean distance having the weakest landscape structure and species behavioural attributes only weakly predicted the performance of resistance distance lcp cost and length estimates with none predicting euclidean distance s efficacy our results indicate that resistance distance and lcp cost produce the most accurate connectivity estimates although their absolute performance under different conditions is difficult to predict we emphasise the importance of testing connectivity estimates against patterns derived from independent data such as those acquired from tracking studies our findings should help to inform a more refined implementation of connectivity metrics in conservation management keywords agent based model circuit theory euclidean distance least cost modelling resistance simulated landscape 1 introduction as habitat fragmentation and land use intensification continue maintaining the ability for individuals to move among habitat patches and populations has become a major goal of many conservation plans fischer and lindenmayer 2007 accordingly measurements of landscape connectivity often play a large role in land use management schemes moilanen and hanski 2001 moilanen and nieminen 2002 landscape connectivity is a measure of the extent to which landscape structures and elements facilitate or impede movements among resources or habitat patches taylor et al 1993 tischendorf and fahrig 2000 however direct measures of landscape connectivity are difficult and costly to obtain kindlmann and burel 2008 and so most quantifications of connectivity are indirect early efforts to estimate landscape connectivity used euclidean distances between habitat patches e g green 1994 metzger and décamps 1997 however because the dispersal capabilities of organisms are affected by landscape composition and configuration and so vary across space euclidean distances often provide poor estimates of connectivity emel and storfer 2015 vuilleumier and fontanillas 2007 subsequently connectivity has been estimated using various models which are underpinned by cost surfaces cost surfaces are raster depictions of landscapes in which the difficulty for individuals of some species of interest to traverse different features in the landscape is represented by a cost value douglas 1994 etherington 2016 connectivity techniques using cost surfaces fall along a continuum of an individuals assumed familiarity with a landscape rayfield et al 2011 at one extreme is least cost path lcp modelling which calculates a single route of maximum efficiency i e lowest cost between two points assuming that an individual has complete and perfect knowledge of the composition and configuration of the landscape adriaensen et al 2003 douglas 1994 etherington 2016 at the other extreme is circuit theory which assumes individuals move randomly through landscapes of which they have no prior knowledge producing multiple pathways depicting the concentration of individuals flow between two points mcrae 2006 mcrae and beier 2007 given the proliferation of cost surface derived connectivity models a number of studies have explored the factors that influence each model s performance most of these studies examine the sensitivity of a single model rayfield et al 2010 or compare the sensitivity of multiple models koen et al 2012 to changes in cost surface configuration i e spatial structure and or composition i e cost values while such studies explain how connectivity models may react to changes in cost surfaces they do not indicate how well each model captures the true connectivity of the underlying landscape recent studies have used tracking and genetic data to quantify the ability of connectivity models to capture this true landscape connectivity mcclure et al 2016 poor et al 2012 ruiz gonzález et al 2014 sawyer et al 2011 the results of these studies have been mixed with regards to which model best represents landscape connectivity however these results highlight that the performance of connectivity models is context dependent for example mcclure et al 2016 found that lcp was the best model for predicting the movements of migrating individuals but that circuit theory was best for naïvely dispersing individuals this context dependence means that elucidating universal trends in model performance requires a large number of different contexts to be studied however due to the costs involved studies such as those mentioned above are rare and are often conducted only on a small number of species in a small number of landscapes limiting the generalisability of their results spear et al 2010 given the limited generalisability of current empirical studies we adopted a virtual ecologist approach in which we assessed the performance of multiple connectivity models and their associated metrics over a range of conditions via simulation zurell et al 2010 we developed a spatially explicit agent based model abm that represented individuals dispersing through landscapes and from this we quantified simulated true landscape connectivity we then assessed model performance by comparing each connectivity model s estimates of landscape connectivity to the simulated true connectivity using this approach we aimed to 1 determine the predictive performance of a suite of widely used connectivity estimation techniques 2 examine to what extent predictive performance was dependent on landscape structure and 3 explore how sensitive predictive performance was to organism behavioural traits by using the virtual ecologist approach to address these aims zurell et al 2010 we were able to analyse each connectivity model over a large range of conditions so producing generalisable results 2 materials and methods we used an abm to simulate true landscape connectivity values against which we evaluated the relative ability of four connectivity metrics euclidean distance least cost paths length least cost paths accumulated cost and resistance distance generated using three connectivity models euclidean distance least cost paths modelling and circuit theory to accurately represent landscape connectivity we ran our simulation over landscapes with a wide range of compositions and configurations using simulated animal movements with varying behavioural characteristics in this section we first report on our abm design section 2 1 then on the calculation of connectivity metrics section 2 2 and finally on the experimental design of our study section 2 3 2 1 agent based model design our abm used the open source programming framework netlogo v 5 1 0 wilensky 1999 in conjunction with r v 3 2 3 r core team 2015 including the rnetlogo library v 1 4 thiele et al 2012 and python v 2 7 11 languages for the development of the connectivity models and assessment of their related metrics the abm description below follows the overview design concepts and details odd protocol grimm et al 2010 in sections 2 1 1 2 1 3 we describe the surface level procedures of the model the detailed formulaic descriptions of the sub models underlying these procedures are given in section 2 1 4 2 1 1 overview 2 1 1 1 purpose the purpose of our abm was to generate true connectivity values for a landscape by virtue of the dispersal of naïve individuals from the centre of the landscape in search of habitat patches in which to settle this represents for example the movements that occur after a translocation event our abm did not nor did it attempt to perfectly emulate the observed movements of a specific taxa but rather we sought to provide a simple representation of movement dynamics through spatially heterogeneous environments dispersal between habitat patches was selected as a movement type as it can be simulated with the fewest explicit assumptions as opposed to movements such as migration that assume some degree of familiarity with a movement route additionally because single dispersal events typically occur over relatively short time periods we did not represent energetic requirements mortality was not represented in the abm because the data used to inform connectivity estimates are usually acquired from the individuals that survive a dispersal event the agents in our model may be viewed as those surviving individuals 2 1 1 2 entities state variables and scales the spatial domain of the abm was a 100 100 cell regular lattice grid each cell in the lattice was classified into a landscape type and assigned a corresponding cost value that represented the difficulty of an agent traversing the cell see landscape generation procedure as the model depicts a generic species with simplified movements that may occur over multiple scales no explicit spatial scale was defined while time steps were not defined explicitly each represented the period required for an agent to travel a distance equivalent to moving from the centre of one cell to the centre of one of its neighbours each landscape had eight habitat patches arranged concentrically around the landscape s midpoint with orthogonal patches being slightly closer to the central cell than diagonal patches fig 1 simulation trials showed that using 16 or 32 patches did not result in qualitatively different outcomes supplementary materials a uniformly spaced concentric ring of habitat patches was selected as this minimised shadowing i e habitat patches acting as barriers to habitat patches behind them which frequently occurred when habitat patches were randomly located habitat patches were circular with a diameter of 10 cells and a cost value of one the total number of agents reaching any part of each individual habitat patch was recorded the abm contained one type of mobile agent agents were initially located at the centre of the landscape facing a random direction each agent moved through the landscape until they reached one of the eight habitat patches or left the simulation landscape see move procedure model agents were characterised by two state variables which were determined prior to each run and together determined the agents movement traits directional bias and inquisitiveness directional bias determined how strongly an agent s direction of movement was auto correlated between steps empirical observations fahrig 2007 schultz and crone 2001 and theoretical studies zollner and lima 1999 suggest that dispersing animals tend to follow correlated paths decreasing the directional bias increases the influence of the cost surface on an agent s movements and so agents with low directional bias could be viewed as showing stronger habitat specialisation i e habitat specialists than those with high directional bias inquisitiveness was an integer ranging between one and eight that determined the number of neighbouring cells in the adjacent moore neighbourhood which an agent could select from during the move procedure when inquisitiveness was low the probability of selecting higher cost cells was increased as the total number of movement choices evaluated was reduced therefore encouraging agents to explore cells beyond their optimal route low inquisitiveness values simulate species that may not be behaviourally averse to exploring costly areas agents also had a memory of the previous ten cells they had traversed and this was used to limit repeated movements into the same cells agents did not interact with other agents in the model a single model realisation continued until 250 agents reached one of the eight habitat patches 2 1 1 3 process overview and scheduling at the start of each model realisation all cells were allocated cost classes representing cells with similar features e g cover type or slope and assigned corresponding cost values landscape generation procedure next 250 agents were generated in the central cell of the landscape and allowed to move move procedure once per time step until they reached a habitat patch at which time the simulated true connectivity between the central cell and the habitat patches was updated the final simulated true connectivity between the central cell and each habitat patch was recorded at the end of the simulation i e after 250 agents had successfully dispersed to a habitat patch 2 1 2 design concepts agent movements were based on probabilistic rules that determined which one of the eight neighbouring cells an agent move to at each time step agents could sense the cost values of the cells they were in as well as those of a random subset of their eight immediate neighbours with the number of cells contained in the subset being equal to the inquisitiveness value inquisitiveness altered the probability of the agent selecting non optimal cells i e locally high cost cells as the cells in the subset were selected independent of their cost value this allowed agents to explore sub optimal habitat areas which may for example allow barriers to be crossed furthermore agents stored a running list of the previous 10 cells that they had traversed see section 2 1 4 2 for a full explanation of the move procedure agents aimed to disperse in such a manner as to limit the cost of their movements given the local information they possessed stochasticity was incorporated into the model at two key stages 1 the assignment of landscape types to cells in the landscape generation procedure which determined landscape structure and 2 during the move procedure where the neighbouring cell an agent chose to move to was selected based on bernoulli trials 2 1 2 1 observation the abm produced a single true connectivity value for each of the eight habitat patches at the end of every model realisation the simulated true connectivity value of a particular habitat patch was calculated as the proportion of agents which entered that habitat patch over the sum of the agents which entered all eight patches the true connectivity values for each of the eight patches were used in all subsequent analysis to represent the true connectivity of the landscape i e each landscape contained a sample of eight connectivity values one for each habitat patch 2 1 3 initialisation the abm was initialised with 250 agents located in the centre of the landscape and facing a randomly selected direction the initial number of agents was selected based on a consistency analysis lorscheid et al 2012 see supplementary materials agents began each model run with no list of previous cells traversed this memory list was updated one cell at a time until 10 cells had been crossed additionally all agents were initialised with the same predetermined directional bias and inquisitiveness with these values differing between model realisations and being determined using latin hypercube sampling see section 2 3 1 2 1 4 sub models 2 1 4 1 landscape generation grid cells in the simulated landscape were allocated to a cluster type using the random clusters nearest neighbour neutral landscapes approach as generated by the nlmpy python package etherington et al 2014a the random clusters algorithm was based on the modified random clusters algorithm described by saura and martínez millán 2000 it generates a series of random clusters collections of cells determined to be of the same group while controlling both the proportion of the landscape in a cluster and the size of the individual clusters each cluster type was assigned a cost value representing the cost of movement through cells of that type fig 1 the composition and configuration of the landscape were determined by four parameters see table 1 for value ranges 1 maximum cost determined the highest possible cost value in a landscape with all landscapes having a minimum cost of one and intermediate values set at equal intervals depending on the number of landscape groups 2 matrix cluster size determined the maximum allowable size of an individual cluster in the inter patch matrix the area between target patches defined by fixing the proportion of cells selected to form clusters 3 number of landscape group types represented the total number of cost classes in a landscape and 4 lowest cost matrix amount defined the proportion of cells in the inter patch matrix assigned to the lowest cost class with the remainder of the landscape being equally divided among the remaining cost classes the value of the four parameters used during each model run was determined using latin hypercube sampling section 2 3 1 2 1 4 2 move our movement model was based on those described by palmer et al 2011 and bender et al 2003 these models were chosen as they reproduce realistic movement patterns fahrig 2007 while being computationally simple and solely informed by a cost surface during each time step the agents evaluated whether any of their neighbouring eight cells i e their moore neighbourhood were habitat patches if any were the agents immediately moved to the habitat patch and were deemed to have successfully dispersed if none of the neighbouring cells were habitat patches the agent selected a random subset of size equal to the agent s inquisitiveness value of its eight neighbouring cells for each cell in that subset the agent calculated the perceived cost of moving into that cell as 1 p c c d where pc is the perceived cost of the cell c is the cost value of the cell and d is the directional bias weighting following palmer et al 2011 the directional bias weighting d was the agent s directional bias parameter value raised to the power of zero in the direction of previous travel and to powers increasing from one to four as the angle of travel relative to the current heading increased from 45 to 180 fig 2 to discourage agents from repeated movements to the same cells all cells in an agent s memory list had their perceived cost value set to the maximum cost value for the landscape prior to calculation of perceived cost agents selected one of the cells in the chosen subset to move to by conducting sequential assessments using a modified version of the movement rules described by bender et al 2003 first agents tested whether the perceived cost of a given member of the subset was lower than the perceived cost of the current cell as calculated from the previous step if so the neighbouring cell was added to a list of potential movements if a neighbouring cell had a higher perceived cost than the current cell the agent tested whether the difference between the perceived costs was lower than a random deviate x drawn from a uniform probability distribution 2 x u 1 m a x i m u m c o s t v a l u e o f l a n d s c a p e if the difference was lower the neighbouring cell was added to the list of possible movements we allowed cells of higher perceived cost than the current cell to be selected both to ensure adequate dispersal across the landscape and to afford agents the chance to explore less ideal landscape types if the difference between the perceived costs was greater than the random value the neighbouring cell was rejected as a movement option if no neighbouring cells were selected the agent repeated the procedure on a new randomly selected subset of its eight neighbouring cells until at least one cell was accepted as a valid movement choice the agent then moved to the candidate cell in the subset with the lowest perceived cost agents that dispersed to the edge of the simulated landscape were removed from the simulation having left the landscape and a new agent was generated in the central cell in order to ensure equal sample sizes between model runs in order to assess the sensitivity of our model to increases in perceptual range the abm was run over 200 landscapes with a perceptual range of two cells this change had no qualitative effect on the results see supplementary materials 2 2 connectivity metrics calculation four commonly used connectivity metrics euclidean distance lcp length lcp accumulated cost and resistance distance generated from three connectivity models euclidean distance lcp modelling and circuit theory were calculated for comparison against the true connectivity produced by the abm see section 2 1 2 1 the landscapes and associated cost values created during the landscape generation procedure section 2 1 4 1 were used as input cost surfaces for each connectivity model connectivity estimates were generated between the central cell and the centre of each of the eight habitat patches for every landscape 2 2 1 euclidean distance we used pythagoras theorem to calculate the euclidean distance from the central cell to each of the habitat patches 2 2 2 least cost paths modelling lcp modelling was used to develop two metrics lcp accumulated cost and lcp length lcps were calculated using the python package networkx hagberg et al 2013 during lcp calculation the cost surface raster was converted into a regular landscape graph with the edge weights equal to the mean cost value of the two cells being connected multiplied by the distance between the cell centroids etherington 2012 dijkstra s algorithm was then applied to the graph to create a dijkstra tree dijkstra 1959 the edges of the tree identified the shortest paths to each node and had as attributes the sum of the weighted edge values associated with the shortest paths a dijkstra tree s shortest paths are equivalent to lcps etherington 2012 using these shortest paths lcp accumulated cost was calculated as the sum of the edge weights traversed between the start and finish vertices i e the sum of the cost values accumulated when travelling along the lcp lcp length was calculated as the number of cells crossed by the lcp between the central cell and a habitat patch without taking the cost value of the cells traversed into account while we chose the one dimensional lcp length and cost metrics other lcp based metrics exist that can generate continuous surfaces e g compton et al 2007 we evaluated the one dimensional metrics because they offer the most conservative single value estimates of connectivity as well as requiring the smallest amount of additional manipulation of the lcp algorithm that underpins all lcp metrics 2 2 3 circuit theory circuit theory modelling was implemented using the gdistance package v 1 9 in r van etten 2014 the cost surface raster was converted into a regular landscape graph with the nodes of the graph connected by resistors with resistance equal to the cost of moving along the edge between two nodes and the edge weights calculated in the same manner as those for the lcp models using this graph the resistance distance from the central node to each of the habitat patch nodes defined as the effective resistance between a pair of nodes when all graph edges have been replaced by analogous resistors klein and randić 1993 was calculated following mcrae 2006 2 3 simulation experiments and analysis 2 3 1 experimental design model experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance correlation between true and estimated connectivity of each connectivity metric under different landscape structures as determined by maximum cost number of landscape types lowest cost matrix amount and cluster size and the two behavioural parameters inquisitiveness and directional bias parameter values were chosen using latin hypercube sampling mckay et al 1979 with 200 points in the six dimensional parameter space evaluated table 1 to evaluate the performance of each connectivity metric over a wide range of conditions we selected a large value range for each parameter each of the 200 parameter sets was repeated 50 times so creating 10000 unique landscapes each with its own structure see supplementary materials for each simulation spearman s rank order correlation between each of the four connectivity metrics and the simulated true landscape connectivity was calculated as the abm simulated connectivity estimates in which high numerical values denoted high connectivity the reverse of the four connectivity metrics true connectivity was multiplied by negative one prior to correlation to allow for an easier interpretation of results we used cohen s d the difference between group means over the pooled standard deviation see cohen 1960 to quantify the effect size of the differences in correlations between the four metrics nakagawa and cuthill 2007 2 3 2 landscape structure statistics in order to describe the landscape level structure of the inter patch matrix of each of the simulated landscapes five landscape metrics were calculated using fragstats v 4 mcgarigal et al 2012 these landscape metrics were the five which captured the most variation in landscape structure out of an initial suite of 88 landscape metrics see supplementary materials many of the original 88 landscape metrics were strongly collinear with 72 metrics being discarded following the methods described by riitters et al 1995 and dormann et al 2013 to achieve this reduction landscape metrics containing no useful information e g unchanging values were removed and the remaining landscape metrics were then correlated with each other using spearman s rank order correlation landscape metrics were grouped together such that each member had at least a spearman s rs 0 7 to every other member the most normally distributed landscape metric from each group was then selected a principal components analysis pca was then conducted on the remaining 16 landscape metrics see supplementary materials from which five components explaining 95 of the total variance were identified and the metric with the strongest loading for each component selected see supplementary materials the five selected landscape metrics were 1 modified simpson s diversity index a measure of the number of landscape group types in a landscape 2 contagion indicating the overall clumpiness of patches in a landscape 3 perimeter area ratio distribution standard deviation representing the ratio of patch perimeter to patch area 4 circumscribing circle range a measure of the overall shape or roundness of patches in the landscape and 5 area weighted mean euclidean nearest neighbour distance measuring the isolation of landscape type patches for a full description of these metrics see mcgarigal et al 2012 2 3 3 landscape structure and agent behavioural trait analysis identifying whether any of the agents behavioural traits or the characteristics of the cost surface influenced the correlation between the connectivity metrics and the simulated true connectivity would isolate conditions under which one connectivity metric may out perform another we used boosted regression tree brt analysis elith et al 2008 as implemented in the dismo package v 1 4 in r v 3 2 3 to determine how and to what extent landscape structure and species behavioural parameters influenced the predictive performance of the four connectivity metrics the predictors used in the brt analysis were the five landscape structure metrics together with lowest cost matrix amount maximum cost number of landscape types directional bias and inquisitiveness we used a learning rate of 0 005 and a tree complexity of 5 to ensure that the brt models produced a minimum of 1000 trees brts provides a measure of the relative importance of each of the input parameters based on the number of times a parameter is selected for splitting weighted by the squared improvement to the model as a result of each split averaged over all trees elith et al 2008 friedman and meulman 2003 to generate confidence envelopes for the relative influence of each parameter 1000 brts were constructed each using 75 sub samples of the full dataset selected without replacement as per perry et al 2012 3 results 3 1 global trends our simulation analysis fig 3 shows that when pooled across all parameter values each connectivity metric was on average positively correlated with simulated connectivity the connectivity metric most strongly correlated with simulated true connectivity was resistance distance rs 0 60 0 27 mean 1 sd closely followed by lcp accumulated cost 0 54 0 31 the similarity in these metrics performance is highlighted by the small effect size cohen s d 0 22 ci 0 19 0 25 indicating a c 92 overlap between the datasets as the correlation with simulated connectivity for the two metrics declined lcp accumulated cost declined more than resistance distance the mean correlation between lcp length and simulated true connectivity 0 40 0 33 was weaker than that of lcp accumulated cost or resistance distance with these differences having a small to medium effect size for both lcp accumulated cost d 0 42 ci 0 40 0 45 and resistance distance d 0 66 ci 0 63 0 69 indicating a small but likely practically meaningful difference fig 3 while lcp length occasionally produced stronger correlations than either lcp accumulated cost or resistance distance correlations between lcp length and simulated true connectivity were usually weaker as with lcp accumulated cost the rate at which the correlation between lcp length and simulated true connectivity weakened was faster than for resistance distance euclidean distance 0 14 0 35 had the weakest mean correlation with simulated true connectivity and with a large effect size compared to even the next most poorly performing metric lcp length d 0 81 ci 0 76 0 86 euclidean distance rarely had stronger correlations with simulated true connectivity than did lcp length and lcp accumulated cost and never out performed resistance distance the performance of all four connectivity metrics varied considerably across different model parameterisations limiting confidence in any single metric s estimates for any one landscape fig 3 the magnitude of this variability followed the same rank order as correlation strength with resistance distance having the smallest variability followed by lcp accumulated cost then lcp length and finally euclidean distance 3 2 influence of landscape and behaviour the fit observed vs predicted values of the brt models indicates that the predictors only weakly explain the variation displayed by euclidean distance spearman s rs 0 06 this finding was supported with euclidean distance deviance explained by the brt model 0 02 the inability to predict this metric s performance arises simply because euclidean distance disregards both landscape structure and species behaviour and so they are not informative predictors due to the brt models low explanatory power for euclidean distance this metric was not considered further see supplementary materials the performance of lcp length deviance explained 0 17 lcp accumulated cost 0 21 and resistance distance 0 21 was better explained by the brt models figs 4 and 5 although the predictors did not fully explain the variability in the metrics performances contagion that is the overall clumpiness of patches in a landscape had the greatest relative importance for all three connectivity metrics as contagion increased the performance of all three metrics initially improved in their performance followed by a decline this trend was strongest for lcp accumulated cost and effective resistance maximum cost had a high relative importance for all three connectivity metrics with an increase in maximum cost associated with an increase in metric performance with this trend plateauing at higher costs the modified simpson s diversity index was also important for all three metrics with their performance increasing as the diversity index increased though a drop off occurred towards the higher values interestingly the two behavioural parameters directional bias and inquisitiveness had low relative importance for all three connectivity metrics directional bias had higher relative importance for lcp accumulated cost and resistance distance than lcp length again highlighting the loss of information inherent in generating the lcp length metric a final noteworthy point was the similarity in the shape of the partial dependency curves for lcp accumulated cost and resistance distance for each parameter fig 5 no significant interactions between predictors were detected 4 discussion 4 1 differences in predictive performance our assessment of four commonly used metrics of landscape connectivity zeller et al 2012 suggests that their performance is likely to be highly context dependent however it is also clear that incorporating the cost of landscape habitat types as both the lcp metrics and resistance distance do yields more accurate assessments of connectivity this outcome is congruent with previous studies bender and fahrig 2005 vuilleumier and fontanillas 2007 of course the incorporation of landscape habitat type costs into connectivity models can itself lead to uncertainty with the methods used to generate cost estimates having variable degrees of reliability especially when empirical data are scarce etherington et al 2014b stevenson holt et al 2014 of the connectivity metrics we evaluated that incorporate cost lcp length consistently performed poorly especially compared with lcp accumulated cost which uses the same algorithm this poor performance is a consequence of lcp length not adequately considering variations in underlying costs etherington and holland 2013 the two metrics that fully incorporate landscape cost values lcp accumulated cost and resistance distance on average performed best and there was only a small difference in their overall mean performance and responses to the various landscape and behavioural parameters analysed in brt models the similar predictive performance of lcp accumulated cost and resistance distance is consistent with the findings of mcrae et al 2008 the similarities between lcp accumulated cost and resistance distance suggest that the choice by researchers between the two metrics may not be critical in many circumstances at least for the production of summary metrics allowing for the use of the model that bests represents the movement ecology of the study species and the context they occur in for example resistance distance for species dispersing through unknown areas as it assumes ignorance of the underlying landscape mcclure et al 2016 the performance of all four connectivity metrics varied considerably even when landscape structure and agent behaviour remained constant fig 3 variability did decrease slightly as the performance of the connectivity metrics increased with euclidean distance having the largest variability and resistance distance the smallest such variation in performance may be exacerbated by the small empirical datasets that are typically used in assessments of landscape connectivity the variability in predictive performance suggests that none of the methods we assessed consistently capture the factors driving animal movements even when these movements are simplified as in our abm thus occasionally producing large predictive errors that may be difficult to predict a priori we suggest that whenever possible indirect estimates of landscape connectivity should be scrutinised against independently collected movement data and known behavioural patterns to evaluate the plausibility of the estimates grimm et al 2005 it is clear however that the estimates produced by connectivity metrics will always contain an inherent level of uncertainty our results corroborate etherington and holland s 2013 view that lcp length is not suitable as a landscape connectivity metric despite being underpinned by the same algorithm lcp length consistently performed more poorly than lcp accumulated cost because the lcp model integrates distance travelled and traversal costs the metric used to interpret these paths must also be based on a combination of these factors i e lcp accumulated cost while on average lcp length outperformed euclidean distance an argument can be made for the use of euclidean distance over lcp length as an initial connectivity estimate euclidean distance is computationally cheap does not require estimation of the underlying cost surface and may produce acceptable estimates for landscapes that are homogeneous 4 2 effect of landscape structure and agent behaviour landscape structure and behavioural parameters only weakly explain the performance of the connectivity metrics such low explanatory power likely arises from three main sources first the connectivity metrics excluding euclidean distance which disregards landscape and behaviour and the parameters used in the brt models are an aggregated characterisation of landscape structure and animal movement behaviour and discount the inherent stochasticity of fine grained movements this fine grained stochasticity was inherent in the agents movement rules and likely masked the explanatory signal produced by the landscape structure and behavioural parameters second and related to the previous point the connectivity metrics we examined assume that an individual s movements are determined entirely by the cost surface which is unlikely as many factors not represented by the cost surface e g heterospecific interactions also influence the movements of individuals in our abm we represent some of these effects in the stochastic nature of the movement process but in empirical studies they could be included e g as spatial representations of predator densities if adequate data were available that an increase in maximum cost which equates to increasing the influence the cost surface has on an individual s movements results in improved connectivity metric performance highlights the importance of the assumption that the cost surface alone controls movement finally the connectivity metrics we evaluated rely on edges between different landscape categories i e cells with different cost values to generate changes in the directions of their paths with the areas between edges not adding additional information to the prediction dependence on patch edges for directional information may be realistic in some cases st louis et al 2014 but it is unlikely that such dependency is universal these three factors combine to make it difficult to develop simple heuristics describing how a given connectivity metric will perform in a given landscape 4 3 limitations our abm as with all models is a simplification of reality and we did not attempt to represent all the complexities of either landscape structure or organism behaviour the movement decisions in the abm from which movement trajectories and ultimately connectivity emerge are simplified and are likely to be far more influenced by the underlying cost surface than would normally be the case this represents a best case scenario for the connectivity metrics as a result we cannot conclude that any of the connectivity metrics we evaluated will perform to similar levels in empirical studies as they did in our study nevertheless with this caveat in mind those connectivity estimators that performed poorly in our simplified virtual system are unlikely to perform better in the face of additional complexity zurell et al 2010 it is likely therefore that the qualitative trends we observed will hold for empirical studies an additional simplifying assumption was that of a perfectly correct cost surface something not achievable empirically we made this simplification in an effort to minimise any confounding factors that may have obscured the performance of the connectivity estimation techniques it is clear nevertheless that the performance of the connectivity metrics depends on the accuracy and precision with which the cost surface is calculated galpern and manseau 2013 rayfield et al 2010 future work exploring how best to parameterise cost surface representations of landscapes would be beneficial for improving understanding what levels of performance the various connectivity metrics might achieve bélisle and desrochers 2002 simpkins et al 2017 we have evaluated four of the most commonly used connectivity estimation techniques but this is not an exhaustive list of all such techniques available for example resistance kernels expand on basic lcps by integrating lcps with kernel estimators to develop estimates probability of movement for every point in a landscape see compton et al 2007 for a detailed explanation further examination of such techniques is needed to understand how well they perform compared to the metrics we have tested additionally a number of more ad hoc individual based methods for calculating connectivity have emerged e g coulon et al 2015 kramer schadt et al 2004 these individual based methods tend to be developed on a case by case basis with no method consistently adopted across multiple studies thus while some of these techniques appear promising aben et al 2014 coulon et al 2015 they are beyond the scope of our study additionally our model assumed agents were dispersing through a landscape of which they have no prior knowledge as this was the type of movement that required the least assumptions however connectivity studies often consider organisms that do have some knowledge of their surroundings such as migratory species or organisms making fine grained daily movements e g goodwin and fahrig 2002 an organism s knowledge of a landscape may influence the performance of the connectivity metrics potentially favouring lcp cost which assumes complete knowledge as individuals become more familiar with a landscape mcclure et al 2016 representation of a perceptual range by for example individuals being able to see multiple cells in each direction can increase the performance of lcp models palmer et al 2011 however representing perceptual range requires a number of assumptions to be made potentially limiting the generalisability of our findings additionally due to the strong correlation in the performance of resistance distances and lcp costs mcrae et al 2008 it is likely that any increase arising from the addition of further cognitive processes in the abm would be seen in both metrics 5 conclusion we have demonstrated that the predictive performance of four widely used connectivity metrics differs substantially with resistance distance and lcp accumulated cost generating on average the most accurate estimates however estimates from all four connectivity metrics were highly variable even under similar conditions meaning that single point estimates of connectivity must be treated with caution we suggest that indirect metric based estimates of connectivity should be assessed against independently identified movement patterns whenever possible additionally we determined that easily obtained measures of landscape structure and species behaviour only weakly account for the variation in the connectivity metrics performance therefore it is difficult to develop heuristics to predict the performance of any one connectivity estimate we hope that by identifying general trends in the predictive performance of the investigated connectivity metrics conservation managers may be better placed to understand the limitations of connectivity estimates and so develop

25371,due to increasing habitat fragmentation and concern about its ecological effects there has been an upsurge in the use of landscape connectivity estimates in conservation planning measuring connectivity is challenging resulting in a limited understanding of the efficacy of connectivity estimation techniques and the conditions under which they perform best we evaluated the performance of four commonly used connectivity metrics euclidean distance least cost paths lcp length and cost and circuit theory s resistance distance over a variety of simulated landscapes we developed an agent based model simulating the dispersal of individuals with different behavioural traits across landscapes varying in their spatial structure the outcomes of multiple dispersal attempts were used to obtain true connectivity these true connectivity measures were then compared to estimates generated using the connectivity metrics employing the simulated landscapes as cost surfaces the four metrics differed in the strength of their correlation with true connectivity resistance distance showed the strongest correlation closely followed by lcp cost with euclidean distance having the weakest landscape structure and species behavioural attributes only weakly predicted the performance of resistance distance lcp cost and length estimates with none predicting euclidean distance s efficacy our results indicate that resistance distance and lcp cost produce the most accurate connectivity estimates although their absolute performance under different conditions is difficult to predict we emphasise the importance of testing connectivity estimates against patterns derived from independent data such as those acquired from tracking studies our findings should help to inform a more refined implementation of connectivity metrics in conservation management keywords agent based model circuit theory euclidean distance least cost modelling resistance simulated landscape 1 introduction as habitat fragmentation and land use intensification continue maintaining the ability for individuals to move among habitat patches and populations has become a major goal of many conservation plans fischer and lindenmayer 2007 accordingly measurements of landscape connectivity often play a large role in land use management schemes moilanen and hanski 2001 moilanen and nieminen 2002 landscape connectivity is a measure of the extent to which landscape structures and elements facilitate or impede movements among resources or habitat patches taylor et al 1993 tischendorf and fahrig 2000 however direct measures of landscape connectivity are difficult and costly to obtain kindlmann and burel 2008 and so most quantifications of connectivity are indirect early efforts to estimate landscape connectivity used euclidean distances between habitat patches e g green 1994 metzger and décamps 1997 however because the dispersal capabilities of organisms are affected by landscape composition and configuration and so vary across space euclidean distances often provide poor estimates of connectivity emel and storfer 2015 vuilleumier and fontanillas 2007 subsequently connectivity has been estimated using various models which are underpinned by cost surfaces cost surfaces are raster depictions of landscapes in which the difficulty for individuals of some species of interest to traverse different features in the landscape is represented by a cost value douglas 1994 etherington 2016 connectivity techniques using cost surfaces fall along a continuum of an individuals assumed familiarity with a landscape rayfield et al 2011 at one extreme is least cost path lcp modelling which calculates a single route of maximum efficiency i e lowest cost between two points assuming that an individual has complete and perfect knowledge of the composition and configuration of the landscape adriaensen et al 2003 douglas 1994 etherington 2016 at the other extreme is circuit theory which assumes individuals move randomly through landscapes of which they have no prior knowledge producing multiple pathways depicting the concentration of individuals flow between two points mcrae 2006 mcrae and beier 2007 given the proliferation of cost surface derived connectivity models a number of studies have explored the factors that influence each model s performance most of these studies examine the sensitivity of a single model rayfield et al 2010 or compare the sensitivity of multiple models koen et al 2012 to changes in cost surface configuration i e spatial structure and or composition i e cost values while such studies explain how connectivity models may react to changes in cost surfaces they do not indicate how well each model captures the true connectivity of the underlying landscape recent studies have used tracking and genetic data to quantify the ability of connectivity models to capture this true landscape connectivity mcclure et al 2016 poor et al 2012 ruiz gonzález et al 2014 sawyer et al 2011 the results of these studies have been mixed with regards to which model best represents landscape connectivity however these results highlight that the performance of connectivity models is context dependent for example mcclure et al 2016 found that lcp was the best model for predicting the movements of migrating individuals but that circuit theory was best for naïvely dispersing individuals this context dependence means that elucidating universal trends in model performance requires a large number of different contexts to be studied however due to the costs involved studies such as those mentioned above are rare and are often conducted only on a small number of species in a small number of landscapes limiting the generalisability of their results spear et al 2010 given the limited generalisability of current empirical studies we adopted a virtual ecologist approach in which we assessed the performance of multiple connectivity models and their associated metrics over a range of conditions via simulation zurell et al 2010 we developed a spatially explicit agent based model abm that represented individuals dispersing through landscapes and from this we quantified simulated true landscape connectivity we then assessed model performance by comparing each connectivity model s estimates of landscape connectivity to the simulated true connectivity using this approach we aimed to 1 determine the predictive performance of a suite of widely used connectivity estimation techniques 2 examine to what extent predictive performance was dependent on landscape structure and 3 explore how sensitive predictive performance was to organism behavioural traits by using the virtual ecologist approach to address these aims zurell et al 2010 we were able to analyse each connectivity model over a large range of conditions so producing generalisable results 2 materials and methods we used an abm to simulate true landscape connectivity values against which we evaluated the relative ability of four connectivity metrics euclidean distance least cost paths length least cost paths accumulated cost and resistance distance generated using three connectivity models euclidean distance least cost paths modelling and circuit theory to accurately represent landscape connectivity we ran our simulation over landscapes with a wide range of compositions and configurations using simulated animal movements with varying behavioural characteristics in this section we first report on our abm design section 2 1 then on the calculation of connectivity metrics section 2 2 and finally on the experimental design of our study section 2 3 2 1 agent based model design our abm used the open source programming framework netlogo v 5 1 0 wilensky 1999 in conjunction with r v 3 2 3 r core team 2015 including the rnetlogo library v 1 4 thiele et al 2012 and python v 2 7 11 languages for the development of the connectivity models and assessment of their related metrics the abm description below follows the overview design concepts and details odd protocol grimm et al 2010 in sections 2 1 1 2 1 3 we describe the surface level procedures of the model the detailed formulaic descriptions of the sub models underlying these procedures are given in section 2 1 4 2 1 1 overview 2 1 1 1 purpose the purpose of our abm was to generate true connectivity values for a landscape by virtue of the dispersal of naïve individuals from the centre of the landscape in search of habitat patches in which to settle this represents for example the movements that occur after a translocation event our abm did not nor did it attempt to perfectly emulate the observed movements of a specific taxa but rather we sought to provide a simple representation of movement dynamics through spatially heterogeneous environments dispersal between habitat patches was selected as a movement type as it can be simulated with the fewest explicit assumptions as opposed to movements such as migration that assume some degree of familiarity with a movement route additionally because single dispersal events typically occur over relatively short time periods we did not represent energetic requirements mortality was not represented in the abm because the data used to inform connectivity estimates are usually acquired from the individuals that survive a dispersal event the agents in our model may be viewed as those surviving individuals 2 1 1 2 entities state variables and scales the spatial domain of the abm was a 100 100 cell regular lattice grid each cell in the lattice was classified into a landscape type and assigned a corresponding cost value that represented the difficulty of an agent traversing the cell see landscape generation procedure as the model depicts a generic species with simplified movements that may occur over multiple scales no explicit spatial scale was defined while time steps were not defined explicitly each represented the period required for an agent to travel a distance equivalent to moving from the centre of one cell to the centre of one of its neighbours each landscape had eight habitat patches arranged concentrically around the landscape s midpoint with orthogonal patches being slightly closer to the central cell than diagonal patches fig 1 simulation trials showed that using 16 or 32 patches did not result in qualitatively different outcomes supplementary materials a uniformly spaced concentric ring of habitat patches was selected as this minimised shadowing i e habitat patches acting as barriers to habitat patches behind them which frequently occurred when habitat patches were randomly located habitat patches were circular with a diameter of 10 cells and a cost value of one the total number of agents reaching any part of each individual habitat patch was recorded the abm contained one type of mobile agent agents were initially located at the centre of the landscape facing a random direction each agent moved through the landscape until they reached one of the eight habitat patches or left the simulation landscape see move procedure model agents were characterised by two state variables which were determined prior to each run and together determined the agents movement traits directional bias and inquisitiveness directional bias determined how strongly an agent s direction of movement was auto correlated between steps empirical observations fahrig 2007 schultz and crone 2001 and theoretical studies zollner and lima 1999 suggest that dispersing animals tend to follow correlated paths decreasing the directional bias increases the influence of the cost surface on an agent s movements and so agents with low directional bias could be viewed as showing stronger habitat specialisation i e habitat specialists than those with high directional bias inquisitiveness was an integer ranging between one and eight that determined the number of neighbouring cells in the adjacent moore neighbourhood which an agent could select from during the move procedure when inquisitiveness was low the probability of selecting higher cost cells was increased as the total number of movement choices evaluated was reduced therefore encouraging agents to explore cells beyond their optimal route low inquisitiveness values simulate species that may not be behaviourally averse to exploring costly areas agents also had a memory of the previous ten cells they had traversed and this was used to limit repeated movements into the same cells agents did not interact with other agents in the model a single model realisation continued until 250 agents reached one of the eight habitat patches 2 1 1 3 process overview and scheduling at the start of each model realisation all cells were allocated cost classes representing cells with similar features e g cover type or slope and assigned corresponding cost values landscape generation procedure next 250 agents were generated in the central cell of the landscape and allowed to move move procedure once per time step until they reached a habitat patch at which time the simulated true connectivity between the central cell and the habitat patches was updated the final simulated true connectivity between the central cell and each habitat patch was recorded at the end of the simulation i e after 250 agents had successfully dispersed to a habitat patch 2 1 2 design concepts agent movements were based on probabilistic rules that determined which one of the eight neighbouring cells an agent move to at each time step agents could sense the cost values of the cells they were in as well as those of a random subset of their eight immediate neighbours with the number of cells contained in the subset being equal to the inquisitiveness value inquisitiveness altered the probability of the agent selecting non optimal cells i e locally high cost cells as the cells in the subset were selected independent of their cost value this allowed agents to explore sub optimal habitat areas which may for example allow barriers to be crossed furthermore agents stored a running list of the previous 10 cells that they had traversed see section 2 1 4 2 for a full explanation of the move procedure agents aimed to disperse in such a manner as to limit the cost of their movements given the local information they possessed stochasticity was incorporated into the model at two key stages 1 the assignment of landscape types to cells in the landscape generation procedure which determined landscape structure and 2 during the move procedure where the neighbouring cell an agent chose to move to was selected based on bernoulli trials 2 1 2 1 observation the abm produced a single true connectivity value for each of the eight habitat patches at the end of every model realisation the simulated true connectivity value of a particular habitat patch was calculated as the proportion of agents which entered that habitat patch over the sum of the agents which entered all eight patches the true connectivity values for each of the eight patches were used in all subsequent analysis to represent the true connectivity of the landscape i e each landscape contained a sample of eight connectivity values one for each habitat patch 2 1 3 initialisation the abm was initialised with 250 agents located in the centre of the landscape and facing a randomly selected direction the initial number of agents was selected based on a consistency analysis lorscheid et al 2012 see supplementary materials agents began each model run with no list of previous cells traversed this memory list was updated one cell at a time until 10 cells had been crossed additionally all agents were initialised with the same predetermined directional bias and inquisitiveness with these values differing between model realisations and being determined using latin hypercube sampling see section 2 3 1 2 1 4 sub models 2 1 4 1 landscape generation grid cells in the simulated landscape were allocated to a cluster type using the random clusters nearest neighbour neutral landscapes approach as generated by the nlmpy python package etherington et al 2014a the random clusters algorithm was based on the modified random clusters algorithm described by saura and martínez millán 2000 it generates a series of random clusters collections of cells determined to be of the same group while controlling both the proportion of the landscape in a cluster and the size of the individual clusters each cluster type was assigned a cost value representing the cost of movement through cells of that type fig 1 the composition and configuration of the landscape were determined by four parameters see table 1 for value ranges 1 maximum cost determined the highest possible cost value in a landscape with all landscapes having a minimum cost of one and intermediate values set at equal intervals depending on the number of landscape groups 2 matrix cluster size determined the maximum allowable size of an individual cluster in the inter patch matrix the area between target patches defined by fixing the proportion of cells selected to form clusters 3 number of landscape group types represented the total number of cost classes in a landscape and 4 lowest cost matrix amount defined the proportion of cells in the inter patch matrix assigned to the lowest cost class with the remainder of the landscape being equally divided among the remaining cost classes the value of the four parameters used during each model run was determined using latin hypercube sampling section 2 3 1 2 1 4 2 move our movement model was based on those described by palmer et al 2011 and bender et al 2003 these models were chosen as they reproduce realistic movement patterns fahrig 2007 while being computationally simple and solely informed by a cost surface during each time step the agents evaluated whether any of their neighbouring eight cells i e their moore neighbourhood were habitat patches if any were the agents immediately moved to the habitat patch and were deemed to have successfully dispersed if none of the neighbouring cells were habitat patches the agent selected a random subset of size equal to the agent s inquisitiveness value of its eight neighbouring cells for each cell in that subset the agent calculated the perceived cost of moving into that cell as 1 p c c d where pc is the perceived cost of the cell c is the cost value of the cell and d is the directional bias weighting following palmer et al 2011 the directional bias weighting d was the agent s directional bias parameter value raised to the power of zero in the direction of previous travel and to powers increasing from one to four as the angle of travel relative to the current heading increased from 45 to 180 fig 2 to discourage agents from repeated movements to the same cells all cells in an agent s memory list had their perceived cost value set to the maximum cost value for the landscape prior to calculation of perceived cost agents selected one of the cells in the chosen subset to move to by conducting sequential assessments using a modified version of the movement rules described by bender et al 2003 first agents tested whether the perceived cost of a given member of the subset was lower than the perceived cost of the current cell as calculated from the previous step if so the neighbouring cell was added to a list of potential movements if a neighbouring cell had a higher perceived cost than the current cell the agent tested whether the difference between the perceived costs was lower than a random deviate x drawn from a uniform probability distribution 2 x u 1 m a x i m u m c o s t v a l u e o f l a n d s c a p e if the difference was lower the neighbouring cell was added to the list of possible movements we allowed cells of higher perceived cost than the current cell to be selected both to ensure adequate dispersal across the landscape and to afford agents the chance to explore less ideal landscape types if the difference between the perceived costs was greater than the random value the neighbouring cell was rejected as a movement option if no neighbouring cells were selected the agent repeated the procedure on a new randomly selected subset of its eight neighbouring cells until at least one cell was accepted as a valid movement choice the agent then moved to the candidate cell in the subset with the lowest perceived cost agents that dispersed to the edge of the simulated landscape were removed from the simulation having left the landscape and a new agent was generated in the central cell in order to ensure equal sample sizes between model runs in order to assess the sensitivity of our model to increases in perceptual range the abm was run over 200 landscapes with a perceptual range of two cells this change had no qualitative effect on the results see supplementary materials 2 2 connectivity metrics calculation four commonly used connectivity metrics euclidean distance lcp length lcp accumulated cost and resistance distance generated from three connectivity models euclidean distance lcp modelling and circuit theory were calculated for comparison against the true connectivity produced by the abm see section 2 1 2 1 the landscapes and associated cost values created during the landscape generation procedure section 2 1 4 1 were used as input cost surfaces for each connectivity model connectivity estimates were generated between the central cell and the centre of each of the eight habitat patches for every landscape 2 2 1 euclidean distance we used pythagoras theorem to calculate the euclidean distance from the central cell to each of the habitat patches 2 2 2 least cost paths modelling lcp modelling was used to develop two metrics lcp accumulated cost and lcp length lcps were calculated using the python package networkx hagberg et al 2013 during lcp calculation the cost surface raster was converted into a regular landscape graph with the edge weights equal to the mean cost value of the two cells being connected multiplied by the distance between the cell centroids etherington 2012 dijkstra s algorithm was then applied to the graph to create a dijkstra tree dijkstra 1959 the edges of the tree identified the shortest paths to each node and had as attributes the sum of the weighted edge values associated with the shortest paths a dijkstra tree s shortest paths are equivalent to lcps etherington 2012 using these shortest paths lcp accumulated cost was calculated as the sum of the edge weights traversed between the start and finish vertices i e the sum of the cost values accumulated when travelling along the lcp lcp length was calculated as the number of cells crossed by the lcp between the central cell and a habitat patch without taking the cost value of the cells traversed into account while we chose the one dimensional lcp length and cost metrics other lcp based metrics exist that can generate continuous surfaces e g compton et al 2007 we evaluated the one dimensional metrics because they offer the most conservative single value estimates of connectivity as well as requiring the smallest amount of additional manipulation of the lcp algorithm that underpins all lcp metrics 2 2 3 circuit theory circuit theory modelling was implemented using the gdistance package v 1 9 in r van etten 2014 the cost surface raster was converted into a regular landscape graph with the nodes of the graph connected by resistors with resistance equal to the cost of moving along the edge between two nodes and the edge weights calculated in the same manner as those for the lcp models using this graph the resistance distance from the central node to each of the habitat patch nodes defined as the effective resistance between a pair of nodes when all graph edges have been replaced by analogous resistors klein and randić 1993 was calculated following mcrae 2006 2 3 simulation experiments and analysis 2 3 1 experimental design model experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance correlation between true and estimated connectivity of each connectivity metric under different landscape structures as determined by maximum cost number of landscape types lowest cost matrix amount and cluster size and the two behavioural parameters inquisitiveness and directional bias parameter values were chosen using latin hypercube sampling mckay et al 1979 with 200 points in the six dimensional parameter space evaluated table 1 to evaluate the performance of each connectivity metric over a wide range of conditions we selected a large value range for each parameter each of the 200 parameter sets was repeated 50 times so creating 10000 unique landscapes each with its own structure see supplementary materials for each simulation spearman s rank order correlation between each of the four connectivity metrics and the simulated true landscape connectivity was calculated as the abm simulated connectivity estimates in which high numerical values denoted high connectivity the reverse of the four connectivity metrics true connectivity was multiplied by negative one prior to correlation to allow for an easier interpretation of results we used cohen s d the difference between group means over the pooled standard deviation see cohen 1960 to quantify the effect size of the differences in correlations between the four metrics nakagawa and cuthill 2007 2 3 2 landscape structure statistics in order to describe the landscape level structure of the inter patch matrix of each of the simulated landscapes five landscape metrics were calculated using fragstats v 4 mcgarigal et al 2012 these landscape metrics were the five which captured the most variation in landscape structure out of an initial suite of 88 landscape metrics see supplementary materials many of the original 88 landscape metrics were strongly collinear with 72 metrics being discarded following the methods described by riitters et al 1995 and dormann et al 2013 to achieve this reduction landscape metrics containing no useful information e g unchanging values were removed and the remaining landscape metrics were then correlated with each other using spearman s rank order correlation landscape metrics were grouped together such that each member had at least a spearman s rs 0 7 to every other member the most normally distributed landscape metric from each group was then selected a principal components analysis pca was then conducted on the remaining 16 landscape metrics see supplementary materials from which five components explaining 95 of the total variance were identified and the metric with the strongest loading for each component selected see supplementary materials the five selected landscape metrics were 1 modified simpson s diversity index a measure of the number of landscape group types in a landscape 2 contagion indicating the overall clumpiness of patches in a landscape 3 perimeter area ratio distribution standard deviation representing the ratio of patch perimeter to patch area 4 circumscribing circle range a measure of the overall shape or roundness of patches in the landscape and 5 area weighted mean euclidean nearest neighbour distance measuring the isolation of landscape type patches for a full description of these metrics see mcgarigal et al 2012 2 3 3 landscape structure and agent behavioural trait analysis identifying whether any of the agents behavioural traits or the characteristics of the cost surface influenced the correlation between the connectivity metrics and the simulated true connectivity would isolate conditions under which one connectivity metric may out perform another we used boosted regression tree brt analysis elith et al 2008 as implemented in the dismo package v 1 4 in r v 3 2 3 to determine how and to what extent landscape structure and species behavioural parameters influenced the predictive performance of the four connectivity metrics the predictors used in the brt analysis were the five landscape structure metrics together with lowest cost matrix amount maximum cost number of landscape types directional bias and inquisitiveness we used a learning rate of 0 005 and a tree complexity of 5 to ensure that the brt models produced a minimum of 1000 trees brts provides a measure of the relative importance of each of the input parameters based on the number of times a parameter is selected for splitting weighted by the squared improvement to the model as a result of each split averaged over all trees elith et al 2008 friedman and meulman 2003 to generate confidence envelopes for the relative influence of each parameter 1000 brts were constructed each using 75 sub samples of the full dataset selected without replacement as per perry et al 2012 3 results 3 1 global trends our simulation analysis fig 3 shows that when pooled across all parameter values each connectivity metric was on average positively correlated with simulated connectivity the connectivity metric most strongly correlated with simulated true connectivity was resistance distance rs 0 60 0 27 mean 1 sd closely followed by lcp accumulated cost 0 54 0 31 the similarity in these metrics performance is highlighted by the small effect size cohen s d 0 22 ci 0 19 0 25 indicating a c 92 overlap between the datasets as the correlation with simulated connectivity for the two metrics declined lcp accumulated cost declined more than resistance distance the mean correlation between lcp length and simulated true connectivity 0 40 0 33 was weaker than that of lcp accumulated cost or resistance distance with these differences having a small to medium effect size for both lcp accumulated cost d 0 42 ci 0 40 0 45 and resistance distance d 0 66 ci 0 63 0 69 indicating a small but likely practically meaningful difference fig 3 while lcp length occasionally produced stronger correlations than either lcp accumulated cost or resistance distance correlations between lcp length and simulated true connectivity were usually weaker as with lcp accumulated cost the rate at which the correlation between lcp length and simulated true connectivity weakened was faster than for resistance distance euclidean distance 0 14 0 35 had the weakest mean correlation with simulated true connectivity and with a large effect size compared to even the next most poorly performing metric lcp length d 0 81 ci 0 76 0 86 euclidean distance rarely had stronger correlations with simulated true connectivity than did lcp length and lcp accumulated cost and never out performed resistance distance the performance of all four connectivity metrics varied considerably across different model parameterisations limiting confidence in any single metric s estimates for any one landscape fig 3 the magnitude of this variability followed the same rank order as correlation strength with resistance distance having the smallest variability followed by lcp accumulated cost then lcp length and finally euclidean distance 3 2 influence of landscape and behaviour the fit observed vs predicted values of the brt models indicates that the predictors only weakly explain the variation displayed by euclidean distance spearman s rs 0 06 this finding was supported with euclidean distance deviance explained by the brt model 0 02 the inability to predict this metric s performance arises simply because euclidean distance disregards both landscape structure and species behaviour and so they are not informative predictors due to the brt models low explanatory power for euclidean distance this metric was not considered further see supplementary materials the performance of lcp length deviance explained 0 17 lcp accumulated cost 0 21 and resistance distance 0 21 was better explained by the brt models figs 4 and 5 although the predictors did not fully explain the variability in the metrics performances contagion that is the overall clumpiness of patches in a landscape had the greatest relative importance for all three connectivity metrics as contagion increased the performance of all three metrics initially improved in their performance followed by a decline this trend was strongest for lcp accumulated cost and effective resistance maximum cost had a high relative importance for all three connectivity metrics with an increase in maximum cost associated with an increase in metric performance with this trend plateauing at higher costs the modified simpson s diversity index was also important for all three metrics with their performance increasing as the diversity index increased though a drop off occurred towards the higher values interestingly the two behavioural parameters directional bias and inquisitiveness had low relative importance for all three connectivity metrics directional bias had higher relative importance for lcp accumulated cost and resistance distance than lcp length again highlighting the loss of information inherent in generating the lcp length metric a final noteworthy point was the similarity in the shape of the partial dependency curves for lcp accumulated cost and resistance distance for each parameter fig 5 no significant interactions between predictors were detected 4 discussion 4 1 differences in predictive performance our assessment of four commonly used metrics of landscape connectivity zeller et al 2012 suggests that their performance is likely to be highly context dependent however it is also clear that incorporating the cost of landscape habitat types as both the lcp metrics and resistance distance do yields more accurate assessments of connectivity this outcome is congruent with previous studies bender and fahrig 2005 vuilleumier and fontanillas 2007 of course the incorporation of landscape habitat type costs into connectivity models can itself lead to uncertainty with the methods used to generate cost estimates having variable degrees of reliability especially when empirical data are scarce etherington et al 2014b stevenson holt et al 2014 of the connectivity metrics we evaluated that incorporate cost lcp length consistently performed poorly especially compared with lcp accumulated cost which uses the same algorithm this poor performance is a consequence of lcp length not adequately considering variations in underlying costs etherington and holland 2013 the two metrics that fully incorporate landscape cost values lcp accumulated cost and resistance distance on average performed best and there was only a small difference in their overall mean performance and responses to the various landscape and behavioural parameters analysed in brt models the similar predictive performance of lcp accumulated cost and resistance distance is consistent with the findings of mcrae et al 2008 the similarities between lcp accumulated cost and resistance distance suggest that the choice by researchers between the two metrics may not be critical in many circumstances at least for the production of summary metrics allowing for the use of the model that bests represents the movement ecology of the study species and the context they occur in for example resistance distance for species dispersing through unknown areas as it assumes ignorance of the underlying landscape mcclure et al 2016 the performance of all four connectivity metrics varied considerably even when landscape structure and agent behaviour remained constant fig 3 variability did decrease slightly as the performance of the connectivity metrics increased with euclidean distance having the largest variability and resistance distance the smallest such variation in performance may be exacerbated by the small empirical datasets that are typically used in assessments of landscape connectivity the variability in predictive performance suggests that none of the methods we assessed consistently capture the factors driving animal movements even when these movements are simplified as in our abm thus occasionally producing large predictive errors that may be difficult to predict a priori we suggest that whenever possible indirect estimates of landscape connectivity should be scrutinised against independently collected movement data and known behavioural patterns to evaluate the plausibility of the estimates grimm et al 2005 it is clear however that the estimates produced by connectivity metrics will always contain an inherent level of uncertainty our results corroborate etherington and holland s 2013 view that lcp length is not suitable as a landscape connectivity metric despite being underpinned by the same algorithm lcp length consistently performed more poorly than lcp accumulated cost because the lcp model integrates distance travelled and traversal costs the metric used to interpret these paths must also be based on a combination of these factors i e lcp accumulated cost while on average lcp length outperformed euclidean distance an argument can be made for the use of euclidean distance over lcp length as an initial connectivity estimate euclidean distance is computationally cheap does not require estimation of the underlying cost surface and may produce acceptable estimates for landscapes that are homogeneous 4 2 effect of landscape structure and agent behaviour landscape structure and behavioural parameters only weakly explain the performance of the connectivity metrics such low explanatory power likely arises from three main sources first the connectivity metrics excluding euclidean distance which disregards landscape and behaviour and the parameters used in the brt models are an aggregated characterisation of landscape structure and animal movement behaviour and discount the inherent stochasticity of fine grained movements this fine grained stochasticity was inherent in the agents movement rules and likely masked the explanatory signal produced by the landscape structure and behavioural parameters second and related to the previous point the connectivity metrics we examined assume that an individual s movements are determined entirely by the cost surface which is unlikely as many factors not represented by the cost surface e g heterospecific interactions also influence the movements of individuals in our abm we represent some of these effects in the stochastic nature of the movement process but in empirical studies they could be included e g as spatial representations of predator densities if adequate data were available that an increase in maximum cost which equates to increasing the influence the cost surface has on an individual s movements results in improved connectivity metric performance highlights the importance of the assumption that the cost surface alone controls movement finally the connectivity metrics we evaluated rely on edges between different landscape categories i e cells with different cost values to generate changes in the directions of their paths with the areas between edges not adding additional information to the prediction dependence on patch edges for directional information may be realistic in some cases st louis et al 2014 but it is unlikely that such dependency is universal these three factors combine to make it difficult to develop simple heuristics describing how a given connectivity metric will perform in a given landscape 4 3 limitations our abm as with all models is a simplification of reality and we did not attempt to represent all the complexities of either landscape structure or organism behaviour the movement decisions in the abm from which movement trajectories and ultimately connectivity emerge are simplified and are likely to be far more influenced by the underlying cost surface than would normally be the case this represents a best case scenario for the connectivity metrics as a result we cannot conclude that any of the connectivity metrics we evaluated will perform to similar levels in empirical studies as they did in our study nevertheless with this caveat in mind those connectivity estimators that performed poorly in our simplified virtual system are unlikely to perform better in the face of additional complexity zurell et al 2010 it is likely therefore that the qualitative trends we observed will hold for empirical studies an additional simplifying assumption was that of a perfectly correct cost surface something not achievable empirically we made this simplification in an effort to minimise any confounding factors that may have obscured the performance of the connectivity estimation techniques it is clear nevertheless that the performance of the connectivity metrics depends on the accuracy and precision with which the cost surface is calculated galpern and manseau 2013 rayfield et al 2010 future work exploring how best to parameterise cost surface representations of landscapes would be beneficial for improving understanding what levels of performance the various connectivity metrics might achieve bélisle and desrochers 2002 simpkins et al 2017 we have evaluated four of the most commonly used connectivity estimation techniques but this is not an exhaustive list of all such techniques available for example resistance kernels expand on basic lcps by integrating lcps with kernel estimators to develop estimates probability of movement for every point in a landscape see compton et al 2007 for a detailed explanation further examination of such techniques is needed to understand how well they perform compared to the metrics we have tested additionally a number of more ad hoc individual based methods for calculating connectivity have emerged e g coulon et al 2015 kramer schadt et al 2004 these individual based methods tend to be developed on a case by case basis with no method consistently adopted across multiple studies thus while some of these techniques appear promising aben et al 2014 coulon et al 2015 they are beyond the scope of our study additionally our model assumed agents were dispersing through a landscape of which they have no prior knowledge as this was the type of movement that required the least assumptions however connectivity studies often consider organisms that do have some knowledge of their surroundings such as migratory species or organisms making fine grained daily movements e g goodwin and fahrig 2002 an organism s knowledge of a landscape may influence the performance of the connectivity metrics potentially favouring lcp cost which assumes complete knowledge as individuals become more familiar with a landscape mcclure et al 2016 representation of a perceptual range by for example individuals being able to see multiple cells in each direction can increase the performance of lcp models palmer et al 2011 however representing perceptual range requires a number of assumptions to be made potentially limiting the generalisability of our findings additionally due to the strong correlation in the performance of resistance distances and lcp costs mcrae et al 2008 it is likely that any increase arising from the addition of further cognitive processes in the abm would be seen in both metrics 5 conclusion we have demonstrated that the predictive performance of four widely used connectivity metrics differs substantially with resistance distance and lcp accumulated cost generating on average the most accurate estimates however estimates from all four connectivity metrics were highly variable even under similar conditions meaning that single point estimates of connectivity must be treated with caution we suggest that indirect metric based estimates of connectivity should be assessed against independently identified movement patterns whenever possible additionally we determined that easily obtained measures of landscape structure and species behaviour only weakly account for the variation in the connectivity metrics performance therefore it is difficult to develop heuristics to predict the performance of any one connectivity estimate we hope that by identifying general trends in the predictive performance of the investigated connectivity metrics conservation managers may be better placed to understand the limitations of connectivity estimates and so develop

25372,excessive water and fertilizer inputs have led to a series of environmental problems in vegetable production areas in china identifying the fates of water and nutrients is crucial to develop best management strategies in intensive vegetable production systems the objectives of this study were to i develop a scientific water and nitrogen n management tool for intensive greenhouse vegetable production in china and ii evaluate the model performance in the simulating the fate of water and n and vegetable growth under different water and n management practices in china a vegetable growth component was added to the field soil crop system model whcns soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator named whcns veg parameters for the model were estimated and a sensitivity analysis was conducted by coupling the model with the model independent parameter estimation program pest data used to test the model came from two years of cucumber and tomato experiments with various water and n combinations in shandong province china the results of sensitivity analysis showed that the soil hydraulic parameters and vegetable genetic parameters had a relatively higher sensitivity compared with those of n transformation parameters the saturated soil water content had the highest sensitivity among soil hydraulic parameters and the total available accumulated temperature crop coefficient and maximum root depth had higher sensitivity for both vegetable crops among the n transformation parameters the parameters related to nitrification had the highest sensitivity the automatic optimization algorithm performed well in adjusting soil hydraulic parameters vegetable genetic parameters and n transformation parameters the normalized root mean square error for soil water content soil nitrate concentration marketable fresh yield and vegetable n uptake were 5 7 28 0 2 7 and 8 3 respectively and indices of agreement were 0 727 0 730 0 997 and 0 832 respectively the results indicated that the whcns veg model has great potential to simulate and analyze water and n fates and vegetable growth for the intensive greenhouse vegetable production in china keyword greenhouse vegetable whcns veg model auto calibration sensitivity analysis water and nitrogen management 1 introduction greenhouse vegetable production in china developed rapidly over the last 30 years in 2014 the cultivated area of greenhouse vegetables reached 3 7 million ha and accounted for 17 6 of the total national vegetable planting area chinese ministry of agriculture 2015 compared to field crops nutrients especially nitrogen and potassium in vegetable production are more prone to leaching due to its shallow root system excessive water and fertilizer inputs is common in many greenhouse vegetable areas in china which has led to a series of environmental problems such as groundwater pollution soil acidification and salinity etc zhu et al 2005 shi et al 2009 du et al 2011 for example zhu et al 2005 surveyed the groundwater quality in greenhouse vegetable production areas in shandong province and found that the nitrate concentration of more than half of 94 local wells exceeded the who s public drinking water limit of 10mgl 1 du et al 2011 investigated the groundwater pollution in the beijing area and also found that the nitrate concentration of groundwater 13 8mgl 1 in vegetable fields was 2 8 times greater than in crop land furthermore some researchers reported that excessive n fertilizer inputs leads to groundwater pollution and also causes acidification and salinity of soils shi et al 2009 in recent years many studies aimed to achieve a balance between vegetable production yields and environment pollution for example min et al 2012 reported that nitrate leaching was reduced by 39 6 without vegetable yield loss when the traditional n fertilizer rate decreased by 40 fan et al 2014 found that the yield of tomato increased 9 and nitrate leaching was significantly reduced when water and n fertilizer inputs of drip irrigation treatments were decreased by 78 and 43 respectively compared with furrow irrigation li et al 2015a also found that the amount of ammonia volatilization decreased by 37 2 when the n application rate was reduced from the traditional 1200kgnha 1 to an optimal rate of 600kgnha 1 without reducing tomato yield these studies were based on the water and n fertilizer controlled experiments in the greenhouse which are time consuming and costly more importantly the results from the experiments are often only relevant to a specific climate condition management practice and soil type which greatly restrict their application under other conditions soil crop models have been widely used to extend point based experimental results to other locations for problems such as crop production management hansen et al 1990 greenwood 2001 water and fertilizer optimal management nendel 2009 rahn et al 2010 and environment impact assessment nolan et al 2010 etc two existing vegetable decision support models are the n expert fink and scharpf 1993 and n able models greenwood 2001 the n able model was widely adopted in europe and based on this model many vegetable models were developed such as the well n rahn et al 2001 npk model zhang et al 2007 smcr n zhang et al 2009 eu rotate n model rahn et al 2010 etc among these models the eu rotate n model is the most widely used to simulate vegetable growth under different water and n management practices nendel 2009 guo et al 2010 sun et al 2012 sun et al 2013 soto et al 2014 suárez rey et al 2016 the eu rotate n model has also been tested with various open field and greenhouse vegetables over 24 vegetables and researchers have established a complete vegetable parameter database greenwood 2001 rahn et al 2010 guo et al 2010 first introduced the eu rotate n model into china to analyze the n loss in a greenhouse and found that the n mineralization was the key process influencing n leaching but it was strongly underestimated in previously studies for the greenhouse vegetable production system sun et al 2012 2013 used this model to simulate n fate and optimize the water and n management for greenhouse cucumber and tomato and suggested that the drip irrigation with straw incorporation can effectively reduce n leaching while maintaining vegetable yield however the soil water movement and solute transport in eu rotate n model used a simple capacitance approach which greatly limits the use of this model under complex bottom boundary conditions yang et al 2009 proposed an alternative dynamic method richards equation to simulate soil water movement but this method has not been implemented in the current eu rotate n model rahn et al 2010 in addition this model could not separate the processes of denitrification and ammonia volatilization for example since the gas emission of nh3 and n2o were calculated together and output as one item of n gas to overcome the limitation of the above models liang et al 2016a developed a water and n management model soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator whcns for intensive cropping system this model was inspired by the widely validated modules and models around the world including soil water movement module from rzwqm model ahuja et al 2000 heat transfer and solute transport processes from hydrus 1d model simunek et al 2008 carbon c and n cycles routines from daisy model hansen et al 1990 and crop growth from epic model williams et al 1989 the model has been successfully applied to water and n management for the major staple crops in north china li et al 2015b liang et al 2016b however the original crop growth module of whcns was a simplification of the epic crop model which is not suitable for simulation of vegetable growth nendel et al 2009 in this study we developed a vegetable growth module for the whcns model based on eu rotate n model to improve water and n management for greenhouse vegetable production in china at the same time a model independent parameter estimation pest doherty 2004 program was coupled with the model to conduct the sensitivity analysis and parameter auto estimation for the newly coupled whcns veg model the objectives of this study were to i develop a vegetable growth module for the whcns model ii conduct a sensitivity analysis and parameter auto optimization using the model

management practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 whcns model the key processes described in whcns model include soil evaporation crop transpiration soil water movement soil temperature mineralization of fresh crop residue and soil organic n soil inorganic n immobilization in biomass nitrification ammonia volatilization denitrification and crop growth in the model the reference evapotranspiration is estimated using the grass based penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the infiltration of rainfall or irrigation is computed by a modified green ampt approach green and ampt 1911 water redistribution is simulated by the richards equation in a soil profile in which surface evaporation and plant uptake are considered as sinks simunek et al 2008 meanwhile soil heat transport simulation is directly imported from the hydrus 1d model simunek et al 2008 soil c and n cycling concepts are drawn from the daisy model hansen et al 1990 the model runs on a daily time step and is driven by inputs including weather data and crop biological parameters the model inputs include site latitude and elevation basic soil properties field management initial conditions and daily weather data a detailed model description is available in the literature liang et al 2016a 2 2 model development 2 2 1 plant dry matter accumulation the main vegetable growth processes are based on the methods proposed by greenwood 2001 and rahn et al 2010 this approach uses total dry matter yield at harvest as a target yield while this approach requires fewer input parameters which facilitates use it does require the user to provide a target yield the crop development stage was calculated by eqs 1 and 2 1 r d s i r d s i 1 δ r d s i 2 δ r d s i 0 t i t b a s e t i t b a s e t s u m t b a s e t i t c r

development c set to 20 c rahn et al 2010 tsum is total heat unit requirement from emergence or transplant to maturity c rdsi is the crop relative development stage on the day i rds 0 0 emergence or transplant rds 1 0 maturity the increment in crop dry matter each day δtdmi is calculated from eq 3 3 t d m i t d m i 1 δ t d m i 4 δ t d m i k 2 δ r d s i c f w c f n t d m i 1 k 1 t d m i 1 where tdmi is plant dry matter on the day i kgha 1 cf w and cf n are the water and n stresses factors for vegetable growth respectively as defined in section 2 2 2 k 1 is an empirical parameter set to 1 0 based on rahn et al 2010 k 2 is computed by eq 4 when cf w and cf n both set 1 then we can get eq 5 5 k 2 k 1 ln t d m max l n t d m i n i t d m max t d m i n i j d h j d p where tdmini is the initial dry matter weight at planting tdm max is the target total dry matter yield kgha 1 jdh and jdp are the julain day of planting and final harvest respectively 2 2 2 root water and n uptake the actual root water uptake ta or crop transpiration is calculated by eq 6 6 t a r d s h z d z t p r d a w h z b z d z where tp is the potential root water uptake cm rd is root length cm h is the water pressure head cm z is the spatial coordinate cm aw h z is a water stress response function feddes et al 1978 and b z is a root distribution function simunek et al 2008 the cf w was computed by the ratio of ta to tp and a compensatory absorption mechanism was introduced in the model which was proposed by simunek and hopmans 2009 as follows 7 c f w t a t p l r a w h z b z d z ω ω ω 1 ω ω c l r a w h z b z d z ω c ω ω c 1 ω ω c where ωc is a critical value of water stress index or a root adaptability factor 0 1 the approach used for the crop n uptake computation comes from greenwood 2001 which was successfully employed in the eu rotate n model and has an established complete parameter database for many types of vegetables this method assumed that there is no n stress when the crop n concentration is above critical value ncrit 8 n c r i t η a 1 η b exp 0 26 t d m where ncrit is crop critical n concentration ηa and ηb are crop specific coefficient and listed in greenwood 2001 luxury n consumption takes place when the soil n supply is greater than the crop requirement 9 n max r l u x n c r i t where n max is the maximum crop n concentration rlux is the luxury n consumption coefficient 1 the crop actual n uptake is determined by crop requirement soil n supply and rlux the cf n is defined as the ratio of the crop actual n concentration nact to ncrit 10 c f n min n a c t n c r i t 1 0 2 2 3 marketable fresh yield predication the computation of marketable fresh yield for vegetable is different from field grain yield because the economic yield for vegetable is determined by fresh weight and vegetables that are too small or too large will affect the crop value thus nendel et al 2009 presented a general method of converting total dry matter tdm to fresh marketable yield for vegetables based on a probability distribution first dry matter yield dmy is calculated from simulated tdmand harvest index hi 11 d m y t d m h i where the unit of dmy is kg ha 1 the single plant average fresh yield spafy kg plant 1 can be calculated by eq 12 and 13 12 p n 10000 p s 2 13 s p a f y d m y p n c d m where pn is the number of plants per hectare ps is plant spacing m cdm is the typical dry matter concentration of the harvested fraction this value for specific vegetables can be found in nendel et al 2009 the weight of the harvested part such as tomato cucumber etc is normally distributed and it can be described as n spafy σy 2 assuming that the weight above a lower market limit llow can be sold at market the fresh marketable can be calculated using eq 14 and 15 14 f x 1 2 π σ y exp x s p a f y 2 2 σ y 2 15 f m y p n s p a f y 1 0 l l o w f x where f x is the normal distribution function of the harvested part and fmy is fresh marketable yield kgha 1 2 3 parameter auto calibration and sensitivity analysis 2 3 1 parameter optimization algorithm for nonlinear models the pest optimizer used the modified gauss marquardt levevberg glm algorithm to estimate model input parameters the glm method is the combination of the gauss newton algorithm and the gradient descent algorithm which has the advantages of these two algorithms and gives fast convergence and global searching capability the tool has been applied successfully in parameter optimization for many hydrology models wang and brubaker 2015 and soil crop models rafique et al 2015 the details description of this algorithm is presented in marquardt 1963 and doherty 2004 the key point of the arithmetic is to minimize the objective function the objective function usually calculated by the sum of squared weighted residuals in this study the objective function φ consist of four components soil water content φw nitrate concentration φn fresh marketable yield φy and crop n uptake φu show in eq 16 16 φ φ w φ n φ y φ u i 1 p w o w i s w i ω w 2 i 1 p n o n i s n i ω n 2 i 1 p y o y i s y i ω y 2 i 1 p u o u i s u i ω l 2 where pw pn py and pu are number of measured soil water content values cm3 cm 3 soil nitrate concentration mgkg 1 fresh marketable yield kgha 1 and crop n uptake kgnha 1 respectively oi and si are measured and simulated values respectively ωw ωn ωy and ωu are weight coefficients for the four individual components respectively since there are considerable differences in magnitude for the four different components the values of ωw ωn ωy and ωu were set to 150 0 35 0 01 and 1 respectively so that they would have similar weightings φu φy φn φw on the objective function 2 3 2 sensitivity analysis most of the time consuming part of each pest optimization iteration is time devoted to the calculation of the jacobian maxtix j we set the maximum iteration number to 10 in this study during this process the model must be run at least n number of input parameters times based on the contents of j pest calculates an index related to the sensitivity of each parameter with respect to all observed values the relative composite sensitivity rcs of parameter i is defined as 17 r c s i j t q j i i 1 2 m where j is the jacobian matrix and q is a diagonal matrix whose elements are comprised of the squared observation weights m is the number of measured data with non zero weights 2 4 model evaluation four statistical indices were used to evaluate model performance the mean bias error me 18 m e i 1 n s i m i n the root mean square error rmse 19 r m s e i 1 n s i m i 2 n the normalized rmse nrmse 20 n r m s e r m s e m 100 index of agreement ia willmott 1982 21 i a 1 i 1 n s i m i 2 i 1 n s i m m i m 2 where si is the simulated value mi is the measured value n is the number of values and m is the mean of measured values the me indicates positive and negative deviations the rmse represents the mean difference between observed and predicted values while nrmse shows the relative size of the mean difference as an unbounded percentage willmott 1982 some studies have suggested that an nrmse 15 represents good agreement 15 30 moderate agreement and 30 poor agreement suárez rey et al 2016 liang et al 2016b the index of agreement 0 ia 1 is intended to be a descriptive measure and is both a relative and bounded measure willmott 1982 the closer the value of ia is to 1 the better the model performance 2 5 greenhouse experiment and data collection 2 5 1 study area the greenhouse vegetable experiments were conducted in shouguang county 36 68 37 32 n 118 53 119 17 e shandong province in north china this is a typical area for vegetable production in china which is also called the vegetable village of china the region is classified as a warm temperature continental monsoon climate with distinct seasons the annual average air temperature and precipitation are 12 7 c and 550mm respectively the soil is classified as cambisol fao unesco 1988 the main vegetable production practice is greenhouse grow the annual average temperature is 21 9 c and 21 0 c in the cucumber and tomato greenhouse respectively typically the local famers apply approximately 1000mm and 572kgnha 1 per season for cucumber production for tomato the rates of irrigation and fertilizer under farmer practice are approximately 600mm and 1000kgnha 1 per season respectively sun et al 2012 2013 2 5 2 experiment design and data collection the greenhouse cucumber experiment included two growing seasons the first season was from august 2009 to january 2010 autumn winter season aw and the second season from january to june 2010 spring summer season ss cucumber seeldings were transplanted on 28 august 2009 and 16 january 2010 respectively the final harvest dates were on 11 january 2010 and 12 june 2010 respectively four different water and n management practices were designed 1 conventional fertilizer farmers s practice fp 2 optimal fertilizer application opt 3 fp crop residues fpr 4 drip irrigation opt crop residues dor the amounts of irrigation and fertilizer application are shown in table 1 the detailed information can be found in sun et al 2012 the greenhouse tomato experiment also included two growing seasons from august 2010 to january 2011 aw season and from february to june 2011 ss season respectively the transplanting dates were 15th august 2010 and 3rd february 2011 with plant spacing of 0 6m for the seasons of aw and ss respectively tomato was harvested on the dates of january 29 2010 and june 1 2011 respectively four different water and n management practices were designed 1 furrow irrigation conventional fertilizer farmer s practice fp 2 drip irrigation optimal fertilizer opt 3 fp crop residues fpr and 4 opt crop residues dor the summary of water and fertilizer management are listed in table 1 details on experiment designs can be found elsewhere sun et al 2013 the basic physical and chemical properties were measured for the 1 20m soil profile in both greenhouses of cucumber and tomato table 2 for the cucumber experiemnt soil volumetric water content from 0 to 120cm at 20cm intervals in the soil profile were measured once about every five days or after an irrigation for tomato experiments soil volumetric water content was measured once every five days at the depths of 45 55 80 and 100cm soil nitrate concentration for both vegetables every 15days for cucumber and every 30days for tomato for soil layers of 0 30 30 60 60 90cm plant samples were also taken from each treatment on a monthly basis to determine dry matter fresh yield and its n content the detail measurement methods were described in sun et al 2012 2013 weather in greenhouse air temperature relatively humidity solar radiation and wind speed were collected using an automatic weather station ar5 yugen 3 results and discussion 3 1 model parameter estimation and parameter sensitivity analysis the measured data soil water content nitrate concentration fresh marketable yield and crop n uptake from the fp treatment for both vegetables was used to calibrate the model the data from the other three treatments were used to evaluate the model the objective function was defined based on procedures outlined in section 2 3 1 the pest optimizer requires the user to select input parameters and input the initial value of each parameter and then the model input parameters can be auto calibrated using inverse modeling as shown in table 3 the input parameters for whcns veg were classified into three groups 1 soil hydraulic parameters a total of 16 hydraulic parameters for four soil textural layers 2 crop parameters nine parameters related to vegetable growth simulation 3 n transformation parameters a total of five parameters which includes two nitrification parameters two denitrification parameters and one ammonia volatilization parameter the initial values for soil hydraulic parameters were set according to the values in table 2 and the parameters for crop and n transformation were set to the default values in the eu rotate n model after 10 iterations the optimal values were obtained by pest table 3 the rcs values of model input parameters for cucumber and tomato calibration experiments are shown in fig 1 the standard error indicated the variation of 10 iterations of pest the two simulation results were similar in general the soil hydraulic parameters and crop parameters had a relative higher sensitivity than the n transformation parameters among soil hydraulic parameters the saturated soil water content had the highest sensitivity and the rank of rcs was θs n α ks among crop parameters the accumulated temperature tsum crop coefficient kini kmid and kend and maximum root depth r max had higher sensitivity among the n transformation parameters the parameters related to nitrification vn and kn had the highest sensitivity followed by the ammonia volatilization parameter kv model users should pay careful attention to estimating the most sensitive parameters during use our results show that θs and n were the most sensitive soil hydraulic parameters which was also reported by li et al 2007 who conducted a sensitivity analysis for wnmm model nolan et al 2010 found that the sensitivity of soil hydraulic parameters are related to the soil textural layer for instance the hydraulic parameters of topsoil 0 50cm had higher sensitivity than other layers however the soil hydraulic parameters did not show the same trend in our study which could be related to the mix of soil with different textures when the greenhouse was established because the spatial variation in soil vertical profile is small table 2 sun et al 2014 calculated the rcs values for rzwqm2 input parameters and concluded that the n transformation parameters had a lower sensitivity than soil hydraulic parameters and crop parameters sun et al 2016 assessed the sensitivity of rzwqm2 model using glue methods and also reported that among n transformation parameters the arrhenius coefficient for nitrification had the largest effect on soil nitrate concentration richter et al 2010 and specka et al 2015 analyzed the crop parameter sensitivities of stamina and monica on crop yield and both of them found that the crop parameters related to crop development and solar canopy interception was the most sensitive in the whcns veg model tsum had the higher sensitivity among crop parameters the result was similar to those other studies 3 2 model performance 3 2 1 soil water content figs 2 and 3 show the comparison of simulated and measured soil water content swc for two seasons for cucumber and tomato respectively because of space limitations we only showed one furrow irrigation treatment fp and one drip irrigation treatment opt or dor for both vegetables figs 2 and 3 the statistical indices of all four treatments are shown in table 4 in general the simulated soil water contents agreed well with the measured values both me and rmse values for calibration treatments are close to zero nrmse 10 and ia 0 6 table 4 for model evaluation treatments the ranges of me rmse nrmse and ia were 0 008 to 0 003cm3 cm 3 0 012 0 029cm3 cm 3 2 9 9 1 and 0 505 0 907 respectively these results indicated that the whcns veg model performed well in simulating swc for cucumber and tomato under different water and n management practices figs 2 and 3 illustrated that the swc of fp fluctuates more dramatically than that of opt or dor treatment for the tomato experiment this was likely due to the large amount of water applied at each irrigation event for fp nearly 50mm 10 times that of opt while for opt it was only about 5mm for each irrigation there was one large peak in swc that occurred at the date of february 2 2011 for opt fig 3e h due to a furrow irrigation event at date of tomato planting the drip irrigation rate for cucumber was larger about 27 8mm at each irrigation event than that of tomato thus the relative changes in swc showed a more dramatic change in fig 2g i compared with fig 3e h those results indicated that the large amount of irrigation water drained out of the root zone under fp condition which may be the driving force for soil nitrate leaching some studies also reported that there was a positive relationship between water drainage and nitrate leaching hu et al 2008 sun et al 2012 li et al 2015b 3 2 2 soil n concentration figs 4 and 5 show the comparison of simulated and measured soil nitrate concentration snc for two seasons for cucumber and tomato respectively similar to the result of swc snc showed greater variability in the upper soil layers compared with deeper soil layers this likely occurred because the upper soil layers are more directly impacted by water and n management practices crop root water uptake and weather conditions other researchers also reported the same results nolan et al 2010 sun et al 2013 the statistical indices in table 4 are the results of calibration and evaluation of snc both of me and rmse values for calibration are small nrmse 30 and ia 0 7 table 4 for model evaluation treatment the ranges of me rmse nrmse and ia were 24 5 to 0 3kgnha 1 36 0 79 8kgnha 1 23 1 40 1 and 0 615 0 940 respectively table 4 almost all of the me values were less than 0 which indicated that whcns veg model underestimated the snc however the measured average snc was about 200kgnha 1 with a high measured error fig 5 and me only accounts for 10 of the average snc values the soil n transformation processes are extremely complex some studies have found that the nrmse for snc simulation were usually high for example nolan et al 2010 applied the rzwqm2 model to simulate the snc on four sites in the usa and the results showed that the nrmse values ranged from 22 to 52 archontoulis et al 2014 simulated snc on corn field using apsim model and also found that the values of nrmse varied from 45 to 75 so the snc result simulated by whcns veg was considered acceptable compared with above results 3 2 3 fresh marketable yield and crop n uptake the relationships between simulated and measured fresh marketable yield and crop n uptake are shown in fig 6 the simulated fresh marketable yield agreed reasonably well with measured values with the slopes of the regression close to 1 and linear regression coefficient r for cucumber and tomato were 0 997 and 0 995 respectively the other four statistical indices in table 5 also indicated good agreement between the model and measured values with the average values of me rmse nrmse and ia of 0 72tha 1 2 69tha 1 2 68 and 0 997 respectively smaller variation was found in the measured crop n uptake data under different water and n management practices during same treatment compared with that of the fresh marketable yield for example the measured crop n uptake for tomato in aw the treatment varied from 217 to 240kgnha 1 while the measured fresh marketable yield ranged from 60 5 to 75 1tha 1 the same luxury n consumption coefficient was used for both growing seasons which maybe the reason for the lower r for crop n uptake compared with fresh marketable yield however the nrmse 10 and ia 0 7 indicated the good performance of crop n uptake table 5 in conclusion the whcns veg model could be used to simulate fresh marketable yield and crop n uptake for vegetable under different water and n management practices 3 3 model limitations these results indicate that the whcns veg model performed well in simulating soil water content soil nitrate concentration marketable fresh yield and crop n uptake however there were some limitations in the current model first due to the limited experimental data in this study only cucumber and tomato growth parameters from the database of the eu rotate n model were calibrated to the varieties grown in china data need to be collected for other vegetable crops in order to establish the database of vegetable parameters for whcns veg in the future secondly some studies found that the soil n transformation processes in greenhouse was different from the open field especially for the soil mineralization greenhouse emission n2o and co2 and ammonia volatilization zhu et al 2014 hou et al 2016 in this study only soil nitrate concentration was evaluated other systematic experiments should be performed in the future to further validate the soil n transformation processes finally the new model does not simulate the effects of other nutrients such as phosphorus or potassium fertilizer diseases and pests on crop growth finally the effect of the depressing osmotic values caused by excessive n application on crop growth was also ignored in current whcns veg model the phenomenon is very common in the greenhouse production due to the large amount of n application zhang et al 2007 4 conclusion we developed a new water and nitrogen management tool whcns veg for intensive greenhouse vegetable production in china the model was calibrated under current farmer practices and a sensitivity analysis results showed that the model was more sensitive to parameters related to soil hydraulic processes and crop growth compared to n transformation parameters soil saturated water content demonstrated the highest sensitivity among soil water hydraulic parameters and the total cumulative available temperature of vegetable growth showed the highest sensitivity for vegetable growth the maximum nitrification rate showed the highest sensitivity among n transformation parameters model evaluation results suggested that the inverse modeling method has some merits for the new whcns veg model the model performed well in simulating soil water content soil nitrate concentration fresh marketable yield and crop n uptake giving values of nrmse of 5 7 28 0 2 7 and 8 3 respectively the values of ia were 0 727 0 730 0 997 and 0 832 respectively this indicated that the whcns veg model is suitable for evaluating the water and n fates and vegetable growth for the intensive greenhouse vegetable production in china in principle the model can be applied for other regions after calibration acknowledgement the study was funded by the national key research and development program of china 2016yfd0800102 2016yfd0201202 and program for changjiang scholars and innovative research team in university gs2 irt0412 
25372,excessive water and fertilizer inputs have led to a series of environmental problems in vegetable production areas in china identifying the fates of water and nutrients is crucial to develop best management strategies in intensive vegetable production systems the objectives of this study were to i develop a scientific water and nitrogen n management tool for intensive greenhouse vegetable production in china and ii evaluate the model performance in the simulating the fate of water and n and vegetable growth under different water and n management practices in china a vegetable growth component was added to the field soil crop system model whcns soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator named whcns veg parameters for the model were estimated and a sensitivity analysis was conducted by coupling the model with the model independent parameter estimation program pest data used to test the model came from two years of cucumber and tomato experiments with various water and n combinations in shandong province china the results of sensitivity analysis showed that the soil hydraulic parameters and vegetable genetic parameters had a relatively higher sensitivity compared with those of n transformation parameters the saturated soil water content had the highest sensitivity among soil hydraulic parameters and the total available accumulated temperature crop coefficient and maximum root depth had higher sensitivity for both vegetable crops among the n transformation parameters the parameters related to nitrification had the highest sensitivity the automatic optimization algorithm performed well in adjusting soil hydraulic parameters vegetable genetic parameters and n transformation parameters the normalized root mean square error for soil water content soil nitrate concentration marketable fresh yield and vegetable n uptake were 5 7 28 0 2 7 and 8 3 respectively and indices of agreement were 0 727 0 730 0 997 and 0 832 respectively the results indicated that the whcns veg model has great potential to simulate and analyze water and n fates and vegetable growth for the intensive greenhouse vegetable production in china keyword greenhouse vegetable whcns veg model auto calibration sensitivity analysis water and nitrogen management 1 introduction greenhouse vegetable production in china developed rapidly over the last 30 years in 2014 the cultivated area of greenhouse vegetables reached 3 7 million ha and accounted for 17 6 of the total national vegetable planting area chinese ministry of agriculture 2015 compared to field crops nutrients especially nitrogen and potassium in vegetable production are more prone to leaching due to its shallow root system excessive water and fertilizer inputs is common in many greenhouse vegetable areas in china which has led to a series of environmental problems such as groundwater pollution soil acidification and salinity etc zhu et al 2005 shi et al 2009 du et al 2011 for example zhu et al 2005 surveyed the groundwater quality in greenhouse vegetable production areas in shandong province and found that the nitrate concentration of more than half of 94 local wells exceeded the who s public drinking water limit of 10mgl 1 du et al 2011 investigated the groundwater pollution in the beijing area and also found that the nitrate concentration of groundwater 13 8mgl 1 in vegetable fields was 2 8 times greater than in crop land furthermore some researchers reported that excessive n fertilizer inputs leads to groundwater pollution and also causes acidification and salinity of soils shi et al 2009 in recent years many studies aimed to achieve a balance between vegetable production yields and environment pollution for example min et al 2012 reported that nitrate leaching was reduced by 39 6 without vegetable yield loss when the traditional n fertilizer rate decreased by 40 fan et al 2014 found that the yield of tomato increased 9 and nitrate leaching was significantly reduced when water and n fertilizer inputs of drip irrigation treatments were decreased by 78 and 43 respectively compared with furrow irrigation li et al 2015a also found that the amount of ammonia volatilization decreased by 37 2 when the n application rate was reduced from the traditional 1200kgnha 1 to an optimal rate of 600kgnha 1 without reducing tomato yield these studies were based on the water and n fertilizer controlled experiments in the greenhouse which are time consuming and costly more importantly the results from the experiments are often only relevant to a specific climate condition management practice and soil type which greatly restrict their application under other conditions soil crop models have been widely used to extend point based experimental results to other locations for problems such as crop production management hansen et al 1990 greenwood 2001 water and fertilizer optimal management nendel 2009 rahn et al 2010 and environment impact assessment nolan et al 2010 etc two existing vegetable decision support models are the n expert fink and scharpf 1993 and n able models greenwood 2001 the n able model was widely adopted in europe and based on this model many vegetable models were developed such as the well n rahn et al 2001 npk model zhang et al 2007 smcr n zhang et al 2009 eu rotate n model rahn et al 2010 etc among these models the eu rotate n model is the most widely used to simulate vegetable growth under different water and n management practices nendel 2009 guo et al 2010 sun et al 2012 sun et al 2013 soto et al 2014 suárez rey et al 2016 the eu rotate n model has also been tested with various open field and greenhouse vegetables over 24 vegetables and researchers have established a complete vegetable parameter database greenwood 2001 rahn et al 2010 guo et al 2010 first introduced the eu rotate n model into china to analyze the n loss in a greenhouse and found that the n mineralization was the key process influencing n leaching but it was strongly underestimated in previously studies for the greenhouse vegetable production system sun et al 2012 2013 used this model to simulate n fate and optimize the water and n management for greenhouse cucumber and tomato and suggested that the drip irrigation with straw incorporation can effectively reduce n leaching while maintaining vegetable yield however the soil water movement and solute transport in eu rotate n model used a simple capacitance approach which greatly limits the use of this model under complex bottom boundary conditions yang et al 2009 proposed an alternative dynamic method richards equation to simulate soil water movement but this method has not been implemented in the current eu rotate n model rahn et al 2010 in addition this model could not separate the processes of denitrification and ammonia volatilization for example since the gas emission of nh3 and n2o were calculated together and output as one item of n gas to overcome the limitation of the above models liang et al 2016a developed a water and n management model soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator whcns for intensive cropping system this model was inspired by the widely validated modules and models around the world including soil water movement module from rzwqm model ahuja et al 2000 heat transfer and solute transport processes from hydrus 1d model simunek et al 2008 carbon c and n cycles routines from daisy model hansen et al 1990 and crop growth from epic model williams et al 1989 the model has been successfully applied to water and n management for the major staple crops in north china li et al 2015b liang et al 2016b however the original crop growth module of whcns was a simplification of the epic crop model which is not suitable for simulation of vegetable growth nendel et al 2009 in this study we developed a vegetable growth module for the whcns model based on eu rotate n model to improve water and n management for greenhouse vegetable production in china at the same time a model independent parameter estimation pest doherty 2004 program was coupled with the model to conduct the sensitivity analysis and parameter auto estimation for the newly coupled whcns veg model the objectives of this study were to i develop a vegetable growth module for the whcns model ii conduct a sensitivity analysis and parameter auto optimization using the model independent parameter estimation program pest and iii evaluate the performance of the model in the simulation of soil water movement n transport and vegetable growth under different water and n management practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 whcns model the key processes described in whcns model include soil evaporation crop transpiration soil water movement soil temperature mineralization of fresh crop residue and soil organic n soil inorganic n immobilization in biomass nitrification ammonia volatilization denitrification and crop growth in the model the reference evapotranspiration is estimated using the grass based penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the infiltration of rainfall or irrigation is computed by a modified green ampt approach green and ampt 1911 water redistribution is simulated by the richards equation in a soil profile in which surface evaporation and plant uptake are considered as sinks simunek et al 2008 meanwhile soil heat transport simulation is directly imported from the hydrus 1d model simunek et al 2008 soil c and n cycling concepts are drawn from the daisy model hansen et al 1990 the model runs on a daily time step and is driven by inputs including weather data and crop biological parameters the model inputs include site latitude and elevation basic soil properties field management initial conditions and daily weather data a detailed model description is available in the literature liang et al 2016a 2 2 model development 2 2 1 plant dry matter accumulation the main vegetable growth processes are based on the methods proposed by greenwood 2001 and rahn et al 2010 this approach uses total dry matter yield at harvest as a target yield while this approach requires fewer input parameters which facilitates use it does require the user to provide a target yield the crop development stage was calculated by eqs 1 and 2 1 r d s i r d s i 1 δ r d s i 2 δ r d s i 0 t i t b a s e t i t b a s e t s u m t b a s e t i t c r

tdmi is plant dry matter on the day i kgha 1 cf w and cf n are the water and n stresses factors for vegetable growth respectively as defined in section 2 2 2 k 1 is an empirical parameter set to 1 0

dry matter weight at planting tdm max is the target total dry matter yield kgha 1 jdh and jdp are the julain day of planting and final harvest respectively 2 2 2 root water and n uptake the actual root water uptake ta or crop transpiration is calculated by eq 6 6 t a r d s h z d z t p r d a w h z b z d z where tp is the potential root water uptake cm rd is root length cm h is the water pressure head cm z is the spatial coordinate cm aw h z is a water stress response function feddes et al 1978 and b z is a root distribution function simunek et al 2008 the cf w was computed by the ratio of ta to tp and a compensatory absorption mechanism was introduced in the model which was proposed by simunek and hopmans 2009 as follows 7 c f w t a t p l r a w h z b z d z ω ω ω 1 ω ω c l r a w h z b z d z ω c ω ω c 1 ω ω c where ωc is a critical value of water stress index or a root adaptability factor 0 1 the approach used for the crop n uptake computation comes from greenwood 2001 which was successfully employed in the eu rotate n model and has an established complete parameter database for many types of vegetables this method assumed that there is no n stress when the crop n concentration is above critical value ncrit 8 n c r i t η a 1 η b exp 0 26 t d m where ncrit is crop critical n concentration ηa and ηb are crop specific coefficient and listed in greenwood 2001

c r i t 1 0 2 2 3 marketable fresh yield predication the computation of marketable fresh yield for vegetable is different from field grain yield because the economic yield for vegetable is determined by fresh weight and vegetables that are too small or too large will affect the crop value thus nendel et al 2009 presented a general method of converting total dry matter tdm to fresh marketable yield for vegetables based on a probability distribution first dry matter yield dmy is calculated from simulated tdmand harvest index hi 11 d m y t d m h i where the unit of dmy is kg ha 1 the single plant average fresh yield spafy kg plant 1 can be calculated by eq 12 and 13 12 p n 10000 p s 2 13 s p a f y d m y p n c d m where pn is the number of plants per hectare ps is plant spacing m cdm is the typical dry matter concentration of the harvested fraction this value for specific vegetables can be found in nendel et al 2009 the weight of the harvested part such as tomato cucumber etc is normally distributed and it can be described as n spafy σy 2 assuming that the weight above a lower market limit llow can be sold at market the fresh marketable can be calculated using eq 14 and 15 14 f x 1 2 π σ y exp x s p a f y 2 2 σ y 2 15 f m y p n s p a f y 1 0 l l o w f x where f x is the normal distribution function of the harvested part and fmy is fresh marketable yield kgha 1 2 3 parameter auto calibration and sensitivity analysis 2 3 1 parameter optimization algorithm for nonlinear models the pest optimizer used the modified gauss marquardt levevberg glm algorithm to estimate model input parameters the glm method is the combination of the gauss newton algorithm and the gradient descent algorithm which has the advantages of these two algorithms and gives fast convergence and global searching capability the tool has been applied successfully in parameter optimization for many hydrology models wang and brubaker 2015 and soil crop models rafique et al 2015 the details description of this algorithm is presented in marquardt 1963 and doherty 2004 the key point of the arithmetic is to minimize the objective function the objective function usually calculated by the sum of squared weighted residuals in this study the objective function φ consist of four components soil water content φw nitrate concentration φn fresh marketable yield φy and crop n uptake φu show in eq 16 16 φ φ w φ n φ y φ u i 1 p w o w i s w i ω w 2 i 1 p n o n i s n i ω n 2 i 1 p y o y i s y i ω y 2 i 1 p u o u i s u i ω l 2 where pw pn py and pu are number of measured soil water content values cm3 cm 3 soil nitrate concentration mgkg 1 fresh marketable yield kgha 1 and crop n uptake kgnha 1 respectively oi and si are measured and simulated values respectively ωw ωn ωy and ωu are weight coefficients for the four individual components respectively since there are considerable differences in magnitude for the four different components the values of ωw ωn ωy and ωu were set to 150 0 35 0 01 and 1 respectively so that they would have similar weightings φu φy φn φw on the objective function 2 3 2 sensitivity analysis most of the time consuming part of each pest optimization iteration is time devoted to the calculation of the jacobian maxtix j we set the maximum iteration number to 10 in this study during this process the model must be run at least n number of input parameters times based on the contents of j pest calculates an index related to the sensitivity of each parameter with respect to all observed values the relative composite sensitivity rcs of parameter i is defined as 17 r c s i j t q j i i 1 2 m where j is the jacobian matrix and q is a diagonal matrix whose elements are comprised of the squared observation weights m is the number of measured data with non zero weights 2 4 model evaluation four statistical indices were used to evaluate model performance the mean bias error me 18 m e i 1 n s i m i n the root mean square error rmse 19 r m s e i 1 n s i m i 2 n the normalized rmse nrmse 20 n r m s e r m s e m 100 index of agreement ia willmott 1982 21 i a 1 i 1 n s i m i 2 i 1 n s i m m i m 2 where si is the simulated value mi is the measured value n is the number of values and m is the mean of measured values the me indicates positive and negative deviations the rmse represents the mean difference between observed and predicted values while nrmse shows the relative size of the mean difference as an unbounded percentage willmott 1982 some studies have suggested that an nrmse 15 represents good agreement 15 30 moderate agreement and 30 poor agreement suárez rey et al 2016 liang et al 2016b the index of agreement 0 ia 1 is intended to be a descriptive measure and is both a relative and bounded measure willmott 1982 the closer the value of ia is to 1 the better the model performance 2 5 greenhouse experiment and data collection 2 5 1 study area the greenhouse vegetable experiments were conducted in shouguang county 36 68 37 32 n 118 53 119 17 e shandong province in north china this is a typical area for vegetable production in china which is also called the vegetable village of china the region is classified as a warm temperature continental monsoon climate with distinct seasons the annual average air temperature and precipitation are 12 7 c and 550mm respectively the soil is classified as cambisol fao unesco 1988 the main vegetable production practice is greenhouse grow the annual average temperature is 21 9 c and 21 0 c in the cucumber and tomato greenhouse respectively typically the local famers apply approximately 1000mm and 572kgnha 1 per season for cucumber production for tomato the rates of irrigation and fertilizer under farmer practice are approximately 600mm and 1000kgnha 1 per season respectively sun et al 2012 2013 2 5 2 experiment design and data collection the greenhouse cucumber experiment included two growing seasons the first season was from august 2009 to january 2010 autumn winter season aw and the second season from january to june 2010 spring summer season ss cucumber seeldings were transplanted on 28 august 2009 and 16 january 2010 respectively the final harvest dates were on 11 january 2010 and 12 june 2010 respectively four different water and n management practices were designed 1 conventional fertilizer farmers s practice fp 2 optimal fertilizer application opt 3 fp crop residues fpr 4 drip irrigation opt crop residues dor the amounts of irrigation and fertilizer application are shown in table 1 the detailed information can be found in sun et al 2012 the greenhouse tomato experiment also included two growing seasons from august 2010 to january 2011 aw season and from february to june 2011 ss season respectively the transplanting dates were 15th august 2010 and 3rd february 2011 with plant spacing of 0 6m for the seasons of aw and ss respectively tomato was harvested on the dates of january 29 2010 and june 1 2011 respectively four different water and n management practices were designed 1 furrow irrigation conventional fertilizer farmer s practice fp 2 drip irrigation optimal fertilizer opt 3 fp crop residues fpr and 4 opt crop residues dor the summary of water and fertilizer management are listed in table 1 details on experiment designs can be found elsewhere sun et al 2013 the basic physical and chemical properties were measured for the 1 20m soil profile in both greenhouses of cucumber and tomato table 2 for the cucumber experiemnt soil volumetric water content from 0 to 120cm at 20cm intervals in the soil profile were measured once about every five days or after an irrigation for tomato experiments soil volumetric water content was measured once every five days at the depths of 45 55 80 and 100cm soil nitrate concentration for both vegetables every 15days for cucumber and every 30days for tomato for soil layers of 0 30 30 60 60 90cm plant samples were also taken from each treatment on a monthly basis to determine dry matter fresh yield and its n content the detail measurement methods were described in sun et al 2012 2013 weather in greenhouse air temperature relatively humidity solar radiation and wind speed were collected using an automatic weather station ar5 yugen 3 results and discussion 3 1 model parameter estimation and parameter sensitivity analysis the measured data soil water content nitrate concentration fresh marketable yield and crop n uptake from the fp treatment for both vegetables was used to calibrate the model the data from the other three treatments were used to evaluate the model the objective function was defined based on procedures outlined in section 2 3 1 the pest optimizer requires the user to select input parameters and input the initial value of each parameter and then the model input parameters can be auto calibrated using inverse modeling as shown in table 3 the input parameters for whcns veg were classified into three groups 1 soil hydraulic parameters a total of 16 hydraulic parameters for four soil textural layers 2 crop parameters nine parameters related to vegetable growth simulation 3 n transformation parameters a total of five parameters which includes two nitrification parameters two denitrification parameters and one ammonia volatilization parameter the initial values for soil hydraulic parameters were set according to the values in table 2 and the parameters for crop and n transformation were set to the default values in the eu rotate n model after 10 iterations the optimal values were obtained by pest table 3 the rcs values of model input parameters for cucumber and tomato calibration experiments are shown in fig 1 the standard error indicated the variation of 10 iterations of pest the two simulation results were similar in general the soil hydraulic parameters and crop parameters had a relative higher sensitivity than the n transformation parameters among soil hydraulic parameters the saturated soil water content had the highest sensitivity and the rank of rcs was θs n α ks among crop parameters the accumulated temperature tsum crop coefficient kini kmid and kend and maximum root depth r max had higher sensitivity among the n transformation parameters the parameters related to nitrification vn and kn had the highest sensitivity followed by the ammonia volatilization parameter kv model users should pay careful attention to estimating the most sensitive parameters during use our results show that θs and n were the most sensitive soil hydraulic parameters which was also reported by li et al 2007 who conducted a sensitivity analysis for wnmm model nolan et al 2010 found that the sensitivity of soil hydraulic parameters are related to the soil textural layer for instance the hydraulic parameters of topsoil 0 50cm had higher sensitivity than other layers however the soil hydraulic parameters did not show the same trend in our study which could be related to the mix of soil with different textures when the greenhouse was established because the spatial variation in soil vertical profile is small table 2 sun et al 2014 calculated the rcs values for rzwqm2 input parameters and concluded that the n transformation parameters had a lower sensitivity than soil hydraulic parameters and crop parameters sun et al 2016 assessed the sensitivity of rzwqm2 model using glue methods and also reported that among n transformation parameters the arrhenius coefficient for nitrification had the largest effect on soil nitrate concentration richter et al 2010 and specka et al 2015 analyzed the crop parameter sensitivities of stamina and monica on crop yield and both of them found that the crop parameters related to crop development and solar canopy interception was the most sensitive in the whcns veg model tsum had the higher sensitivity among crop parameters the result was similar to those other studies 3 2 model performance 3 2 1 soil water content figs 2 and 3 show the comparison of simulated and measured soil water content swc for two seasons for cucumber and tomato respectively because of space limitations we only showed one furrow irrigation treatment fp and one drip irrigation treatment opt or dor for both vegetables figs 2 and 3 the statistical indices of all four treatments are shown in table 4 in general the simulated soil water contents agreed well with the measured values both me and rmse values for calibration treatments are close to zero nrmse 10 and ia 0 6 table 4 for model evaluation treatments the ranges of me rmse nrmse and ia were 0 008 to 0 003cm3 cm 3 0 012 0 029cm3 cm 3 2 9 9 1 and 0 505 0 907 respectively these results indicated that the whcns veg model performed well in simulating swc for cucumber and tomato under different water and n management practices figs 2 and 3 illustrated that the swc of fp fluctuates more dramatically than that of opt or dor treatment for the tomato experiment this was likely due to the large amount of water applied at each irrigation event for fp nearly 50mm 10 times that of opt while for opt it was only about 5mm for each irrigation there was one large peak in swc that occurred at the date of february 2 2011 for opt fig 3e h due to a furrow irrigation event at date of tomato planting the drip irrigation rate for cucumber was larger about 27 8mm at each irrigation event than that of tomato thus the relative changes in swc showed a more dramatic change in fig 2g i compared with fig 3e h those results indicated that the large amount of irrigation water drained out of the root zone under fp condition which may be the driving force for soil nitrate leaching some studies also reported that there was a positive relationship between water drainage and nitrate leaching hu et al 2008 sun et al 2012 li et al 2015b 3 2 2 soil n concentration figs 4 and 5 show the comparison of simulated and measured soil nitrate concentration snc for two seasons for cucumber and tomato respectively similar to the result of swc snc showed greater variability in the upper soil layers compared with deeper soil layers this likely occurred because the upper soil layers are more directly impacted by water and n management practices crop root water uptake and weather conditions other researchers also reported the same results nolan et al 2010 sun et al 2013 the statistical indices in table 4 are the results of calibration and evaluation of snc both of me and rmse values for calibration are small nrmse 30 and ia 0 7 table 4 for model evaluation treatment the ranges of me rmse nrmse and ia were 24 5 to 0 3kgnha 1 36 0 79 8kgnha 1 23 1 40 1 and 0 615 0 940 respectively table 4 almost all of the me values were less than 0 which indicated that whcns veg model underestimated the snc however the measured average snc was about 200kgnha 1 with a high measured error fig 5 and me only accounts for 10 of the average snc values the soil n transformation processes are extremely complex some studies have found that the nrmse for snc simulation were usually high for example nolan et al 2010 applied the rzwqm2 model to simulate the snc on four sites in the usa and the results showed that the nrmse values ranged from 22 to 52 archontoulis et al 2014 simulated snc on corn field using apsim model and also found that the values of nrmse varied from 45 to 75 so the snc result simulated by whcns veg was considered acceptable compared with above results 3 2 3 fresh marketable yield and crop n uptake the relationships between simulated and measured fresh marketable yield and crop n uptake are shown in fig 6 the simulated fresh marketable yield agreed reasonably well with measured values with the slopes of the regression close to 1 and linear regression coefficient r for cucumber and tomato were 0 997 and 0 995 respectively the other four statistical indices in table 5 also indicated good agreement between the model and measured values with the average values of me rmse nrmse and ia of 0 72tha 1 2 69tha 1 2 68 and 0 997 respectively smaller variation was found in the measured crop n uptake data under different water and n management practices during same treatment compared with that of the fresh marketable yield for example the measured crop n uptake for tomato in aw the treatment varied from 217 to 240kgnha 1 while the measured fresh marketable yield ranged from 60 5 to 75 1tha 1 the same luxury n consumption coefficient was used for both growing seasons which maybe the reason for the lower r for crop n uptake compared with fresh marketable yield however the nrmse 10 and ia 0 7 indicated the good performance of crop n uptake table 5 in conclusion the whcns veg model could be used to simulate fresh marketable yield and crop n uptake for vegetable under different water and n management practices 3 3 model limitations these results indicate that the whcns veg model performed well in simulating soil water content soil nitrate concentration marketable fresh yield and crop n uptake however there were some limitations in the current model first due to the limited experimental data in this study only cucumber and tomato growth parameters from the database of the eu rotate n model were calibrated to the varieties grown in china data need to be collected for other vegetable crops in order to establish the database of vegetable parameters for whcns veg in the future secondly some studies found that the soil n transformation processes in greenhouse was different from the open field especially for the soil mineralization greenhouse emission n2o and co2 and ammonia volatilization zhu et al 2014 hou et al 2016 in this study only soil nitrate concentration was evaluated other systematic experiments should be performed in the future to further validate the soil n transformation processes finally the new model does not simulate the effects of other nutrients such as phosphorus or potassium fertilizer diseases and pests on crop growth finally the effect of the depressing osmotic values caused by excessive n application on crop growth was also ignored in current whcns veg model the phenomenon is very common in the greenhouse production due to the large amount of n application zhang et al 2007 4 conclusion we developed a new water and nitrogen management tool whcns veg for intensive greenhouse vegetable production in china the model was calibrated under current farmer practices and a sensitivity analysis results showed that the model was more sensitive to parameters related to soil hydraulic processes and crop growth compared to n transformation parameters soil saturated water content demonstrated the highest sensitivity among soil water hydraulic parameters and the total cumulative available temperature of vegetable growth showed the highest sensitivity for vegetable growth the maximum nitrification rate showed the highest sensitivity among n transformation parameters model evaluation results suggested that the inverse modeling method has some merits for the new whcns veg model the model performed well in simulating soil water content soil nitrate concentration fresh marketable yield and crop n uptake giving values of nrmse of 5 7 28 0 2 7 and 8 3 respectively the values of ia were 0 727 0 730 0 997 and 0 832 respectively this indicated that the whcns veg model is suitable for evaluating the water and n fates and vegetable growth for the intensive greenhouse vegetable production in china in principle the model can be applied for other regions after calibration acknowledgement the study was funded by the national key research and development program of china 2016yfd0800102 2016yfd0201202 and program for changjiang scholars and innovative research team in university gs2 irt0412 
25373,marine spatial planning msp can offer significant benefits in terms of economic conservation strategies optimizing spatial planning and minimizing the impact on the environment in this paper we focused on the application of multi criteria evaluation mce technique for co locating offshore wind farms and open water mussel cultivation an index of co location sustainability si was developed based on the application of mce technique constructed with physical and biological parameters on the basis of remote sensing data the relevant physical factors considered were wind velocity depth range concerning the site location for energy production and sea surface temperature anomaly the biological variables used were chlorofill a as a measurement of the productivity and particle organic carbon poc concentration in order to assess their influence on the probable benefits and complete the requirements of this management framework this si can be easily implemented to do a first order selection of the most promising areas to be more specifically studied in a second order approach based on local field data keywords sustainability index aquaculture mussel farm and wind farm co location 1 introduction 1 1 scientific background offshore wind farms are widely spread in denmark however their growth has proven to limit the allowable space for aquaculture sites therefore the environmental authorities to enhance sustainability improve marine space utilization and reduce costs are encouraging to move the aquaculture facilities between the wind farms foteinis and tsoutsos 2017 the coexistence of this complementary use of marine space which has been first investigated by buck et al 2008 is possible for both limited depths found in the danish coastal waters and also for higher depths found in other offshore sites where the monopiles are substituted by semisubmersible structures in this case the aquaculture lines have to cope with the structure moorings which recently have been investigated benassai et al 2014a b 2015 the co locating strategy of aquaculture and offshore wind farms arises from the increase in local biodiversity species abundance and biomass that have been found in artificial reefs used as foundations for offshore wind farms alexander et al 2016 gimpel et al 2015 stelzenmüller et al 2016 to do this specific co management strategies are needed that are either more results oriented e g for integrating technical knowledge of the two sectors or more process oriented e g for establishing new linkages between different groups michler cieluch and krause 2008 typically the synoptic and mesoscale characteristics of some remote sensing sensors have been exploited to infer information about the environment and its changes and therefore to support decision makers to take the correct action for marine spatial planning msp some authors showed that the main factor explaining growth variation was phytoplankton availability as permitted by the current speed camacho et al 1991 the actual amount of phytoplankton available to the mussels depends on the water flow through the mussel ropes i e current speed and the chl a concentration different levels of chl a content and water current speed which influence phytoplankton availability coupled with proper salinity and temperature conditions affect mussel growth other potential stressors that can impact bivalves include dissolved oxygen and poc concentrations the baltic sea in particular the danish and norwegian fjords are characterized by high levels of hypoxia due to on shore slow circulation currents a shallow bottom and excess of nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and organic carbon enhanced eutrophication not only reduces water clarity but also causes a shift in phytoplankton species composition from high quality e g diatoms to low quality species e g cyanobacteria this shift in species composition can have a rippling effect up the food chain and cause a decrease in natural fish stocks due to the decrease in zooplankton biomass this condition may increase the hypoxia and cause the decline of seagrass and macrophyte concentration during the preliminary physical analysis the factors influencing the aquaculture sustainability are chosen among the conditions leading to more enhanced growth rates which are governed by food availability and phytoplankton dynamics winter 1978 soniat and ray 1985 an upwelling index associated to high productivity areas is linked with the increase in sea surface chl a concentrations valavanis et al 2004 so areas with high chl a concentrations present also an increase of nutrients available to photo synthesisers the oceanographic processes such as upwelling gyres or eddies which can transport cold nutrient rich water from below the pycnocline to the euphotic zone where photosynthesis takes place are typical of autotrophs organisms associated with low sst sea surface temperature the spatial integration of sst anomaly and chl a normalized may detect areas of productive processes such as upwelling and gyres valavanis et al 2004 the analysis of climatological long term time series allows the identification of persistently productive regions independent on short term variability 1 2 marine spatial planning as a tool to implement ecosystem based conservation strategies this study confirms that msp is a key framework for delivering conservation strategies in marine environment provided that it reduces conflicts between different uses of marine space and limits the possible undesirable effects such as the restriction of activities in the coastal area today this ecosystem approach has become widely accepted as a strategy for integrated management of resources that promotes conservation and sustainable use douvere 2008 in this study we use msp as a tool to achieve a sustainable use of marine resources in coastal areas where multiples activities occur and space is a limiting factor following benassai et al 2014c 2011 who proposed the development of a sustainability index si for the co location of aquaculture cultivation in marine areas of offshore wind farms we selected the optimal sites for a sustainable offshore aquaculture on the basis of physical chemical parameters driving autotrophic production coupled with other biological environmental factors i e chl a poc that can fuel increases in microbial biomass and productivity 2 study area and data source 2 1 site characterization the study area used as a test site to implement the co locating management was identified in the danish portion of the baltic sea and in the western part of the danish north sea fig 1 where many offshore wind farms are already installed and many projects are in construction or in the planning stage marine aquaculture along the baltic sea and the denmark coast is an advantageous tie in strategy to optimize the great potential to sustainably develop offshore wind farms that are supported by strong and stable winds for instance in the danish portion of the baltic sea and in the western part of the danish coast the average wind speed ranges between 7 and 10m s with higher values in the northern zones persistent winds together with shallow water columns depth less than 40m are important factors influencing the feasibility of developing an offshore wind farm benassai et al 2014c however the social and environmental conditions of the coastal areas should always be considered especially during the planning stages in the north sea these planned structures compete with shipping recreational activities cables and pipelines military exercises and fisheries wirtz et al 2003 the circulation in the coastal area under study consisting in the southern and eastern north sea from the german bight into the skaggerak is influenced by the jutland current in the northern part of denmark which branches into two currents one staying in the north sea and the other entering the skagerrak in the kattegat the influence of oceanic circulation is weaker than in the north sea since dominating factors are river run off and larger atmospheric variability above land becker 1996 the south eastern part of the north sea is influenced by the shallow water column and the strong tidal current which transports high nutrient and sediment loads in general the north sea circulation pattern is cyclonic so that german bight waters which are nutrient rich due to river discharge in relatively shallow waters are transported towards north along the jutland west coast into the skagerrak and even spilled into the kattegat 2 2 data source and modelling topography was interpolated from etopo1 high resolution 1 arc minute digital elevation model fig 1 evidenced a north sea average of about 100m deep with a maximum depth higher than 200m in the skagerrak between denmark and norway and depths of few meters lower than 20 25m in the southern bight 51 54 n in particular the western part of the kattegat presents relatively shallow depths 10 20m whereas the eastern part has a north south trench with depths higher than 40m and more carstensen and conley 2004 with regard to wind speed at 10m a s l the merra modern era retrospective analysis for research and application a nasa reanalysis for the era satellite using the goddard earth observing system data assimilation system version 5 geos 5 das was used the original data was on the geos 5 grid with 2 3 degree longitude and 1 2 degree latitude resolution and covers the period 01 10 2006 31 10 2016 this dataset although with a relatively low resolution is the only public data covering the study area the sst fig 4 and relative anomaly ssta fig 5 in the north sea were obtained by aqua modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer satellite observations with a resolution of 4kmpixel 1 the ssta pattern shows north sea regions with warmer or colder temperature than the long term average for a given year from october 2015 to october 2016 the chlorophyll a chl a concentration in the ocean indicates the presence and concentration of phytoplankton and is related to oceanic primary production fig 6 shows interannual averaged from 2006 to 2016 modis aqua satellite detected chl a concentrations with a resolution of 4kmpixel 1 calculated using an empirical relationship derived from in situ measurements of chl a and blue to green band ratios of in situ remote sensing reflectances rrs poc concentration obtained by modis aqua observations at the same resolution was reported for the same 10 years averaged dataset in fig 7 3 methods in order to perform the si evaluation the previous raw data of the environmental conditions were re binned in the study area using relatively high horizontal resolution 4km and nearest values interpolation method a specific normalization procedure was then applied to obtain the parameter specific sustainability functions pssf between 0 and 1 seabed topography and wind speed were the most important physical characteristics to derive pssf of the wind farm activities in the north sea with reference to water depth a step cost function was assigned with four steps ranging from below 20m most favorable to higher than 40m least favorable with reference to the wind speed a conversion factor between wind speed and energy was obtained using the standard power curve for the vestas v112 3mw turbine particularly suited for offshore sites then a normalization procedure values max value ensured pssf varying between 0 and 1 the maximum value of 1 most favourable was given to the mean wind speed associated with 100 of the power transfer function 12m s while the other pssf values were assigned consistently thus the pssf was not linear with wind speed but was fitted to the shape of the energy transfer function from the wind coastal interannual means of sst were obtained for each coastal segment as the mean temperatures obtained from the monthly climatological mean data set the climatological monthly mean data were compared with the corresponding monthly mean data to identify temperature anomalies and areas of persistently higher or lower temperatures than that of the coastal mean long term coastal chl a and poc interannual mean values were generated for each coastal segment in an identical manner to that of sst to identify regions with persistently low sst and high chl a which correspond to areas of productive processes the calculation of pssf for the ssta chl a and poc was made on the basis of a normalization technique over the remote sensing data values max value an additional rescaling was applied through the logarithm log10 of chl a to take into account the huge amount of variation of this environmental parameter and so obtain the pssf ranging from 0 to 1 the sst anomalies were transformed into anomaly indexes suitable for aquaculture attributing 1 to low values of temperature anomaly and 0 to maximum positive anomaly because large sst anomalies are detrimental for aquaculture activities a synthesis of the variables directly considered for si and their associated ranking for si computation is given in table 1 based on the functional forms reported in fig 2 the final ranking of the si was classified in four distinct classes good medium poor unsuitable on the basis of the following equation 1 si unsuitable if si 0 25 poor if 0 25 si 0 50 medium if 0 50 si 0 75 good if si 0 75 4 results 4 1 spatial distribution of the environmental parameters the spatial distribution of the surface wind speed shows higher values on the western side of the jutland which is more exposed to atlantic winds and in the center of the kattegat lower values are found in the coastal area of the kattegat both on the eastern and western side in the study area the sst fig 4 has a minimum value in the range of 10 10 5 c and a maximum value around 13 c the highest sst values are located near the coast where the low water depth limits the water mixing processes the spatial distribution of the chl a obtained by modis aqua fig 6 shows higher concentrations along the coastline because phytoplankton production is driven by large external nutrient inputs that are dominated by loading from land in particular the chl a concentrations are higher in the western side of the zealand where the river discharge is even more dominant poc spatial distribution obtained by modis aqua fig 7 shows higher concentrations on the coastal zone of the south western and north eastern part of the jutland and on the area north of the zealand the modis aqua data are consistent with carstensen and conley 2004 who obtained a spatial distribution of chl a concentration in the upper mixed layer of the kattegat based on field data may august 1989 1999 their results in fact showed higher chl a levels in the nearshore region particularly near the mouth of the freshwater sources similarly poc values are in good agreement with poc spatial distribution obtained by leipe et al 2011 through in situ analysis of superficial sediments of the baltic sea 4 2 spatial distribution of the sustainability index the si spatial distribution reported in fig 8 varies from si 0 in the open ocean northern of north sea to si 0 7 and more in the coastal zones in detail si spatial distribution evidences higher values on the southern western and on the northern eastern coastal area of the jutland and around the zealand the northern eastern area of the kattegat is characterized by higher depths fig 1 and lower wind speed values fig 3 for this reason although the values of chl a poc and ssta in these areas are intermediate the eastern coastal zone presents lower si values than the western one numerical values of the si for several sites already elected or planned to be used for offshore wind farms are reported in histogram of fig 9 where the index values have been calculated with and without the use of poc variable sia and sib respectively the comparison has been performed in three locations horns rev wind farms 7 9 e 55 7 n in the north sea anholt located in the northern western area of the kattegat 11 3 e 56 5 n and nysted 11 2 e 55 0 n in the baltic sea located south of zealand we note that depth and wind speed are the factors largely controlling the si distribution depth is very low for horns rev 2 9m intermediate for anholt 14 20m and low for nysted 6 9 5m on the other hand wind speed is higher for horns rev 7 0 7 5m s than in anholt and nysted 6 5 7 0m s the ssta is lower in horns rev intermediate in nysted and higher in anolth while chl a and poc are comparable for all cited sites the numerical values of si follow the physical variable trends all of which contribute to increase the si values in horns rev with regard to the difference between sia and sib in the three locations the use of poc together with the other physical and biological parameters has not found to appreciably influence the global si trend in this case study 5 discussion the si is an useful tool to assess the overall co location suitability of offshore wind farms and mussel aquaculture based on different hydro biochemical variables this index allows the quantitative classification into representative classes of conditions ranging from excellent to very poor to obtain comparisons between different locations as well as their evolutionary trend over time ott 1978 the previous development of the application of mce technique for co location of offshore wind farms and open water mussel cultivation proposed by benassai et al 2014c was based mainly on physical constraints the current development of a sustainability index for the co location in marine areas of offshore wind farms and aquaculture based on a new different data set associates physical constraints and biological parameters that are directly linked to primary production the relevant physical factors are wind velocity depth range and sst anomaly while the biological parameters are chl a and poc concentration the obtained si scores in fig 9 show that the index is mainly influenced by the physical parameters the obtained results confirm that the integration of physical and biological parameters is crucial for implementing global indexes for optimizing the use of marine resources in this context the combined use of physical and biological observations and high resolution numerical models benassai et al 2013 montuori et al 2011 benassai and ascione 2006a b galletti et al 2017 montella et al 2016b a di luccio et al 2017 is needed for the construction of a smart tool for multiple space utilization a possible complementary approach may consider other relevant aspects such as the ocean acidification effects which have to be considered for their direct impacts on both calcification rates of adult organisms and growth rates and survival of larval species in fact mussels are similar to most aragonitic organisms which are the most susceptible calcifying organisms to the effects of carbonate under saturation caused by ocean acidification for example the aragonite calcification rates of edible blue mussel were shown to decrease linearly as a function of the pco2 concentration sarà and mazzola 2004 other complementary aspects include the social acceptance of combined use of marine space as well as the possible economic efficiency of the co location strategy the first aspect is related to the mussel cultivation future restraints so cultivating mussels within offshore wind farms can offer a way for mussel fishermen to secure their business in the long term because it has become clear that the area currently available for nearshore mussel cultivation will not be extended in the future the second economic aspect is difficult to be properly evaluated because there are no reliable data on the economic efficiency increase associated to the mixed use 6 conclusions in this study we addressed offshore wind and mussel farm co location in the coastal areas of denmark for a correct planning of sustainable use of marine resources we selected the optimal sites for a sustainable offshore aquaculture on the basis of physical chemical parameters driving autotrophic production coupled with other biological environmental factors i e chl a poc that can fuel increases in microbial biomass and productivity the application was collected in a definition of a sustainability index which is a possible response to the actual and future need of a smart tool for multiple marine space utilization and sustainable use of marine resources however other biological information have to be added into this index to have a better understanding of the processes therefore it is crucial to utilize basic scientific knowledge in developing and optimizing the possible co location of energy production and sustainable aquaculture systems 
25373,marine spatial planning msp can offer significant benefits in terms of economic conservation strategies optimizing spatial planning and minimizing the impact on the environment in this paper we focused on the application of multi criteria evaluation mce technique for co locating offshore wind farms and open water mussel cultivation an index of co location sustainability si was developed based on the application of mce technique constructed with physical and biological parameters on the basis of remote sensing data the relevant physical factors considered were wind velocity depth range concerning the site location for energy production and sea surface temperature anomaly the biological variables used were chlorofill a as a measurement of the productivity and particle organic carbon poc concentration in order to assess their influence on the probable benefits and complete the requirements of this management framework this si can be easily implemented to do a first order selection of the most promising areas to be more specifically studied in a second order approach based on local field data keywords sustainability index aquaculture mussel farm and wind farm co location 1 introduction 1 1 scientific background offshore wind farms are widely spread in denmark however their growth has proven to limit the allowable space for aquaculture sites therefore the environmental authorities to enhance sustainability improve marine space utilization and reduce costs are encouraging to move the aquaculture facilities between the wind farms foteinis and tsoutsos 2017 the coexistence of this complementary use of marine space which has been first investigated by buck et al 2008 is possible for both limited depths found in the danish coastal waters and also for higher depths found in other offshore sites where the monopiles are substituted by semisubmersible structures in this case the aquaculture lines have to cope with the structure moorings which recently have been investigated benassai et al 2014a b 2015 the co locating strategy of aquaculture and offshore wind farms arises from the increase in local biodiversity species abundance and biomass that have been found in artificial reefs used as foundations for offshore wind farms alexander et al 2016 gimpel et al 2015 stelzenmüller et al 2016 to do this specific co management strategies are needed that are either more results oriented e g for integrating technical knowledge of the two sectors or more process oriented e g for establishing new linkages between different groups michler cieluch and krause 2008 typically the synoptic and mesoscale characteristics of some remote sensing sensors have been exploited to infer information about the environment and its changes and therefore to support decision makers to take the correct action for marine spatial planning msp some authors showed that the main factor explaining growth variation was phytoplankton availability as permitted by the current speed camacho et al 1991 the actual amount of phytoplankton available to the mussels depends on the water flow through the mussel ropes i e current speed and the chl a concentration different levels of chl a content and water current speed which influence phytoplankton availability coupled with proper salinity and temperature conditions affect mussel growth other potential stressors that can impact bivalves include dissolved oxygen and poc concentrations the baltic sea in particular the danish and norwegian fjords are characterized by high levels of hypoxia due to on shore slow circulation currents a shallow bottom and excess of nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and organic carbon enhanced eutrophication not only reduces water clarity but also causes a shift in phytoplankton species composition from high quality e g diatoms to low quality species e g cyanobacteria this shift in species composition can have a rippling effect up the food chain and cause a decrease in natural fish stocks due to the decrease in zooplankton biomass this condition may increase the hypoxia and cause the decline of seagrass and macrophyte concentration during the preliminary physical analysis the factors influencing the aquaculture sustainability are chosen among the conditions leading to more enhanced growth rates which are governed by food availability and phytoplankton dynamics winter 1978 soniat and ray 1985 an upwelling index associated to high productivity areas is linked with the increase in sea surface chl a concentrations valavanis et al 2004 so areas with high chl a concentrations present also an increase of nutrients available to photo synthesisers the oceanographic processes such as upwelling gyres or eddies which can transport cold nutrient rich water from below the pycnocline to the euphotic zone where photosynthesis takes place are typical of autotrophs organisms associated with low sst sea surface temperature the spatial integration of sst anomaly and chl a normalized may detect areas of productive processes such as upwelling and gyres valavanis et al 2004 the analysis of climatological long term time series allows the identification of persistently productive regions independent on short term variability 1 2 marine spatial planning as a tool to implement ecosystem based conservation strategies this study confirms that msp is a key framework for delivering conservation strategies in marine environment provided that it reduces conflicts between different uses of marine space and limits the possible undesirable effects such as the restriction of activities in the coastal area today this ecosystem approach has become widely accepted as a strategy for integrated management of resources that promotes conservation and sustainable use douvere 2008 in this study we use msp as a tool to achieve a sustainable use of marine resources in coastal areas where multiples activities occur and space is a limiting factor following benassai et al 2014c 2011 who proposed the development of a sustainability index si for the co location of aquaculture cultivation in marine areas of offshore wind farms we selected the optimal sites for a sustainable offshore aquaculture on the basis of physical chemical parameters driving autotrophic production coupled with other biological environmental factors i e chl a poc that can fuel increases in microbial biomass and productivity 2 study area and data source 2 1 site characterization the study area used as a test site to implement the co locating management was identified in the danish portion of the baltic sea and in the western part of the danish north sea fig 1 where many offshore wind farms are already installed and many projects are in construction or in the planning stage marine aquaculture along the baltic sea and the denmark coast is an advantageous tie in strategy to optimize the great potential to sustainably develop offshore wind farms that are supported by strong and stable winds for instance in the danish portion of the baltic sea and in the western part of the danish coast the average wind speed ranges between 7 and 10m s with higher values in the northern zones persistent winds together with shallow water columns depth less than 40m are important factors influencing the feasibility of developing an offshore wind farm benassai et al 2014c however the social and environmental conditions of the coastal areas should always be considered especially during the planning stages in the north sea these planned structures compete with shipping recreational activities cables and pipelines military exercises and fisheries wirtz et al 2003 the circulation in the coastal area under study consisting in the southern and eastern north sea from the german bight into the skaggerak is influenced by the jutland current in the northern part of denmark which branches into two currents one staying in the north sea and the other entering the skagerrak in the kattegat the influence of oceanic circulation is weaker than in the north sea since dominating factors are river run off and larger atmospheric variability above land becker 1996 the south eastern part of the north sea is influenced by the shallow water column and the strong tidal current which transports high nutrient and sediment loads in general the north sea circulation pattern is cyclonic so that german bight waters which are nutrient rich due to river discharge in relatively shallow waters are transported towards north along the jutland west coast into the skagerrak and even spilled into the kattegat 2 2 data source and modelling topography was interpolated from etopo1 high resolution 1 arc minute digital elevation model fig 1 evidenced a north sea average of about 100m deep with a maximum depth higher than 200m in the skagerrak between denmark and norway and depths of few meters lower than 20 25m in the southern bight 51 54 n in particular the western part of the kattegat presents relatively shallow depths 10 20m whereas the eastern part has a north south trench with depths higher than 40m and more carstensen and conley 2004 with regard to wind speed at 10m a s l the merra modern era retrospective analysis for research and application a nasa reanalysis for the era satellite using the goddard earth observing system data assimilation system version 5 geos 5 das was used the original data was on the geos 5 grid with 2 3 degree longitude and 1 2 degree latitude resolution and covers the period 01 10 2006 31 10 2016 this dataset although with a relatively low resolution is the only public data covering the study area the sst fig 4 and relative anomaly ssta fig 5 in the north sea were obtained by aqua modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer satellite observations with a resolution of 4kmpixel 1 the ssta pattern shows north sea regions with warmer or colder temperature than the long term average for a given year from october 2015 to october 2016 the chlorophyll a chl a concentration in the ocean indicates the presence and concentration of phytoplankton and is related to oceanic primary production fig 6 shows interannual averaged from 2006 to 2016 modis aqua satellite detected chl a concentrations with a resolution of 4kmpixel 1 calculated using an empirical relationship derived from in situ measurements of chl a and blue to green band ratios of in situ remote sensing reflectances rrs poc concentration obtained by modis aqua observations at the same resolution was reported for the same 10 years averaged dataset in fig 7 3 methods in order to perform the si evaluation the previous raw data of the environmental conditions were re binned in the study area using relatively high horizontal resolution 4km and nearest values interpolation method a specific normalization procedure was then applied to obtain the parameter specific sustainability functions pssf between 0 and 1 seabed topography and wind speed were the most important physical characteristics to derive pssf of the wind farm activities in the north sea with reference to water depth a step cost function was assigned with four steps ranging from below 20m most favorable to higher than 40m least favorable with reference to the wind speed a conversion factor between wind speed and energy was obtained using the standard power curve for the vestas v112 3mw turbine particularly suited for offshore sites then a normalization procedure values max value ensured pssf varying between 0 and 1 the maximum value of 1 most favourable was given to the mean wind speed associated with 100 of the power transfer function 12m s while the other pssf values were assigned consistently thus the pssf was not linear with wind speed but was fitted to the shape of the energy transfer function from the wind coastal interannual means of sst were obtained for each coastal segment as the mean temperatures obtained from the monthly climatological mean data set the climatological monthly mean data were compared with the corresponding monthly mean data to identify temperature anomalies and areas of persistently higher or lower temperatures than that of the coastal mean long term coastal chl a and poc interannual mean values were generated for each coastal segment in an identical manner to that of sst to identify regions with persistently low sst and high chl a which correspond to areas of productive processes the calculation of pssf for the ssta chl a and poc was made on the basis of a normalization technique over the remote sensing data values max value an additional rescaling was applied through the logarithm log10 of chl a to take into account the huge amount of variation of this environmental parameter and so obtain the pssf ranging from 0 to 1 the sst anomalies were transformed into anomaly indexes suitable for aquaculture attributing 1 to low values of temperature anomaly and 0 to maximum positive anomaly because large sst anomalies are detrimental for aquaculture activities a synthesis of the variables directly considered for si and their associated ranking for si computation is given in table 1 based on the functional forms reported in fig 2 the final ranking of the si was classified in four distinct classes good medium poor unsuitable on the basis of the following equation 1 si unsuitable if si 0 25 poor if 0 25 si 0 50 medium if 0 50 si 0 75 good if si 0 75 4 results 4 1 spatial distribution of the environmental parameters the spatial distribution of the surface wind speed shows higher values on the western side of the jutland which is more exposed to atlantic winds and in the center of the kattegat lower values are found in the coastal area of the kattegat both on the eastern and western side in the study area

25374,cities are considered to be major consumers of natural resources creating global resource shortages and environmental challenges therefore understanding the mechanism of material metabolism is crucial for modern cities sustainable development here we took the city of wuxi as an example first constructing a network composed of 8 components combining material accounting and ecological network analysis we analyzed the integrated flow process and components weight distributions for 6 years additionally relationships among components were identified to examine the synergism level of the metabolic system our results indicate that wuxi s urban system was dependent on its environment and the integrated material inflow of transportation household consumption and mining increased to 1 55 1 36 and 3 36 respectively during the study period environment and household consumption accounted for the largest sectoral weights 20 9 and 20 0 respectively while that of manufacturing and mining changed significantly by 5 1 and 4 4 respectively within the system the environment supplied resources agriculture and mining utilized renewable resources venous industry promoted resource recycling mutualism relationships were mainly related to these sectors however exploitation and control were the dominant relationships in wuxi and the whole system s synergism level still needed to be improved this study provides a scientific guidance for the future structural adjustment and resource utilization for wuxi and the similar medium sized cities with rapid economic development in china keywords urban metabolism material accounting ecological networks relationship analysis china 1 introduction rapid economic globalization and information technology development have effectively promoted the process of urbanization currently approximately 3 9 billion people live in cities worldwide comprising 54 of the world s population according to the un 2014 by 2050 the proportion of urban population is projected to increase to 66 with another 2 5 billion people moving to urban settlements mainly in developing countries as a result the large urban population leads to massive resource and energy consumption for example every year approximately 67 of the world s total energy is consumed in cities worldwide resulting in more than 70 of global greenhouse gas emissions united nations institute 2015 facing such a challenging and pressing situation how to effectively allocate limited resources in urban areas and to promote sustainable urban development has aroused extensive attention therefore researchers have introduced the concept of urban metabolism to investigate the whole process of resource and energy exploitation processing consumption and recycling within the urban system to find approaches to realize sustainable development the concept of urban metabolism was first put forward by wolman in 1965 he compared cities to a complete ecosystem and proposed urban metabolism as the whole process by which resources and energy enter and products and waste leave the urban system materials including food fuels products water waste and other natural resources eurostat 2013 2016 hendrils et al 2000 barles 2009a 2009b are crucial elements in the urban system that maintain the normal operation and sustainable development of cities liang and zhang 2011 graedel et al 2015 wiedmann et al 2015 krausmann et al 2017 therefore material flows among components within the urban system and between the system and external zones are the focus of urban metabolism material flow analysis is an important research method to study the urban material metabolism process and to reveal its mechanism kennedy et al 2015 many scholars have implemented a wide range of research on cities of various sizes based on this concept including cities such as hong kong taipei huang 1998 newcombe et al 1978 sydney newman 1999 vienna hendrils et al 2000 toronto sahely et al 2003 forkes 2007 los angeles ngo and pataki 2008 paris barles 2009a b 2010 taipei huang and chen 2009 lisbon niza et al 2009 rosado et al 2014 london walker et al 2014 horta and keirstead 2016 suzhou liang and zhang 2011 and beijing zhang et al 2013 2014a 2014b previous studies have normally paid more attention to external characteristics of the whole urban system wolman 1965 newman 1999 warren rhodes and koenig 2001 codoban and kennedy 2008 browne et al 2009 such as the total input or output flows while neglecting sectoral flows and sectoral ecological correlations within the system in addition although material exchange and consumption through direct pathways have been analyzed in many studies the material flows embodied in indirect pathways are often omitted thus the indirect material metabolism within cities which accounts for a significant proportion in the whole process of urban metabolism is ignored therefore in recent years some researchers have begun to focus on the above gaps in urban material metabolism studies by using ecological network analysis zhang et al 2011b 2013 2014a 2014b 2015 zhang et al 2011a li et al 2012 chen and chen 2012 2015 ecological network analysis compares a city as a network comprising nodes and pathways and imitates the flows of materials and energy within the network fath and patten 1999 from the perspective of networks they have tried to quantify integrated material flows embodied in direct pathways and to identify key nodes and pathways in urban metabolism thereby revealing urban systems structures and functions fath and patten 1999 fath 2004 fath and killian 2007 at the same time the ecological network model can also solve the problem that the traditional black box model cannot explore the internal characteristics of a system in urban metabolism studies the structure and functional characteristics of an urban metabolic system can be examined by relationship analysis based on it the mechanism of interactions between different sectors can be revealed and in turn reflect the characteristics of the whole system for example zhang et al 2014b focused on the material metabolic process and did a control analysis of eight components in beijing zhang et al 2015 analyzed the complex relations among fifteen sectors in jing jin ji energy agglomeration this method can help to understand relationships among compartments within urban systems further promoting the effective structural planning and sustainable development of cities the rapid buildup of china s economy has stimulated the development of chinese cities at present most completed studies on the urban material metabolism in china based on ecological network analysis mainly concentrate on the area of beijing revealing the relationships among compartments within the urban system liu et al 2011 and li et al 2012 examined beijing s sectoral ecological relationship and system structure zhang et al 2013 investigated the structure of beijing s metabolic system using four indices metabolic scale intensity efficiency and impact zhang et al 2014a examined the synergism level of beijing s 7 sectors and zhang et al 2014b constructed a 32 compartment model and analyzed the ecological relationships and hierarchy combining input output analysis currently the number of studies on material metabolism in other typical chinese cities is relatively low and existing research areas mainly concentrate on beijing and its surrounding regions at present despite of china s rapid economic growth the development of different areas still exist displays an unbalanced trend in particular the socioeconomic development level of the coastal areas including the yangtze river delta the pearl river delta and the bohai rim is higher than the national average accelerating the urbanization process in these areas wuxi in jiangsu province of china and the hinterland of the yangtze river delta is a typical medium sized coastal city fig 1 it has a land area of approximately 4627km2 and a population of 479 million wbs 2016 in 2013 the urbanization rate of wuxi increased to 73 7 reaching a steady development period among china s administrative prefecture level cities wuxi ranked 14 in gross domestic product gdp approximately 921 billion yuan in 2016 wuxi is a well known manufacturing center in china s jiangsu province having mature industries like textile and machinery manufacturing therefore exploring the material metabolism process of wuxi has significance for urban sustainability of medium sized cities with rapid economic development in the developing countries here we took wuxi as an empirical example to explore its urban material metabolism process we first constructed a network model comprising 8 compartments and pathways among them within the urban system next by combining material flow accounting and network flow analysis we examined the variations of integrated flows and weight distributions in 6 years 2000 2003 2006 2009 2012 and 2015 thus we identified the key nodes and pathways in the metabolic network through controlling and adjusting above key points this research supports for the resource utilization optimization and waste reduction finally we analyzed the changes of ecological relationship mutualism competition exploitation and control distributions to regulate the system s synergism level this study can provide reliable evidence for policy makers to identify the metabolic system s structure and characteristics and to further alleviate disorder and resource waste in cities 2 methodology 2 1 system boundary and data acquisition the study boundary in this research is the whole urban system of wuxi including all the socioeconomic sectors involved in the process of urban material metabolism and the urban system s internal and external zone based on available data we divide wuxi s industries into 7 sectors in total including agriculture mining process and manufacturing venous industry household consumption construction and transportation shown in table 1 in this study we use material flow accounting to calculate flows among sectors within the system during the urban metabolism process material accounting items included mineral exploitation biomass exploitation energy exploitation and consumption industrial product exploitation and consumption household consumption water supply and use waste treatment and emission product import and export and balance items we analyzed the urban metabolism process in six years 2000 2003 2006 2009 2012 and 2015 drawing the original data mainly from wuxi statistic yearbooks wbs 2001 2004 2007 2010 2013 2016 material items are shown in supplemental table s1 to facilitate the calculation the units of all data in this study were unified as million tons mt after data collection and conversion the final value of items could be obtained by calculation conversion factors are shown in supplemental table s2 because of the lack of data the amounts for imports and exports of sectors were mainly accounted for by the difference between the production consumption and stock of different products 2 2 ecological network modeling the first step in ecological network analysis is the construction of a conceptual network model in this study we regard the socioeconomic sectors involved in the metabolic process and the environment as nodes and the material flows among them as pathways hence refining the material flow process within the urban system fig 2 shows the network model of actual material delivery between sectors within the urban metabolic system of wuxi comprising 8 compartments and 30 direct pathways materials flows through the direct pathways are defined in supplemental table s3 and supplemental table s4 2 3 material flow network analysis based on the direct flow matrix we can obtain the integrated flow matrix of the urban metabolism system we define ti as the sum of material inputs into node i comprising flows from other nodes and from the boundary therefore it includes the sum of local material flow and imports into node i li et al 2012 as shown in eq 1 1 t i j 1 n f i j z i where ti is the total inflow of node i fij represents the material flow from node j to node i and zi refers to the imported material flow from the external zone into node i then using the ratio of material flow fij to the total flow into node i ti we can obtain the element g ij of the dimensionless material flow intensity matrix g li et al 2012 using eq 2 2 g i j f i j t i based on the direct flow intensity matrix g g ij the dimensionless integral flow intensity matrix n nij could be obtained using the following power series zhang et al 2011b 3 n n ij g 0 g 1 g 2 g 3 g m i g 1 where matrix n indicates the integral material flow between any of the nodes in the network n ij refers to the integral dimensionless value of g ij which is accounted for by using the inverse matrix and i is the identity matrix to be applicable for this method we must ensure that the series is convergent and confirm that this requirement is met for our available data using the method proposed by fath and patten 1999 the self feedback matrix g 0 reflects material flow that originates in and returns to a node g 1 reflects flow along one path between a pair of nodes i e a flow with a path length of 1 and g m represents flow along paths with a length of m m 2 between nodes hence multiplying n by the diagonal matrix of the total inflow ti diag t we can obtain the integrated flow matrix y as shown in eq 4 4 y d i a g t n the row vector y i y i1 y i2 y i3 y ij reflects the integrated energy flow from other nodes to node i and j 1 n y i j is the integrated energy flow that the entire system contributes to node i additionally we use j 1 n y i j as the weight of node i in the whole system expressed as w as shown in the following eq 5 5 w j 1 n y i j i 1 n j 1 n y i j w reflects the reaction of node i to the whole system and a greater value of w represents a greater impact of node i on the system s metabolic level 2 4 ecological relationship analysis network utility analysis which is one of the ecological network approaches was first proposed by patten 1991 to identify the ecological role of one city or sector during the material flow process zhang et al 2013 used specific cases to describe how utility analysis can be used in network environments the direct utility matrix d can be calculated by using the flow matrix and the element dij refers to the effective utilization of flows between nodes i e the benefit of the flow from node j to i as shown in eq 6 6 d i j f i j f j i t i based on the matrix d dij a dimensionless integral utility intensity matrix u can be obtained from the following convergent power series eq 7 the matrix u represents the net utility between any pair of nodes within the whole network and reflects the intensity and pattern of the system to use materials through multiple pathways fath and patten 1999 7 u u ij d 0 d 1 d 2 d 3 d m i d 1 where uij refers to the integral dimensionless value of di which is computed by a leontief inverse matrix i is an identity matrix the matrix d 0 reflects self feedback of flows through each node d 1 reflects the intensity and pattern of a direct relationship between a pair of nodes in the network and d m represents the interaction between two nodes with a pathway length of m m 2 we designate the sign of an element in the matrix u uij as the relationship utility sign matrix sgn u with su ij as the element in the matrix fath 2004 the matrix sgn u reveals the natural relationship and interaction between two nodes if su ij su ji node i exploits node j i e node i receives more utility than it transfers to node j as the predator in a natural system by contrast if su ij su ji node i is exploited or controlled by node j similar to the prey in a natural system the exploitation and control relationships indicate a form of independence between components in the network if su ij su ji the relationship between two components can be described as competition and it leads to negative effects for both however if su ij su ji there is a mutualism between the two nodes and both can benefit from this relationship additionally if su ij su ji 0 0 the two components have no interactions or relationship since all nodes can indirectly connect with other nodes in a network the situation of su ij su ji 0 0 is not considered in our research the amplitude of variations in ecological relationships between two nodes within the system can be judged by the parameter called the stability degree n 12 n i t where i refers to the number of year in the research period when the ecological relationship between nodes does not change and t refers to the total number of study year in this research the quantitative standard for the stability degree is shown in table 2 3 results 3 1 material flow processes analysis 3 1 1 trends in integrated material flows integrated material flows among sectors within the urban system of wuxi changed dramatically from 2000 to 2015 shown in fig 3 the most remarkable increases of material exchange during the study period were outflows from environment e to the sectors of transportation t household consumption h and mining mi standing originally at 717 9 mt in 2000 the quantity of material flows between environment e and household consumption h continued to show an upward trend reaching its highest point at 974 6 mt in 2015 the integrated flow between transportation t and environment e in 2000 was 563 8 mt which increased by 54 5 over 15 years in addition the integrated flow from environment e to mining mi climbed to 3 4 times the value in 2000 136 3 mt in contrast agriculture a mining mi and construction c had relatively small flow exchanges with other sectors less than 10 0 mt in both years from the perspective of total sectoral material inputs environment e was the largest material receiver within wuxi s metabolic network in 2015 the amount of integrated material flow imported by environment e was 588 9 mt accounting for only 41 7 of the value in 2000 this result showed that emissions from socioeconomic sectors to the environment in wuxi s urban system had decreased during the past 16 years the second receiver was household consumption h whose input increased by 8 6 to 1640 8 mt in 2015 in 2015 the top three suppliers were environment i 59 4 manufacturing ma 13 9 and venous industry r 9 2 in addition the value of material input by venous industry v and transportation t remained stable 1212 3 mt and 1364 6 mt in 2015 respectively in terms of total sectoral material outputs environment e also acted as the largest contributor the total amount of integrated flows exported by environment e in 2000 3272 9 mt occupied 96 6 in 2015 which indicated that the demand for resource supply in the system increased relatively following environment e closely the export of manufacturing ma showed a downtrend decreasing by 35 5 from 2000 1519 0 mt during the study period the largest receivers of flows from manufacturing ma were venous industry v household consumption h and environment e which accounted for 17 8 15 1 and 14 2 respectively transportation t is the fastest growing sector of material output and the value in 2015 was 244 2 mt which climbed by 2 3 times compared to 2000 the significant growth of transportation s material outputs marked the rapid buildup of wuxi s transport development level in contrast agriculture a is the sector with the fastest material output decline in the urban system decreasing to 66 9 of the original value 143 4 mt after 15 years the decline of agricultural output demonstrated that agricultural production is gradually weakening in the urban metabolic system which is also an inevitable phenomenon in the urbanization process 3 1 2 structure of integrated material flows during the study period the annual sectoral weights fig 4 a in wuxi s urban system changed slightly which indicated that wuxi s industrial structure and development were relatively stable environment e and household consumption h occupied the largest weights which remained stable during the study period weights of environment e and household consumption h increased by 2 5 and 1 9 respectively in 2015 compared with 2000 mining mi manufacturing ma and construction c were sectors with relatively obvious change in weights among them the weight of mining mi climbed by 5 1 during the study period which demonstrated the buildup of the development scale of the mining industry in wuxi by contrast weights of the manufacturing ma and construction c were reduced falling by 4 4 and 2 7 respectively obviously wuxi s industrial development and urban construction lagged behind the overall level of the urban metabolism and their driving effects on urban development had gradually decreased the changes of the remaining sectors weights were relatively slight less than 2 0 the average sectoral weights for wuxi s metabolic network from 2000 to 2015 are shown in fig 4 b the ranking of sectoral weights is as follows i 20 9 d 20 0 t 16 6 r 15 5 a 10 4 p 7 5 m 5 2 c 3 9 as the producer in the system environment e contributed the largest material flow during the metabolic process which indicated that natural resources played a prominent role in wuxi s urban metabolism at the same time as consumers household consumption h and transportation t also had significant influences on the urban system with weights approximating 40 0 this finding shows that the living standard of local inhabitants and the transportation development level in wuxi rapidly improved additionally as the key point in promoting recycling in urban material metabolism the importance of venous industry v cannot be neglected the above three sectors accounted for similar weights which indicated the close relationships among them however as the traditionally important sector in an urban system manufacturing ma had a limited influence on wuxi s material metabolism based on this phenomenon it can be speculated that manufacturing ma was more dependent on the external zone 3 2 trends in ecological relationships among sectors our research revealed a total of 28 pairs of relationships including mutualism competition exploitation and control in wuxi s urban metabolic system the variations of single ecological relationship among sectors during the study period were obtained by analyzing the utility intensity matrix supplemental table s9 and the sectoral sign matrix supplemental table s10 3 2 1 mutualism relationship analysis the overall changes of mutualism relationships between two sectors during the period from 2000 to 2015 are shown in table 3 during the study period there were 11 pairs of mutualism relationships in the urban system among them the number of mutualism relationships related to agriculture a and transportation t was the largest 4 pairs respectively which reflected their contributions to the overall metabolic system s synergism level four stable mutualism relationships emerged in the past 16 years supi suip sura suar surm sumr sutm sumt the result adequately reflects the sustained and stable mutualism relationships between environment e and manufacturing ma between agriculture a and recycling v between mining mi and recycling v and between transportation t and mining e supi suip demonstrated the essential role of environment e and transportation t in the system environment e acted as the system s producer which provided the primary material basis for urban metabolism whereas transportation t mainly acted as the superior consumer and discharged pollutants and waste into the environment the above two sectors had material exchanges but also resource competition by contrast sura suar surm sumr sutm sumt shows mutualism relationships embodied between sectors that had no direct material exchanges between agriculture a and venous industry v venous industry v and mining mi and mining mi and transportation t the above sectors played predominant roles in the urban system agriculture a and mining mi provided support for resource and energy exploitation venous industry v benefited waste treatment and reuse and as the senior consumer transportation t had no conflicts with other sectors within the system additionally construction and mining transportation and agriculture and transportation and construction maintained stable mutualism relationships in five years the stability degree e equals 0 8 this indicates that mutualism is the dominant relationship between these three pairs of sectors further revealing the positive relationships between sectors within wuxi s urban system 3 2 2 competition relationship analysis table 4 shows the overall variations of competition relationships between two sectors during the period from 2000 to 2015 during the study period there were 10 pairs of competition relationships in the urban system three stable competition relationships appeared within the system during 2000 and 2015 suma suam sucr surc sutr surt according to the results the compartment pairs of agriculture a and mining mi construction c and recycling v and recycling v and transportation t maintained stable and continuous competition relationships in the study period situated in the first class of the material consumer hierarchy within the system agriculture a and mining mi had fierce conflict for resource acquisition as a result they cannot easily reach mutualism a sustained competition relationship also existed between construction c and venous industry v venous industry v promoted waste materials reuse and recycling which enabled materials to reenter the metabolic system while construction c facilitated the conversion of the flowing materials into stocks and these materials would no longer participate in the material flow processes the system functions contradiction made it impossible for these two sectors to truly realize mutualism additionally this result also illustrates that the contact between the two sectors was not close enough waste generated by construction c was not effectively treated and recycled by recycling processing v similarly a stable competition relationship also existed between transportation t and recycling processing v the above phenomena show that the maturation level of wuxi s venous industry still needs to be enhanced competition between household consumption h and manufacturing ma occurred in five years n 0 8 indicating that competition was the dominant relationship between these sectors this phenomenon shows that the above two sectors formed a competition relationship for resources instead of a healthy material supply relationship the overwhelming majority of goods consumed by urban residents were imported from the external zone and local industry cannot meet the increasing demand brought by the population growth from the perspective of sustainable development the result also indicates that population growth exceeded the development level of industrialization within the urban system a situation about which policy makers need to be vigilant 3 2 3 exploitation and control relationship analysis the changes of exploitation and control relationships within the system in the period from 2000 to 2015 are shown in table 5 since they are reciprocal relationships we combine them and use only exploitation in our study for the convenience of expression among 28 pairs of relationships 20 belonged to exploitation 71 4 which indicated that exploitation and control relationships were the predominant relationship in the system exploitation describes the effectiveness of the material flows from the upstream sectors to downstream sectors when material exchanges between two sectors comprise energy resources or product this relationship is true exploitation however when the exchanges mainly contain waste or pollutants this relationship is similar to recycling which supports metabolism li et al 2012 the results show that 8 pairs of stable exploitation relationships existed in the study among them suai suia sumi suim illustrates that located on the bottom of the consumer hierarchy both agriculture a and mining mi mainly obtained resources from the environment within the system surp supr surd sudr indicates that a vast majority of materials used by venous industry v came from manufacturing ma and household consumption h and the latter two sectors were the main sources of waste and pollutants in cities suir suri shows that after the waste treatment by venous industry v the remaining materials that could not be removed or reused were discharged into the environment sucp supc demonstrates that the industrial products and non metallic minerals consumed by construction c originated from indigenous manufacturing industries suit suti shows that transportation t created great amounts of emissions to the environment suci suic demonstrates that construction c consumed a certain amount of natural resources from the environment e regardless of the absence of direct pathways additionally in the remaining 13 pairs of relationships the relationships between agriculture a and manufacturing ma between mining mi and household consumption h between manufacturing ma or transportation t between household consumption h and construction c and between household consumption h and transportation t can be considered exploitation i 0 7 agriculture a and transportation t largely depended on the industrial products of manufacturing ma in addition the other three pairs which had no direct connections contributed to indirect material exchanges and consumption during the whole metabolic process 3 3 system structure variations distributions of annual ecological relationships between compartments within the system in the period of our study are shown in table 6 overall exploitation is the predominant relationship of the urban system accounting for approximately 51 0 ranging from 46 4 to 57 1 which is similar to the results in the research on beijing s industrial sectors ranging from 47 0 to 53 0 zhang et al 2014b the percentage of mutualism occupied approximately 27 0 ranging from 25 0 to 32 1 followed closely by competition relationship which maintained approximately 21 during the study period ranging from 17 9 to 25 0 the distributions of each sector s dominant relationship within wuxi s urban system in the past 16 years are summarized in table 7 the hierarchy of ecological relationships within the urban system was exploitation and control mutualism competition exploitation and control are the dominant relationships within the whole system which is also the direct presentation of the connections among departments within the system during the study period the ecological relationship of mining and transportation was consistently dominated by a single relationship mining represented self mutualism relationships except in 2000 exploitation while transportation was dominated by competition except in 2012 mutualism and competition and 2015 mutualism in contrast the sectors of environment and venous industry were controlled by more than one relationship environment was mainly dominated by both mutualism relationships and competition relationships except in 2000 and 2003 exploitation while venous industry was represented a mixture of three relationships including mutualism competition and exploitation except in 2000 mutualism and competition although the predominant relationships of the remaining sectors during the study period presented different forms of change the proportion of mutualism relationships within the urban system continued a gradual upward trend 4 discussion in this study combining material flow accounting with ecological network analysis we calculated the material consumption and exchanges within the urban metabolic system of wuxi and identified the mechanisms of the material flow process at the same time through comparison of the variations of sectoral ecological relationships we detailed the characteristics of the structure and the connection of components within the system this study provided scientific guidance for structural adjustment and resource conservation in the city of wuxi according to the results of integrated material flows and weight distributions in wuxi the inner structure and function within the metabolic system were relatively stable based on the variation of sectoral material inflows during the study period material flows imported by the agriculture and manufacturing decreased dramatically by 25 9 and 41 6 respectively the value of transportation and household consumption continued to exhibit a downward trend by 8 6 and 20 5 respectively this is probably caused by the urbanization movement of wuxi as the first and second industries kept decreasing their percentage in consuming materials while the tertiary industries rose dramatically it is widely known that beijing is a typical mature urban system in china and the number of researches of beijing based on ecological analysis is relatively large therefore we mainly compare our results with that in beijing the development of the metabolic process in wuxi was similar to the variation trend in beijing zhang et al 2013 found that the percentages of the amount of materials inputted by agriculture and manufacturing in beijing decreased by 31 5 and 43 3 respectively during the period from 1998 to 2007 therefore it is obvious that the influences of traditional primary and secondary industries which are represented by agriculture and manufacturing respectively on the urbanization process have gradually weakened by contrast the weights of agriculture and mining which were the primary sectors for material supply in the city did not have an appreciable impact on the whole metabolic system this also indirectly illustrates the city of wuxi was largely independent on the external zone according to the variations of the annual average weights and the total average weights the household consumption was still the sector occupying the largest weight within the system obviously during the urbanization process of wuxi population is one of the key factors that determine the direction and situation of the city s future development nevertheless the percentages of agriculture and mining accounted for less than 2 which had a slight impact on the whole metabolism process and this is similar to the results of zhang et al 2014b our research shows that the change of venous industry v maintained within a narrow range less than 2 which is different from the change trend in beijing zhang et al 2013 found that the weight of beijing s venous industry continued a rapid upward trend increasing by 26 9 from 1998 to 2007 as the key point in promoting recycling in urban material metabolism the promoting effect of venous industry v in terms of the material flow and recycling process cannot be neglected this also indicates that the degree of material recycling and reusing in wuxi was lower than that in beijing and it should be enhanced in the future additionally by comparing the research data from zhang et al 2013 we found weights of manufacturing ma in both wuxi and beijing experienced an apparent decline 4 4 and 7 0 respectively which illustrates that the status of processing and industry in the urban system gradually weakened with the city s development however weights of mining mi in both cities increased during the past 10 years by 5 1 and 0 30 respectively indicating cities are still dependent on the exploitation of indigenous resources compared with beijing mutualism relationship percentage of the whole system less than 20 0 the situation of mutualistic symbiosis among compartments in wuxi ranging from 25 0 to 32 1 was better than that in beijing therefore these studies show that exploitation and control relationships still maintain the predominant position during current urbanization processes in china mutualism relationship is the significant signal of the metabolic system s symbiotic degree the percentage of mutualism relationships among sectors within urban systems was relatively low which needs to be enhanced in the next decades differences of ecological relationship distributions between wuxi and beijing zhang et al 2014b li et al 2012 are highlighted during the urbanization processes the relationships among compartments within beijing s urban system remained stable and constant beijing s construction and household consumption were represented by a constant mutualism relationship while the predominant relationships of above sectors in wuxi changes dramatically during the study period additionally the manufacturing sector in beijing was dominated by both exploitation and competition whereas in our research the controlling relationship of this sector in wuxi changed significantly it is obvious that wuxi s manufacturing plays a positive role in promoting the urban material metabolism furthermore mining sector in both cities was dominated by mutualism relationship in terms of the ecological relationship distributions the mutualism relationship was extensively distributed among various sectors while the stable mutualism relationship was primarily concentrated between the environment and manufacturing between venous industry and agriculture or mining and between mining and transportation this phenomenon fully reflects that within the urban system the environment acted as the component of resource supply agriculture and mining acted as the components of resource exploitation and venous industry acted as the component of resource recycling the above sectors have significant impacts on the resource sustainable development of cities therefore in wuxi s future development policymakers should pay attention to the pattern and structure of sectorial resource utilization to improve the efficiency of resource use meanwhile the sharing exchange and recycling of resources among compartments as well as the absorption and treatment of waste and pollutants should also be strengthened to further improve the metabolic level of the whole city in fact sectorial relationship in urban cities did not have constant good or bad assessment criterion in different urban development stage the relation between the same sectors may present totally different hence related policies on material utilization may be formulated correspondingly to keep urban developing always in the most suitable pattern 5 conclusion this study analyzed the material metabolic process in the city of wuxi from the concept of urban metabolism combining material flow accounting with ecological network analysis we identified key nodes and pathways during the material flow process we also examined the system s resource utilization situation by sectorial weights changes during the study period additionally the variation and distribution of ecological relationship among sectors were analyzed based on utility analysis the results of this research provide empirical support for the city s policy making to promote the resource sustainable development during the study period the environment was both the largest material flow contributor and receiver within wuxi s urban system the amount of inflows from the environment to the sectors of mining transportation and household consumption had the largest growth representing 3 36 1 55 and 1 36 times the original value respectively after 15 years the variation in sectoral weight distribution was not obvious among them environment household consumption and transportation were the top three compartments with the highest weight the weights of manufacturing and mining held the largest decrease 5 1 and increase 4 4 respectively on the whole the metabolic system was dominated by exploitation and control relationships followed by mutualism and competition most mutualism relationships were associated with agriculture or transportation competition was concentrated in agriculture household consumption and construction exploitation and control relationships were widely distributed within the system mostly related to the environment overall the system s mutualism relationships were not sufficient and policy makers should do more to improve wuxi s synergism level in the future appendix a supplementary data supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online

25374,cities are considered to be major consumers of natural resources creating global resource shortages and environmental challenges therefore understanding the mechanism of material metabolism is crucial for modern cities sustainable development here we took the city of wuxi as an example first constructing a network composed of 8 components combining material accounting and ecological network analysis we analyzed the integrated flow process and components weight distributions for 6 years additionally relationships among components were identified to examine the synergism level of the metabolic system our results indicate that wuxi s urban system was dependent on its environment and the integrated material inflow of transportation household consumption and mining increased to 1 55 1 36 and 3 36 respectively during the study period environment and household consumption accounted for the largest sectoral weights 20 9 and 20 0 respectively while that of manufacturing and mining changed significantly by 5 1 and 4 4 respectively within the system the environment supplied resources agriculture and mining utilized renewable resources venous industry promoted resource recycling mutualism relationships were mainly related to these sectors however exploitation and control were the dominant relationships in wuxi and the whole system s synergism level still needed to be improved this study provides a scientific guidance for the future structural adjustment and resource utilization for wuxi and the similar medium sized cities with rapid economic development in china keywords urban metabolism material accounting ecological networks relationship analysis china 1 introduction rapid economic globalization and information technology development have effectively promoted the process of urbanization currently approximately 3 9 billion people live in cities worldwide comprising 54 of the world s population according to the un 2014 by 2050 the proportion of urban population is projected to increase to 66 with another 2 5 billion people moving to urban settlements mainly in developing countries as a result the large urban population leads to massive resource and energy consumption for example every year approximately 67 of the world s total energy is consumed in cities worldwide resulting in more than 70 of global greenhouse gas emissions united nations institute 2015 facing such a challenging and pressing situation how to effectively allocate limited resources in urban areas and to promote sustainable urban development has aroused extensive attention therefore researchers have introduced the concept of urban metabolism to investigate the whole process of resource and energy exploitation processing consumption and recycling within the urban system to find approaches to realize sustainable development the concept of urban metabolism was first put forward by wolman in 1965 he compared cities to a complete ecosystem and proposed urban metabolism as the whole process by which resources and energy enter and products and waste leave the urban system materials including food fuels products water waste and other natural resources eurostat 2013 2016 hendrils et al 2000 barles 2009a 2009b are crucial elements in the urban system that maintain the normal operation and sustainable development of cities liang and zhang 2011 graedel et al 2015 wiedmann et al 2015 krausmann et al 2017 therefore material flows among components within the urban system and between the system and external zones are the focus of urban metabolism material flow analysis is an important research method to study the urban material metabolism process and to reveal its mechanism kennedy et al 2015 many scholars have implemented a wide range of research on cities of various sizes based on this concept including cities such as hong kong taipei huang 1998 newcombe et al 1978 sydney newman 1999 vienna hendrils et al 2000 toronto sahely et al 2003 forkes 2007 los angeles ngo and pataki 2008 paris barles 2009a b 2010 taipei huang and chen 2009 lisbon niza et al 2009 rosado et al 2014 london walker et al 2014 horta and keirstead 2016 suzhou liang and zhang 2011 and beijing zhang et al 2013 2014a 2014b previous studies have normally paid more attention to external characteristics of the whole urban system wolman 1965 newman 1999 warren rhodes and koenig 2001 codoban and kennedy 2008 browne et al 2009 such as the total input or output flows while neglecting sectoral flows and sectoral ecological correlations within the system in addition although material exchange and consumption through direct pathways have been analyzed in many studies the material flows embodied in indirect pathways are often omitted thus the indirect material metabolism within cities which accounts for a significant proportion in the whole process of urban metabolism is ignored therefore in recent years some researchers have begun to focus on the above gaps in urban material metabolism studies by using ecological network analysis zhang et al 2011b 2013 2014a 2014b 2015 zhang et al 2011a li et al 2012 chen and chen 2012 2015 ecological network analysis compares a city as a network comprising nodes and pathways and imitates the flows of materials and energy within the network fath and patten 1999 from the perspective of networks they have tried to quantify integrated material flows embodied in direct pathways and to identify key nodes and pathways in urban metabolism thereby revealing urban systems structures and functions fath and patten 1999 fath 2004 fath and killian 2007 at the same time the ecological network model can also solve the problem that the traditional black box model cannot explore the internal characteristics of a system in urban metabolism studies the structure and functional characteristics of an urban metabolic system can be examined by relationship analysis based on it the mechanism of interactions between different sectors can be revealed and in turn reflect the characteristics of the whole system for example zhang et al 2014b focused on the material metabolic process and did a control analysis of eight components in beijing zhang et al 2015 analyzed the complex relations among fifteen sectors in jing jin ji energy agglomeration this method can help to understand relationships among compartments within urban systems further promoting the effective structural planning and sustainable development of cities the rapid buildup of china s economy has stimulated the development of chinese cities at present most completed studies on the urban material metabolism in china based on ecological network analysis mainly concentrate on the area of beijing revealing the relationships among compartments within the urban system liu et al 2011 and li et al 2012 examined beijing s sectoral ecological relationship and system structure zhang et al 2013 investigated the structure of beijing s metabolic system using four indices metabolic scale intensity efficiency and impact zhang et al 2014a examined the synergism level of beijing s 7 sectors and zhang et al 2014b constructed a 32 compartment model and analyzed the ecological relationships and hierarchy combining input output analysis currently the number of studies on material metabolism in other typical chinese cities is relatively low and existing research areas mainly concentrate on beijing and its surrounding regions at present despite of china s rapid economic growth the development of different areas still exist displays an unbalanced trend in particular the socioeconomic development level of the coastal areas including the yangtze river delta the pearl river delta and the bohai rim is higher than the national average accelerating the urbanization process in these areas wuxi in jiangsu province of china and the hinterland of the yangtze river delta is a typical medium sized coastal city fig 1 it has a land area of approximately 4627km2 and a population of 479 million wbs 2016 in 2013 the urbanization rate of wuxi increased to 73 7 reaching a steady development period among china s administrative prefecture level cities wuxi ranked 14 in gross domestic product gdp approximately 921 billion yuan in 2016 wuxi is a well known manufacturing center in china s jiangsu province having mature industries like textile and machinery manufacturing therefore exploring the material metabolism process of wuxi has significance for urban sustainability of medium sized cities with rapid economic development in the developing countries here we took wuxi as an empirical example to explore its urban material metabolism process we first constructed a network model comprising 8 compartments and pathways among them within the urban system next by combining material flow accounting and network flow analysis we examined the variations of integrated flows and weight distributions in 6 years 2000 2003 2006 2009 2012 and 2015 thus we identified the key nodes and pathways in the metabolic network through controlling and adjusting above key points this research supports for the resource utilization optimization and waste reduction finally we analyzed the changes of ecological relationship mutualism competition exploitation and control distributions to regulate the system s synergism level this study can provide reliable evidence for policy makers to identify the metabolic system s structure and characteristics and to further alleviate disorder and resource waste in cities 2 methodology 2 1 system boundary and data acquisition the study boundary in this research is the whole urban system of wuxi including all the socioeconomic sectors involved in the process of urban material metabolism and the urban system s internal and external zone based on available data we divide wuxi s industries into 7 sectors in total including agriculture mining process and manufacturing venous industry household consumption construction and transportation shown in table 1 in this study we use material flow accounting to calculate flows among sectors within the system during the urban metabolism process material accounting items included mineral exploitation biomass exploitation energy exploitation and consumption industrial product exploitation and consumption household consumption water supply and use waste treatment and emission product import and export and balance items we analyzed the urban metabolism process in six years 2000 2003 2006 2009 2012 and 2015 drawing the original data mainly from wuxi statistic yearbooks wbs 2001 2004 2007 2010 2013 2016 material items are shown in supplemental table s1 to facilitate the calculation the units of all data in this study were unified as million tons mt after data collection and conversion the final value of items could be obtained by calculation conversion factors are shown in supplemental table s2 because of the lack of data the amounts for imports and exports of sectors were mainly accounted for by the difference between the production consumption and stock of different products 2 2 ecological network modeling the first step in ecological network analysis is the construction of a conceptual network model in this study we regard the socioeconomic sectors involved in the metabolic process and the environment as nodes and the material flows among them as pathways hence refining the material flow process within the urban system fig 2 shows the network model of actual material delivery between sectors within the urban metabolic system of wuxi comprising 8 compartments and 30 direct pathways materials flows through the direct pathways are defined in supplemental table s3 and supplemental table s4 2 3 material flow network analysis based on the direct flow matrix we can obtain the integrated flow matrix of the urban metabolism system we define ti as the sum of material inputs into node i comprising flows from other nodes and from the boundary therefore it includes the sum of local material flow and imports into node i li et al 2012 as shown in eq 1 1 t i j 1 n f i j z i where ti is the total inflow of node i fij represents the material flow from node j to node i and zi refers to the imported material flow from the external zone into node i then using the ratio of material flow fij to the total flow into node i ti we can obtain the element g ij of the dimensionless material flow intensity matrix g li et al 2012 using eq 2 2 g i j f i j t i based on the direct flow intensity matrix g g ij the dimensionless integral flow intensity matrix n nij could be obtained using the following power series zhang et al 2011b 3 n n ij g 0 g 1 g 2 g 3 g m i g 1 where matrix n indicates the integral material flow between any of the nodes in the network n ij refers to the integral dimensionless value of g ij which is accounted for by using the inverse matrix and i is the identity matrix to be applicable for this method we must ensure that the series is convergent and confirm that this requirement is met for our available data using the method proposed by fath and patten 1999 the self feedback matrix g 0 reflects material flow that originates in and returns to a node g 1 reflects flow along one path between a pair of nodes i e a flow with a path length of 1 and g m represents flow along paths with a length of m m 2 between nodes hence multiplying n by the diagonal matrix of the total inflow ti diag t we can obtain the integrated flow matrix y as shown in eq 4 4 y d i a g t n the row vector y i y i1 y i2 y i3 y ij reflects the integrated energy flow from other nodes to node i and j 1 n y i j is the integrated energy flow that the entire system contributes to node i additionally we use j 1 n y i j as the weight of node i in the whole system expressed as w as shown in the following eq 5 5 w j 1 n y i j i 1 n j 1 n y i j w reflects the reaction of node i to the whole system and a greater value of w represents a greater impact of node i on the system s metabolic level 2 4 ecological relationship analysis network utility analysis which is one of the ecological network approaches was first proposed by patten 1991 to identify the ecological role of one city or sector during the material flow process zhang et al 2013 used specific cases to describe how utility analysis can be used in network environments the direct utility matrix d can be calculated by using the flow matrix and the element dij refers to the effective utilization of flows between nodes i e the benefit of the flow from node j to i as shown in eq 6 6 d i j f i j f j i t i based on the matrix d dij a dimensionless integral utility intensity matrix u can be obtained from the following convergent power series eq 7 the matrix u represents the net utility between any pair of nodes within the whole network and reflects the intensity and pattern of the system to use materials through multiple pathways fath and patten 1999 7 u u ij d 0 d 1 d 2 d 3 d m i d 1 where uij refers to the integral dimensionless value of di which is computed by a leontief inverse matrix i is an identity matrix the matrix d 0 reflects self feedback of flows through each node d 1 reflects the intensity and pattern of a direct relationship between a pair of nodes in the network and d m represents the interaction between two nodes with a pathway length of m m 2 we designate the sign of an element in the matrix u uij as the relationship utility sign matrix sgn u with su ij as the element in the matrix fath 2004 the matrix sgn u reveals the natural relationship and interaction between two nodes if su ij su ji node i exploits node j i e node i receives more utility than it transfers to node j as the predator in a natural system by contrast if su ij su ji node i is exploited or controlled by node j similar to the prey in a natural system the exploitation and control relationships indicate a form of independence between components in the network if su ij su ji the relationship between two components can be described as competition and it leads to negative effects for both however if su ij su ji there is a mutualism between the two nodes and both can benefit from this relationship additionally if su ij su ji 0 0 the two components have no interactions or relationship since all nodes can indirectly connect with other nodes in a network the situation of su ij su ji 0 0 is not considered in our research the amplitude of variations in ecological relationships between two nodes within the system can be judged by the parameter called the stability degree n 12 n i t where i refers to the number of year in the research period when the ecological relationship between nodes does not change and t refers to the total number of study year in this research the quantitative standard for the stability degree is shown in table 2 3 results 3 1 material flow processes analysis 3 1 1 trends in integrated material flows integrated material flows among sectors within the urban system of wuxi changed dramatically from 2000 to 2015 shown in fig 3 the most remarkable increases of material exchange during the study period were outflows from environment e to the sectors of transportation t household consumption h and mining mi standing originally at 717 9 mt in 2000 the quantity of material flows between environment e and household consumption h continued to show an upward trend reaching its highest point at 974 6 mt in 2015 the integrated flow between transportation t and environment e in 2000 was 563 8 mt which increased by 54 5 over 15 years in addition the integrated flow from environment e to mining mi climbed to 3 4 times the value in 2000 136 3 mt in contrast agriculture a mining mi and construction c had relatively small flow exchanges with other sectors less than 10 0 mt in both years from the perspective of total sectoral material inputs environment e was the largest material receiver within wuxi s metabolic network in 2015 the amount of integrated material flow imported by environment e was 588 9 mt accounting for only 41 7 of the value in 2000 this result showed that emissions from socioeconomic sectors to the environment in wuxi s urban system had decreased during the past 16 years the second receiver was household consumption h whose input increased by 8 6 to 1640 8 mt in 2015 in 2015 the top three suppliers were environment i 59 4 manufacturing ma 13 9 and venous industry r 9 2 in addition the value of material input by venous industry v and transportation t remained stable 1212 3 mt and 1364 6 mt in 2015 respectively in terms of total sectoral material outputs environment e also acted as the largest contributor the total amount of integrated flows exported by environment e in 2000 3272 9 mt occupied 96 6 in 2015 which indicated that the demand for resource supply in the system increased relatively following environment e closely the export of manufacturing ma showed a downtrend decreasing by 35 5 from 2000 1519 0 mt during the study period the largest receivers of flows from manufacturing ma were venous industry v household consumption h and environment e which accounted for 17 8 15 1 and 14 2 respectively transportation t is the fastest growing sector of material output and the value in 2015 was 244 2 mt which climbed by 2 3 times compared to 2000 the significant growth of transportation s material outputs marked the rapid buildup of wuxi s transport development level in contrast agriculture a is the sector with the fastest material output decline in the urban system decreasing to 66 9 of the original value 143 4 mt after 15 years the decline of agricultural output demonstrated that agricultural production is gradually weakening in the urban metabolic system which is also an inevitable phenomenon in the urbanization process 3 1 2 structure of integrated material flows during the study period the annual sectoral weights fig 4 a in wuxi s urban system changed slightly which indicated that wuxi s industrial structure and development were relatively stable environment e and household consumption h occupied the largest weights which remained stable during the study period weights of environment e and household consumption h increased by 2 5 and 1 9 respectively in 2015 compared with 2000 mining mi manufacturing ma and construction c were sectors with relatively obvious change in weights among them the weight of mining mi climbed by 5 1 during the study period which demonstrated the buildup of the development scale of the mining industry in wuxi by contrast weights of the manufacturing ma and construction c were reduced falling by 4 4 and 2 7 respectively obviously wuxi s industrial development and urban construction lagged behind the overall level of the urban metabolism and their driving effects on urban development had gradually decreased the changes of the remaining sectors weights were relatively slight less than 2 0 the average sectoral weights for wuxi s metabolic network from 2000 to 2015 are shown in fig 4 b the ranking of sectoral weights is as follows i 20 9 d 20 0 t 16 6 r 15 5 a 10 4 p 7 5 m 5 2 c 3 9 as the producer in the system environment e contributed the largest material flow during the metabolic process which indicated that natural resources played a prominent role in wuxi s urban metabolism at the same time as consumers household consumption h and transportation t also had significant influences on the urban system with weights approximating 40 0 this finding shows that the living standard of local inhabitants and the transportation development level in wuxi rapidly improved additionally as the key point in promoting recycling in urban material metabolism the importance of venous industry v cannot be neglected the above three sectors accounted for similar weights which indicated the close relationships among them however as the traditionally important sector in an urban system manufacturing ma had a limited influence on wuxi s material metabolism based on this phenomenon it can be speculated that manufacturing ma was more dependent on the external zone 3 2 trends in ecological relationships among sectors our research revealed a total of 28 pairs of relationships including mutualism competition exploitation and control in wuxi s urban metabolic system the variations of single ecological relationship among sectors during the study period were obtained by analyzing the utility intensity matrix supplemental table s9 and the sectoral sign matrix supplemental table s10 3 2 1 mutualism relationship analysis the overall changes of mutualism relationships between two sectors during the period from 2000 to 2015 are shown in table 3 during the study period there were 11 pairs of mutualism relationships in the urban system among them the number of mutualism relationships related to agriculture a and transportation t was the largest 4 pairs respectively which reflected their contributions to the overall metabolic system s synergism level four stable mutualism relationships emerged in the past 16 years supi suip sura suar surm sumr sutm sumt the result adequately reflects the sustained and stable mutualism relationships between environment e and manufacturing ma between agriculture a and recycling v between mining mi and recycling v and between transportation t and mining e supi suip demonstrated the essential role of environment e and transportation t in the system environment e acted as the system s producer which provided the primary material basis for urban metabolism whereas transportation t mainly acted as the superior consumer and discharged pollutants and waste into the environment the above two sectors had material exchanges but also resource competition by contrast sura suar surm sumr sutm sumt shows mutualism relationships embodied between sectors that had no direct material exchanges between agriculture a and venous industry v venous industry v and mining mi and mining mi and transportation t the above sectors played predominant roles in the urban system agriculture a and mining mi provided support for resource and energy exploitation venous industry v benefited waste treatment and reuse and as the senior consumer transportation t had no conflicts with other sectors within the system additionally construction and mining transportation and agriculture and transportation and construction maintained stable mutualism relationships in five years the stability degree e equals 0 8 this indicates that mutualism is the dominant relationship between these three pairs of sectors further revealing the positive relationships between sectors within wuxi s urban system 3 2 2 competition relationship analysis table 4 shows the overall variations of competition relationships between two sectors during the period from 2000 to 2015 during the study period there were 10 pairs of competition relationships in the urban system three stable competition relationships appeared within the system during 2000 and 2015 suma suam sucr surc sutr surt according to the results the compartment pairs of agriculture a and mining mi construction c and recycling v and recycling v and transportation t maintained stable and continuous competition relationships in the study period situated in the first class of the material consumer hierarchy within the system agriculture a and mining mi had fierce conflict for resource acquisition as a result they cannot easily reach mutualism a sustained competition relationship also existed between construction c and venous industry v venous industry v promoted waste materials reuse and recycling which enabled materials to reenter the metabolic system while construction c facilitated the conversion of the flowing materials into stocks and these materials would no longer participate in the material flow processes the system functions contradiction made it impossible for these two sectors to truly realize mutualism additionally this result also illustrates that the contact between the two sectors was not close enough waste generated by construction c was not effectively treated and recycled by recycling processing v similarly a stable competition relationship also existed between transportation t and recycling processing v the above phenomena show that the maturation level of wuxi s venous industry still needs to be enhanced competition between household consumption h and manufacturing ma occurred in five years n 0 8 indicating that competition was the dominant relationship between these sectors this phenomenon shows that the above two sectors formed a competition relationship for resources instead of a healthy material supply relationship the overwhelming majority of goods consumed by urban residents were imported from the external zone and local industry cannot meet the increasing demand brought by the population growth from the perspective of sustainable development the result also indicates that population growth exceeded the development level of industrialization within the urban system a situation about which policy makers need to be vigilant 3 2 3 exploitation and control relationship analysis the changes of exploitation and control relationships within the system in the period from 2000 to 2015 are shown in table 5 since they are reciprocal relationships we combine them and use only exploitation in our study for the convenience of expression among 28 pairs of relationships 20 belonged to exploitation 71 4 which indicated that exploitation and control relationships were the predominant relationship in the system exploitation describes the effectiveness of the material flows from the upstream sectors to downstream sectors when material exchanges between two sectors comprise energy resources or product this relationship is true exploitation however when the exchanges mainly contain waste or pollutants this relationship is similar to recycling which supports metabolism li et al 2012 the results show that 8 pairs of stable exploitation relationships existed in the study among them suai suia sumi suim illustrates that located on the bottom of the consumer hierarchy both agriculture a and mining mi mainly obtained resources from the environment within the system surp supr surd sudr indicates that a vast majority of materials used by venous industry v came from manufacturing ma and household consumption h and the latter two sectors were the main sources of waste and pollutants in cities suir suri shows that after the waste treatment by venous industry v the remaining materials that could not be removed or reused were discharged into the environment sucp supc demonstrates that the industrial products and non metallic minerals consumed by construction c originated from indigenous manufacturing industries suit suti shows that transportation t created great amounts of emissions to the environment suci suic demonstrates that construction c consumed a certain amount of natural resources from the environment e regardless of the absence of direct pathways additionally in the remaining 13 pairs of relationships the relationships between agriculture a and manufacturing ma between mining mi and household consumption h between manufacturing ma or transportation t between household consumption h and construction c and between household consumption h and transportation t can be considered exploitation i 0 7 agriculture a and transportation t largely depended on the industrial products of manufacturing ma in addition the other three pairs which had no direct connections contributed to indirect material exchanges and consumption during the whole metabolic process 3 3 system structure variations distributions of annual ecological relationships between compartments within the system in the period of our study are shown in table 6 overall exploitation is the predominant relationship of the urban system accounting for approximately 51 0 ranging from 46 4 to 57 1 which is similar to the results in the research on beijing s industrial sectors ranging from 47 0 to 53 0 zhang et al 2014b the percentage of mutualism occupied approximately 27 0 ranging from 25 0 to 32 1 followed closely by competition relationship which maintained approximately 21 during the study period ranging from 17 9 to 25 0 the distributions of each sector s dominant relationship within wuxi s urban system in the past 16 years are summarized in table 7 the hierarchy of ecological relationships within the urban system was exploitation and control mutualism competition exploitation and control are the dominant relationships within the whole system which is also the direct presentation of the connections among departments within the system during the study period the ecological relationship of mining and transportation was consistently dominated by a single relationship mining represented self mutualism relationships except in 2000 exploitation while transportation was dominated by competition except in 2012 mutualism and competition and 2015 mutualism in contrast the sectors of environment and venous industry were controlled by more than one relationship environment was mainly dominated by both mutualism relationships and competition relationships except in 2000 and 2003 exploitation while venous industry was represented a mixture of three relationships including mutualism competition and exploitation except in 2000 mutualism and competition although the predominant relationships of the remaining sectors during the study period presented different forms of change the proportion of mutualism relationships within the urban system continued a gradual upward trend 4 discussion in this study combining material flow accounting with ecological network analysis we calculated the material consumption and exchanges within the urban metabolic system of wuxi and identified the mechanisms of the material flow process at the same time through comparison of the variations of sectoral ecological relationships we detailed the characteristics of the structure and the connection of components within the system this study provided scientific guidance for structural adjustment and resource conservation in the city of wuxi according to the results of integrated material flows and weight distributions in wuxi the inner structure and function within the metabolic system were relatively stable based on the variation of sectoral material inflows during the study period material flows imported by the agriculture and manufacturing decreased dramatically by 25 9 and 41 6 respectively the value of transportation and household consumption continued to exhibit a downward trend by 8 6 and 20 5 respectively this is probably caused by the urbanization movement of wuxi as the first and second industries kept decreasing their percentage in consuming materials while the tertiary industries rose dramatically it is widely known that beijing is a typical mature urban system in china and the number of researches of beijing based on ecological analysis is relatively large therefore we mainly compare our results with that in beijing the development of the metabolic process in wuxi was similar to the variation trend in beijing zhang et al 2013 found that the percentages of the amount of materials inputted by agriculture and manufacturing in beijing decreased by 31 5 and 43 3 respectively during the period from 1998 to 2007 therefore it is obvious that the influences of traditional primary and secondary industries which are represented by agriculture and manufacturing respectively on the urbanization process have gradually weakened by contrast the weights of agriculture and mining which were the primary sectors for material supply in the city did not have an appreciable impact on the whole metabolic system this also indirectly illustrates the city of wuxi was largely independent on the external zone according to the variations of the annual average weights and the total average weights the household consumption was still the sector occupying the largest weight within the system obviously during the urbanization process of wuxi population is one of the key factors that determine the direction and situation of the city s future development nevertheless the percentages of agriculture and mining accounted for less than 2 which had a slight impact on the whole metabolism process and this is similar to the results of zhang et al 2014b our research shows that the change of venous industry v maintained within a narrow range less than 2 which is different from the change trend in beijing zhang et al 2013 found that the weight of beijing s venous industry continued a rapid upward trend increasing by 26 9 from 1998 to 2007 as the key point in promoting recycling in urban material metabolism the promoting effect of venous industry v in terms of the material flow and recycling process cannot be neglected this also indicates that the degree of material recycling and reusing in wuxi was lower than that in beijing and it should be enhanced in the future additionally by comparing the research data from zhang et al 2013 we found weights of manufacturing ma in both wuxi and beijing experienced an apparent decline 4 4 and 7 0 respectively which illustrates that the status of processing and industry in the urban system gradually weakened with the city s development however weights of mining mi in both cities increased during the past 10 years by 5 1 and 0 30 respectively indicating cities are still dependent on the exploitation of indigenous resources compared with beijing mutualism relationship percentage of the whole system less than 20 0 the situation of mutualistic symbiosis among compartments in wuxi ranging from 25 0 to 32 1 was better than that in beijing therefore these studies show that exploitation and control relationships still maintain the predominant position during current urbanization processes in china mutualism relationship is the significant signal of the metabolic system s symbiotic degree the percentage of mutualism relationships among sectors within urban systems was relatively low which needs to be enhanced in the next decades differences of ecological relationship distributions between wuxi and beijing zhang et al 2014b li et al 2012 are highlighted during the urbanization processes the relationships among compartments within beijing s urban system remained stable and constant beijing s construction and household consumption were represented by a constant mutualism relationship while the predominant relationships of above sectors in wuxi changes dramatically during the study period additionally the manufacturing sector in beijing was dominated by both exploitation and competition whereas in our research the controlling relationship of this sector in wuxi changed significantly it is obvious that wuxi s manufacturing plays a positive role in promoting the urban material metabolism furthermore mining sector in both cities was dominated by mutualism relationship in terms of the ecological relationship distributions the mutualism relationship was extensively distributed among various sectors while the stable mutualism relationship was primarily concentrated between the environment and manufacturing between venous industry and agriculture or mining and between mining and transportation this phenomenon fully reflects that within the urban system the environment acted as the component of resource supply agriculture and mining acted as the components of resource exploitation and venous industry acted as the component of resource recycling the above sectors have significant impacts on the resource sustainable development of cities therefore in wuxi s future development policymakers should pay attention to the pattern and structure of sectorial resource utilization to improve the efficiency of resource use meanwhile the sharing exchange and recycling of resources among compartments as well as the absorption and treatment of waste and pollutants should also be strengthened to further improve the metabolic level of the whole city in fact sectorial relationship in urban cities did not have constant good or bad assessment criterion in different urban development stage the relation between the same sectors may present totally different hence related policies on material utilization may be formulated correspondingly to keep urban developing always in the most suitable pattern 5 conclusion this study analyzed the material metabolic process in the city of wuxi from the concept of urban metabolism combining material flow accounting with ecological network analysis we identified key nodes and pathways during the material flow process we also examined the system s resource utilization situation by sectorial weights changes during the study period additionally the variation and distribution of ecological relationship among sectors were analyzed based on utility analysis the results of this research provide empirical support for the city s policy making to promote the resource sustainable development during the study period the environment was both the largest material flow contributor and receiver within wuxi s urban system the amount of inflows from the environment to the sectors of mining transportation and household consumption had the largest growth representing 3 36 1 55 and 1 36 times the original value respectively after 15 years the variation in sectoral weight distribution was not obvious among them environment household consumption and transportation were the top three compartments with the highest weight the weights of manufacturing and mining held the largest decrease 5 1 and increase 4 4 respectively on the whole the metabolic system was dominated by exploitation and control relationships followed by mutualism and competition most mutualism relationships were associated with agriculture or transportation competition was concentrated in agriculture household consumption and construction exploitation and control relationships were widely distributed within the system mostly related to the environment overall the system s mutualism relationships were not sufficient and policy makers should do more to improve wuxi s synergism level in the future appendix a supplementary data supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online
