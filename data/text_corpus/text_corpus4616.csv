23080,it was necessary to determine how to estimate the operational efficiency through an objective evaluation since a ship owner s interest was closely connected to the operating cost ship owners demanded that shipyards predicted the most efficient speed based on the evaluated operating cost by considering the hydrodynamic characteristics of a ship sea route environmental conditions including wind and waves equipment features including main engine and gcu fuel property and others in this paper we constructed a new approach to estimate the operating cost by developing direct cost evaluation in consideration of the requested factors as a result the observed slow steaming was investigated on the basis of the hydrodynamic characteristics of the vessel and the effect of the activated gcu on the operating cost could be analyzed finally a speed range within which slow steaming was effective was perceived and the most efficient speed was observed at the lowest speed of that range keywords direct cost evaluation hydrodynamic characteristics equipment operation slow steaming efficient speed 1 introduction as a consequence of high oil prices improvement of the operational efficiency of a ship has been regarded as the most important goal to be attained by international organizations shipping companies classification societies and shipbuilding companies imo has been reviewing regulations to increase the efficiency of a ship by applying eedi eeoi and seemp ball et al 2015 some classification societies and research institutes have been carrying out collaborative projects such as shopera to examine the applicability of the relevant regulations shipping companies have been installing commercial platforms developed by abb wartsila etc to improve the efficiency during a voyage monitor the sailing conditions of a vessel and confirm the navigation plan of their fleet shipyards have been struggling to meet the market demands for improved efficiency through new hull forms or new equipment on board each institution has been trying new attempts to achieve its particular goals from the shipyard s perspective it was preferentially necessary to determine how to estimate the operational efficiency through an objective evaluation since a ship owner s interest was closely connected to the operating cost in addition ship owners demanded that shipyards predicted the most efficient speed and suggested an example of schedule for their fleet based on the evaluated operating cost by considering the hydrodynamic characteristics of a ship sea route environmental conditions including wind and waves equipment features including main engine re liquefaction unit and gcu fuel property and others since there was a market trend to change fuel from hfo to lng fuel to reduce the operating cost and co2 nox and sox emission it was required to consider the effect of the fuel property on the operating cost however the requested scope was a kind of a macro level it was not focused on the tips to make a vessel efficient for a specific environmental conditions but on the macroscopic plan that a headquarter office gives an instruction schedule to the seafarers of their fleets like putting the puzzle making representative studies focusing on the operational efficiency are summarized as follows wang and meng 2012 researched the optimized speed of a ship in which the ship was operated by following a planned route with the minimum amount of fuel consumption within a pre determined time semolinos et al semolinos et al 2013 and simmer et al simmer et al 2015 compared the operating cost and the emission according to the fuel hfo and lng fuel of a vessel kowalski kowalski 2013 proposed to intuitively predict operating cost by combining the famed methodologies based on the suggested approach the effect of sailing speed on the operating cost could be investigated furthermore a trend of the operating cost according to the fuel price was disclosed however there was the limitation that the hydrodynamic characteristics of a ship under actual environmental conditions could not be considered since the operating cost was estimated by using a simple mathematical model you et al 2017a carried out a sailing simulation to predict the actual rpm and engine power by considering the resistance self propulsion maneuvering characteristics and sailing records including the sea route and speed obtained from the ais data they compared the predicted rpm and power with the measured values you et al 2018 developed the simulation by considering wind and waves sea route and the recorded speed obtained from the full scale measurement data they investigated the quantitative difference among the simulated values based on the ais data simulated values based on the full scale measurement data and the measured values you et al 2017b conducted a feasibility study to replace the full scale measurement data by combining the ais data and ecmwf database in order to overcome the circumstance that due to its security policy the full scale measurement data acquired by a shipping company was rarely shared with a shipyard they compared the predicted rpm and power based on the ais data and ecmwf database with those based on the full scale measurement data even if there was a quantitative difference between those values it could be perceived that the tendencies of the values were very similar the researches carried out by you et al 2017a 2017b 2018 could provide a clue to a researcher who tried to estimate the actual operating cost of a ship by considering the hydrodynamic characteristics of a ship sea route and environmental conditions from this motive the necessity to construct a direct cost evaluation procedure by considering the equipment such as the main engine gcu and fuel property was perceived in this paper the operating cost of a ship was estimated by developing direct cost evaluations based on the simulation proposed by you et al 2017a 2017b 2018 in consideration of the hydrodynamic characteristics sea route and environmental conditions in order to achieve this goal a 174k lngc constructed in dsme was chosen therefore the ship design information model test results and calculation results regarding the various hydrodynamic characteristics including the resistance self propulsion maneuvering and seakeeping performance could be considered with confidence a sea route used to evaluate the operating cost was obtained from the ais data that were recorded for an lngc that had actually been operated in the ocean the sea route that the ship sailed with the loaded condition from west africa to east asia was chosen the environmental data encountered during the actual operation were acquired through ecmwf database for the corresponding time and location obtained from the ais data equipment operation was additionally considered to make the evaluation realistic the main engine of me gi type fuel property and gcu were considered for the vessel the lngc has two me gi type main engines manufactured by man man dieselturbo 2017 the fuel properties were taken into consideration in the iso ambient condition based on the properties specified by iso iso 2010 since lng cargo handling scenario was reviewed for our relevant practical experience to be used for the understanding of the actual operation of an lngc a scenario for the fuel supply and combustion to consider characteristics of the lng cargo containment system including bog and bor was also constructed igu 2017 jeong 2013 the methods of determining an operational concept could differ according to the shipping company or shipyard since it was impossible to generalize all the scenarios applied to this field the scenario was simplified based on the practical experience of the lngc construction in dsme the operating cost due to fuel consumption was estimated by considering the lng fuel price and mgo price disclosed by ship bunker https shipandbunker com consequently the fuel consumption and operating cost could be directly estimated based on the constructed methodology simulations were repeatedly conducted to investigate the effect of the command speed and bor on the operating cost under the given sea route and the actual environmental conditions it was necessary to assume that the ship always sailed under identical environmental conditions so as not to confuse the effect of other parameters the predicted environmental conditions were regarded as fixed values according to the waypoints as a result it was possible to independently investigate the effect of the sailing speed on the operating cost in addition the effect of bor of the lng cargo tank on the operating cost was also investigated to take into account the latest types of cargo containment system from this research it was possible to directly estimate the operating cost by considering the hydrodynamic characteristics of the ship sea route environmental conditions equipment operation etc by following the objectively constructed procedure this research could be regarded as the extension of vision in shipbuilding and shipping field to consider the different issue on the same platform as summarized there had been a lot of researches for each topic regarding the operational performance of a ship and lng cargo containment system since they were conventional issues in shipbuilding and shipping companies however they had been separately dealt with by different research groups like the hydrodynamics and process engineering it could be anticipated that the acquired view of this research would helpful for ship owners to make an operating plan of their fleet by considering different knowledge together 2 mathematical model and simulation procedure fig 1 shows the coordinates of this sailing simulation since coordinates for the maneuvering equations of motion wind load coefficients wave drift forces and moment ais data and ecmwf database were acquired for different coordinates it was necessary to adjust the entire values for the same coordinates as shown in fig 1 the 174k lngc with twin screw that had been studied in previous research was also used you and choi 2017 the lngc was constructed as a membrane type in dsme fig 2 shows the vessel anchoring in an lng terminal table 1 shows the principal particulars representatively l p p is 284 5 m b is 48 4 m t is 11 7 m and c b is about 0 77 with the design condition 2 1 hydrodynamic loads due to hull rudders and propellers since the proposed sailing simulation concept you et al 2017a 2017b 2018 had been constructed by solving the maneuvering equations of motion it was needed beyond all to describe how to construct the equations eq 1 shows the maneuvering equations of motion eq 2 shows the forces and moment acting on the vessel the subscripts h p r wi and wa indicate the hydrodynamic loads due to the hull propellers rudders wind and waves respectively other external factors like current tide water depth and fouling were ignored 1 m u v r x g r 2 x m v u r x g r y i z z r m x g v r u n 2 x x h x p x r x w i x w a y y h y r y w i y w a n n h n p n r n w i n w a eqs 3 5 show how to predict the hydrodynamic loads of the hull propellers and rudders in detail most hydrodynamic coefficients such as the added mass added mass moment of inertia and rudder lift coefficients were predicted using the empirical formulae proposed by kijima et al 1990 and fujii and tsuda 1961 1962 the definitions of each hydrodynamic coefficient were identical with those used by kijima et al 1990 the coefficients for the resistance and thrust were obtained from the model tests conducted in a basin rudder lift coefficients were predicted by using the empirical formulae because full spade rudders were equipped in the vessel there was potential inaccuracy due to the hydrodynamic coefficients predicted from the empirical formulae developed for a single screw vessel although the exact characteristics of twin propellers and rudders could not be replicated it was possible to obtain physical insight from a qualitative point of view in addition the simulated maneuvering performance is compared with that of the free running model test results of the 174k lngc as shown in figs 3 and 4 you and choi 2017 you 2018 to reduce the potential risk of the mathematical model in terms of the accuracy fig 3 shows the 35 turning trajectories predicted from the simulation and those obtained from the free running model tests of the 174k lngc fig 4 shows the time series of the heading angle and turn rate predicted from the simulation of 10 10 zigzag test to the port side and those obtained from the free running model tests of the 174k lngc there are insignificant differences between the simulated results and the free running model test results from the comparisons consequently the mathematical model could be applied to the simulation of the maneuvering behavior of the 174k lngc 3 x h m x u m y x v r v r 1 2 ρ l p p t u 2 x u u cos 2 β y h m y v m x u r y h v r n h j z z r n h v r x g y h v r w h e r e y h v r 1 2 ρ l p p t u 2 y v v y r

taken into account based on the wind tunnel model test results in the tests conducted in december 2007 you 2018 dsme 2008 the non dimensionalized wind load coefficients were obtained for the 1 200 scale model of the vessel the wind model tests were carried out in the 2 6 m wide boundary layer tunnel wind speed corresponded to 12 5 m s and a reynolds number of 9 0 10 5 was applied at the reference height 10 0 m in full scale eq 6 shows how to non dimensionalize the measured wind loads fig 5 shows the non dimensional wind load coefficients of the 174k lngc for the surge sway and yaw the axial values are omitted due to the security policy in dsme the wind loads were considered by using eq 7 which had been used in prior researches you et al 2017b 2018 a t is about 1500 m2 and a l

calculation results the ship design information such as the hull form and loading conditions and the predicted wave conditions were used to take into account the wave loads acting on the lngc linear superposition was assumed to calculate the wave drift forces and moment in irregular waves the additional resistance in irregular waves was calculated by using pre calculated wave drift forces moment and wave spectrum you et al 2018 ittc 2002 hydrostar provided by bv classification was used eq 8 shows how to non dimensionalize the wave drift forces and moment eq 9 shows the predicted wave loads by considering the pre calculated qtfs 8 x w a x w a ρ g l p p ζ a 2 y w a y w a ρ g l p p ζ a 2 n w a n w a ρ g l p p 2 ζ a 2 9 x w a y w a n w a 0 q t f w α w a ζ a 2 e w d w e w 5 16 h s 2 w m 4 w 5 exp 5 4 w m w 4 the wave loads were calculated for three speeds 10 75 16 125 and 21 5 knots seven wave incident angles 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 and twenty nine wave frequencies 0 2721 1 0539 to avoid the extrapolation of wave loads the minimum speed was determined as 10 75 knots while the maximum speed was determined as 21 5 knots the range of the calculated speed was determined to cover the sailing speed which was investigated from the economic evaluation the wave drift forces and moment for x y and n at an arbitrary time were calculated by using the linear interpolation according to the speed and wave incident angle the significant wave height wave mean period and wave direction were predicted from the ecmwf database the predicted significant wave height and wave mean period were used to generate the ittc wave spectrum ittc 2002 the wave loads for surge were only plotted although the sway wave drift forces and yaw wave drift moments were considered in the calculation due to the insignificant meaning of them fig 6 shows the non dimensionalized surge wave drift forces according to the wave incident angles at 0 6665 frequency of the lngc with the design draft according to the speed fig 7 shows the non dimensionalized surge wave drift forces for waves from 60 of the lngc with the design draft according to the speed the black solid line blue chain line and red broken line indicate the results for 10 75 16 125 and 21 0 knots respectively the tendencies of the wave loads of the 174k lngc were similar to those of the 151k lngc which had been calculated in previous research you et al 2018 as the ship speed increase the peaks of wave drift force also increase and the peak frequencies are moved in the small wave frequency from fig 7 it can be understood that as the ship speed increases a larger amount of waves is scattered and this causes the increase of the peak value the peak frequency of the wave drift force goes to small wave frequency because the encounter with the wave frequency becomes larger the maximum values of the surge wave drift forces are observed at bow quartering waves with 60 and 300 2 4 rpm control and power calculation the basic concept of how to control the rpm for the ship to follow the command speed was identical with that used in previous research you et al 2017b 2018 in detail after comparing the difference between the present speed and the command speed at 30 s interval the deviation was categorized into seven steps rpm was added or reduced according to the rules that corresponded to each step however it was necessary to apply the different tips and modify the rules for rpm control as follows first for more accurate estimation and comparison of the operating costs according to the command speed it was essential to make the error between the intended speed and actual sailing speed insignificant during the entire voyage but when using the values used in the previous study which maintained the rpm between 2 0 and 2 0 knots the error that could based on 12 knots was about 16 6 16 6 of course although the average error during the entire voyage could be small it was inevitable that the error affected the predicted operating cost if the speed criterion to maintain the rpm was changed to between 0 05 and 0 05 knots the potential error was gradually reduced by about 0 4 likewise the mean error was further reduced for the entire voyage furthermore the concept of this research was for the ship to follow a command speed while the concept of the previous research had been for the ship to follow the sailing speed recorded with broad range you et al 2018 you et al 2017b man dieselturbo 2017 to follow the seafarer s judgement in dealing with actual traffic and compensate the speed loss due to the environmental loads since there was no need for the ship to rapidly change command speed the magnitudes of the rpm commands had to be reduced to make the simulation not easily disturbed for this reason the referring values to categorize the speed difference are partially changed as shown in table 2 while 8 0 4 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 knots had been used in the previous research here 8 0 2 0 0 05 0 05 2 0 and 8 0 knots were applied the values of 4 0 and 2 0 knots were changed to 2 0 and 0 05 knots to decrease the width used to maintain the rpm the rpm commands were changed from 0 6 0 4 0 2 0 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 into 0 4 0 2 0 1 0 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 second there were some periods when either considerable speed loss or insignificant speed increase was observed in comparison with the command speed during the simulation in all speed conditions and they had to be handled with the speed loss resulted from course change with large difference although the propulsive load was maintained the drag due to the deflected rudder and increased resistance due to the drift angle decreased the ship s speed in previous research you et al 2018 it had been not necessary to consider this kind of speed loss since the ship had followed the decreased speed that had been varied according to the ship s behavior because here the command speed was fixed at a certain value the speed loss could not be recognized therefore an alternative tip to handle the speed loss had to be considered if the ship had to be steered with large difference the rudder deflection angle was roughly commanded from 5 10 since more time was needed to follow the waypoint after course changing the smaller rudder angle of less than 5 had to be taken into account by trial and error 3 5 was regarded as a criterion to judge whether the ship executed the course change or not in other words if there was a speed loss with rudders deflected over 3 5 then the rpm was not added or reduced of course since the value of 3 5 was empirically determined there was much room for improvement it has to be further studied to replicate the sailing simulation of a ship by following a command speed if the rpm at an arbitrary moment can be known it is possible to predict the torque used in propulsion based on the propeller open water test results as shown in eq 10 k q j p p o r t and k q j p s t b d were obtained from the propeller open water tests power can be estimated from eq 11 in the previous researches you et al 2017b 2018 significant wave height and wave direction affected the tendency of quantitative error between predicted power and measured power since the average value during the entire voyage had been regarded to be offset here the interaction effect of significant wave height and wave direction on the rpm power relation was ignored 10 q p p o r t ρ n 2 d p 5 k q j p p o r t q p s t b d ρ n 2 d p 5 k q j p s t b d 11 p o w e r 2 π n q p p o r t q p s t b d 2 5 determination of the operating mode for me gi engine and gcu and the fuel property since in terms of operational efficiency ship owners preferred to install the me gi engine it was assumed that the lngc had two me gi engines specifically the 5g70me c9 5 gi that was manufactured by man man dieselturbo 2017 the amount of fuel consumption was estimated by using the sgc and spoc curves specified in the engine specification sgc had the minimum value at the engine load of approximately 60 80 and the value increased when the required engine load increased more than 80 or decreased below 60 namely the amount of the lng fuel required to generate unit power over 80 or under 60 conditions was more a document published by man showed sgc and spoc values at the engine load of 50 75 and 100 man dieselturbo 2017 a representative example was that when the engine load was 75 sgc was 130 7 g kwh although the sgc and spoc values written for the engine loads from 30 100 were used in the calculation the disclosed values were only referred to due to the security policy of the specification pilot oil was also considered to estimate the amount of fuel consumption and spoc values were also referred from the specification in the case of pilot oil the spoc values decreased as the engine loads increased this means that as the engine load increases less amount of pilot oil is required to generate unit power the bor from a lng cargo tank in a vessel varies from the type of containment system of course the amount of generated bog depends on whether the re liquefaction unit is activated or not since the re liquefaction unit was not considered here the pressure depended on bor and gcu only fig 8 shows a schematic of the equipment operation considered here in the lng cargo tank bog was generated from the loaded lng due to the heat in leakage the generated bog was supplied to the fuel and gas supply system as the fuel of the me gi engine it was possible to supply the lng as the fuel of the system as well the decision of the fuel supplied to the system depended on the operating scenario of an lngc if the lng cargo tank was filled with the generated bog to a considerable extent from a safety point of view gcu was activated to consistently combust the bog fig 9 shows the assumed operating scenario of the me gi engine and gcu by considering the maximum pressure upper limit and lower limit black solid line blue chain line and red dashed line indicate the lower limit upper limit and maximum pressure respectively of the lng cargo tank the maximum allowable pressure of the lng cargo tank that was being constructed in a shipyard was known to be about 250 mbarg kulitsa and wood 2018 the lower limit and upper limit were commonly determined to confirm the gcu operating scenario and they were specified as 20 and 80 of the maximum pressure of the cargo tank kulitsa and wood 2018 man and turbo 2014 since the generated bog increased the pressure in the lng cargo tank the gcu had to be activated to reduce the tank pressure the gcu was essential equipment for the safety of the lng cargo tank since the re liquefaction unit was not considered here therefore it was possible for the simulation to be realistic by considering the operating scenario of the gcu it was assumed that the bog compressor and gcu were stopped to protect the cargo tank from vacuum eq 12 is used to calculate the amount of accumulated bog in the cargo tank and the varied pressure according to the bog the amount of generated bog depended on the bor since the re liquefaction unit was not considered here it had been reported that the bor on operating vessels ranges from about 0 075 0 150 day igu 2017 in this paper the bor of the vessel was initially assumed to be 0 150 day and to be maintained as a constant during the voyage when the effect of bor on the operating cost was investigated bors of 0 125 0 100 and 0 075 day were additionally considered and they were assumed to be maintained during a voyage here it was assumed that the heat energy flowing into the lng cargo spreads evenly throughout all the lng cargo and the temperature of the lng rose equally as the cargo tank temperature increased the cargo tank pressure also increased based on the calculation result by the commercial thermodynamic analysis program hysys a figure of 385 694 248 kj of heat energy flowing into the lng to increase the pressure from 50 mbarg to 190 mbarg was obtained it was the same as the energy of evaporating 741 9 ton of lng since a linear relationship was assumed between the tank pressure and the amount of heat ingress or bog accumulation eq 13 was derived the lng composition used for the properties was that used in nigeria national energy technology laboratory 2005 12 q h e a t m l n g c p d t 13 p t 0 19 a c c u m u l a t e d b o g 50 0 there are two methods to supply the me gi engine with fuel by pressurizing the ng with high pressure fuel gas compressor or pressurizing the lng with high pressure pump and vaporizing with vaporizer in the early stage of developing the me gi engine the high pressure pump and vaporizer were considered for the fuel gas supply system due to the lower electric power consumption however usage of the ng as fuel was more preferable than combustion of bog on gcu or re liquefaction of bog by the re liquefaction unit by considering the trend it was assumed that the two kinds of fuel and gas supply system that identified the acronym for the me gi engine were installed in the vessel the high pressure fuel gas compressor was preferentially used but if the pressure in the cargo tank was low and the fuel gas supply by bog was not possible the high pressure pump and vaporizer system was activated choi 2014 it was assumed that there was no difference in the operating cost due to the method of supplying the fuel gas although the actual cost of supplying the bog as fuel consumed more energy than that of supplying the lng it was assumed that the initial pressure of the cargo tank defined the lower limit of the cargo tank pressure since the lower limit was used as the criterion for the normal loading unloading work since the pressure in the cargo tank was larger than the lower limit the bog was basically supplied to the main engine as fuel if the amount of bog supplied to the main engine as fuel was smaller than the nbog during a voyage bog accumulated in the lng cargo tank and the pressure in the tank increased this was defined as mode i which continued until the pressure in the cargo tank reached the upper limit from the lower limit since the pressure of the lng cargo tank between the lower limit and the upper limit was regarded as a safe level gcu was deactivated in this mode if the pressure of the tank reached the upper limit the mode was defined as mode ii since the pressure in the tank was regarded as risk condition gcu had to be activated to secure the safety of the cargo tank of course bog was supplied to the main engine as fuel which was helpful in terms of safety the combusted amount of bog through gcu was assumed to be the same as the bor of the tank and it was basically 0 15 day bor dnv 2006 the combusted rate of gcu also changed according to the variation in bor since the gcu capacity was determined to be able to burn the entire nbog in the cargo tanks once bog was supplied to the engine and was combusted through the gcu the pressure in the tanks had to be reduced this was defined as mode iii until the pressure of the cargo tanks reached the lower limit when the pressure reached the lower limit the gcu was turned off this was defined as mode iv when the cargo tank pressure was smaller than the lower limit there was another risk of the lng cargo tank since tanks were always secured from vacuum condition so as to not be damaged therefore bog could not be supplied to the fuel namely the fuel gas compressor was stopped to protect the cargo tank from the vacuum and lng was directly supplied to the engine as fuel and the gcu had to be turned off the amount of accumulated bog was larger than that supplied as fuel therefore it was considered that the mode changes in the order of mode i ii iii iv i since the bog was accumulated in the cargo tank the cargo tank pressure increased from the lower limit after the ship started toward the destination as mode i when the pressure reached the upper limit the mode became mode ii since bog was supplied to the engine and combusted through gcu the pressure of cargo tank decreased after the pressure was smaller than the upper limit as mode iii bog was supplied to the engine and combusted through the gcu until the tank pressure reached the lower limit when the pressure was smaller than the lower limit the mode became mode iv during mode iv the gcu and the fuel gas compressor had to be stopped consequently bog was again accumulated in the lng cargo tank and the mode became mode i simulations were commonly executed by following the described order on the other hand if the amount of nbog was smaller than the amount of bog consumed in the propulsion it was considered that the mode changed in the order of mode iv i iv the tank pressure decreased from the lower limit to a smaller value under the lower limit after starting the voyage since the amount of bog required in the propulsion was larger than that of nbog the mode became mode iv and lng had to be directly supplied to the engine as fuel since bog was accumulated again the tank pressure increased over the lower limit and the mode became mode i again the change had to be repeated with a short time interval as described if the mode was changed iv i and i iv the fuel supply system was also turned off and turned on continuously namely if the high pressure fuel gas compressor was turned on the high pressure pump and vaporizer system had to be turned off in reality the two fuel gas supply systems were separately operated on each engine to be in equilibrium between nbog and the amount of supplied bog to consistently maintain the simplified operation scenario this kind of parallel operation of the fuel gas supply system was not considered 2 6 evaluation of operating cost considering lng fuel and mgo here the operating cost was defined as the total expense that was the sum of the lng fuel cost mgo cost and the combusted bog cost at the final destination the combusted bog cost was obtained by multiplying the price of lng fuel and the liquefied amount of the combusted amount of bog the cost of the combusted bog was included in the lng fuel cost since rpm and power at an arbitrary time could be estimated from the sailing simulation the operating cost was also estimated by considering the sgc and spoc curve and solving eqs 14 16 the specified sgc and spoc were used to know the amount of lng fuel and pilot oil to generate the necessary power as shown in eq 15 the total amount of fuel used in the voyage can be estimated by accumulating the fgc and fpoc required to generate the power at an arbitrary time during the entire voyage since the lng fuel cost and mgo cost were respectively obtained from eqs 14 and 15 the operating cost at the final destination could be estimated by adding the lng fuel cost and mgo cost from eq 16 14 f g c t i t f p o w e r t s g c f p o w e r d t f p o c t i t f p o w e r t s p o c f p o w e r d t 15 l n g f u e l c o s t l n g f u e l p r i c e

referring to the bunker price of vancouver harbor which was disclosed by ship bunker https shipandbunker com fig 10 shows the time histories of lng fuel and mgo price from 1st july 2017 for 180 days in vancouver harbor during the period the prices of lng fuel and mgo roughly increased since the operating costs could not be estimated by considering the fluctuating fuel price the fuel price was selected for that on 8th december 2017 as 298 0 for lng fuel and 708 0 for mgo 2 7 detailed simulation procedure fig 11 shows the calculation procedure of estimating the operating cost during a voyage until the ship reaches the final destination to unload the lng cargo the grey section in fig 11 indicates the simulation modules proposed in previous research you et al 2018 first of all waypoints corresponding to the actual sea route of the ship time in utc at each waypoint environmental conditions and command speed were determined in order to carry out the sailing simulation time in utc latitude longitude sog and stw were obtained from the ais data wind speed wind direction significant wave height mean wave period and wave direction were predicted from the ecmwf database the ship moved from an arbitrary location to the next waypoint while maintaining the command speed the ship s behavior was calculated by solving the maneuvering equations of motion as shown in eq 3 and the detailed solving process was described in the previous researches you et al 2017a 2017b 2018 the calculation was performed with constant time step here 1 s rpm and power were estimated every second you et al 2018 described in detail the scheme of how to follow the waypoint and control the rudder deflection angle it was possible to predict the pressure of the cargo tank at an arbitrary time by calculating the amount of bog in the tank there are four modes of the main engine and gcu according to the pressure in the tank as shown in fig 10 and table 3 since the lng fuel could be supplied as both liquid and gas by using different equipment how to supply the lng fuel to the main engines was determined likewise the gcu could be activated or deactivated according to the determined mode fgc and fpoc could be calculated by using eq 15 because the sgc and spoc were known through the given engine specification by multiplying the sgc and spoc by the price per unit weight of each fuel as summarized in table 5 it was possible to calculate the operating cost for an arbitrary time the calculation was repeated until the ship reached the final destination table 4 shows the detailed sequence to evaluate the operating cost and description of the input execution and output to improve the readability among the written equations all information of a ship is known including the resistance self propulsion maneuvering seakeeping sea route environmental conditions and unique values for equipment operation based on the information maneuvering simulation started as shown in step 1 the values of u i v i r i x g i y g i ψ i δ p o r t i δ s t b d i and n i were set for the initial state of the simulation after solving eqs 1 5 and 7 and 9 for a timestep of 1 s u i 1 v i 1 r i 1 x g i 1 y g i 1 ψ i 1 δ p o r t i 1 and δ s t b d i 1 were updated to estimate n i 1 and u i 1 was compared with the command speed and k q j p p o r t i 1 and k q j p s t b d i 1 were predicted as shown in step 2 from the m l n g i 1 and bor the pressure of the lng cargo tank denoted as p t i 1 and mode denoted as m o d e i 1 were updated as shown in step 3 by considering sgc and spoc corresponding to the engine load eq 14 was solved to estimate f g c i 1 and f p o c i 1 as shown in step 4 eq 15 was solved to estimate the lng fuel cost and mgo cost as shown in step 5 finally the operating cost could be obtained by solving eq 16 as shown in step 6 the sequence was repeated with 1 s intervals until the ship reached the final destination 3 basic scenario for the simulation 3 1 one way sea route obtained from the ais data in this study the actual sea route of an lngc was used to estimate the operating cost the route shown in fig 12 was recorded through the ais device on board since red dots in fig 12 are marked on the recorded locations of the lngc the red lines from west africa to japan are together perceived as the entire sea route representatively time in utc latitude longitude sog and stw were recorded after loading the lng cargo the lngc started from an lng terminal in nigeria on may 20 2016 the ship sailed through cape town madagascar and the strait of malacca and then arrived at an lng terminal in japan on june 17 2016 taking about 26 days sailing time the recorded location was assumed as a waypoint that the ship had to follow in the sailing simulation 3 2 environmental condition obtained from the ecmwf database environmental conditions were predicted from the ecmwf database according to the recorded time in utc and the location since the grid size of ecmwf database was 0 25 0 25 and the time interval was 6 h the environmental conditions including wind and waves were acquired at the closest node of the grid and closest time the feasibility of the ecmwf database was verified by comparing the environmental data obtained from full scale measurement with those obtained from the ecmwf database in previous research you et al 2017b the tendency of the full scale measurement data matched well with that of the ecmwf database consequently the predicted environmental conditions were regarded as the actual environmental conditions that the ship had encountered the acquired environmental conditions were assumed as a representative environmental data for the sea route in other words this means that the environmental conditions were assumed to be always identical depending on the location of the ship even if the ship passed through a waypoint at any time due to different speed the assumption was closely connected to the purpose of this research if different environmental conditions were considered during a voyage with different speed it was hard to analyze the effect of the sailing speed on the operating cost due to the plural variables like speed wind and waves consequently here other parameters than the command speed of the ship had to be fixed fig 13 shows the time histories of absolute wind speed and wind direction obtained from the ecmwf database for about 26 days black squares denote the absolute wind speed while blue circles denote the absolute wind direction fig 14 shows the time histories of the significant wave height and wave direction from the ecmwf database for about 26 days after the ship left west africa black squares denote the significant wave height while blue circles denote the absolute wave direction the predicted environmental conditions from the ecmwf database matched well with the statistical data written in the young s research young 1999 in general the ship sailed for the entire voyage under mild weather conditions they showed similar tendencies and the difference could be regarded as ignorable 3 3 simulation plan to predict the economic speed of the lngc kowalski 2013 estimated the operating cost of a bulk carrier whose speed ranges 10 5 14 5 knots to determine the efficient speed the service speed of a bulk carrier was 7 33 m s about 14 25 knots by reviewing the average speed of bulk carriers assuming liner shipping szelangiewicz and zelazny 2016 here a 174k lngc was used to estimate the operating cost since the sailing speed of an lngc was higher than that of a bulk carrier the speed range had to be changed the service speed of the lngc is 19 4 knots as shown in table 1 based on the value the maximum speed of an lngc was assumed to be 20 0 knots the operating cost was estimated for the speed ranging 12 20 knots at 1 knot interval 3 4 feasibility of the sailing simulation since the verified mathematical model was used the feasibility check could be simply carried out by comparing the simulated route and speed of the ship with the recorded sea route from the ais data and the command speed from the comparisons the simulation could be regarded as the appropriate results to acquire the aim of this research since there were 9 tested speeds from 12 knots to 20 knots at 1 knot interval it was hard to recognize all the results in a figure to improve the readability the simulated route and speed were only plotted for the maximum speed and the minimum speed fig 15 shows the comparison between recorded sea routes and simulated sea routes of an lngc for the entire voyage black solid lines indicate the sea route recorded from the ais data blue squares and red circles indicate the routes with simulated speed of 20 and 12 knots the simulated sea routes are well matched with the recorded route since fig 15 was plotted to show the entire voyage it was necessary to also plot the sea route as an enlarged section in detail a rectangle is marked near the cape of good hope fig 16 shows the comparison between the recorded sea routes and simulated sea routes of an lngc near the cape of good hope with simulated speed of 20 and 12 knots since the ship was steered with large difference near the area it is helpful for the reader to perceive the feasibility the definitions of solid line and symbols are identical to those in fig 15 even if the sea route was enlarged the simulated sea routes were well matched with the recorded route as well slight deviation resulted from the controllability that could be secured in a ship since the ship could only have directional stability in the case of a merchant ship having propellers and rudders lewis 1989 the ship could not follow the waypoints under environmental loads without error in terms of feasibility study the simulated routes were regarded as acceptable fig 17 shows the time histories of the simulated speed of an lngc for the entire voyage of the ship with 20 and 12 knots since the simulation was conducted by following the command speed the simulated speed was only plotted in this figure only blue squares and red circles denote the simulated speed by following the command speeds of 20 and 12 knots respectively since the sailing speed of the ship was different it took a different time to arrive at the final destination when the ship sailed at 20 knots the ship was operated for about 23 days on the other hand at 12 knots the ship sailed for about 38 days as mentioned it seems that the ship was well operated by following the command speed of 20 and 12 knots speed loss due to course change or speed increase after course change is observed as shown in fig 17 since the phenomenon was observed during a relatively short period the effect of the speed loss and speed increase on the averaged speed for the entire voyage could be ignored table 5 shows the comparison of the command speed with the average speed during the simulation the simulated speeds are always smaller than the command speeds roughly the errors between the command speed and the average speed are under 0 3 the observed errors are even smaller than the anticipated error of 0 4 in the decision of rules for rpm control the calculated error was regarded as of ignorable value fig 18 shows the estimated time of arrival of the lngc according to the command speeds black squares denote the estimated time of arrival summarized in table 5 if the distance is fixed there is an inverse relationship between the travel time and velocity according to the distance speed time formula of t r a v e l t i m e d i s t a n c e v e l o c i t y the distances of the voyage were always the same because the lngc was simulated from an lng terminal in west africa to an lng terminal in japan it was recognized that the tendency of the estimated time of arrival was in inverse proportion to the command speed fig 19 shows the average rpm and average power of the lngc during the entire voyage according to the command speeds black squares and blue circles denote the average rpm and average power respectively fig 19 shows that as the command speed increases the average power increases drastically this shows the general feature of relation between speed rpm and power since the tendencies also matched the physics the simulation could be regarded as the appropriate results the feature could be understood based on physical knowledge the resistance of a ship is in proportion to the square of the ship speed lewis 1989 thrust is in proportion to n2 according to eq 4 consequently the rpm of a ship is in direct proportion to the ship speed the characteristic is easily found in the speed rpm curve of a ship behrendt and kucharski 1997 furthermore eq 9 shows the relation between the rpm and power of a ship power is in direct proportion to n3 if sgc and spoc are assumed as constants the fuel consumption will be in direct proportion to n3 as well of course since sgc and spoc values were variables depending on the engine loads the tendency of the fuel consumption had to be different according to the description since the operating cost is evaluated by multiplying the price of the fuel by the fuel consumption it will be assumed to be in direct proportion to n3 4 discussion on the simulation results 4 1 simulated operating cost not considering gas combustion fig 20 shows the evaluated lng fuel cost mgo cost and total operating cost of the lngc according to the command speeds black solid line with squares blue chain line with circles and red dashed line with diamonds denote the lng fuel cost mgo cost and total operating cost respectively as described sgc values ranging 60 80 of the maximum engine load were relatively small since the mcr of an engine was about 13 000 kw the smaller sgc values were considered from 17 5 20 knots consequently larger sgc values had to be used to predict the fuel consumption below 17 5 knots this made the slope of the lng fuel cost at under 17 knots high on the other hand the slope of the necessary power according to the command speed under 17 knots seems to be steep the tendency of the mgo cost was definitely different from that of the lng fuel cost although the command speed increased the mgo cost was kept similarly as explained as the engine load increased spoc values consistently decreased this feature of the spoc curve affected the evaluated mgo cost although the mgo cost varies insignificantly according to the command speed the tendency of the total operating cost seems to be similar to that of the lng fuel cost but the slope becomes somewhat gradual it is possible to conclude that the two features due to the sgc curve and spoc curve make the tendency of the total operating cost accord with the command speed as shown in fig 20 the total operating cost is not in proportion to n3 or a cubic square of the command speed it was different from that anticipated from a simple mathematical model and assumptions this could be understood from a referred paper that showed the operating cost according to the sailing speed meyer et al 2012 in general the slower the ship the smaller the operating cost this feature is so called slow steaming slow steaming which is a well known feature of today s shipping means the low load operation of an engine or low speed operation of a ship to reduce the fuel consumption and carbon emissions if a simplified mathematical model was used that did not consider the sgc and spoc values the operating cost was in proportion to n3 or a cubic square of the speed as discussed however the benefit of slow steaming was not proportional to a cubic of the speed since there were some ignorance of lubricating oil and other considerations meyer et al 2012 4 2 simulated operating cost considering gas combustion although slow steaming was a premise to understand the operation efficiency of a ship it was not pursued due to actual factors in terms of the shipping since the aim was to evaluate the operating cost by considering the equipment operation here consideration of the lng cargo containment system and gcu was implemented by referring to the range of bor in a lng cargo tank the effect of bor on the operating cost was investigated according to the evenly divided bor conditions of 0 15 0 125 0 10 and 0 075 day fig 21 shows the operating cost according to the command speeds and bor the operating cost means the total expenditure for a ship to arrive at the final destination black solid line with squares blue chain line with circles red dashed line with diamonds orange broken line with right triangles and green dotted line with left triangles indicate the estimated operating cost by considering bors of zero 0 15 0 125 0 10 and 0 075 day respectively the tendency of the evaluated operating cost by considering bor and gas combustion was definitely changed in the case of the bors of 0 15 and 0 125 day in comparison with that of the cost not considering bor as ship speed decreased for the bors the operating cost increased this means that the benefit due to slow steaming disappeared since the cost for the combusted bog increased substantially in other words although less fuel was consumed with the low speed condition more bog was generated and had to be combusted to secure the safety of the lng cargo tank furthermore since the slow speed increased the estimated time of arrival more bog had to be wasted on the whole the operating cost was significantly affected by bor since the amount of bog was determined according to bor as bor became small the operating cost became small if the bor was reduced by about 0 025 day in the lngc by following a command speed the operating cost was reduced by about 300 000 usd at the given speed for the operating cost by considering bors of 0 100 and 0 075 day there were inflection points as the minimum cost at a certain command speed in addition there was a range of command speed where slow steaming was still applicable in fig 21 there were some points where the evaluated cost was identical whether bor was considered or not for bors of 0 100 and 0 075 day this indicates that there was no need to combust bor with those speeds and the ship could arrive at the final destination before the pressure of the lng cargo tank reached the upper limit within the range where slow steaming was applicable there was a speed to be anticipated for the minimum operating cost for a certain bor the minimum speed was 20 18 and 16 knots for bors of 0 125 0 100 and 0 075 day respectively the minimum speed for the bor of 0 15 day might be higher than 20 knots since the amount of combusted bog was relatively larger than that of bog used to propulsion this means that the operating cost of the lng with bor of 0 15 day decreased for the sea route as the ship arrived at the final destination early 4 3 estimated lng cargo at the final destination the loadage to be unloaded of the lngc at an arrived lng terminal had been empirically anticipated according to the sea route since bor and gcu activation were considered during the sailing simulation by considering the hydrodynamic characteristics of the vessel it was possible to predict the remaining lng cargo at the final destination this was considered an additional advantage of the suggested approach the loaded lng cargo was assumed by considering a filling ratio of 98 for the lngc dobrota et al 2013 the amount of remaining lng cargo was compared based on the loaded amount of lng fig 22 shows the remaining lng cargo at the final destination according to the command speed and bor the definition of each line is identical to that used in fig 21 as the ship sailed and bog was supplied to generate the thrust as fuel the loadage became small if bor and the limitation of the lng cargo pressure were not considered bog was only used as the fuel accordingly as the command speed increased the final loadage decreased by considering the gcu and combustion of bog due to safety reasons the tendency was changed as the ship arrived at the final destination late due to slow speed the amount of combusted bog increased while the remaining lng cargo decreased it is well known that bor is an important parameter to determine the remaining lng cargo for a voyage if bor was 0 15 day it was inevitable to combust the bog from 20 12 knots if a ship had the lng cargo tank with bor of 0 15 day the fastest speed was helpful to increase the loadage the maximum loadage for bors of 0 125 0 100 and 0 075 day were observed at 16 18 and 20 knots respectively since the combusted bog was considered as the operating cost there is no doubt that by comparing the tendency of the operating cost the tendency of the remaining lng cargo was inverted 5 conclusion in this paper we constructed a new approach to estimate the operating cost by developing direct cost evaluation in consideration of the hydrodynamic characteristics of a vessel sea route environmental conditions and equipment operation in detail the ship design information model test results and calculation results regarding the resistance self propulsion maneuvering and seakeeping performance were considered the sea route was obtained from an ais device and environmental conditions are acquired from the ecmwf database furthermore the equipment operation for me gi engines and the gcu and fuel property were additionally considered direct cost evaluation was conducted based on the sailing simulation by following the obtained sea route under the predicted environmental condition three conclusions are derived as follows first the observed slow steaming was investigated on the basis of the hydrodynamic characteristics of the vessel and the equipment installed on the vessel by simulating the actual operation although slow steaming had been empirically perceived in the field of shipping it was hard to quantitatively analyze the effect of a parameter on the operating cost by constructing a mathematical model that includes the hull propeller rudder environmental loads engine and fuel property it was possible to replicate the slow steaming observed on a ship consequently it was perceived that the operating cost was not in proportion to n3 or a cubic square of the speed since it was affected by sgc and spoc features the benefit of slow steaming became weakened since the slope of the operating cost according to the command speed was gradual second the additional consideration of the gcu to secure the safety of the lng cargo tank definitely reversed the tendency of the evaluated operating cost according to the command speed since the necessary power to make the speed of the ship slow was smaller the amount of accumulated bog became larger this affected the starting time of gcu activation and more bog had to be combusted to lower the pressure in the cargo tank furthermore since the low speed increased the estimated time of arrival the total amount of combusted bog increased this resulted in the increase of operating cost third there was a speed range within which slow steaming was effective and the most efficient speed was observed at the lowest speed of that range bor was a key parameter to determine the effective range here the operating cost was investigated for the bor from 0 15 0 075 day at 0 025 day intervals and for the command speed from 20 12 knots at 1 knot intervals as bor increased the values of the effective range increased for the given sea route and environmental conditions the efficient speed of the lngc was observed at 16 18 and 20 knots for the bors of 0 075 0 100 and 0 125 day there was an additional benefit of efficient speed in that the lngc could deliver more lng cargo at the efficient speed this research made it possible to determine the efficient speed by considering the various features of the vessel it will be helpful for ship owners to make a navigation plan of their fleet after this research was finalized some supplementary items were perceived since the predicted efficient speed was for a one way voyage with the design draft it has to be further developed to secure the appropriateness for entire voyages by considering the design draft and ballast draft together from the macroscopic point of view more factors affecting the operating cost have to be considered and these include the number of seafarers on board and their salaries freight charge and the etd and eta a study of the various scenarios of equipment operation will be meaningful to disclose economic

23080,it was necessary to determine how to estimate the operational efficiency through an objective evaluation since a ship owner s interest was closely connected to the operating cost ship owners demanded that shipyards predicted the most efficient speed based on the evaluated operating cost by considering the hydrodynamic characteristics of a ship sea route environmental conditions including wind and waves equipment features including main engine and gcu fuel property and others in this paper we constructed a new approach to estimate the operating cost by developing direct cost evaluation in consideration of the requested factors as a result the observed slow steaming was investigated on the basis of the hydrodynamic characteristics of the vessel and the effect of the activated gcu on the operating cost could be analyzed finally a speed range within which slow steaming was effective was perceived and the most efficient speed was observed at the lowest speed of that range keywords direct cost evaluation hydrodynamic characteristics equipment operation slow steaming efficient speed 1 introduction as a consequence of high oil prices improvement of the operational efficiency of a ship has been regarded as the most important goal to be attained by international organizations shipping companies classification societies and shipbuilding companies imo has been reviewing regulations to increase the efficiency of a ship by applying eedi eeoi and seemp ball et al 2015 some classification societies and research institutes have been carrying out collaborative projects such as shopera to examine the applicability of the relevant regulations shipping companies have been installing commercial platforms developed by abb wartsila etc to improve the efficiency during a voyage monitor the sailing conditions of a vessel and confirm the navigation plan of their fleet shipyards have been struggling to meet the market demands for improved efficiency through new hull forms or new equipment on board each institution has been trying new attempts to achieve its particular goals from the shipyard s perspective it was preferentially necessary to determine how to estimate the operational efficiency through an objective evaluation since a ship owner s interest was closely connected to the operating cost in addition ship owners demanded that shipyards predicted the most efficient speed and suggested an example of schedule for their fleet based on the evaluated operating cost by considering the hydrodynamic characteristics of a ship sea route environmental conditions including wind and waves equipment features including main engine re liquefaction unit and gcu fuel property and others since there was a market trend to change fuel from hfo to lng fuel to reduce the operating cost and co2 nox and sox emission it was required to consider the effect of the fuel property on the operating cost however the requested scope was a kind of a macro level it was not focused on the tips to make a vessel efficient for a specific environmental conditions but on the macroscopic plan that a headquarter office gives an instruction schedule to the seafarers of their fleets like putting the puzzle making representative studies focusing on the operational efficiency are summarized as follows wang and meng 2012 researched the optimized speed of a ship in which the ship was operated by following a planned route with the minimum amount of fuel consumption within a pre determined time semolinos et al semolinos et al 2013 and simmer et al simmer et al 2015 compared the operating cost and the emission according to the fuel hfo and lng fuel of a vessel kowalski kowalski 2013 proposed to intuitively predict operating cost by combining the famed methodologies based on the suggested approach the effect of sailing speed on the operating cost could be investigated furthermore a trend of the operating cost according to the fuel price was disclosed however there was the limitation that the hydrodynamic characteristics of a ship under actual environmental conditions could not be considered since the operating cost was estimated by using a simple mathematical model you et al 2017a carried out a sailing simulation to predict the actual rpm and engine power by considering the resistance self propulsion maneuvering characteristics and sailing records including the sea route and speed obtained from the ais data they compared the predicted rpm and power with the measured values you et al 2018 developed the simulation by considering wind and waves sea route and the recorded speed obtained from the full scale measurement data they investigated the quantitative difference among the simulated values based on the ais data simulated values based on the full scale measurement data and the measured values you et al 2017b conducted a feasibility study to replace the full scale measurement data by combining the ais data and ecmwf database in order to overcome the circumstance that due to its security policy the full scale measurement data acquired by a shipping company was rarely shared with a shipyard they compared the predicted rpm and power based on the ais data and ecmwf database with those based on the full scale measurement data even if there was a quantitative difference between those values it could be perceived that the tendencies of the values were very similar the researches carried out by you et al 2017a 2017b 2018 could provide a clue to a researcher who tried to estimate the actual operating cost of a ship by considering the hydrodynamic characteristics of a ship sea route and environmental conditions from this motive the necessity to construct a direct cost evaluation procedure by considering the equipment such as the main engine gcu and fuel property was perceived in this paper the operating cost of a ship was estimated by developing direct cost evaluations based on the simulation proposed by you et al 2017a 2017b 2018 in consideration of the hydrodynamic characteristics sea route and environmental conditions in order to achieve this goal a 174k lngc constructed in dsme was chosen therefore the ship design information model test results and calculation results regarding the various hydrodynamic characteristics including the resistance self propulsion maneuvering and seakeeping performance could be considered with confidence a sea route used to evaluate the operating cost was obtained from the ais data that were recorded for an lngc that had actually been operated in the ocean the sea route that the ship sailed with the loaded condition from west africa to east asia was chosen the environmental data encountered during the actual operation were acquired through ecmwf database for the corresponding time and location obtained from the ais data equipment operation was additionally considered to make the evaluation realistic the main engine of me gi type fuel property and gcu were considered for the vessel the lngc has two me gi type main engines manufactured by man man dieselturbo 2017 the fuel properties were taken into consideration in the iso ambient condition based on the properties specified by iso iso 2010 since lng cargo handling scenario was reviewed for our relevant practical experience to be used for the understanding of the actual operation of an lngc a scenario for the fuel supply and combustion to consider characteristics of the lng cargo containment system including bog and bor was also constructed igu 2017 jeong 2013 the methods of determining an operational concept could differ according to the shipping company or shipyard since it was impossible to generalize all the scenarios applied to this field the scenario was simplified based on the practical experience of the lngc construction in dsme the operating cost due to fuel consumption was estimated by considering the lng fuel price and mgo price disclosed by ship bunker https shipandbunker com consequently the fuel consumption and operating cost could be directly estimated based on the constructed methodology simulations were repeatedly conducted to investigate the effect of the command speed and bor on the operating cost under the given sea route and the actual environmental conditions it was necessary to assume that the ship always sailed under identical environmental conditions so as not to confuse the effect of other parameters the predicted environmental conditions were regarded as fixed values according to the waypoints as a result it was possible to independently investigate the effect of the sailing speed on the operating cost in addition the effect of bor of the lng cargo tank on the operating cost was also investigated to take into account the latest types of cargo containment system from this research it was possible to directly estimate the operating cost by considering the hydrodynamic characteristics of the ship sea route environmental conditions equipment operation etc by following the objectively constructed procedure this research could be regarded as the extension of vision in shipbuilding and shipping field to consider the different issue on the same platform as summarized there had been a lot of researches for each topic regarding the operational performance of a ship and lng cargo containment system since they were conventional issues in shipbuilding and shipping companies however they had been separately dealt with by different research groups like the hydrodynamics and process engineering it could be anticipated that the acquired view of this research would helpful for ship owners to make an operating plan of their fleet by considering different knowledge together 2 mathematical model and simulation procedure fig 1 shows the coordinates of this sailing simulation since coordinates for the maneuvering equations of motion wind load coefficients wave drift forces and moment ais data and ecmwf database were acquired for different coordinates it was necessary to adjust the entire values for the same coordinates as shown in fig 1 the 174k lngc with twin screw that had been studied in previous research was also used you and choi 2017 the lngc was constructed as a membrane type in dsme fig 2 shows the vessel anchoring in an lng terminal table 1 shows the principal particulars representatively l p p is 284 5 m b is 48 4 m t is 11 7 m and c b is about 0 77 with the design condition 2 1 hydrodynamic loads due to hull rudders and propellers since the proposed sailing simulation concept you et al 2017a 2017b 2018 had been constructed by solving the maneuvering equations of motion it was needed beyond all to describe how to construct the equations eq 1 shows the

inertia and rudder lift coefficients were predicted using the empirical formulae proposed by kijima et al 1990 and fujii and tsuda 1961 1962 the definitions of each hydrodynamic coefficient were identical with those used by kijima et al 1990 the coefficients for the resistance and thrust were obtained from the model tests conducted in a basin rudder lift coefficients were predicted by using the empirical formulae because full spade rudders were equipped in the vessel there was potential inaccuracy due to the hydrodynamic coefficients predicted from the empirical formulae developed for a single screw vessel although the exact characteristics of twin propellers and rudders could not be replicated it was possible to obtain physical insight from a qualitative point of view in addition the simulated maneuvering performance is compared with that of the free running model test results of the 174k lngc as shown in figs 3 and 4 you and choi 2017 you 2018 to reduce the potential risk of the mathematical model in terms of the accuracy fig 3 shows the 35 turning trajectories predicted from the simulation and those obtained from the free running model tests of the 174k lngc fig 4 shows the time series of the heading angle and turn rate predicted from the simulation of 10 10 zigzag test to the port side and those obtained from the free running model tests of the 174k lngc there are insignificant differences between the simulated results and the free running model test results from the comparisons consequently the mathematical model could be applied to the simulation of the

taken into account based on the wind tunnel model test results in the tests conducted in december 2007 you 2018 dsme 2008 the non dimensionalized wind load coefficients were obtained for the 1 200 scale model of the vessel the wind model tests were carried out in the 2 6 m wide boundary layer tunnel wind speed corresponded to 12 5 m s and a reynolds number of 9 0 10 5 was applied at the reference height 10 0 m in full scale eq 6 shows how to non dimensionalize the measured wind loads fig 5 shows the non dimensional wind load coefficients of the 174k lngc for the surge sway and yaw the axial values are omitted due to the security policy in dsme the wind loads were considered by using eq 7 which had been used in prior researches you et al 2017b 2018 a t is about 1500 m2 and a l

calculation results the ship design information such as the hull form and loading conditions and the predicted wave conditions were used to take into account the wave loads acting on the lngc linear superposition was assumed to calculate the wave drift forces and moment in irregular waves the additional resistance in irregular waves was calculated by using pre calculated wave drift forces moment and wave spectrum you et al 2018 ittc 2002 hydrostar provided by bv classification was used eq 8 shows how to non dimensionalize the wave drift forces and moment eq 9 shows the predicted wave loads by

exp 5 4 w m w 4 the wave loads were calculated for three speeds 10 75 16 125 and 21 5 knots seven wave incident angles 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 and twenty nine wave frequencies 0 2721 1 0539 to avoid the extrapolation of wave loads the minimum speed was determined as 10 75 knots while the maximum speed was determined as 21 5 knots the range of the calculated speed was determined to cover the sailing speed which was investigated from the economic evaluation the wave drift forces and moment for x y and n at an arbitrary time were calculated by using the linear interpolation according to the speed and wave incident angle the significant wave height wave mean period and wave direction were predicted from the ecmwf database the predicted significant wave height and wave mean period were used to generate the ittc wave spectrum ittc 2002 the wave loads for surge were only plotted although the sway wave drift forces and yaw wave drift moments were considered in the calculation due to the insignificant meaning of them fig 6 shows the non dimensionalized surge wave drift forces according to the wave incident angles at 0 6665 frequency of the lngc with the design draft according to the speed fig 7 shows the non dimensionalized surge wave drift forces for waves from 60 of the lngc with the design draft according to the speed the black solid line blue chain line and red broken line indicate the results for 10 75 16 125 and 21 0 knots respectively the tendencies of the wave loads of the 174k lngc were similar to those of the 151k lngc which had been calculated in previous research you et al 2018 as the ship speed increase the peaks of wave drift force also increase and the peak frequencies are moved in the small wave frequency from fig 7 it can be understood that as the ship speed increases a larger amount of waves is scattered and this causes the increase of the peak value the peak frequency of the wave drift force goes to small wave frequency because the encounter with the wave frequency becomes larger the maximum values of the surge wave drift forces are observed at bow quartering waves with 60 and 300 2 4 rpm control and power calculation the basic concept of how to control the rpm for the ship to follow the command speed was identical with that used in previous research you et al 2017b 2018 in detail after comparing the difference between the present speed and the command speed at 30 s interval the deviation was categorized into seven steps rpm was added or reduced according to the rules that corresponded to each step however it was necessary to apply the different tips and modify the rules for rpm control as follows first for more accurate estimation and comparison of the operating costs according to the command speed it was essential to make the error between the intended speed and actual sailing speed insignificant during the entire voyage but when using the values used in the previous study which maintained the rpm between 2 0 and 2 0 knots the error that could based on 12 knots was about 16 6 16 6 of course although the average error during the entire voyage could be small it was inevitable that the error affected the predicted operating cost if the speed criterion to maintain the rpm was changed to between 0 05 and 0 05 knots the potential error was gradually reduced by about 0 4 likewise the mean error was further reduced for the entire voyage furthermore the concept of this research was for the ship to follow a command speed while the concept of the previous research had been for the ship to follow the sailing speed recorded with broad range you et al 2018 you et al 2017b man dieselturbo 2017 to follow the seafarer s judgement in dealing with actual traffic and compensate the speed loss due to the environmental loads since there was no need for the ship to rapidly change command speed the magnitudes of the rpm commands had to be reduced to make the simulation not easily disturbed for this reason the referring values to categorize the speed difference are partially changed as shown in table 2 while 8 0 4 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 knots had been used in the previous research here 8 0 2 0 0 05 0 05 2 0 and 8 0 knots were applied the values of 4 0 and 2 0 knots were changed to 2 0 and 0 05 knots to decrease the width used to maintain the rpm the rpm commands were changed from 0 6 0 4 0 2 0 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 into 0 4 0 2 0 1 0 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 second there were some periods when either considerable speed loss or insignificant speed increase was observed in comparison with the command speed during the simulation in all speed conditions and they had to be handled with the speed loss resulted from course change with large difference although the propulsive load was maintained the drag due to the deflected rudder and increased resistance due to the drift angle decreased the ship s speed in previous research you et al 2018 it had been not necessary to consider this kind of speed loss since the ship had followed the decreased speed that had been varied according to the ship s behavior because here the command speed was fixed at a certain value the speed loss could not be recognized therefore an alternative tip to handle the speed loss had to be considered if the ship had to be steered with large difference the rudder deflection angle was roughly commanded from 5 10 since more time was needed to follow the waypoint after course changing the smaller rudder angle of less than 5 had to be taken into account by trial and error 3 5 was regarded as a criterion to judge whether the ship executed the course change or not in other words if there was a speed loss with rudders deflected over 3 5 then the rpm was not added or reduced of course since the value of 3 5 was empirically determined there was much room for improvement it has to be further studied to replicate the sailing simulation of a ship by following a command speed if the rpm at an arbitrary moment can be known it is possible to predict the torque used in propulsion based on the propeller open water test results as shown in eq 10 k q j p p o r t and k q j p s t b d were obtained from the propeller open water tests power can be estimated from eq 11 in the previous researches you et al 2017b 2018 significant wave height and wave direction affected the tendency of quantitative error between predicted power and measured power since the average value during the entire voyage had been regarded to be offset here the interaction effect of significant wave height and wave direction on the rpm power relation was ignored 10 q p p o r t ρ n 2 d p 5 k q j p p o r t q p s t b d ρ n 2 d p 5 k q j p s t b d 11 p o w e r 2 π n q p p o r t q p s t b d 2 5 determination of the operating mode for me gi engine and gcu and the fuel property since in terms of operational efficiency ship owners preferred to install the me gi engine it was assumed that the lngc had two me gi engines specifically the 5g70me c9 5 gi that was manufactured by man man dieselturbo 2017 the amount of fuel consumption was estimated by using the sgc and spoc curves specified in the engine specification sgc had the minimum value at the engine load of approximately 60 80 and the value increased when the required engine load increased more than 80 or decreased below 60 namely the amount of the lng fuel required to generate unit power over 80 or under 60 conditions was more a document published by man showed sgc and spoc values at the engine load of 50 75 and 100 man dieselturbo 2017 a representative example was that when the engine load was 75 sgc was 130 7 g kwh although the sgc and spoc values written for the engine loads from 30 100 were used in the calculation the disclosed values were only referred to due to the security policy of the specification pilot oil was also considered to estimate the amount of fuel consumption and spoc values were also referred from the specification in the case of pilot oil the spoc values decreased as the engine loads increased this means that as the engine load increases less amount of pilot oil is required to generate unit power the bor from a lng cargo tank in a vessel varies from the type of containment system of course the amount of generated bog depends on whether the re liquefaction unit is activated or not since the re liquefaction unit was not considered here the pressure depended on bor and gcu only fig 8 shows a schematic of the equipment operation considered here in the lng cargo tank bog was generated from the loaded lng due to the heat in leakage the generated bog was supplied to the fuel and gas supply system as the fuel of the me gi engine it was possible to supply the lng as the fuel of the system as well the decision of the fuel supplied to the system depended on the operating scenario of an lngc if the lng cargo tank was filled with the generated bog to a considerable extent from a safety point of view gcu was activated to consistently combust the bog fig 9 shows the assumed operating scenario of the me gi engine and gcu by considering the maximum pressure upper limit and lower limit black solid line blue chain line and red dashed line indicate the lower limit upper limit and maximum pressure respectively of the lng cargo tank the maximum allowable pressure of the lng cargo tank that was being constructed in a shipyard was known to be about 250 mbarg kulitsa and wood 2018 the lower limit and upper limit were commonly determined to confirm the gcu operating scenario and they were specified as 20 and 80 of the maximum pressure of the cargo tank kulitsa and wood 2018 man and turbo 2014 since the generated bog increased the pressure in the lng cargo tank the gcu had to be activated to reduce the tank pressure the gcu was essential equipment for the safety of the lng cargo tank since the re liquefaction unit was not considered here therefore it was possible for the simulation to be realistic by considering the operating scenario of the gcu it was assumed that the bog compressor and gcu were stopped to protect the cargo tank from vacuum eq 12 is used to calculate the amount of accumulated bog in the cargo tank and the varied pressure according to the bog the amount of generated bog depended on the bor since the re liquefaction unit was not considered here it had been reported that the bor on operating vessels ranges from about 0 075 0 150 day igu 2017 in this paper the bor of the vessel was initially assumed to be 0 150 day and to be maintained as a constant during the voyage when the effect of bor on the operating cost was investigated bors of 0 125 0 100 and 0 075 day were additionally considered and they were assumed to be maintained during a voyage here it was assumed that the heat energy flowing into the lng cargo spreads evenly throughout all the lng cargo and the temperature of the lng rose equally as the cargo tank temperature increased the cargo tank pressure also increased based on the calculation result by the commercial thermodynamic analysis program hysys a figure of 385 694 248 kj of heat energy flowing into the lng to increase the pressure from 50 mbarg to 190 mbarg was obtained it was the same as the energy of evaporating 741 9 ton of lng since a linear relationship was assumed between the tank pressure and the amount of heat ingress or bog accumulation eq 13 was derived the lng composition used for the properties was that used in nigeria national energy technology laboratory 2005 12 q h e a t m l n g c p d t 13 p t 0 19 a c c u m u l a t e d b o g 50 0 there are two methods to supply the me gi engine with fuel by pressurizing the ng with high pressure fuel gas compressor or pressurizing the lng with high pressure pump and vaporizing with vaporizer in the early stage of developing the me gi engine the high pressure pump and vaporizer were considered for the fuel gas supply system due to the lower electric power consumption however usage of the ng as fuel was more preferable than combustion of bog on gcu or re liquefaction of bog by the re liquefaction unit by considering the trend it was assumed that the two kinds of fuel and gas supply system that identified the acronym for the me gi engine were installed in the vessel the high pressure fuel gas compressor was preferentially used but if the pressure in the cargo tank was low and the fuel gas supply by bog was not possible the high pressure pump and vaporizer system was activated choi 2014 it was assumed that there was no difference in the operating cost due to the method of supplying the fuel gas although the actual cost of supplying the bog as fuel consumed more energy than that of supplying the lng it was assumed that the initial pressure of the cargo tank defined the lower limit of the cargo tank pressure since the lower limit was used as the criterion for the normal loading unloading work since the pressure in the cargo tank was larger than the lower limit the bog was basically supplied to the main engine as fuel if the amount of bog supplied to the main engine as fuel was smaller than the nbog during a voyage bog accumulated in the lng cargo tank and the pressure in the tank increased this was defined as mode i which continued until the pressure in the cargo tank reached the upper limit from the lower limit since the pressure of the lng cargo tank between the lower limit and the upper limit was regarded as a safe level gcu was deactivated in this mode if the pressure of the tank reached the upper limit the mode was defined as mode ii since the pressure in the tank was regarded as risk condition gcu had to be activated to secure the safety of the cargo tank of course bog was supplied to the main engine as fuel which was helpful in terms of safety the combusted amount of bog through gcu was assumed to be the same as the bor of the tank and it was basically 0 15 day bor dnv 2006 the combusted rate of gcu also changed according to the variation in bor since the gcu capacity was determined to be able to burn the entire nbog in the cargo tanks once bog was supplied to the engine and was combusted through the gcu the pressure in the tanks had to be reduced this was defined as mode iii until the pressure of the cargo tanks reached the lower limit when the pressure reached the lower limit the gcu was turned off this was defined as mode iv when the cargo tank pressure was smaller than the lower limit there was another risk of the lng cargo tank since tanks were always secured from vacuum condition so as to not be damaged therefore bog could not be supplied to the fuel namely the fuel gas compressor was stopped to protect the cargo tank from the vacuum and lng was directly supplied to the engine as fuel and the gcu had to be turned off the amount of accumulated bog was larger than that supplied as fuel therefore it was considered that the mode changes in the order of mode i ii iii iv i since the bog was accumulated in the cargo tank the cargo tank pressure increased from the lower limit after the ship started toward the destination as mode i when the pressure reached the upper limit the mode became mode ii since bog was supplied to the engine and combusted through gcu the pressure of cargo tank decreased after the pressure was smaller than the upper limit as mode iii bog was supplied to the engine and combusted through the gcu until the tank pressure reached the lower limit when the pressure was smaller than the lower limit the mode became mode iv during mode iv the gcu and the fuel gas compressor had to be stopped consequently bog was again accumulated in the lng cargo tank and the mode became mode i simulations were commonly executed by following the described order on the other hand if the amount of nbog was smaller than the amount of bog consumed in the propulsion it was considered that the mode changed in the order of mode iv i iv the tank pressure decreased from the lower limit to a smaller value under the lower limit after starting the voyage since the amount of bog required in the propulsion was larger than that of nbog the mode became mode iv and lng had to be directly supplied to the engine as fuel since bog was accumulated again the tank pressure increased over the lower limit and the mode became mode i again the change had to be repeated with a short time interval as described if the mode was changed iv i and i iv the fuel supply system was also turned off and turned on continuously namely if the high pressure fuel gas compressor was turned on the high pressure pump and vaporizer system had to be turned off in reality the two fuel gas supply systems were separately operated on each engine to be in equilibrium between nbog and the amount of supplied bog to consistently maintain the simplified operation scenario this kind of parallel operation of the fuel gas supply system was not considered 2 6 evaluation of operating cost considering lng fuel and mgo here the operating cost was defined as the total expense that was the sum of the lng fuel cost mgo cost and the combusted bog cost at the final destination the combusted bog cost was obtained by multiplying the price of lng fuel and the liquefied amount of the combusted amount of bog the cost of the combusted bog was included in the lng fuel cost since rpm and power at an arbitrary time could be estimated from the sailing simulation the operating cost was also estimated by considering the sgc and spoc curve and solving eqs 14 16 the specified sgc and spoc were used to know the amount of lng fuel and pilot oil to generate the necessary power as shown in eq 15 the total amount of fuel used in the voyage can be estimated by accumulating the fgc and fpoc required to generate the power at an arbitrary time during the entire voyage since the lng fuel cost and mgo cost were respectively obtained from eqs 14 and 15 the operating cost at the final destination could be estimated by adding the lng fuel cost and mgo cost from eq 16 14 f g c t i t f p o w e r t s g c f p o w e r d t f p o c t i t f p o w e r t s p o c f p o w e r d t 15 l n g f u e l c o s t l n g f u e l p r i c e f g c m g o c o s t m g o p r i c e f p o c 16 o p e r a t i n g c o s t l n g f u e l c o s t m g o c o s t the prices of lng fuel and mgo were assumed as the actual price on the 8th december 2017 by referring to the bunker price of vancouver harbor which was disclosed by ship bunker https shipandbunker com fig 10 shows the time histories of lng fuel and mgo price from 1st july 2017 for 180 days in vancouver harbor during the period the prices of lng fuel and mgo roughly increased since the operating costs could not be estimated by considering the fluctuating fuel price the fuel price was selected for that on 8th december 2017 as 298 0 for lng fuel and 708 0 for mgo 2 7 detailed simulation procedure fig 11 shows the calculation procedure of estimating the operating cost during a voyage until the ship reaches the final destination to unload the lng cargo the grey section in fig 11 indicates the simulation modules proposed in previous research you et al 2018 first of all waypoints corresponding to the actual sea route of the ship time in utc at each waypoint environmental conditions and command speed were determined in order to carry out the sailing simulation time in utc latitude longitude sog and stw were obtained from the ais data wind speed wind direction significant wave height mean wave period and wave direction were predicted from the ecmwf database the ship moved from an arbitrary location to the next waypoint while maintaining the command speed the ship s behavior was calculated by solving the maneuvering equations of motion as shown in eq 3 and the detailed solving process was described in the previous researches you et al 2017a 2017b 2018 the calculation was performed with constant time step here 1 s rpm and power were estimated every second you et al 2018 described in detail the scheme of how to follow the waypoint and control the rudder deflection angle it was possible to predict the pressure of the cargo tank at an arbitrary time by calculating the amount of bog in the tank there are four modes of the main engine and gcu according to the pressure in the tank as shown in fig 10 and table 3 since the lng fuel could be supplied as both liquid and gas by using different equipment how to supply the lng fuel to the main engines was determined likewise the gcu could be activated or deactivated according to the determined mode fgc and fpoc could be calculated by using eq 15 because the sgc and spoc were known through the given engine specification by multiplying the sgc and spoc by the price per unit weight of each fuel as summarized in table 5 it was possible to calculate the operating cost for an arbitrary time the calculation was repeated until the ship reached the final destination table 4 shows the detailed sequence to evaluate the operating cost and description of the input execution and output to improve the readability among the written equations all information of a ship is known including the resistance self propulsion maneuvering seakeeping sea route environmental conditions and unique values for equipment operation based on the information maneuvering simulation started as shown in step 1 the values of u i v i r i x g i y g i ψ i δ p o r t i δ s t b d i and n i were set for the initial state of the simulation after solving eqs 1 5 and 7 and 9 for a timestep of 1 s u i 1 v i 1 r i 1 x g i 1 y g i 1 ψ i 1 δ p o r t i 1 and δ s t b d i 1 were updated to estimate n i 1 and u i 1 was compared with the command speed and k q j p p o r t i 1 and k q j p s t b d i 1 were predicted as shown in step 2 from the m l n g i 1 and bor the pressure of the lng cargo tank denoted as p t i 1 and mode denoted as m o d e i 1 were updated as shown in step 3 by considering sgc and spoc corresponding to the engine load eq 14 was solved to estimate f g c i 1 and f p o c i 1 as shown in step 4 eq 15 was solved to estimate the lng fuel cost and mgo cost as shown in step 5 finally the operating cost could be obtained by solving eq 16 as shown in step 6 the sequence was repeated with 1 s intervals until the ship reached the final destination 3 basic scenario for the simulation 3 1 one way sea route obtained from the ais data in this study the actual sea route of an lngc was used to estimate the operating cost the route shown in fig 12 was recorded through the ais device on board since red dots in fig 12 are marked on the recorded locations of the lngc the red lines from west africa to japan are together perceived as the entire sea route representatively time in utc latitude longitude sog and stw were recorded after loading the lng cargo the lngc started from an lng terminal in nigeria on may 20 2016 the ship sailed through cape town madagascar and the strait of malacca and then arrived at an lng terminal in japan on june 17 2016 taking about 26 days sailing time the recorded location was assumed as a waypoint that the ship had to follow in the sailing simulation 3 2 environmental condition obtained from the ecmwf database environmental conditions were predicted from the ecmwf database according to the recorded time in utc and the location since the grid size of ecmwf database was 0 25 0 25 and the time interval was 6 h the environmental conditions including wind and waves were acquired at the closest node of the grid and closest time the feasibility of the ecmwf database was verified by comparing the environmental data obtained from full scale measurement with those obtained from the ecmwf database in previous research you et al 2017b the tendency of the full scale measurement data matched well with that of the ecmwf database consequently the predicted environmental conditions were regarded as the actual environmental conditions that the ship had encountered the acquired environmental conditions were assumed as a representative environmental data for the sea route in other words this means that the environmental conditions were assumed to be always identical depending on the location of the ship even if the ship passed through a waypoint at any time due to different speed the assumption was closely connected to the purpose of this research if different environmental conditions were considered during a voyage with different speed it was hard to analyze the effect of the sailing speed on the operating cost due to the plural variables like speed wind and waves consequently here other parameters than the command speed of the ship had to be fixed fig 13 shows the time histories of absolute wind speed and wind direction obtained from the ecmwf database for about 26 days black squares denote the absolute wind speed while blue circles denote the absolute wind direction fig 14 shows the time histories of the significant wave height and wave direction from the ecmwf database for about 26 days after the ship left west africa black squares denote the significant wave height while blue circles denote the absolute wave direction the predicted environmental conditions from the ecmwf database matched well with the statistical data written in the young s research young 1999 in general the ship sailed for the entire voyage under mild weather conditions they showed similar tendencies and the difference could be regarded as ignorable 3 3 simulation plan to predict the economic speed of the lngc kowalski 2013 estimated the operating cost of a bulk carrier whose speed ranges 10 5 14 5 knots to determine the efficient speed the service speed of a bulk carrier was 7 33 m s about 14 25 knots by reviewing the average speed of bulk carriers assuming liner shipping szelangiewicz and zelazny 2016 here a 174k lngc was used to estimate the operating cost since the sailing speed of an lngc was higher than that of a bulk carrier the speed range had to be changed the service speed of the lngc is 19 4 knots as shown in table 1 based on the value the maximum speed of an lngc was assumed to be 20 0 knots the operating cost was estimated for the speed ranging 12 20 knots at 1 knot interval 3 4 feasibility of the sailing simulation since the verified mathematical model was used the feasibility check could be simply carried out by comparing the simulated route and speed of the ship with the recorded sea route from the ais data and the command speed from the comparisons the simulation could be regarded as the appropriate results to acquire the aim of this research since there were 9 tested speeds from 12 knots to 20 knots at 1 knot interval it was hard to recognize all the results in a figure to improve the readability the simulated route and speed were only plotted for the maximum speed and the minimum speed fig 15 shows the comparison between recorded sea routes and simulated sea routes of an lngc for the entire voyage black solid lines indicate the sea route recorded from the ais data blue squares and red circles indicate the routes with simulated speed of 20 and 12 knots the simulated sea routes are well matched with the recorded route since fig 15 was plotted to show the entire voyage it was necessary to also plot the sea route as an enlarged section in detail a rectangle is marked near the cape of good hope fig 16 shows the comparison between the recorded sea routes and simulated sea routes of an lngc near the cape of good hope with simulated speed of 20 and 12 knots since the ship was steered with large difference near the area it is helpful for the reader to perceive the feasibility the definitions of solid line and symbols are identical to those in fig 15 even if the sea route was enlarged the simulated sea routes were well matched with the recorded route as well slight deviation resulted from the controllability that could be secured in a ship since the ship could only have directional stability in the case of a merchant ship having propellers and rudders lewis 1989 the ship could not follow the waypoints under environmental loads without error in terms of feasibility study the simulated routes were regarded as acceptable fig 17 shows the time histories of the simulated speed of an lngc for the entire voyage of the ship with 20 and 12 knots since the simulation was conducted by following the command speed the simulated speed was only plotted in this figure only blue squares and red circles denote the simulated speed by following the command speeds of 20 and 12 knots respectively since the sailing speed of the ship was different it took a different time to arrive at the final destination when the ship sailed at 20 knots the ship was operated for about 23 days on the other hand at 12 knots the ship sailed for about 38 days as mentioned it seems that the ship was well operated by following the command speed of 20 and 12 knots speed loss due to course change or speed increase after course change is observed as shown in fig 17 since the phenomenon was observed during a relatively short period the effect of the speed loss and speed increase on the averaged speed for the entire voyage could be ignored table 5 shows the comparison of the command speed with the average speed during the simulation the simulated speeds are always smaller than the command speeds roughly the errors between the command speed and the average speed are under 0 3 the observed errors are even smaller than the anticipated error of 0 4 in the decision of rules for rpm control the calculated error was regarded as of ignorable value fig 18 shows the estimated time of arrival of the lngc according to the command speeds black squares denote the estimated time of arrival summarized in table 5 if the distance is fixed there is an inverse relationship between the travel time and velocity according to the distance speed time formula of t r a v e l t i m e d i s t a n c e v e l o c i t y the distances of the voyage were always the same because the lngc was simulated from an lng terminal in west africa to an lng terminal in japan it was recognized that the tendency of the estimated time of arrival was in inverse proportion to the command speed fig 19 shows the average rpm and average power of the lngc during the entire voyage according to the command speeds black squares and blue circles denote the average rpm and average power respectively fig 19 shows that as the command speed increases the average power increases drastically this shows the general feature of relation between speed rpm and power since the tendencies also matched the physics the simulation could be regarded as the appropriate results the feature could be understood based on physical knowledge the resistance of a ship is in proportion to the square of the ship speed lewis 1989 thrust is in proportion to n2 according to eq 4 consequently the rpm of a ship is in direct proportion to the ship speed the characteristic is easily found in the speed rpm curve of a ship behrendt and kucharski 1997 furthermore eq 9 shows the relation between the rpm and power of a ship power is in direct proportion to n3 if sgc and spoc are assumed as constants the fuel consumption will be in direct proportion to n3 as well of course since sgc and spoc values were variables depending on the engine loads the tendency of the fuel consumption had to be different according to the description since the operating cost is evaluated by multiplying the price of the fuel by the fuel consumption it will be assumed to be in direct proportion to n3 4 discussion on the simulation results 4 1 simulated operating cost not considering gas combustion fig 20 shows the evaluated lng fuel cost mgo cost and total operating cost of the lngc according to the command speeds black solid line with squares blue chain line with circles and red dashed line with diamonds denote the lng fuel cost mgo cost and total operating cost respectively as described sgc values ranging 60 80 of the maximum engine load were relatively small since the mcr of an engine was about 13 000 kw the smaller sgc values were considered from 17 5 20 knots consequently larger sgc values had to be used to predict the fuel consumption below 17 5 knots this made the slope of the lng fuel cost at under 17 knots high on the other hand the slope of the necessary power according to the command speed under 17 knots seems to be steep the tendency of the mgo cost was definitely different from that of the lng fuel cost although the command speed increased the mgo cost was kept similarly as explained as the engine load increased spoc values consistently decreased this feature of the spoc curve affected the evaluated mgo cost although the mgo cost varies insignificantly according to the command speed the tendency of the total operating cost seems to be similar to that of the lng fuel cost but the slope becomes somewhat gradual it is possible to conclude that the two features due to the sgc curve and spoc curve make the tendency of the total operating cost accord with the command speed as shown in fig 20 the total operating cost is not in proportion to n3 or a cubic square of the command speed it was different from that anticipated from a simple mathematical model and assumptions this could be understood from a referred paper that showed the operating cost according to the sailing speed meyer et al 2012 in general the slower the ship the smaller the operating cost this feature is so called slow steaming slow steaming which is a well known feature of today s shipping means the low load operation of an engine or low speed operation of a ship to reduce the fuel consumption and carbon emissions if a simplified mathematical model was used that did not consider the sgc and spoc values the operating cost was in proportion to n3 or a cubic square of the speed as discussed however the benefit of slow steaming was not proportional to a cubic of the speed since there were some ignorance of lubricating oil and other considerations meyer et al 2012 4 2 simulated operating cost considering gas combustion although slow steaming was a premise to understand the operation efficiency of a ship it was not pursued due to actual factors in terms of the shipping since the aim was to evaluate the operating cost by considering the equipment operation here consideration of the lng cargo containment system and gcu was implemented by referring to the range of bor in a lng cargo tank the effect of bor on the operating cost was investigated according to the evenly divided bor conditions of 0 15 0 125 0 10 and 0 075 day fig 21 shows the operating cost according to the command speeds and bor the operating cost means the total expenditure for a ship to arrive at the final destination black solid line with squares blue chain line with circles red dashed line with diamonds orange broken line with right triangles and green dotted line with left triangles indicate the estimated operating cost by considering bors of zero 0 15 0 125 0 10 and 0 075 day respectively the tendency of the evaluated operating cost by considering bor and gas combustion was definitely changed in the case of the bors of 0 15 and 0 125 day in comparison with that of the cost not considering bor as ship speed decreased for the bors the operating cost increased this means that the benefit due to slow steaming disappeared since the cost for the combusted bog increased substantially in other words although less fuel was consumed with the low speed condition more bog was generated and had to be combusted to secure the safety of the lng cargo tank furthermore since the slow speed increased the estimated time of arrival more bog had to be wasted on the whole the operating cost was significantly affected by bor since the amount of bog was determined according to bor as bor became small the operating cost became small if the bor was reduced by about 0 025 day in the lngc by following a command speed the operating cost was reduced by about 300 000 usd at the given speed for the operating cost by considering bors of 0 100 and 0 075 day there were inflection points as the minimum cost at a certain command speed in addition there was a range of command speed where slow steaming was still applicable in fig 21 there were some points where the evaluated cost was identical whether bor was considered or not for bors of 0 100 and 0 075 day this indicates that there was no need to combust bor with those speeds and the ship could arrive at the final destination before the pressure of the lng cargo tank reached the upper limit within the range where slow steaming was applicable there was a speed to be anticipated for the minimum operating cost for a certain bor the minimum speed was 20 18 and 16 knots for bors of 0 125 0 100 and 0 075 day respectively the minimum speed for the bor of 0 15 day might be higher than 20 knots since the amount of combusted bog was relatively larger than that of bog used to propulsion this means that the operating cost of the lng with bor of 0 15 day decreased for the sea route as the ship arrived at the final destination early 4 3 estimated lng cargo at the final destination the loadage to be unloaded of the lngc at an arrived lng terminal had been empirically anticipated according to the sea route since bor and gcu activation were considered during the sailing simulation by considering the hydrodynamic characteristics of the vessel it was possible to predict the remaining lng cargo at the final destination this was considered an additional advantage of the suggested approach the loaded lng cargo was assumed by considering a filling ratio of 98 for the lngc dobrota et al 2013 the amount of remaining lng cargo was compared based on the loaded amount of lng fig 22 shows the remaining lng cargo at the final destination according to the command speed and bor the definition of each line is identical to that used in fig 21 as the ship sailed and bog was supplied to generate the thrust as fuel the loadage became small if bor and the limitation of the lng cargo pressure were not considered bog was only used as the fuel accordingly as the command speed increased the final loadage decreased by considering the gcu and combustion of bog due to safety reasons the tendency was changed as the ship arrived at the final destination late due to slow speed the amount of combusted bog increased while the remaining lng cargo decreased it is well known that bor is an important parameter to determine the remaining lng cargo for a voyage if bor was 0 15 day it was inevitable to combust the bog from 20 12 knots if a ship had the lng cargo tank with bor of 0 15 day the fastest speed was helpful to increase the loadage the maximum loadage for bors of 0 125 0 100 and 0 075 day were observed at 16 18 and 20 knots respectively since the combusted bog was considered as the operating cost there is no doubt that by comparing the tendency of the operating cost the tendency of the remaining lng cargo was inverted 5 conclusion in this paper we constructed a new approach to estimate the operating cost by developing direct cost evaluation in consideration of the hydrodynamic characteristics of a vessel sea route environmental conditions and equipment operation in detail the ship design information model test results and calculation results regarding the resistance self propulsion maneuvering and seakeeping performance were considered the sea route was obtained from an ais device and environmental conditions are acquired from the ecmwf database furthermore the equipment operation for me gi engines and the gcu and fuel property were additionally considered direct cost evaluation was conducted based on the sailing simulation by following the obtained sea route under the predicted environmental condition three conclusions are derived as follows first the observed slow steaming was investigated on the basis of the hydrodynamic characteristics of the vessel and the equipment installed on the vessel by simulating the actual operation although slow steaming had been empirically perceived in the field of shipping it was hard to quantitatively analyze the effect of a parameter on the operating cost by constructing a mathematical model that includes the hull propeller rudder environmental loads engine and fuel property it was possible to replicate the slow steaming observed on a ship consequently it was perceived that the operating cost was not in proportion to n3 or a cubic square of the speed since it was affected by sgc and spoc features the benefit of slow steaming became weakened since the slope of the operating cost according to the command speed was gradual second the additional consideration of the gcu to secure the safety of the lng cargo tank definitely reversed the tendency of the evaluated operating cost according to the command speed since the necessary power to make the speed of the ship slow was smaller the amount of accumulated bog became larger this affected the starting time of gcu activation and more bog had to be combusted to lower the pressure in the cargo tank furthermore since the low speed increased the estimated time of arrival the total amount of combusted bog increased this resulted in the increase of operating cost third there was a speed range within which slow steaming was effective and the most efficient speed was observed at the lowest speed of that range bor was a key parameter to determine the effective range here the operating cost was investigated for the bor from 0 15 0 075 day at 0 025 day intervals and for the command speed from 20 12 knots at 1 knot intervals as bor increased the values of the effective range increased for the given sea route and environmental conditions the efficient speed of the lngc was observed at 16 18 and 20 knots for the bors of 0 075 0 100 and 0 125 day there was an additional benefit of efficient speed in that the lngc could deliver more lng cargo at the efficient speed this research made it possible to determine the efficient speed by considering the various features of the vessel it will be helpful for ship owners to make a navigation plan of their fleet after this research was finalized some supplementary items were perceived since the predicted efficient speed was for a one way voyage with the design draft it has to be further developed to secure the appropriateness for entire voyages by considering the design draft and ballast draft together from the macroscopic point of view more factors affecting the operating cost have to be considered and these include the number of seafarers on board and their salaries freight charge and the etd and eta a study of the various scenarios of equipment operation will be meaningful to disclose economic operation in the shipping field 6 nomenclature abbreviation abbreviation full meaning imo international maritime organization eedi energy efficiency design index eeoi energy efficiency operational

has been a large interest among maritime industries in terms of mariners comfort and marine environmental protection the objective of this study is to propose and validate practical computational methods to predict near field propeller cavitation noise by complementary use of viscous cfd and semi empirical formula acoustic analogical method represented by ffowcs williams hawkings equation is not utilized at all in the present study four different propellers equipped on actual ships are of the interest cavitation phenomena around these propellers are reproduced by viscous cfd simulations behind full scale ship wake time series of pressure fluctuations as well as the area of cavitation extent on the blades are logged the former is directly utilized to quantify the level of tonal noise at near field while the latter is utilized to estimate upper bound of broadband noise together with the brown s semi empirical formula the proposed methods accurately estimate the tonal noise up to 3rd blade frequency in the meantime upper limit of broadband noise is well predicted in comparison to the measurement results the present method is very practical and thus it can be one of the criteria to estimate propeller cavitation noise in the near field keywords marine propeller cavitation underwater ship radiated noise environmental protection viscous cfd 1 introduction underwater ship radiated noise usrn has been a large interest among maritime industries in terms of mariners comfort as well as marine environmental protection two major components of underwater ship radiated noise are 1 low frequency and periodic machinery noise which is originated from main and auxiliary engines and 2 tonal and broadband noise which is originated from marine propulsors although the former is important the latter is the most dominant noise source under the normal navigation speed and thus is of interest in the present study in 1995 international council for the exploration of the sea released the guidelines of underwater ship radiated noise for fishery research vessels mitson 1995 in 2014 international maritime organization has released the guidelines for the reduction of underwater noise from commercial shipping to address adverse impacts on marine life international maritime organization imo 2014 the former directly regulates the upper limit of radiated sound pressure level spl while the latter regulates the 1st and 2nd blade rate harmonic amplitudes of stern pressure fluctuation depending on the block coefficient c b of the ship european union countries organized several research projects e g silenv badino et al 2013 aquo audoly et al 2014 and sonic bureau veritasdnv 2015 to investigate experimental and computational methods for assessing environmental impact of underwater ship radiated noise more recently the recommendation has been made by convention of biological diversity subsidiary body on scientific technical and technological advice cbd sbstta on 2016 that the ratifiers should prepare toolkits for assessment of usrn the subsidiary body on scientific technical and technological advice 2016 since computational methods will be one of the essential factors for such toolkits the present study focuses on their development numerical estimation of propeller cavitation and resultant noise are usually challenging since the flow field around cavitating propeller contains multiscale flow physics i e phase change of the fluid turbulence unsteady loading on the propeller blade and so on therefore the propeller cavitation noise has both tonal and broadband frequencies to capture such noise characteristics local pressure fluctuation around noise source needs to be predicted accurately modeling dynamics of cavitation bubble around rotating propeller by nonlinear rayleigh plesset equation with thermodynamic interaction kamiirisa and goto 2005 contributes to estimate pressure fluctuation with high frequency and resultant broadband noise yet this method requires assumptions in volumetric change of cavitation bubble in time as well as distribution of bubble radius the semi empirical formulae based on model and full scale measurements brown 1976 wittekind 2014 wittekind and schuster 2016 bureau veritasdnv 2015 are able to provide rough estimation in the upper bound of spl this method is practical and suitable at initial design stage of hull and propeller yet sufficient number of measurement campaigns in model and full scale are necessary to construct database for these formulae which are usually expensive in cost and time viscous computational fluid dynamics cfd can be one of the alternatives to compensate the disadvantages of former two methods unsteady propeller cavitation is solved by reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation together with appropriate cavitation and turbulence models far field noise can be calculated by complementary use of acoustic analogical method represented by ffowcs williams hawkings fwh wave propagation equation and viscous cfd the fw h method has widely been accepted in the field of aeroacoustics see for instance farassat 2007 according to international towing tank conference ittc specialist committee on hydrodynamic noise specialist committee on hydrodynamic noise 2017 rapid development is on going in the application of fw h method together with viscous cfd to hydroacoustic problem specifically for propeller radiated noise recent studies for such investigation can be found in kellet et al 2013 ianiello et al 2014a ianiello et al 2013 ianiello et al 2014b lloyd et al 2015 li et al 2015 bensow and liefvendahl 2016 lidtke et al 2016 and ianiello 2016 these studies solve flows around non cavitating and cavitating propellers via viscous cfd simulations the permeable surface termed fw h surface in the propeller vicinity is prepared as a part of computational domain in such a way that the local flows around a propeller are included inside the fw h surface acoustic sources originated from flow physics inside the fw h surface are modeled as monopole dipoles and quadrupoles these acoustic sources are then mapped onto the fw h surface and the fw h wave propagation equation is solved to evaluate pressure fluctuation emitted from the fw h surface the pressure waves are evaluated at arbitrary receivers located inside or outside of the computational domain received pressure fluctuations in time are subjected to frequency analysis and are converted to spl this method is able to carry out local flow analysis around a propeller and investigation of its hydroacoustic wave propagation to the far field at the same time yet the fw h equation cannot take the effect of marine environmental conditions into consideration vertical and lateral distribution of profiles of acoustic speed under the water strongly affect to the propagation path of the acoustic wave urick 1982 in the meantime reflections from free surface and seabed can sometimes not be ignored holford 1981 as the ittc specialist committee on hydrodynamic noise 2017 stated numerical predictions for acoustic wave propagation under the water are well established such as normal mode method and parabolic equation method for which marine environmental condition can rigorously be considered as input parameters for simulation tappert et al 1977 urick 1983 another computational method is to separate estimation of spl and acoustic wave propagation under the water dominant frequencies and their spl originated from a propeller vicinity are estimated by viscous cfd and or cfd semi empirical specialist committee on hydrodynamic noise 2017 methods and these results become inputs for simulations of underwater acoustic wave propagation taking marine environmental effects into consideration in the meantime some input parameters to the semi empirical formulae wittekind 2014 can be extracted from solutions of viscous cfd simulations according to these backgrounds the present study aims to investigate the validity of viscous cfd and cfd semi empirical methods to estimate propeller cavitation noise in the near field in model and full scale the definition of near field in this manuscript means that 1 hydrophone is flush mounted on ships bottom in their stern vicinity and or 2 distance of closest point of approach between the propeller equipped on the target hull and the measurement ship with drooping hydrophone is approximately 100 m four cases of cavitating propellers are of the interest in the present study as step by step investigation initial validations are carried out to understand the capability of viscous cfd for non cavitating propellers operating in uniform flow then the propeller cavitation simulations behind the ship wake are carried out to validate cavitation pattern and extent of propeller cavitation in time since some measurement data are quite limited necessary conditions to simulate propeller cavitation are also estimated by viscous cfd after these validations and preparations propeller cavitation noise in the near field is directly estimated from viscous cfd acoustic analogical approach is not utilized at all maximum extent of propeller cavitation on the blade surface is extracted from viscous cfd solution and becomes the input for the brown s semi empirical formula brown 1976 estimated frequencies and spl are validated with the available experimental data in model and full scale followed by this introduction chapter 2 presents the computational methods of viscous cfd and propeller cavitation noise

transport k ω sst based detached eddy simulation des is selected the reason to choose des instead of unsteady rans urans is its better capability to capture detail vortical structure than urans at blade tip riera et al 2016 capturing low pressure region at the core of tip vortex will yield better resolution in tip vortex cavitation tvc the des model utilized in the present study switches rans

figures are not shown in this manuscript visualization of ϕ in a computational domain confirms that les region is activated slightly away from the blades and behind the hub to model rotation of a propeller two methods are utilized for steady simulations e g uniform flow computations to estimate propeller open water characteristics poc moving reference frame mrf approach is adopted for mrf approach computational domain is separated into mrf region and the outside of mrf region the governing equations solved inside the mrf region take the effect of centrifugal and coriolis force due to

exchanged through cell faces with appropriate coordinate transformations in the present study the mrf region is rotator and the outside region is stator which will be explained in section 3 3 for unsteady simulations e g non uniform flow computations to estimate propeller cavitation dynamic overset grid is adopted this method will also be described in section 3 3 the boundary layer is assumed

model scale data was measured at small sized cavitation tunnel with ship wake generated by wire mesh screen while the full scale measurement was carried out using two hydrophones flush mounted on the

b and ship c can be found in kamiirisa et al 2017 to determine configuration and necessary data for propeller cavitation simulation three viscous cfd simulations are carried out as a pre process for cavitation simulation for ship b and ship c summarized in table 3 p1 is necessary to obtain poc to tune inflow velocity profile which will be explained in section 3 7 when ships are running the i in eq 7 could be different to that of still water configuration due to changes of running attitude as well as to the wave elevation at the propeller plane therefore p2 is necessary to set realistic i and resultant σ n full scale ship wake is simulated by p3 and the results are utilized as the inflow boundary condition bc to the cavitation simulation although no validation data are available for full scale wake in ship b and ship c this is still reasonable approach according to the ittc the specialist committee on scaling of wake field 2011 3 3 computational grid and boundary conditions the coordinate system is right handed cartesian and its center is coincident with the boss center of a propeller the flow direction is x negative to x positive and the propeller rotates clockwise around x axis observing from downstream fig 3 presents the computational grid for case 1 in the vicinity of the propeller it consists of two cylindrical volume parts e g stator for which the computational domain remains stationary during the simulation and rotator for which the computational domain rotates together with the propeller motion most of the computational domain are discretized using hexahedral cells while prism cells are generated in the region where hexahedral cells cannot be prepared due to geometrical constraint nondimensional viscous length y is close to 1 to meet the requirement for the present turbulence model to advect imposed non uniform velocity profile which will be explained in section 3 7 to the propeller plane with less numerical diffusion isotropic local refinement is placed from inflow boundary to 0 6dp downstream of the propeller measured from coordinate center local refinements are also placed at 50 of propeller radius termed r r 0 5 toward the tip to resolve sheet and tip vortex cavitation stretching ratio of the grid in the wall normal direction is set less than 1 25 since excessive stretching ratio also causes undesirable numerical diffusion the growth rate of the cell from fine region to coarse region is set in such a way that 2 to 4 layers are set between the region of mesh size transition the mesh arrangements on the propeller blade e g grid spacing near the leading edge and trailing edge the height and the number of prism layer toward the blade normal direction are set according to the results of parametric study by kawamura et al 2004 who utilized the same turbulence model as the present study as an overset assemble process cells in each region are flagged as 1 donor 2 receptor 3 active and 4 inactive fig 4 a b and c show the example of overset grid arrangements for cavitation simulation for case 1 in fig 4b and c the cells colored by light green are active cells where governing equations are solved the cells colored by red are inactive cells where governing equations are not solved the cells colored by blue are receptor the donor cells around the receptor are searched using linear scheme with shape function of spanning tetrahedron which means that one receptor has 4 donor stencils the donor cells in stator provide flux variables to receptor cells in rotator and vice versa the flux variables f are interpolated from donor cells to a receptor cell as 8 f r e c e p t o r i α i f i d o n o r where i is the cell id and α i is the interpolation coefficients for flux variables of donor cell i for unsteady simulations receptor donor relationship as well as α i are updated at every physical time advancement total number of cell is approximately 19m in case 1 and 2 approximately 11m in case 3 and case 4 please notice that the same parameters e g smallest and target cell sizes stretching ratio etc are utilized for grid generation among case 1 through 4 following the past studies ji et al 2011 the distance from the coordinate center to the inflow boundary far field boundary and outflow boundary are 3dp uniform inflow to estimate poc 0 7dp non uniform inflow to estimate propeller cavitation 5dp and 5dp respectively 3 4 flow conditions for cavitation simulation table 4 summarizes the simulation conditions for the present propeller cavitation three representative nondimensional parameters are k t ó n and kempf s reynolds number rnk defined as 9 r n k c 0 7 r v a 2 0 7 π n p d p 2 ν where c 0 7r m is the chord length of the blade section at r r 0 7 v a m s is the advance speed and ν m2 s is fluid kinematic viscosity in the present study v a is estimated through j as shown in eq 10 for which the j is determined by k t identity method utilizing poc estimated from viscous cfd simulations 10 v a n p d p j for case 1 and case 2 n p 20 0 rps is set while n p for case 3 and case 4 cannot be open to public due to non disclosure agreement nda between the data providers and national maritime research institute nmri as explained in section 3 2 k t and ó n must be identical between model and full scale for case 1 and 2 these variables are known from model test and sea trials they are unknown for case 3 and 4 therefore they must be determined by the provided data shown in table 2 together with the results of viscous cfd simulations in table 3 to determine target k t full scale sea trial data are utilized in the sea trial brake power p b kw was measured at certain ship speeds v s m s given the transmission efficiency η t t n in eq 6 can be estimated as 11 t 1000 p b η t v s this variable is plugged into eq 6 together with the other parameters in the denominator to determine k t the σ n is estimated with without ships running attitude and wave elevation at longitudinal propeller position according to the computational results both ship b and ship c run bow up configuration at their target speeds which means that the i in eq 7 becomes larger when ships are running than those in rest it is also found that the wave elevation at longitudinal propeller position for ship b and ship c has positive sign which also contributes to increase i in eq 7 in consequence more severe configurations in cavitation e g ships in still water with smaller σ n are adopted for the present study 3 5 approximate computational resolution of the pressure wave in space and time for the present study according to the solver property cd adapco 2016 it is recommended that 20 cells should be prepared at least to resolve one wave length of pressure wave this approximates maximum frequency f max s hz in space to be resolved in model scale as 12 f m a x s c 0 20 δ 12 khz where c 0 1438 m s is the sound speed in water and δ 6 0e 03 m is the cubic cell size prepared between blade tip and sampling point of the pressure according to the scaling criterion discussed in section 3 6 eq 18 or 21 this f max s corresponds to 3 khz in full scale the size of time step δt s is set in such a way that the propeller rotates 1 0 per physical time advancement with 20 sub iteration this approximates maximum frequency f max t hz in time taking nyquist frequency into consideration as 13 f m a x t 1 2 δ t 3 6 khz according to the scaling criterion by eq 18 or 21 this f max t corresponds to 800 to 900 hz in full scale the time step adopted for the present study is the same as the references ji et al 2011 ji et al 2012 who utilized the same propeller geometries as case 1 and case 2 for cavitation simulations and managed to resolve the pressure fluctuations up to 3rd order blade harmonics accurately with respect to the experimental data yet qualitative diagnostic of the present computational results specifically for cavitation simulation found that the local cfl courant friedrichs lewy number is nearly 3 0 at limited cells very close to the blade at certain time steps the local cfl number for unsteady computation should be less than 1 0 at entire region of the computational domain over whole computational period which can be achieved by smaller δ t although it is trivial to systematically investigate the effect of δ t to the computational results it will be left as one of the future works due to limitation of computational expense 3 6 validation data and variables six physical quantities are chosen as successive validation data for the present study 1 poc 2 pressure distribution on the blade 3 cavitation pattern 4 extent of cavitation 5 spl in model scale and 6 spl in full scale for which they are tightly associated with each other experimental data for these quantities are all available for case 1 and case 2 while only 6 is available for case 3 and case 4 for poc k t k q and η o are subjected to the validation against the experimental data provided in the reference japan ship technology res 1983 for pressure distribution on the blade experimental data measured under uniform flow condition ukon et al 1989 are utilized as validation data pressure coefficient c p is defined by 14 c p p 0 5 ρ n p d p 2 where p pa is the dynamic pressure on the blade its distribution along the chord at r r 0 7 is selected as the validation data for cavitation pattern experimental data by kurobe et al 1983 are utilized as validation data to compare the computational results with the experimental data iso surface of volume fraction 0 1 is adopted in the present study for quantified extent of cavitation experimental data by kudo et al 1989 are utilized as validation data please notice that the dimension of the model propellers as well as cavitation conditions between kurobe et al 1983 and kudo et al 1989 are identical each other measured quantities are the time histories of the area of cavitation a c mm2 on the key blade and the volume of cavitation bubble v c mm3 in the vicinity of the key blade the measurement of these quantities were carried out by a laser beam coupled with charge coupled device to compute a c and v c from the present cfd results the following criteria are utilized 15 a c c f d t i 1 n f s i β i t w h e r e β i t 1 i f α i t 0 1 0 o t h e r w i s e 16 v c c f d t i 1 n c v i α i

extent on the key blade α i t is the instantaneous volume fraction of gas phase n c is the number of cells in the rotator domain and v i mm3 is the volume of discretized cells solution dependencies in a c and v c in terms of the threshold of α i t 0 1 have been assessed using case 1 and case 2 prior to further investigation using the thresholds of 0 25 and 0 5 in a c the maximum difference of 20 the value with α i t 0 1 was found in case 2 by α i t 0 5 yet it yields less than 3 db r e l 1 μ p a h z 1 m in accordance with eq 5 from the acoustical point of view it makes sense to utilize α i t 0 1 to compute the maximum value of a c in v c it was at most 20 smaller e g 140 mm3 when estimated by α i t 0 5 compared to that of α i t 0 1 for both case 1 and case 2 volumetric change of 140 mm3 in cavity bubble is very difficult to visualize at qualitative comparison shown in section 4 2 consequently in terms of comparison in the cavitation pattern between experiment and cfd utilizing α i t 0 1 iso surface makes sense in the present study for spl in model scale experimental data in the reference kato and ukon 1990 are utilized as validation data for case 1 and case 2 point probes in the computational domain are set in such a way that the relative orientations between boss center and point probes are identical to the measurement configuration as shown in fig 2a for case 3 and case 4 point probes in the computational domain are set according to the following criteria set the coordinate origin identical to the boss center based on the coordinate origin longitudinal position is identical to the propeller generator line at r r 0 7 lateral position is shifted 5 d p towards port from coordinate origin and vertical position is d p 2 z t from the coordinate origin for which z t is the tip clearance see fig 5 for the schematic image ukon 1991 such sampling point usually captures maximum amplitude of pressure fluctuation originated from cavitating propellers when the model tests are carried out in a cavitation tunnel with wire mesh screen ukon 1991 in the present study geometry of ship s bottom mounting plate for hydrophone is not modeled in the computational domain to consider the effect of walls the solid boundary factor 2 0 according to the reference hoshino 1979 is multiplied to the pressure fluctuation subjected to the frequency analysis for spl in full scale experimental data in the reference japan ship technology res 1983 for case 1 and case 2 and the reference kamiirisa et al 2017 for case 3 and case 4 are utilized as validation data since all the computations are carried out in model scale scaling criteria are applied to obtain the spl in full scale in case 1 and case 2 levkovskii s method is utilized according to the reference japan ship technology res 1983 as 17 λ d p s d p m 18 f s f m 1 λ σ n s σ n m 0 5 v s v m 19 δ s p l s p l s s p l m 20 l o g 10 λ 1 5 σ n s σ n m 0 5 v s v m r m r s where the subscripts of m and s denote model and full scale respectively and v s m n ps pm d ps pm in the present study σ n is identical between model experiment and full scale measurement and thus σ ns σ nm 1 the receiver position from the noise source is geometrically similar between model and full scale and thus r m r s 1 λ n pm and n ps is set to 1200 rpm and 163 rpm respectively in case 3 and case 4 levkovskii s method was applied first yet the agreement between computational results and full scale measurements was not satisfactory therefore the correction formulae suggested by the ittc the specialist committee on hydrodynamic noise of the 28th ittc 2017 is utilized as 20 λ d p s d p m 21 f s f m n s n m σ n s σ n m 0 5 22 δ s p l 20 l o g 10 λ z r m r s x σ n s σ n m 0 5 y λ n s n m 0 5 y ρ s ρ m 0 y where r m is the distance from blade tip to the hydrophone location in model scale cfd r s is set to 1 m so that the spl becomes source level ρ s 1025 kg m3 ρ m 998 kg m3 n s rps is the measured data at sea trial and n m rps is the value used for the present cfd simulations ns and nm cannot open to public due to the nda between the data provider and nmri similar to case 1 and case 2 the present cfd holds the law of similarity in σ n therefore σ ns σ nm 1 when the exponents of right hand side rhs in eq 22 is set as x y z 1 1 2 and assume ρ s ρ m the rhs of eq 22 becomes identical to the rhs of eq 19 for case 3 and case 4 the exponents x y z 1 1 1 with ρs ρm gives reasonable scaling which will be discussed in section 4 3 specifically for case 4 3 db is added to the rhs of eq 22 to take the effect of twin screw into consideration e g acoustic energy originated from the propeller is doubled for twin screw configuration assuming in phase rotation between port and starboard in comparison to the single screw configuration 3 7 overall solution procedure fig 6 summarizes overall solution procedure to estimate near field propeller cavitation noise by the complementary use of viscous cfd simulation experimental data in model and full scale and brown s semi empirical formula since most of the procedures have already been explained in chapter 2 and chapter 3 the procedure of wake tuning together with poc is explained herein for the present cavitation simulation axial component of non uniform ship wake is given as the bc at inflow boundary for instance fig 7 shows the ship wake for cavitation simulation in case 1 and case 2 for case 3 and case 4 viscous cfd simulations are carried out in full scale reynolds number based on l pp is 3 50e 08 and 4 14e 08 for ship b and ship c respectively to obtain axial velocity profiles in full scale although these data cannot be open to public due to the nda between the data providers and nmri let the axial component of the ship wake u as a function of position vector x as 23 u c a u x where x is expressed based on the coordinate utilized in the cfd simulation although u is imposed on inflow boundary it is usually not advected to the propeller location maintaining its original profile due to numerical diffusion which violates to achieve target k t to avoid this the correction factor c a is multiplied to the rhs of eq 23 fig 8 describes the schematic image to calculate c a under non cavitating condition imposed u gives a certain value of k t termed k t cal utilizing poc obtained by the cfd simulation the working point termed j cal can be estimated by k t identity method since the target k t is given as one of the parameters for cavitation simulation termed k t target there is the target working point termed j target which can also be estimated by k t identity method the ratio between j cal and j target computes c a as 24 c a j c a l j t a r g e t i f j t a r g e t j c a l j t a r g e t j c a l i f j t a r g e t j c a l such tuning is very similar to the procedure of k t adjustment which is normally carried out at cavitation tunnel experiment changing c a in the cfd simulation is equivalent to controlling the rotation speed of tunnel impeller to change axial velocity maintaining the geometry of wire mesh screen in the experiment in the present study several iterations typically within 2 3 times of this tuning gives k t cal k t target within 3 of difference fig 9 compares the imposed axial velocity profile and tuned axial velocity profile advected to the propeller location at r r 0 5 1 0 which confirms the validity of the proposed tuning method in the overall solution procedure shown in fig 6 two issues should be addressed specifically for computational method of propeller cavitation first issue is its model scale configuration if the propeller cavitation can directly be simulated in full scale correction of scale effect in the estimated spl would not be not necessary however viscous cfd simulation in full scale specifically for propeller cavitation is still likely to be premature to apply its results for engineering assessment and or scientific investigation including usrn estimation available references ponkratov 2017 fujiyama and nakashima 2016 reveal that full scale viscous cfd simulation cannot accurately capture both sheet and tip vortex cavitation in comparison to full scale observation since accurate reproduction in cavitation pattern via numerical simulation is the first priority for the present investigation the configuration of viscous cfd simulation in propeller cavitation is still model scale at this time the second issue is to replace viscous cfd in cavitation simulation by simpler tool for instance inviscid blade element method bem if it is feasible computational expense would be much less than that of the present method the bem will be useful to estimate maximum value of a c however its computational accuracy and physical consistency in pressure fluctuation and volumetric change of cavitation extent in time should be improved further see for instance perali et al 2016 who carried out systematic validation study in the computational results of propeller cavitation and resultant pressure fluctuation obtained from urans and bem once the bem is able to capture pressure fluctuation and spacial extent of cavitation in time with physical consistency it can be another numerical tool in the present solution procedure 4 results 4 1 initial validation in the non cavitating uniform flow case 1 and case 2 fig 10 a and b presents the experimental and the computational results of poc for cp and hsp2 respectively in the figure w o transition represents the results obtained without transition effect of laminar turbulent boundary layer while with transition are the results with transition effect for which γ reθ model malan et al 2009 is utilized it is common among both cp and hsp2 over the entire range of j that the transition turbulence model provides higher values in k t and η o lower value in 10k q relative to the results without transition transition region is typically present at root to r r 0 5 since the circumferential velocity is smaller at the region rather than tip region local rnk is smaller and the boundary layer may be partially laminar from leading edge to a certain chord location the transition model is likely to capture this physics which yields smaller frictional resistance and in consequence smaller 10k q compared to the results without transition at the target k t utilized for the presemt cavitation condition with transition shows smaller difference 0 04 exp for cp than w o transition 2 35 exp compared to the experimental data while it is opposite for hsp2 one issue for the present transition model is that it requires two input parameters i e free stream turbulence intensity and free stream edge value both are important to trigger the onset of boundary layer transition yet these are quite problem dependent and are still open to question for propeller open water computation as well as for computations behind hull non uniform wake in consequence the transition of boundary layer is not considered in the further simulations fig 11 a and b shows the experimental and the computational results of the steady distribution of c p along the chord at r r 0 7 for cp and hsp2 respectively operating in uniform flow the computational results comprehensively agree well with the experimental data both on back and face sides at four different j for both cp and hsp2 comparisons in the time series of c p could be made under non uniform ship wake utilizing the experimental data by ukon et al 1989 yet it is omitted in the present study since the comparisons in cavitation pattern between the experimental data and computational results presented in section 4 2 confirms the validity of unsteady pressure distribution on the blade surfaces under non uniform ship wake 4 2 cavitation extent in the full scale ship wake figs 12 and 13 summarize the experimental kurobe et al 1983 and computational results of cavitation pattern at different blade position θ for case 1 cp and case 2 hsp2 respectively animated version of figs 12 and 13 can be seen at the electronic annex for the online version of this manuscript definition of θ is counter clockwise positive observing from fore with 0deg at 12 o clock position the computational results of sheet cavitation show nice agreement to the experimental data for both cp and hsp2 in the meantime they are competitive or even better in comparison to the existing computational results ji et al 2011 ji et al 2012 hasuike et al 2010 fujiyama 2015 the tip vortex cavitation tvc is reproduced for the cp to some extent while it is not for the hsp2 as one of the design changes from cp to hsp2 decreased pitch distribution with large skew angle was introduced and thus hsp2 is tip unloaded than cp this attenuated the strength of tip vortex in the present computation the spacial resolution is the same between cp and hsp2 which indicates that the spacial resolution to capture tvc utilized for cp is not enough for hsp2 and thus further computations are necessary with finer grid refinement figs 14 and 15 summarizes computational results of cavitation pattern at different blade position θ for case 3 ship b and case 4 ship c respectively the sheet cavitation is apparent in all blades for both ship b and ship c tvc is resolved by the present cfd at 48 deg θ 56 deg and 54 deg θ 77 deg for ship b and ship c respectively to quantify the extent of cavitation figs 16 and 17 present the time histories of a c on the key blade and v c over the rotator domain respectively as a function θ for case 1 and case 2 the experimental kudo et al 1989 and inviscid computational results kanemaru and ando 2011 of the a c and v c are put in figs 16 and 17 respectively as a validation purpose fig 18 compares the time history of nondimensional pressure k p p ρn 2 d p 2 logged at numerical probes in the computational domain to that of the second derivative of v c termed d 2 v c dt 2 calculated by 5 points central differencing scheme followed by the reference kudo et al 1989 it is considered to be influential on pressure fluctuation since the pressure fluctuation δ p due to volumetric variation of single spherical bubble is given by 25 δ p ρ 4 π r 2 v b t r c t 2 where r is the distance between bubble and arbitral field point t is the time c is the sound velocity v b 4 3πr b 3 is the volume of single spherical bubble and r b is the bubble radius hoshino et al 2010 table 5 summarizes the results of maximum values of a c a d and d 2 v c dt 2 the computational results of a c and v c in case 1 and case 2 presented in figs 16 and 17 show quantitative difference to the experimental data in the experiment the a c remains almost constant at 10deg θ 0deg case 1 and 20 deg θ 40deg case 2 while the v c is not constant in these range it means that the thickness of cavitation bubble changes toward the blade normal direction at back side while the extent of sheet cavitation does not spread the maximum values of the a c and v c are achieved at the same time when θ is 10deg case 1 and 30deg case 2 at 10deg θ 30deg case 1 and 40deg θ 50deg case 2 the a c and v c decrease at the same time and they finally become similar level to those of 10deg case 1 and 0deg case 2 at θ 30deg case 1 and 50deg case 2 in the computational results the a c and v c grow up in parallel it means that the growth of the extent of sheet cavitation on the blade yields the increase of v c for which it is consecutive to the cavitation pattern shown in figs 12 and 13 the a c and v c decrease at the same time for case 1 while there is a phase difference between the two for case 2 for case 3 and case 4 such discussion is rather difficult to made since cavitation is apparent in all blades due to smaller σn in comparison to case 1 and case 2 the present computational results of the maximum value of a c a d which becomes the input to eq 5 agree well with the experimental data for both case 1 and case 2 one can notice that the computational results of time series of a c and v c have generally flatter and lower gradients than those of the experimental data it is conjectured that the flatness of a c in the computational results is not due to modeling of the axial ship wake the sqcm in fig 16 is the lifting surface method for which the axial ship wake described in fig 7 is directly imposed onto the propeller surface such treatment is different to the present viscous cfd simulations regardless to the different treatment in the axial wake the computational result of a c is quite similar between the present cfd and the sqcm the flatness of v c may due to large time step and resultant excessive local cfl as discussed in section 3 6 at the cells with excessive cfl evaporation and condensation of the fluid may have less physical accuracy which deteriorates the steepness of the volumetric change of cavitation bubble in time however the results by ji et al 2012 who utilize the same time step as the present study show steeper gradient in v c in time although the cavitation patterns are not well reproduced consequently it is still inconclusive to state the reason of flatter profile in a c and v c in the present computational results with respect to the experimental data the computational results of the maximum value of d 2 v c dt 2 are at most 3 6 times smaller than that of the experimental data for case 1 and case 2 which indicates that the pressure fluctuation due to volumetric change of cavitation bubble may be less sensitive at a certain time in the computational results than that of the experimental results in fig 18 the time history of d 2 v c dt 2 is almost in phase with the time history of k p for all the cases it is interesting that the fluctuation of k p with higher order bfs are also well reproduced by d 2 v c dt 2 volumetric change of cavitation extent in time can be considered as source sink since the acoustic originated from periodic source sink is considered as monopole source acoustic interpretation of in phase relationship between k p and d 2 v c dt 2 is that the monopole source of propeller cavitation noise is the volumetric change of cavitation extent in time 4 3 propeller cavitation noise fig 19 presents the experimental and computational results of spl evaluated at the port side hydrophone for case 1 and case 2 in model scale correction of the measured spl via transfer function proposed by the references tani et al 2016 the specialist committee on hydrodynamic noise of the 28th ittc 2017 were not carried out in the experiment fig 20 summarizes experimental and computational results of spl in full scale for all the cases background noise were not measured in the model tests in case 1 and case 2 and thus they are not shown in fig 19 in fig 20 the results from brown s formula are added since the validity of the formula is in full scale the lloyd mirror correction urick 1983 is applied for the experimental results of case 3 and case 4 to take the effect of acoustic wave reflection due to the presence of free surface into consideration please notice that the variables in vertical axis are removed from fig 20c and d due to the nda between the data providers and nmri in fig 19 regardless to the difference in d 2 v c dt 2 between the computational and experimental results the computational result is able to capture tonal noise up to 2nd bf in case 1 and 3rd bf in case 2 respectively compared to the experimental data the noise at f c 1 khz obtained by the present cfd is underestimated by 10 db relative to the experiment which is most probably due to 1 lack of temporal resolution see section 3 5 and 2 limitation of the present cavitation model i e bubble growth and collapse cannot be well resolved in fig 20a and b the full scale measurement shows that tonal noise due to 1st and 2nd bfs from case 2 is 10 db smaller than that of case 1 due to decreased pitch distribution with higher skew angle it contributes to decrease a c and v c which results in the decrease of pressure fluctuation with 1st bf approximately 1 3 of case 1 the present cfd is likely to capture these phenomena therefore the computational result is able to reproduce the decrease of tonal noise due to 1st and 2nd bfs in case 2 compared to case 1 brown s formula successfully estimates upper bound of the spl due to propeller cavitation as shown in table 5 fig 18a and b the difference in ac a d in case 1 and case 2 is 5 exp and 21 exp respectively which yields the difference in spl less than 1 db for case 1 and approximately 1 2 db for case 2 respectively different to case 1 and case 2 fig 20c and d shows that the tonal noise up to 3rd bfs estimated by the present cfd agree very well with the experimental data although tonal noise for the measured data in case 4 are less apparent as those of case 3 similar to case 1 and case 2 brown s formula estimates the upper bound of spl well at f c 1 khz for both case 3 and case 4 which supports the fact that the present computation appropriately estimates the maximum value of a c a d for both case 3 and case 4 5 concluding remarks the present study aims to investigate the validity of viscous cfd with semi empirical method to estimate propeller cavitation noise in the near field four different propellers operating behind non uniform ship wake are of the interest for the two of four cases σn and full scale ship wake for propeller cavitation simulation are also predicted by viscous cfd together with the available experimental data fluctuation of hydrodynamic pressure directly obtained from viscous cfd is assumed to be the source of propeller cavitation noise in other words no acoustic analogical approach is considered as successive validation steady viscous cfd simulations are carried out to estimate poc and distribution of c p along the chord under uniform and non cavitating condition for initial validation purpose then unsteady viscous cfd simulations are carried out for cavitating propellers operating behind the full scale ship wake for cavitation pattern the present cfd is capable of predicting sheet cavitation patters and resultant maximum value of a c a d very well in comparison to the experimental data finer spacial resolution is necessary to resolve tvc in phase relationship between k p and d 2 v c dt 2 supports the fact that the monopole source of propeller cavitation noise is the volumetric change of cavitation extent in time for tonal noise it is well predicted up to 3rd bfs by the present assumption while the resolution of broadband noise is limited at 1 khz in full scale due to temporal resolution for the present cfd simulation brown s formula successfully predicts the upper bound of broadband noise in consequence the present method is proven to be one of the practical approaches to estimate propeller cavitation noise in the near field due to the limitations of computational cost and time uncertainty assessment is not carried out for the present study yet it is important to quantify simulation numerical uncertainty specifically iterative grid and time step dependencies in the numerical solution e g time histories of k t a c v c and k p for the present study iterative uncertainty of such periodic signals can be quantified by for instance marching harmonic analysis yoon et al 2015 systematic coarsening refining of grid resolution and time step will made it possible to carry out deterministic verification and validation proposed by ittc 2008 to quantify grid and time step uncertainties acknowledgement this study was carried out as a research activity of underwater radiated noise project of the japan ship technology research association in

has been a large interest among maritime industries in terms of mariners comfort and marine environmental protection the objective of this study is to propose and validate practical computational methods to predict near field propeller cavitation noise by complementary use of viscous cfd and semi empirical formula acoustic analogical method represented by ffowcs williams hawkings equation is not utilized at all in the present study four different propellers equipped on actual ships are of the interest cavitation phenomena around these propellers are reproduced by viscous cfd simulations behind full scale ship wake time series of pressure fluctuations as well as the area of cavitation extent on the blades are logged the former is directly utilized to quantify the level of tonal noise at near field while the latter is utilized to estimate upper bound of broadband noise together with the brown s semi empirical formula the proposed methods accurately estimate the tonal noise up to 3rd blade frequency in the meantime upper limit of broadband noise is well predicted in comparison to the measurement results the present method is very practical and thus it can be one of the criteria to estimate propeller cavitation noise in the near field keywords marine propeller cavitation underwater ship radiated noise environmental protection viscous cfd 1 introduction underwater ship radiated noise usrn has been a large interest among maritime industries in terms of mariners comfort as well as marine environmental protection two major components of underwater ship radiated noise are 1 low frequency and periodic machinery noise which is originated from main and auxiliary engines and 2 tonal and broadband noise which is originated from marine propulsors although the former is important the latter is the most dominant noise source under the normal navigation speed and thus is of interest in the present study in 1995 international council for the exploration of the sea released the guidelines of underwater ship radiated noise for fishery research vessels mitson 1995 in 2014 international maritime organization has released the guidelines for the reduction of underwater noise from commercial shipping to address adverse impacts on marine life international maritime organization imo 2014 the former directly regulates the upper limit of radiated sound pressure level spl while the latter regulates the 1st and 2nd blade rate harmonic amplitudes of stern pressure fluctuation depending on the block coefficient c b of the ship european union countries organized several research projects e g silenv badino et al 2013 aquo audoly et al 2014 and sonic bureau veritasdnv 2015 to investigate experimental and computational methods for assessing environmental impact of underwater ship radiated noise more recently the recommendation has been made by convention of biological diversity subsidiary body on scientific technical and technological advice cbd sbstta on 2016 that the ratifiers should prepare toolkits for assessment of usrn the subsidiary body on scientific technical and technological advice 2016 since computational methods will be one of the essential factors for such toolkits the present study focuses on their development numerical estimation of propeller cavitation and resultant noise are usually challenging since the flow field around cavitating propeller contains multiscale flow physics i e phase change of the fluid turbulence unsteady loading on the propeller blade and so on therefore the propeller cavitation noise has both tonal and broadband frequencies to capture such noise characteristics local pressure fluctuation around noise source needs to be predicted accurately modeling dynamics of cavitation bubble around rotating propeller by nonlinear rayleigh plesset equation with thermodynamic interaction kamiirisa and goto 2005 contributes to estimate pressure fluctuation with high frequency and resultant broadband noise yet this method requires assumptions in volumetric change of cavitation bubble in time as well as distribution of bubble radius the semi empirical formulae based on model and full scale measurements brown 1976 wittekind 2014 wittekind and schuster 2016 bureau veritasdnv 2015 are able to provide rough estimation in the upper bound of spl this method is practical and suitable at initial design stage of hull and propeller yet sufficient number of measurement campaigns in model and full scale are necessary to construct database for these formulae which are usually expensive in cost and time viscous computational fluid dynamics cfd can be one of the alternatives to compensate the disadvantages of former two methods unsteady propeller cavitation is solved by reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation together with appropriate cavitation and turbulence models far field noise can be calculated by complementary use of acoustic analogical method represented by ffowcs williams hawkings fwh wave propagation equation and viscous cfd the fw h method has widely been accepted in the field of aeroacoustics see for instance farassat 2007 according to international towing tank conference ittc specialist committee on hydrodynamic noise specialist committee on hydrodynamic noise 2017 rapid development is on going in the application of fw h method together with viscous cfd to hydroacoustic problem specifically for propeller radiated noise recent studies for such investigation can be found in kellet et al 2013 ianiello et al 2014a ianiello et al 2013 ianiello et al 2014b lloyd et al 2015 li et al 2015 bensow and liefvendahl 2016 lidtke et al 2016 and ianiello 2016 these studies solve flows around non cavitating and cavitating propellers via viscous cfd simulations the permeable surface termed fw h surface in the propeller vicinity is prepared as a part of computational domain in such a way that the local flows around a propeller are included inside the fw h surface acoustic sources originated from flow physics inside the fw h surface are modeled as monopole dipoles and quadrupoles these acoustic sources are then mapped onto the fw h surface and the fw h wave propagation equation is solved to evaluate pressure fluctuation emitted from the fw h surface the pressure waves are evaluated at arbitrary receivers located inside or outside of the computational domain received pressure fluctuations in time are subjected to frequency analysis and are converted to spl this method is able to carry out local flow analysis around a propeller and investigation of its hydroacoustic wave propagation to the far field at the same time yet the fw h equation cannot take the effect of marine environmental conditions into consideration vertical and lateral distribution of profiles of acoustic speed under the water strongly affect to the propagation path of the acoustic wave urick 1982 in the meantime reflections from free surface and seabed can sometimes not be ignored holford 1981 as the ittc specialist committee on hydrodynamic noise 2017 stated numerical predictions for acoustic wave propagation under the water are well established such as normal mode method and parabolic equation method for which marine environmental condition can rigorously be considered as input parameters for simulation tappert et al 1977 urick 1983 another computational method is to separate estimation of spl and acoustic wave propagation under the water dominant frequencies and their spl originated from a propeller vicinity are estimated by viscous cfd and or cfd semi empirical specialist committee on hydrodynamic noise 2017 methods and these results become inputs for simulations of underwater acoustic wave propagation taking marine environmental effects into consideration in the meantime some input parameters to the semi empirical formulae wittekind 2014 can be extracted from solutions of viscous cfd simulations according to these backgrounds the present study aims to investigate the validity of viscous cfd and cfd semi empirical methods to estimate propeller cavitation noise in the near field in model and full scale the definition of near field in this manuscript means that 1 hydrophone is flush mounted on ships bottom in their stern vicinity and or 2 distance of closest point of approach between the propeller equipped on the target hull and the measurement ship with drooping hydrophone is approximately 100 m four cases of cavitating propellers are of the interest in the present study as step by step investigation initial validations are carried out to understand the capability of viscous cfd for non cavitating propellers operating in uniform flow then the propeller cavitation simulations behind the ship wake are carried out to validate cavitation pattern and extent of propeller cavitation in time since some measurement data are quite limited necessary conditions to simulate propeller cavitation are also estimated by viscous cfd after these validations and preparations propeller cavitation noise in the near field is directly estimated from viscous cfd acoustic analogical approach is not utilized at all maximum extent of propeller cavitation on the blade surface is extracted from viscous cfd solution and becomes the input for the brown s semi empirical formula brown 1976 estimated frequencies and spl are validated with the available experimental data in model and full scale followed by this introduction chapter 2 presents the computational methods of viscous cfd and propeller cavitation noise

transport k ω sst based detached eddy simulation des is selected the reason to choose des instead of unsteady rans urans is its better capability to capture detail vortical structure than urans at blade tip riera et al 2016 capturing low pressure region at the core of tip vortex will yield better resolution in tip vortex cavitation tvc the des model utilized in the present study switches rans

propeller two methods are utilized for steady simulations e g uniform flow computations to estimate propeller open water characteristics poc moving reference frame mrf approach is adopted for mrf approach computational domain is separated into mrf region and the outside of mrf region the governing equations solved inside the mrf region take the effect of centrifugal and coriolis force due to

mpi and is ran on distributed memory type machines with 112 156 cpus 2 2 near field propeller cavitation noise two methods are complementary utilized in the present study to estimate spl originated from cavitating propellers first method is to utilize time history of pressure sampled at certain receiver point directly from viscous cfd simulation to resolve tonal noise with several order of blade frequencies bf and limited range of broadband noise the data is subjected to discrete fourier transform with hanning window and then filtered by 1 3 octave band five complete periods of data are selected in the present study the amplitude of the signal are integrated within the lower and upper frequency over each band width and converted into spl relative to 1 μpa as kato 1999 3 g p t e x p j

d p m is the propeller diameter n p rps is propeller rotation speed f hz is the target frequency a c m2 is the area of cavitation extent on the blade and a d m2 is the area of the blade the viscous cfd simulation estimates a c a d and the result is plugged into eq 5 to estimate l s for certain f as described in section 4 3 spl obtained from eq 4 and l s obtained from eq 5 will be compared each other for such cases l s is converted to energy then 1 3 octave band width δf c in eq 4 is multiplied and is finally converted to spl db rel 1 μpa assuming spherical spreading 3 simulation design 3 1

inter domestic research projects in japan on 1980 s and early 1990 s see for instance 19th ittc kato and ukon 1990 ship a equipped two different propellers e g the conventional propeller termed cp and highly skewed propeller termed hsp2 the cp was initially equipped on the ship and then the hsp2 was retro fitted subsequent to the cp aiming to reduce hull vibration the configuration ship a cp is case 1 and ship a hsp2 is case 2 in table 1 respectively major modifications in propeller design for hsp2 relative to cp were 1 high skew angle 45 deg 2 pitch distribution from root to tip becomes increase decrease so that the blade became tip unloaded japan ship technology res 1983 and 3 blade section modified sri b was adopted instead of mau since sri b had better cavitation performance than mau kadoi et al 1984 ship b and ship c are inland cargo liners operating between domestic remote islands of japan ship b has single screw while ship c is split stern hull with twin screws the configuration ship b is case 3 and ship c is case 4 in table 1 respectively 3 2 experimental configuration and validation data table 2 summarizes experimental configuration and validation data for case 1 case 4 for ship a case 1 and case 2 detailed experimental configurations and validation data are given and open to public japan ship technology res 1983 while limited number of data are

b and ship c can be found in kamiirisa et al 2017 to determine configuration and necessary data for propeller cavitation simulation three viscous cfd simulations are carried out as a pre process for cavitation simulation for ship b and ship c summarized in table 3 p1 is necessary to obtain poc to tune inflow velocity profile which will be explained in section 3 7 when ships are running the i in eq 7 could be different to that of still water configuration due to changes of running attitude as well as to the wave elevation at the propeller plane therefore p2 is necessary to set realistic i and resultant σ n full scale ship wake is simulated by p3 and the results are utilized as the inflow boundary condition bc to the cavitation simulation although no validation data are available for full scale wake in ship b and ship c this is still reasonable approach according to the ittc the specialist committee on scaling of wake field 2011 3 3 computational grid and boundary conditions the coordinate system is right handed cartesian and its center is coincident with the boss center of a propeller the flow direction is x negative to x positive and the propeller rotates clockwise around x axis observing from downstream fig 3 presents the computational grid for case 1 in the vicinity of the propeller it consists of two cylindrical volume parts e g stator for which the computational domain remains stationary during the simulation and rotator for which the computational domain rotates together with the propeller motion most of the computational domain are discretized using hexahedral cells while prism cells are generated in the region where hexahedral cells cannot be prepared due to geometrical constraint nondimensional viscous length y is close to 1 to meet the requirement for the present turbulence model to advect imposed non uniform velocity profile which will be explained in section 3 7 to the propeller plane with less numerical diffusion isotropic local refinement is placed from inflow boundary to 0 6dp downstream of the propeller measured from coordinate center local refinements are also placed at 50 of propeller radius termed r r 0 5 toward the tip to resolve sheet and tip vortex cavitation stretching ratio of the grid in the wall normal direction is set less than 1 25 since excessive stretching ratio also causes undesirable numerical diffusion the growth rate of the cell from fine region to coarse region is set in such a way that 2 to 4 layers are set between the region of mesh size transition the mesh arrangements on the propeller blade e g grid spacing near the leading edge and trailing edge the height and the number of prism layer toward the blade normal direction are set according to the results of parametric study by kawamura et al 2004 who utilized the same turbulence model as the present study as an overset assemble process cells in each region are flagged as 1 donor 2 receptor 3 active and 4 inactive fig 4 a b and c show the example of overset grid arrangements for cavitation simulation for case 1 in fig 4b and c the cells colored by light green are active cells where governing equations are solved the cells colored by red are inactive cells where governing equations are not solved the cells colored by blue are receptor the donor cells around the receptor are searched using linear scheme with shape function of spanning tetrahedron which means that one receptor has 4 donor stencils the donor cells in stator provide flux variables to receptor cells in rotator and vice versa the flux variables f are interpolated from donor cells to a receptor cell as 8 f r e c e p t o r i α i f i d o n o r where i is the cell id and α i is the interpolation coefficients for flux variables of donor cell i for unsteady simulations receptor donor relationship as well as α i are updated at every physical time advancement total number of cell is approximately 19m in case 1 and 2 approximately 11m in case 3 and case 4 please notice that the same parameters e g smallest and target cell sizes stretching ratio etc are utilized for grid generation among case 1 through 4 following the past studies ji et al 2011 the distance from the coordinate center to the inflow boundary far field boundary and outflow boundary are 3dp uniform inflow to estimate poc 0 7dp non uniform inflow to estimate propeller cavitation 5dp and 5dp respectively 3 4 flow conditions for cavitation simulation table 4 summarizes the simulation conditions for the present propeller cavitation three representative nondimensional parameters are k t ó n and kempf s reynolds number rnk defined as 9 r n k c 0 7 r v a 2 0 7 π n p d p 2 ν where c 0 7r m is the chord length of the blade section at r r 0 7 v a m s is the advance speed and ν m2 s is fluid kinematic viscosity in the present study v a is estimated through j as shown in eq 10 for which the j is determined by k t identity method utilizing poc estimated from viscous cfd simulations 10 v a n p d p j for case 1 and case 2 n p 20 0 rps is set while n p for case 3 and case 4 cannot be open to public due to non disclosure agreement nda between the data providers and national maritime research institute nmri as explained in section 3 2 k t and ó n must be identical between model and full scale for case 1 and 2 these variables are known from model test and sea trials they are unknown for case 3 and 4 therefore they must be determined by the provided data shown in table 2 together with the results of viscous cfd simulations in table 3 to determine target k t full scale sea trial data are utilized in the sea trial brake power p b kw was measured at certain ship speeds v s m s given the transmission efficiency η t t n in eq 6 can be estimated as 11 t 1000 p b η t v s this variable is plugged into eq 6 together with the other parameters in the denominator to determine k t the σ n is estimated with without ships running attitude and wave elevation at longitudinal propeller position according to the computational results both ship b and ship c run bow up configuration at their target speeds which means that the i in eq 7 becomes larger when ships are running than those in rest it is also found that the wave elevation at longitudinal propeller position for ship b and ship c has positive sign which also contributes to increase i in eq 7 in consequence more severe configurations in cavitation e g ships in still water with smaller σ n are adopted for the present study 3 5 approximate computational resolution of the pressure wave in space and time for the present study according to the solver property cd adapco 2016 it is recommended that 20 cells should be prepared at least to resolve one wave length of pressure wave this approximates maximum frequency f max s hz in space to be resolved in model scale as 12 f m a x s c 0 20 δ 12 khz where c 0 1438 m s is the sound speed in water and δ 6 0e 03 m is the cubic cell size prepared between blade tip and sampling point of the pressure according to the scaling criterion discussed in section 3 6 eq 18 or 21 this f max s corresponds to 3 khz in full scale the size of time step δt s is set in such a way that the propeller rotates 1 0 per physical time advancement with 20 sub iteration this approximates maximum frequency f max t hz in time taking nyquist frequency into consideration as 13 f m a x t 1 2 δ t 3 6 khz according to the scaling criterion by eq 18 or 21 this f max t corresponds to 800 to 900 hz in full scale the time step adopted for the present study is the same as the references ji et al 2011 ji et al 2012 who utilized the same propeller geometries as case 1 and case 2 for cavitation simulations and managed to resolve the pressure fluctuations up to 3rd order blade harmonics accurately with respect to the experimental data yet qualitative diagnostic of the present computational results specifically for cavitation simulation found that the local cfl courant friedrichs lewy number is nearly 3 0 at limited cells very close to the blade at certain time steps the local cfl number for unsteady computation should be less than 1 0 at entire region of the computational domain over whole computational period which can be achieved by smaller δ t although it is trivial to systematically investigate the effect of δ t to the computational results it will be left as one of the future works due to limitation of computational expense 3 6 validation data and variables six physical quantities are chosen as successive validation data for the present study 1 poc 2 pressure distribution on the blade 3 cavitation pattern 4 extent of cavitation 5 spl in model scale and 6 spl in full scale for which they are tightly associated with each other experimental data for these quantities are all available for case 1 and case 2 while only 6 is available for case 3 and case 4 for poc k t k q and η o are subjected to the validation against the experimental data provided in the reference japan ship technology res 1983 for pressure distribution on the blade experimental data measured under uniform flow condition ukon et al 1989 are utilized as validation data pressure coefficient c p is defined by 14 c p p 0 5 ρ n p d p 2 where p pa is the dynamic pressure on the blade its distribution along the chord at r r 0 7 is selected as the validation data for cavitation pattern experimental data by kurobe et al 1983 are utilized as validation data to compare the computational results with the experimental data iso surface of volume fraction 0 1 is adopted in the present study for quantified extent of cavitation experimental data by kudo et al 1989 are utilized as validation data please notice that the dimension of the model propellers as well as cavitation conditions between kurobe et al 1983 and kudo et al 1989 are identical each other measured quantities are the time histories of the area of cavitation a c mm2 on the key blade and the volume of cavitation bubble v c mm3 in the vicinity of the key blade the measurement of these quantities were carried out by a laser beam coupled with charge coupled device to

extent on the key blade α i t is the instantaneous volume fraction of gas phase n c is the number of cells in the rotator domain and v i mm3 is the volume of discretized cells solution dependencies in a c and v c in terms of the threshold of α i t 0 1 have been assessed using case 1 and case 2 prior to further investigation using the thresholds of 0 25 and 0 5 in a c the maximum difference of 20 the value with α i t 0 1 was found in case 2 by α i t 0 5 yet it yields less than 3 db r e l 1 μ p a h z 1 m in accordance with eq 5 from the acoustical point of view it makes sense to utilize α i t 0 1 to compute the maximum value of a c in v c it was at most 20 smaller e g 140 mm3 when estimated by α i t 0 5 compared to that of α i t 0 1 for both case 1 and case 2 volumetric change of 140 mm3 in cavity bubble is very difficult to visualize at qualitative comparison shown in section 4 2 consequently in terms of comparison in the cavitation pattern between experiment and cfd utilizing α i t 0 1 iso surface makes sense in the present study for spl in model scale experimental data in the reference kato and ukon 1990 are utilized as validation data for case 1 and case 2 point probes in the computational domain are set in such a way that the relative orientations between boss center and point probes are identical to the measurement configuration as shown in fig 2a for case 3 and case 4 point probes in the computational domain are set according to the following criteria set the coordinate origin identical to the boss center based on the coordinate origin longitudinal position is identical to the propeller generator line at r r 0 7 lateral position is shifted 5 d p towards port from coordinate origin and vertical position is d p 2 z t from the coordinate origin for which z t is the tip clearance see fig 5 for the schematic image ukon 1991 such sampling point usually captures maximum amplitude of pressure fluctuation originated from cavitating propellers when the model tests are carried out in a cavitation tunnel with wire mesh screen ukon 1991 in the present study geometry of ship s bottom mounting plate for hydrophone is not modeled in the computational domain to consider the effect of walls the solid boundary factor 2 0 according to the reference hoshino 1979 is multiplied to the pressure fluctuation subjected to the frequency analysis for spl in full scale experimental data in the reference japan ship technology res 1983 for case 1 and case 2 and the reference kamiirisa et al 2017 for case 3 and case 4 are utilized as validation data since all the computations are carried out in model scale scaling criteria are applied to obtain the spl in full scale in case 1 and case 2 levkovskii s method is utilized according to the reference japan ship technology res 1983 as 17 λ d p s d p m 18 f s f m 1 λ σ n s σ n m 0 5 v s v m 19 δ s p l s p l s s p l m 20 l o g 10 λ 1 5 σ n s σ n m 0 5 v s v m r m r s where the subscripts of m and s denote model

noise source is geometrically similar between model and full scale and thus r m r s 1 λ n pm and n ps is set to 1200 rpm and 163 rpm respectively in case 3 and case 4 levkovskii s method was applied first yet the agreement between computational results and full scale measurements was not satisfactory therefore the correction formulae suggested by the ittc the specialist committee on hydrodynamic

n m rps is the value used for the present cfd simulations ns and nm cannot open to public due to the nda between the data provider and nmri similar to case 1 and case 2 the present cfd holds the law

obtain axial velocity profiles in full scale although these data cannot be open to public due to the nda between the data providers and nmri let the axial component of the ship wake u as a function of position vector x as 23 u c a u x where x is expressed based on the coordinate utilized in the cfd simulation although u is imposed on inflow boundary it is usually not advected to the propeller location maintaining its original profile due to numerical diffusion which violates to achieve target k t to avoid this the correction factor c a is multiplied to the rhs of eq 23 fig 8 describes the schematic image to calculate c a under non cavitating condition imposed u gives a certain value of k t termed k t cal utilizing poc obtained by the cfd simulation the working point termed j cal can be estimated by k t identity method since the target k t is given as one of the parameters for cavitation simulation termed k t target there is the target working point termed j target which can also be estimated by k t identity method the ratio between j cal and j target computes c a as 24 c a j c a l j t a r g e t i f j t a r g e t j c a l j t a r g e t j c a l i f j t a r g e t j c a l such tuning is very similar to the procedure of k t adjustment which is normally carried out at cavitation tunnel experiment changing c a in the cfd simulation is equivalent to controlling the rotation speed of tunnel impeller to change axial velocity maintaining the geometry of wire mesh screen in the experiment in the present study several iterations typically within 2 3 times of this tuning gives k t cal k t target within 3 of difference fig 9 compares the imposed axial velocity profile and tuned axial velocity profile advected to the propeller location at r r 0 5 1 0 which confirms the validity of the proposed tuning method in the overall solution procedure shown in fig 6 two issues should be addressed specifically for computational method of propeller cavitation first issue is its model scale configuration if the propeller cavitation can directly be simulated in full scale correction of scale effect in the estimated spl would not be not necessary however viscous cfd simulation in full scale specifically for propeller cavitation is still likely to be premature to apply its results for engineering assessment and or scientific investigation including usrn estimation available references ponkratov 2017 fujiyama and nakashima 2016 reveal that full scale viscous cfd simulation cannot accurately capture both sheet and tip vortex cavitation in comparison to full scale observation since accurate reproduction in cavitation pattern via numerical simulation is the first priority for the present investigation the configuration of viscous cfd simulation in propeller cavitation is still model scale at this time the second issue is to replace viscous cfd in cavitation simulation by simpler tool for instance inviscid blade element method bem if it is feasible computational expense would be much less than that of the present method the bem will be useful to estimate maximum value of a c however its computational accuracy and physical consistency in pressure fluctuation and volumetric change of cavitation extent in time should be improved further see for instance perali et al 2016 who carried out systematic validation study in the computational results of propeller cavitation and resultant pressure fluctuation obtained from urans and bem once the bem is able to capture pressure fluctuation and spacial extent of cavitation in time with physical consistency it can be another numerical tool in the present solution procedure 4 results 4 1 initial validation in the non cavitating uniform flow case 1 and case 2 fig 10 a and b presents the experimental and the computational results of poc for cp and hsp2 respectively in the figure w o transition represents the results obtained without transition effect of laminar turbulent boundary layer while with transition are the results with transition effect for which γ reθ model malan et al 2009 is utilized it is common among both cp and hsp2 over the entire range of j that the transition turbulence model provides higher values in k t and η o lower value in 10k q relative to the results without transition transition region is typically present at root to r r 0 5 since the circumferential velocity is smaller at the region rather than tip region local rnk is smaller and the boundary layer may be partially laminar from leading edge to a certain chord location the transition model is likely to capture this physics which yields smaller frictional resistance and in consequence smaller 10k q compared to the results without transition at the target k t utilized for the presemt cavitation condition with transition shows smaller difference 0 04 exp for cp than w o transition 2 35 exp compared to the experimental data while it is opposite for hsp2 one issue for the present transition model is that it requires two input parameters i e free stream turbulence intensity and free stream edge value both are important to trigger the onset of boundary layer transition yet these are quite problem dependent and are still open to question for propeller open water computation as well as for computations behind hull non uniform wake in consequence the transition of boundary layer is not considered in the further simulations fig 11 a and b shows the experimental and the computational results of the steady distribution of c p along the chord at r r 0 7 for cp and hsp2 respectively operating in uniform flow the computational results comprehensively agree well with the experimental data both on back and face sides at four different j for both cp and hsp2 comparisons in the time series of c p could be made under non uniform ship wake utilizing the experimental data by ukon et al 1989 yet it is omitted in the present study since the comparisons in cavitation pattern between the experimental data and computational results presented in section 4 2 confirms the validity of unsteady pressure distribution on the blade surfaces under non uniform ship wake 4 2 cavitation extent in the full scale ship wake figs 12 and 13 summarize the experimental kurobe et al 1983 and computational results of cavitation pattern at different blade position θ for case 1 cp and case 2 hsp2 respectively animated version of figs 12 and 13 can be seen at the electronic annex for the online version of this manuscript definition of θ is counter clockwise positive observing from fore with 0deg at 12 o clock position the computational results of sheet cavitation show nice agreement to the experimental data for both cp and hsp2 in the meantime they are competitive or even better in comparison to the existing computational results ji et al 2011 ji et al 2012 hasuike et al 2010 fujiyama 2015 the tip vortex cavitation tvc is reproduced for the cp to some extent while it is not for the hsp2 as one of the design changes from cp to hsp2 decreased pitch distribution with large skew angle was introduced and thus hsp2 is tip unloaded than cp this attenuated the strength of tip vortex in the present computation the spacial resolution is the same between cp and hsp2 which indicates that the spacial resolution to capture tvc utilized for cp is not enough for hsp2 and thus further computations are necessary with finer grid refinement figs 14 and 15 summarizes computational results of cavitation pattern at different blade position θ for case 3 ship b and case 4 ship c respectively the sheet cavitation is apparent in all blades for both ship b and ship c tvc is resolved by the present cfd at 48 deg θ 56 deg and 54 deg θ 77 deg for ship b and ship c respectively to quantify the extent of cavitation figs 16 and 17 present the time histories of a c on the key blade and v c over the rotator domain respectively as a function θ for case 1 and case 2 the experimental kudo et al 1989 and inviscid computational results kanemaru and ando 2011 of the a c and v c are put in figs 16 and 17 respectively as a validation purpose fig 18 compares the time history of nondimensional pressure k p p ρn 2 d p 2 logged at numerical probes in the computational domain to that of the second derivative of v c termed d 2 v c dt 2 calculated by 5 points central differencing scheme followed by the reference kudo et al 1989 it is considered to be influential on pressure fluctuation since the pressure fluctuation δ p due to volumetric variation of single spherical bubble is given by 25 δ p ρ 4 π r 2 v b t r c t 2 where r is the distance between bubble and arbitral field point t is the time c is the sound velocity v b 4 3πr b 3 is the volume of single spherical bubble and r b is the bubble radius hoshino et al 2010 table 5 summarizes the results of maximum values of a c a d and d 2 v c dt 2 the computational results of a c and v c in case 1 and case 2 presented in figs 16 and 17 show quantitative difference to the experimental data in the experiment the a c remains almost constant at 10deg θ 0deg case 1 and 20 deg θ 40deg case 2 while the v c is not constant in these range it means that the thickness of cavitation bubble changes toward the blade normal direction at back side while the extent of sheet cavitation does not spread the maximum values of the a c and v c are achieved at the same time when θ is 10deg case 1 and 30deg case 2 at 10deg θ 30deg case 1 and 40deg θ 50deg case 2 the a c and v c decrease at the same time and they finally become similar level to those of 10deg case 1 and 0deg case 2 at θ 30deg case 1 and 50deg case 2 in the computational results the a c and v c grow up in parallel it means that the growth of the extent of sheet cavitation on the blade yields the increase of v c for which it is consecutive to the cavitation pattern shown in figs 12 and 13 the a c and v c decrease at the same time for case 1 while there is a phase difference between the two for case 2 for case 3 and case 4 such discussion is rather difficult to made since cavitation is apparent in all blades due to smaller σn in comparison to case 1 and case 2 the present computational results of the maximum value of a c a d which becomes the input to eq 5 agree well with the experimental data for both case 1 and case 2 one can notice that the computational results of time series of a c and v c have generally flatter and lower gradients than those of the experimental data it is conjectured that the flatness of a c in the computational results is not due to modeling of the axial ship wake the sqcm in fig 16 is the lifting surface method for which the axial ship wake described in fig 7 is directly imposed onto the propeller surface such treatment is different to the present viscous cfd simulations regardless to the different treatment in the axial wake the computational result of a c is quite similar between the present cfd and the sqcm the flatness of v c may due to large time step and resultant excessive local cfl as discussed in section 3 6 at the cells with excessive cfl evaporation and condensation of the fluid may have less physical accuracy which deteriorates the steepness of the volumetric change of cavitation bubble in time however the results by ji et al 2012 who utilize the same time step as the present study show steeper gradient in v c in time although the cavitation patterns are not well reproduced consequently it is still inconclusive to state the reason of flatter profile in a c and v c in the present computational results with respect to the experimental data the computational results of the maximum value of d 2 v c dt 2 are at most 3 6 times smaller than that of the experimental data for case 1 and case 2 which indicates that the pressure fluctuation due to volumetric change of cavitation bubble may be less sensitive at a certain time in the computational results than that of the experimental results in fig 18 the time history of d 2 v c dt 2 is almost in phase with the time history of k p for all the cases it is interesting that the fluctuation of k p with higher order bfs are also well reproduced by d 2 v c dt 2 volumetric change of cavitation extent in time can be considered as source sink since the acoustic originated from periodic source sink is considered as monopole source acoustic interpretation of in phase relationship between k p and d 2 v c dt 2 is that the monopole source of propeller cavitation noise is the volumetric change of cavitation extent in time 4 3 propeller cavitation noise fig 19 presents the experimental and computational results of spl evaluated at the port side hydrophone for case 1 and case 2 in model scale correction of the measured spl via transfer function proposed by the references tani et al 2016 the specialist committee on hydrodynamic noise of the 28th ittc 2017 were not carried out in the experiment fig 20 summarizes experimental and computational results of spl in full scale for all the cases background noise were not measured in the model tests in case 1 and case 2 and thus they are not shown in fig 19 in fig 20 the results from brown s formula are added since the validity of the formula is in full scale the lloyd mirror correction urick 1983 is applied for the experimental results of case 3 and case 4 to take the effect of acoustic wave reflection due to the presence of free surface into consideration please notice that the variables in vertical axis are removed from fig 20c and d due to the nda between the data providers and nmri in fig 19 regardless to the difference in d 2 v c dt 2 between the computational and experimental results the computational result is able to capture tonal noise up to 2nd bf in case 1 and 3rd bf in case 2 respectively compared to the experimental data the noise at f c 1 khz obtained by the present cfd is underestimated by 10 db relative to the experiment which is most probably due to 1 lack of temporal resolution see section 3 5 and 2 limitation of the present cavitation model i e bubble growth and collapse cannot be well resolved in fig 20a and b the full scale measurement shows that tonal noise due to 1st and 2nd bfs from case 2 is 10 db smaller than that of case 1 due to decreased pitch distribution with higher skew angle it contributes to decrease a c and v c which results in the decrease of pressure fluctuation with 1st bf approximately 1 3 of case 1 the present cfd is likely to capture these phenomena therefore the computational result is able to reproduce the decrease of tonal noise due to 1st and 2nd bfs in case 2 compared to case 1 brown s formula successfully estimates upper bound of the spl due to propeller cavitation as shown in table 5 fig 18a and b the difference in ac a d in case 1 and case 2 is 5 exp and 21 exp respectively which yields the difference in spl less than 1 db for case 1 and approximately 1 2 db for case 2 respectively different to case 1 and case 2 fig 20c and d shows that the tonal noise up to 3rd bfs estimated by the present cfd agree very well with the experimental data although tonal noise for the measured data in case 4 are less apparent as those of case 3 similar to case 1 and case 2 brown s formula estimates the upper bound of spl well at f c 1 khz for both case 3 and case 4 which supports the fact that the present computation appropriately estimates the maximum value of a c a d for both case 3 and case 4 5 concluding remarks the present study aims to investigate the validity of viscous cfd with semi empirical method to estimate propeller cavitation noise in the near field four different propellers operating behind non uniform ship wake are of the interest for the two of four cases σn and full scale ship wake for propeller cavitation simulation are also predicted by viscous cfd together with the available experimental data fluctuation of hydrodynamic pressure directly obtained from viscous cfd is assumed to be the source of propeller cavitation noise in other words no acoustic analogical approach is considered as successive validation steady viscous cfd simulations are carried out to estimate poc and distribution of c p along the chord under uniform and non cavitating condition for initial validation purpose then unsteady viscous cfd simulations are carried out for cavitating propellers operating behind the full scale ship wake for cavitation pattern the present cfd is capable of predicting sheet cavitation patters and resultant maximum value of a c a d very well in comparison to the experimental data finer spacial resolution is necessary to resolve tvc in phase relationship between k p and d 2 v c dt 2 supports the fact that the monopole source of propeller cavitation noise is the volumetric change of cavitation extent in time for tonal noise it is well predicted up to 3rd bfs by the present assumption while the resolution of broadband noise is limited at 1 khz in full scale due to temporal resolution for the present cfd simulation brown s formula successfully predicts the upper bound of broadband noise in consequence the present method is proven to be one of the practical approaches to estimate propeller cavitation noise in the near field due to the limitations of computational cost and time uncertainty assessment is not carried out for the present study yet it is important to quantify simulation numerical uncertainty specifically iterative grid and time step dependencies in the numerical solution e g time histories of k t a c v c and k p for the present study iterative uncertainty of such periodic signals can be quantified by for instance marching harmonic analysis yoon et al 2015 systematic coarsening refining of grid resolution and time step will made it possible to carry out deterministic verification and validation proposed by ittc 2008 to

23082,new measurements from a drillship operating in a swell dominated region are used to demonstrate that generally reliable estimates of the hydrodynamic motions can be obtained from numerically hindcast directional wave spectra independent estimates of the directional wave spectra derived from the ship motions using a parametric approach are shown to be in close alignment with the hindcast spectra deviations between predictions and observations in this methodology are largely explained through the idealised nature of the hindcast spectra and limitations in the ability of the numerical model to capture swell arrival over the long fetch on approach to the project site which is demonstrated through comparison of observed and modelled spectra in general the study provides encouraging support for the application of numerical hindcast techniques for vessel motion assessments particularly for sites for which wave buoy measurements are not available keywords directional wave spectra

safe and efficient operation of an offshore floating facility is critically dependent on its hydrodynamic response to the local wave conditions for ship shaped vessels such as a drillship depending on the incident wave periods and direction large wave induced resonant motions can be experienced in the open sea excessive heave roll and pitch motions in particular can compromise the mechanical systems restrict aviation operations and endanger the safety of personnel for feasibility studies quantifying the wave induced dynamic motions that a vessel is sensitive to therefore plays a critical role in evaluating its suitability for a particular site in an operational context the methods of determining the operability of a floating facility have previously often been based on significant wave height thresholds that is the probability distributions of the significant wave height that are provided for a select region within industry guidance documents e g dnv 2010 are employed for assessment against a single parameter threshold there are however several important shortcomings of this approach the use of a single parameter such as the significant wave height generally provides an inaccurate representation of the complex sea states prevalent at offshore locations the response of a floating body may be sensitive to wave energy at particular frequencies which cannot be readily deduced from this metric the distributions also generally do not include details on seasonality furthermore operability limits installation offtake aviation etc are typically expressed in terms of tolerances on the vessel motion and not wave parameters given the variability in the wave response characteristics of different floating facilities it is often difficult to obtain relevant sea state thresholds a more rigorous assessment of the suitability of the floating facility necessitates determining the dynamic motions from extensive records of the sea state which describe the wave amplitudes periods and their directionality to ensure that this is practically feasible to be employed operationally the approach pursued must not only yield accurate results but be computationally efficient this generally restricts the approaches to those which can be implemented stochastically rather than in the time domain computing the response from directional wave spectra and hydrodynamic transfer functions which characterise the response of the ship to the waves is an effective means of achieving this in many instances particularly for exploration studies long term directional spectra from wave buoy measurements are unfortunately not available at the location of interest this can pose a significant challenge for the practitioner attempting to compute the hydrodynamic vessel responses over the last decades significant improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of numerical based spectral wave models have however enabled long term wave hindcast directional spectra data to become accessible these models can therefore possibly circumvent the need for observations at an offshore site or supplement measurements third generation phase averaged spectral wave models such as wavewatch iii ww3 tolman 1991 tolman 2014 have proved particularly popular and are now widely utilised in both research and operational oceanography contexts these models are based on solving the wave action density balance and parametrize the key physical processes associated with wave generation growth and dissipation to estimate the directional wave spectral properties over a specified domain provided that the response characteristics of the floating facility to waves are known such models can therefore potentially be employed to estimate the dynamic response statistics of the facility in lieu of observations of the sea state at the site despite the potential attractiveness of employing a numerical approach for operability assessments there are several salient points which the practitioner must consider for instance the vast majority of studies in which numerical wave models have been employed and validated have primarily focused on wind sea waves owing to their large inertia the first order hydrodynamic responses of floating production storage and offloading fpso facilities or ship shaped drillships are generally more sensitive to longer swells compared to wind waves it is therefore essential to ensure that the swell energy is accurately simulated by the numerical model as swells propagate over significant distances this typically necessitates computations over spatially large domains and ensuring that appropriate source terms are employed to model the non linear growth and dispersion of the swell evaluating the capability of a numerical model to simulate this swell component of the spectra using field measurements is therefore essential if a hindcast approach is to be confidently employed to undertake feasibility assessments for offshore floating facilities some insights can be drawn from the study by milne et al 2016 in which a numerical approach utilising a third generation wave spectral model was demonstrated to yield generally reliable estimates of the most probable maximum amplitudes of the first order dynamic motions of a fpso in a complex wave environment where strong swells were present the response spectra were however not able to be compared due to limitations with the data acquisition systems the study also demonstrated that the numerical wave hindcast could be utilised to deduce the heading of the turret moored vessel implying that reliable estimates of the mean wave drift loads could be obtained however as the mean drift wave loads are generally dominated by the higher frequency wave components faltinsen 1993 it is challenging to explicitly evaluate the performance of the swell hindcast from these results despite these encouraging findings there is therefore an apparent need for more extensive validation using field data and with a particular focus on the swells it is also important to appreciate that the use of a numerical hindcast approach in lieu of directional measurements from a wave buoy inherently adds another source of uncertainty to the computation of the vessel motions to facilitate an evaluation of the approach it is therefore of interest to eliminate as many potential sources of error as possible the previous studies which have incorporated field measurements in their analyses of vessel motions have generally been based on an fpso or a cargo ship the dynamic motions of these vessels particularly in roll can be affected by non linearities associated with varying draft heading and forward speed that can further complicate the validation of the models by considering a stationary vessel with a constant displacement and heading such as a dynamically positioned drillship and for which high quality motion data are generally available these additional uncertainties can potentially be circumvented furthermore when attempting to evaluate the performance of a hindcast it is also useful to consider whether independent estimates of the directional wave spectra can possibly be derived from the motions of a ship itself using a wave buoy analogy see e g nielsen 2017 milne and zed 2018 in the absence of directional wave buoy measurements for direct comparisons with model wave spectra these independent spectral estimates may be a valuable aid for verification deriving the directional wave spectra from a ship however is generally more challenging than obtaining these directly from a wave buoy the effects of forward speed and a variable draft can complicate the analyses which again suggests that a drillship could be an ideal vessel for utilising this technique it is also important to acknowledge that only those wave components that the floating body is sensitive to can be reliably resolved following this approach due to the large inertia of a ship the higher frequency wave content typically associated with wind waves is effectively filtered out however since the higher frequency waves are unlikely to govern operability this is generally not of too great of concern furthermore it should be appreciated that for a dynamically positioned ship the long period horizontal motions e g surge sway and yaw may be significantly affected by the actions of the thrusters as such these components of motion may not be reliable for determining the wave spectra using the wave buoy analogy to this end this paper presents a case study whereby high quality motion records from an operating drillship were used to evaluate the performance of a numerical based approach to estimate the vessel motions the objective of the study was to utilise fully directional wave spectra computed from a state of the art numerical hindcast to in particular quantify the suitability of the model in terms of key motion statistics which may be used for operability assessments examine the reliability of the model for a range of representative sea states that may be experienced during the drilling operation and that the ship was sensitive to including bi modal swells establish independent estimates of the wave spectra directly from the vessel motions using a wave buoy analogy for comparison the study is intended to provide the offshore industry with a new set of results which may be used to assess the value of a numerical model for aiding operability assessments owing to its computational efficiency the model may be utilised to obtain long term hindcasts of vessel motions and determine weather windows furthermore it is useful to appreciate that the independent estimates of the wave spectra can be computed from the vessel motions at near real time which can therefore be exploited during operations the study significantly extends the earlier investigations of zed and milne 2018 in particular by drawing on the study by milne and zed 2018 to derive the independent estimates of the wave spectra for comparisons with the hindcast spectra additionally new measurements from a directional wave buoy acquired at a similar swell dominated site are compared with a numerical hindcast which are drawn on to aid in the evaluation the paper proceeds by providing an overview of the acquisition of the ship motions which form the basis of the investigation a description of the wave spectral hindcast methodologies and the vessel hydrodynamics which together comprise the numerical based model for the motion hindcasts is then presented the methods utilised for the model evaluation which encompass direct comparisons with the measured responses as well as an independent derivation of the wave spectra from the vessel motions are then introduced the model is subsequently evaluated for a range of representative sea state cases including single modal swells and multi modal conditions in both frequency and mean directions the results and the implications of the study for the offshore industry are finally discussed with the aid of the new wave buoy measurements 2 acquisition and processing of ship motions the motions of a dynamically positioned drillship with a length of 220 m and a beam of 42 m form the basis of this study the motion data were obtained during a drilling campaign at a swell dominated location with a water depth of approximately 1000 m during operation the vessel maintained a constant draught of 11 9 m and displacement of 96000 mt measurements of the heave roll and pitch displacements of the drillship were acquired from three independent kongsberg seatex mru5 motion reference units which comprised the dynamic positioning system two mrus were positioned on the port and starboard sides of the ship aligned approximately with the longitudinal centre of gravity the third unit was located near the stern and close to the midship axis the motion data were sampled continuously at a frequency of 1 hz together with the vessel heading a quality assurance assessment was undertaken prior to the analysis to remove erroneous data signals this involved identifying instantaneous signals which exceeded a given threshold and then replacing the affected datapoint by interpolating over the data the data were considered generally of high quality with poor signals comprising less than 1 of the entire data a 3rd order butterworth high pass filter was applied to remove low frequency components from the signal which were not of primary interest to this study and at frequencies below that available in the hindcast wave spectra estimates of the heave displacement at the centre of gravity were then obtained by correcting for the lever arm between the mru location and the centre of gravity based on small angle transformations for a rigid body see e g faltinsen 1993 fig 1 shows an example of the heave roll and pitch time histories having applied this correction which demonstrates good agreement between the independent sensors and also implies that ship had minimal structural flexure the spectra were computed from 1 hour motion time history records corresponding to the hindcast temporal resolution following bendat and piersol 2010 to aid in obtaining smoothed spectra and reduce random error the data were divided into multiple segments prior to computing the fast fourier transforms and the spectra were then evaluated by averaging the results 3 development of a numerical based model for ship motion hindcasts 3 1 wave spectra hindcasts the ship motions were estimated using a model which combined a hindcast of the directional wave spectra and computations of the hydrodynamic response of the vessel the directional wave spectra were computed from a phase averaged spectral wave model hindcast which simulated the underlying physical processes associated with the wave dynamics the selected spectral wave model was the third generation wavewatch iii ww3 version 4 18 described in tolman 1991 tolman 2014 the application of the ocean wave propagation model is based on solving the spectral action density balance for directional wavenumber spectra with parametrized source terms for the physics associated with wave generation interaction and dissipation these parametrisations were based on those by ardhuin et al 2010 with the non linear wave wave interactions which are essential for modelling wave growth modelled utilising the discrete interaction approximation dia of hasselmann et al 1985 the spectral wave model was setup over a regional domain that extended approximately 1500 km from the project site in all directions on a regular grid of approximately 10 km resolution with a nested grid of 3 5 km resolution within approximately 50 km of the project site all significant islands and bathymetric features likely to affect the project site were resolved within the model domain the coupling between the two domains was two way which allowed for improvements in the wave field from the higher resolution zone to be propagated back into the lower resolution zone wind forcing for the model noted as a critical factor underpinning the accuracy of the wave model rogers and wittmann 2002 was taken from the second generation cfsr dataset described in saha et al 2014 all grids in ww3 were forced with surface winds from this dataset at 0 3 horizontal resolution and hourly temporal resolution given that swells with wave periods greater than 10s were of interest to the study it was necessary to employ directional wave spectra derived from a global model hindcast with the same setup as the regional domain though at 25 km resolution as boundary conditions to ensure swell propagation to the boundaries of the nested domain were well represented the numerical hindcast was run to coincide with the dates for which the motions were acquired directional wave spectra output from the numerical model were available at a location within close proximity of the project site estimates of the hindcast based directional wave spectra were obtained at a directional resolution of 15 with frequency discretised over 25 bins exponentially spaced between 0 04 hz and 0 4 hz 2 5 and 25s thus encompassing the dominant wave energy of interest confirmation of the appropriateness of the selected model source terms forcing winds boundary conditions and other parameterisations were established through a validation of the modelled significant wave height using satellite altimeter observations as shown in fig 2 there was negligible bias in the significant wave height and the rms error was 0 307 m it is important to note that this verification is only for the total significant wave height with validation of the ability of the model to reproduce swell component of the sea state at the project site not possible in the absence of in situ observations 3 2 ship hydrodynamics the complex valued response amplitude operators raos of the drillship were obtained using the commercial hydrodynamic analysis software wamit lee 1995 to solve the combined diffraction and radiation problems based on three dimensional potential flow theory these numerical computations were complemented by a series of model scale tests of the vessel in a commercial wave basin following standard class guidance these experiments were used to verify the wave induced responses and determine the roll response for which viscous effects are particularly important both roll decay and irregular wave experiments were performed for the maximum significant wave height the vessel was intended to operate at and were obtained at incident wave direction increments of 15 from which the roll rao once the motions were normalised by the wave amplitude was ultimately determined it is acknowledged that due to possible non linearities the roll damping may have been overestimated for the relatively benign sea states which were considered as part of this study the moonpool with dimensions of 25 m by 12 5 m was included in both the wamit computations and the model tests in order to account for hydrodynamic resonances which could affect the heave response of the ship as the drillship operated at a near constant displacement and in relatively benign wave conditions the raos were computed for a single draft these were aligned with the centre of gravity of the vessel and were generated in wave direction increments of 15 consistent with the wave spectra the rao data were obtained at radial frequencies of between ω 0 1 rad s 1 and 1 3 rad s 1 i e 4 8s and 63s and at a resolution of d ω 0 1 rad s 1 the heave resonance corresponded to wave periods of approximately 10s with minimal heave response below 8s the pitch resonances ranged between 11s and 14s depending on the wave direction with minimal response also below 8s the roll resonance corresponded to wave periods of approximately 18s with the roll response comparatively more narrow banded and between around 10s and 30s 4 model evaluation methods 4 1 computation of motion statistics the stochastic properties of the hydrodynamic responses of the drillship were used to evaluate the performance of the model following chakrabarti 1987 for instance the response spectra of the principal motions of a floating facility can be theoretically derived as 1 φ i j ω π π h i ω β h j ω θ s ω θ d θ where i and j denote the motion of interest with 3 4 5 referring to heave roll and pitch respectively h i ω β is the response amplitude operator rao is the complex conjugate s ω θ is the directional wave spectra ω is the radial frequency and β is the relative incident wave direction with β 0 corresponding to following waves inherent in this computation is that the wave energy is temporally stationary and that the hydrodynamic responses of the ship are linear the statistical moments are of particular interest in this study which are defined as 2 m n i 0 ω n φ i i ω d ω where n 0 1 2 are the zeroth i e variance of the autospectra first and second statistical moments respectively the rayleigh approximation for the most probable maximum amplitude which is a key metric for assessing operability was computed from the equation 3 η m a x σ 2 log n where σ m 0 n t t z t z 2 π m 0 m 2 and t is the time interval in seconds over which the estimate is computed 4 2 derivation of directional wave spectra from the ship motions an independent estimate of the directional wave spectra was also derived from the stochastic properties of the ship motion response which aided in evaluating the performance of the hindcast the spectra were estimated using a parametric based approach drawing on the methodologies outlined by tannuri et al 2003 and nielsen 2017 for instance the technique is based on the assumption that the wave spectra can be approximately described using an analytical spectral model a jonswap parametric model combined with a cosine 2 s spreading function tucker and pitt 2001 was considered in this study the directional spectral density defined in the radial frequency domain is given as 4 s ω θ α h s 2 ω p 4 ω 5 exp 5 4 ω p ω 4 γ exp 1 2 ω ω p σ ω p 2 2 2 s 1 γ 2 s 1 π γ 2 s 1 cos 2 s θ θ 2 where γ is a non dimensional peak shape parameter α 5 16 1 0 287 ln γ the spectral width parameter σ 0 07 for ω ω p and 0 09 otherwise θ is the mean direction of wave propagation γ x is the gamma function and s is a spreading parameter which has a value of ω ω p 5 s m a x if ω ω p and otherwise ω ω p 2 5 s m a x these parameters therefore conveniently enable the model to describe a wide range of wave spectra that could be observed in the open sea including relatively narrow banded swells in this study the parameters h s t p γ and θ were sought as the region considered was dominated by swells with limited directional spreading a constant value of s m a x 50 was assumed similarly nielsen and stredulinsky 2012 fixed the value of s m a x and investigations also confirmed that the estimates in this study were not significantly affected by this simplification it should also be noted that the model as implemented here is intended for describing a single modal sea state which was appropriate for the majority of the cases considered in this study however as is subsequently demonstrated multi modal sea states can be considered by applying the single peak model to a subset of wave periods corresponding to the mode of interest provided that their spectral content is adequately separated in frequency space in order to solve for these unknown parameters a cost function of the following form was derived for each spectral density component 5 s r r 1 σ i 2 σ j 2 2 m 1 m φ i j ω m δ θ n 1 n h i ω m θ n h j ω m θ n s ω m θ n 2 where the measured variances σ i 2 etc have been used for normalization and which ensures that the spectral shape is preserved in order to facilitate the solver performance the model was applied to the heave roll and pitch ship responses which were assumed to be less affected particularly at longer wave periods by the action of the thrusters than the surge sway and yaw motions for computational efficiency the equations were solved in matrix form the hermitian nature of spectral density relations implies that the cost function can be constructed using the following vector ϕ 33 ϕ 44 ϕ 55 r e ϕ 34 r e ϕ 35 r e ϕ 45 i m ϕ 34 i m ϕ 35 i m ϕ 45 t the non linearity in the equations and the possibility of multiple local minima necessitates the use of a global optimisation routine while the matlab multistart algorithm the mathworks and inc 2015 was employed in this study it is possible to employ alternative methods such as a genetic algorithm see e g pascoal et al 2006 further details regarding the application of the parametric model are given by milne and zed 2018 5 results the performance of the model was evaluated for a range of sea states and operational conditions that were experienced by the ship during the drilling campaign fig 3 shows an example of time histories of the standard deviations i e σ m 0 and 10 minute most probable maximum amplitudes of the heave roll and pitch displacements measured by the ship and estimated using the hindcast at consecutive 1 hr intervals over a 14 day period the corresponding significant wave height peak period and mean incident wave direction estimated from the hindcast are also presented for reference to facilitate the comparisons the wave statistics were computed by integrating the wave energy spectral frequencies corresponding to the swell mode only and do not include contributions from wind waves which the ship was not sensitive to although relatively small at the site during the selected 14 day period the hindcast predicted swells arriving at the site in intervals of approximately 5 days with peak wave periods of up to 22s in general the comparisons demonstrate that the model was able to replicate the underlying trends in the ship motion statistics in response to these swells the histories elucidate that the agreement between the magnitudes of the measured and modelled response statistics was generally most favourable for peak wave periods of less than approximately 15s in these instances the agreement in the heave and pitch was typically within 10 the discrepancy in the roll was comparatively larger though for waves from the stern and bow the magnitude of the roll was generally relatively small to further facilitate the model evaluation a series of sea states and vessel heading combinations were specifically examined which were considered to be representative of both typical and less ideal operational conditions table 1 summarises the cases considered herein and compares the hindcast based estimates and measured values of the standard deviations and the most probable maximum amplitudes of the dynamic motions the wave spectral properties obtained from the hindcast and with those derived by the parametric model are also listed in the table for reference the first two cases are representative of the condition where the ship heading was aligned approximately with the principal direction of a relatively moderate swell i e when the ship followed the waves and the waves approached from ahead respectively these conditions are generally favoured operationally in order to minimise the roll motions referring to table 1 the agreement in the heave and pitch response statistics between the model and measured values was generally favourable i e between 2 and 20 percent whilst the estimates for the roll were underestimated by the model figs 4 and 5 serve to demonstrate that the estimated autospectra of the heave and pitch responses aligned relatively well with the measured data with the dominant energy encompassing the equivalent wave frequency bands the magnitude of the spectral energy near the peak frequency estimated by the model was however larger than that measured the application of the approach using the analytical wave model combined with the vessel raos to describe the motion response spectra hereafter simply referred to as the parametric model is also shown in fig 4 and fig 5 these demonstrate that generally favourable agreement with the measured data was achieved and that the parametric model results aligned closer than the hindcast values it is noteworthy to consider that given the autospectra of the heave and pitch motions are typically similar for cases of waves incident from either the bow or stern it is the quadrature component of φ 35 which has enabled the wave direction to be distinguished the directional spectra computed using the parametric model for the two cases are also compared with the respective hindcast spectra in fig 6 and fig 7 these show that the mean direction spreading and wave periods were generally consistent between the hindcast and parametric based estimates whilst the energy density of the parametric model was smaller given this latter result and the finding the hindcast based statistics exceeded the measured values it suggests that the hindcast estimates of the significant wave height differed from the parametric model by approximately 10 although conditions where a drillship is aligned with the waves may be more frequently experienced or favoured operationally it is useful to consider instances where significant wave energy is incident from the side of the ship for these cases the dynamic motions of the ship may be more appreciable particularly for roll but potentially unavoidable during a campaign cases 3 and 4 are representative of both a relatively benign quartering swell and more energetic beam on swell respectively and are summarized in table 1 in these scenarios the motion statistics estimated by the hindcast were in fair agreement with the measured values the comparisons of the wave spectra estimated from the hindcast and derived using the parametric model for the cases are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively these demonstrate that the distributions of the spectral energy estimates were also in reasonable agreement but again suggest that the hindcast overestimated the significant wave heights it is also important to acknowledge that while the previous cases have considered only single peaked wave spectra more complex sea states are common in the open sea such sea states can potentially result in resonant excitations of multiple motions constituents e g heave and roll and be particularly challenging to model fig 10 shows the hindcast directional sea state corresponding to case 5 which comprised two swell modes as well as a higher frequency wind wave component the motion statistics for all three motions considered were in generally favourable agreement particularly in spite of the inherent complexities the application of the parametric model to estimate the spectral energy corresponding to the two swell modes is demonstrated in fig 11 in this instance given that the frequency content of the two swell modes was deemed to be sufficiently distinct the single mode based parametric model was applied to resolve the swells independently by restricting the wave periods utilised in the computation in order to identify the shorter period swell mode wave periods greater than 15s were excluded to prevent the significant near resonant roll motion that was present around 18s from compromising the performance of the solver conversely the longer swell period mode was resolved by considering only wave periods greater than 15s such that the dominant heave and pitch responses arising from the shorter period swell were sufficiently excluded with this simple constraint the model is demonstrated to have yielded estimates which aligned generally well with that of the hindcast this case also serves as a very useful demonstration that the ship has minimal response to wind waves which is reflected by both the numerical and measured motion spectra shown in fig 11 having very little energy at wave periods corresponding to the higher frequency wind waves for a numerical modeller this is a salient point and reinforces the notion that it is not necessary to resolve the wind waves in the model in order to quantify the motions of interest to the drillship 6 discussion the acquisition of high quality motion data from a dynamically positioned drillship has provided a valuable new opportunity to evaluate the potential of a numerical wave spectra hindcast approach to quantify the dynamic response of floating facilities in general the results presented in the study provide encouraging support for the application of the model to obtain reliable estimates of the hydrodynamic motions of interest for operability assessments for the practitioner there are two independent sources of uncertainty inherent in the approach which must be appreciated those owing to errors in the hindcast and those associated with the characterisation of the hydrodynamic response of the ship to the incident waves in lieu of in situ concurrent measured wave data the parametric approach has been demonstrated to serve as a useful aid in evaluating the performance of the numerical wave spectra hindcasts the results suggest that generally favourable estimates of the peak spectral period and mean wave direction can be obtained from the hindcast for the majority of the cases investigated however the comparisons of the motion statistics and the parametric based wave spectra suggests differences in magnitudes of the spectral energy between that estimated by the hindcast and what was observed to explore this further measurements of the seastate from a wave buoy acquired at another swell dominated site were compared with estimates computed from a numerical hindcast fig 12 shows the respective time histories of the significant wave heights and the peak spectral periods these comparisons demonstrate the peak spectral periods generally aligned well and were similar to the range of wave periods observed by the drillship whilst the general trends in the significant wave height histories were consistent there was however comparatively greater disparity in their values in particular the histories elucidate that in several instances the arrival time of swell predicted by the hindcast was in error based on these results it is therefore plausible that the relatively large errors observed in the statistics for the relatively long wave periods could have arisen from similar arrival time issues it is also interesting to consider the measured and modelled directional wave spectra corresponding to day 19 presented in fig 13 the spectra serve to demonstrate that in spite of the near equivalent values of the significant wave height and peak spectra periods the modelled spectra under resolved the spectral peak and the directional spreading this can be attributed in part to the idealised nature of the model and the inability to resolve the spread of conditions across different directions at the swell frequencies which results in energy focused into a narrow section of the spectrum it is important to also appreciate that the pronounced asymmetrical nature of the observed spectra would not be accounted for by the analytical spreading assumed in the parametric model either for a vessel aligned with the mean direction of the waves representative of cases 1 and 2 the larger directional spreading evident in the observations could be expected to give rise to increased roll motions in particular as identified in the study to understand the possible cause of these discrepancies it is worth noting that in order to describe wave energy distributed over a wide frequency range ww3 utilises a logarithmic scaling of the frequencies such that f i 1 1 1 f i while this implies that the wind waves may be well resolved this is at the expense of the resolution of the swells this issue was briefly highlighted by tolman et al 2001 where it was attributed to leading to under resolved spectral peaks in the swell energy band as well as errors in the swell arrival times while the frequency resolution is a recognized area of the numerical modelling which may require further attention studies which have treated it in depth are scarce the present study therefore provides a useful demonstration of its possible significance in the context of offshore engineering in regards to the uncertainties associated with characterising the hydrodynamic response the rao discretisation may have also attributed to differences between the measured and modelled responses the roll response of a ship in particular is highly sensitive to both the wave period and direction based on the previous discussions it is plausible that the nature of the roll response was under resolved in the models this is perhaps best demonstrated by the hindcast estimates as well as the parametric model application for the cases in which the waves were nearly aligned with the ship heading the magnitude of the roll response decreases significantly towards zero as the wave direction coincides with the principal axis of a ship it can be expected that this trend would be relatively poorly resolved with a directional discretisation of 15 however whilst the discrepancy in the roll may be large for these typical operating states it is important to appreciate that the roll magnitudes remain relatively small and thus may not govern operability it is also important to acknowledge the presence of a moonpool in an assessment of the hydrodynamic uncertainties of a vessel such as a drillship a hydrodynamic piston type resonance in the moonpool could possibly affect the heave response of the vessel if not accounted for the natural frequency corresponding to the piston type resonance can be estimated to first order as equal to ω n g d where g is gravitational acceleration and d is the vessel draft faltinsen 1993 for the drillship considered in this study the natural frequency corresponded to a wave period of approximately 7s as there was minimal wave energy content in this wave period range in the present study such a resonance is unlikely to have been excited however the possibility of a moonpool resonance could potentially be an important consideration for the practitioner if a numerical hindcast approach were to be applied to a different site or vessel draught 7 concluding remarks knowledge of the wave induced hydrodynamic motions on a floating facility is critical for feasibility assessments structural integrity the safety of personnel onboard and ultimately vessel selection in practice a key shortcoming of historical approaches for conducting a feasibility assessment of a vessel at an offshore location has not been accounting for the frequency and directional characteristics of the wave energy and the specific response characteristics of the vessel of interest as relatively large heave roll and pitch amplitudes may be excited in the open sea this can have significant consequences on an operation and a poor vessel selection can ultimately result in significant downtime motivated by the need for accurate and rapid vessel motion prediction methodologies to support schedule optimisation and facility selection this study has presented a valuable new series of results in which to assess the applicability of a fully numerical method to estimate the dynamic motions of a floating facility it has been demonstrated that reliable estimates of key statistical properties which characterise the motions of a drillship can be obtained from a model which combines metocean hindcasts and first order predictions of the wave responses the frequency based approach of this methodology results in high computational efficiency enabling the approach to be further utilised in heading optimisation over short term forecast horizons for maximizing operational performance it is important to reinforce that owing to the idealised nature of the model it is possible that the long period wave energy may be under resolved by the hindcast which has implications for swell dominated sites in particular it has been demonstrated that errors in the magnitude of the swell energy swell arrival time and degree of spreading could be a possible consequence of this it is particularity important to acknowledge the potential issue with the swell arrival time if the model is to be employed for realtime operations which are time critical such as drilling the possibility to predict the swell wave climate that the study presents is also particularly useful at remote locations during preliminary drilling campaigns as the offshore oil and gas industry moves to more remote locations the availability of long term wave records are scarce the information provided by this methodology makes effective use of standard monitoring equipment onboard most floating facilities to efficiently and economically provide additional data on the wave energy content that a vessel would be sensitive to acknowledgments this work

23082,new measurements from a drillship operating in a swell dominated region are used to demonstrate that generally reliable estimates of the hydrodynamic motions can be obtained from numerically hindcast directional wave spectra independent estimates of the directional wave spectra derived from the ship motions using a parametric approach are shown to be in close alignment with the hindcast spectra deviations between predictions and observations in this methodology are largely explained through the idealised nature of the hindcast spectra and limitations in the ability of the numerical model to capture swell arrival over the long fetch on approach to the project site which is demonstrated through comparison of observed and modelled spectra in general the study provides encouraging

safe and efficient operation of an offshore floating facility is critically dependent on its hydrodynamic response to the local wave conditions for ship shaped vessels such as a drillship depending on the incident wave periods and direction large wave induced resonant motions can be experienced in the open sea excessive heave roll and pitch motions in particular can compromise the mechanical systems restrict aviation operations and endanger the safety of personnel for feasibility studies quantifying the wave induced dynamic motions that a vessel is sensitive to therefore plays a critical role in evaluating its suitability for a particular site in an operational context the methods of determining the operability of a floating facility have previously often been based on significant wave height thresholds that is the probability distributions of the significant wave height that are provided for a select region within industry guidance documents e g dnv 2010 are employed for assessment against a single parameter threshold there are however several important shortcomings of this approach the use of a single parameter such as the significant wave height generally provides an inaccurate representation of the complex sea states prevalent at offshore locations the response of a floating body may be sensitive to wave energy at particular frequencies which cannot be readily deduced from this metric the distributions also generally do not include details on seasonality furthermore operability limits installation offtake aviation etc are typically expressed in terms of tolerances on the vessel motion and not wave parameters given the variability in the wave response characteristics of different floating facilities it is often difficult to obtain relevant sea state thresholds a more rigorous assessment of the suitability of the floating facility necessitates determining the dynamic motions from extensive records of the sea state which describe the wave amplitudes periods and their directionality to ensure that this is practically feasible to be employed operationally the approach pursued must not only yield accurate results but be computationally efficient this generally restricts the approaches to those which can be implemented stochastically rather than in the time domain computing the response from directional wave spectra and hydrodynamic transfer functions which characterise the response of the ship to the waves is an effective means of achieving this in many instances particularly for exploration studies long term directional spectra from wave buoy measurements are unfortunately not available at the location of interest this can pose a significant challenge for the practitioner attempting to compute the hydrodynamic vessel responses over the last decades significant improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of numerical based spectral wave models have however enabled long term wave hindcast directional spectra data to become accessible these models can therefore possibly circumvent the need for observations at an offshore site or supplement measurements third generation phase averaged spectral wave models such as wavewatch iii ww3 tolman 1991 tolman 2014 have proved particularly popular and are now widely utilised in both research and operational oceanography contexts these models are based on solving the wave action density balance and parametrize the key physical processes associated with wave generation growth and dissipation to estimate the directional wave spectral properties over a specified domain provided that the response characteristics of the floating facility to waves are known such models can therefore potentially be employed to estimate the dynamic response statistics of the facility in lieu of observations of the sea state at the site despite the potential attractiveness of employing a numerical approach for operability assessments there are several salient points which the practitioner must consider for instance the vast majority of studies in which numerical wave models have been employed and validated have primarily focused on wind sea waves owing to their large inertia the first order hydrodynamic responses of floating production storage and offloading fpso facilities or ship shaped drillships are generally more sensitive to longer swells compared to wind waves it is therefore essential to ensure that the swell energy is accurately simulated by the numerical model as swells propagate over significant distances this typically necessitates computations over spatially large domains and ensuring that appropriate source terms are employed to model the non linear growth and dispersion of the swell evaluating the capability of a numerical model to simulate this swell component of the spectra using field measurements is therefore essential if a hindcast approach is to be confidently employed to undertake feasibility assessments for offshore floating facilities some insights can be drawn from the study by milne et al 2016 in which a numerical approach utilising a third generation wave spectral model was demonstrated to yield generally reliable estimates of the most probable maximum amplitudes of the first order dynamic motions of a fpso in a complex wave environment where strong swells were present the response spectra were however not able to be compared due to limitations with the data acquisition systems the study also demonstrated that the numerical wave hindcast could be utilised to deduce the heading of the turret moored vessel implying that reliable estimates of the mean wave drift loads could be obtained however as the mean drift wave loads are generally dominated by the higher frequency wave components faltinsen 1993 it is challenging to explicitly evaluate the performance of the swell hindcast from these results despite these encouraging findings there is therefore an apparent need for more extensive validation using field data and with a particular focus on the swells it is also important to appreciate that the use of a numerical hindcast approach in lieu of directional measurements from a wave buoy inherently adds another source of uncertainty to the computation of the vessel motions to facilitate an evaluation of the approach it is therefore of interest to eliminate as many potential sources of error as possible the previous studies which have incorporated field measurements in their analyses of vessel motions have generally been based on an fpso or a cargo ship the dynamic motions of these vessels particularly in roll can be affected by non linearities associated with varying draft heading and forward speed that can further complicate the validation of the models by considering a stationary vessel with a constant displacement and heading such as a dynamically positioned drillship and for which high quality motion data are generally available these additional uncertainties can potentially be circumvented furthermore when attempting to evaluate the performance of a hindcast it is also useful to consider whether independent estimates of the directional wave spectra can possibly be derived from the motions of a ship itself using a wave buoy analogy see e g nielsen 2017 milne and zed 2018 in the absence of directional wave buoy measurements for direct comparisons with model wave spectra these independent spectral estimates may be a valuable aid for verification deriving the directional wave spectra from a ship however is generally more challenging than obtaining these directly from a wave buoy the effects of forward speed and a variable draft can complicate the analyses which again suggests that a drillship could be an ideal vessel for utilising this technique it is also important to acknowledge that only those wave components that the floating body is sensitive to can be reliably resolved following this approach due to the large inertia of a ship the higher frequency wave content typically associated with wind waves is effectively filtered out however since the higher frequency waves are unlikely to govern operability this is generally not of too great of concern furthermore it should be appreciated that for a dynamically positioned ship the long period horizontal motions e g surge sway and yaw may be significantly affected by the actions of the thrusters as such these components of motion may not be reliable for determining the wave spectra using the wave buoy analogy to this end this paper presents a case study whereby high quality motion records from an operating drillship were used to evaluate the performance of a numerical based approach to estimate the vessel motions the objective of the study was to utilise fully directional wave spectra computed from a state of the art numerical hindcast to in particular quantify the suitability of the model in terms of key motion statistics which may be used for operability assessments examine the reliability of the model for a range of representative sea states that may be experienced during the drilling operation and that the ship was sensitive to including bi modal swells establish independent estimates of the wave spectra directly from the vessel motions using a wave buoy analogy for comparison the study is intended to provide the offshore industry with a new set of results which may be used to assess the value of a numerical model for aiding operability assessments owing to its computational efficiency the model may be utilised to obtain long term hindcasts of vessel motions and determine weather windows furthermore it is useful to appreciate that the independent estimates of the wave spectra can be computed from the vessel motions at near real time which can therefore be exploited during operations the study significantly extends the earlier investigations of zed and milne 2018 in particular by drawing on the study by milne and zed 2018 to derive the independent estimates of the wave spectra for comparisons with the hindcast spectra additionally new measurements from a directional wave buoy acquired at a similar swell dominated site are compared with a numerical hindcast which are drawn on to aid in the evaluation the paper proceeds by providing an overview of the acquisition of the ship motions which form the basis of the investigation a description of the wave spectral hindcast methodologies and the vessel hydrodynamics which together comprise the numerical based model for the motion hindcasts is then presented the methods utilised for the model evaluation which encompass direct comparisons with the measured responses as well as an independent derivation of the wave spectra from the vessel motions are then introduced the model is subsequently evaluated for a range of representative sea state cases including single modal swells and multi modal conditions in both frequency and mean directions the results and the implications of the study for the offshore industry are finally discussed with the aid of the new wave buoy measurements 2 acquisition and processing of ship motions the motions of a dynamically positioned drillship with a length of 220 m and a beam of 42 m form the basis of this study the motion data were obtained during a drilling campaign at a swell dominated location with a water depth of approximately 1000 m during operation the vessel maintained a constant draught of 11 9 m and displacement of 96000 mt measurements of the heave roll and pitch displacements of the drillship were acquired from three independent kongsberg seatex mru5 motion reference units which comprised the dynamic positioning system two mrus were positioned on the port and starboard sides of the ship aligned approximately with the longitudinal centre of gravity the third unit was located near the stern and close to the midship axis the motion data were sampled continuously at a frequency of 1 hz together with the vessel heading a quality assurance assessment was undertaken prior to the analysis to remove erroneous data signals this involved identifying instantaneous signals which exceeded a given threshold and then replacing the affected datapoint by interpolating over the data the data were considered generally of high quality with poor signals comprising less than 1 of the entire data a 3rd order butterworth high pass filter was applied to remove low frequency components from the signal which were not of primary interest to this study and at frequencies below that available in the hindcast wave spectra estimates of the heave displacement at the centre of gravity were then obtained by correcting for the lever arm between the mru location and the centre of gravity based on small angle transformations for a rigid body see e g faltinsen 1993 fig 1 shows an example of the heave roll and pitch time histories having applied this correction which demonstrates good agreement between the independent sensors and also implies that ship had minimal structural flexure the spectra were computed from 1 hour motion time history records corresponding to the hindcast temporal resolution following bendat and piersol 2010 to aid in obtaining smoothed spectra and reduce random error the data were divided into multiple segments prior to computing the fast fourier transforms and the spectra were then evaluated by averaging the results 3 development of a numerical based model for ship motion hindcasts 3 1 wave spectra hindcasts the ship motions were estimated using a model which combined a hindcast of the directional wave spectra and computations of the hydrodynamic response of the vessel the directional wave spectra were computed from a phase averaged spectral wave model hindcast which simulated the underlying physical processes associated with the wave dynamics the selected spectral wave model was the third generation wavewatch iii ww3 version 4 18 described in tolman 1991 tolman 2014 the application of the ocean wave propagation model is based on solving the spectral action density balance for directional wavenumber spectra with parametrized source terms for the physics associated with wave generation interaction and dissipation these parametrisations were based on those by ardhuin et al 2010 with the non linear wave wave interactions which are essential for modelling wave growth modelled utilising the discrete interaction approximation dia of hasselmann et al 1985 the spectral wave model was setup over a regional domain that extended approximately 1500 km from the project site in all directions on a regular grid of approximately 10 km resolution with a nested grid of 3 5 km resolution within approximately 50 km of the project site all significant islands and bathymetric features likely to affect the project site were resolved within the model domain the coupling between the two domains was two way which allowed for improvements in the wave field from the higher resolution zone to be propagated back into the lower resolution zone wind forcing for the model noted as a critical factor underpinning the accuracy of the wave model rogers and wittmann 2002 was taken from the second generation cfsr dataset described in saha et al 2014 all grids in ww3 were forced with surface winds from this dataset at 0 3 horizontal resolution and hourly temporal resolution given that swells with wave periods greater than 10s were of interest to the study it was necessary to employ directional wave spectra derived from a global model hindcast with the same setup as the regional domain though at 25 km resolution as boundary conditions to ensure swell propagation to the boundaries of the nested domain were well represented the numerical hindcast was run to coincide with the dates for which the motions were acquired directional wave spectra output from the numerical model were available at a location within close proximity of the project site estimates of the hindcast based directional wave spectra were obtained at a directional resolution of 15 with frequency discretised over 25 bins exponentially spaced between 0 04 hz and 0 4 hz 2 5 and 25s thus encompassing the dominant wave energy of interest confirmation of the appropriateness of the selected model source terms forcing winds boundary conditions and other parameterisations were established through a validation of the modelled significant wave height using satellite altimeter observations as shown in fig 2 there was negligible bias in the significant wave height and the rms error was 0 307 m it is important to note that this verification is only for the total significant wave height with validation of the ability of the model to reproduce swell component of the sea state at the project site not possible in the absence of in situ observations 3 2 ship hydrodynamics the complex valued response amplitude operators raos of the drillship were obtained using the commercial hydrodynamic analysis software wamit lee 1995 to solve the combined diffraction and radiation problems based on three dimensional potential flow theory these numerical computations were complemented by a series of model scale tests of the vessel in a commercial wave basin following standard class guidance these experiments were used to verify the wave induced responses and determine the roll response for which viscous effects are particularly important both roll decay and irregular wave experiments were performed for the maximum significant wave height the vessel was intended to operate at and were obtained at incident wave direction increments of 15 from which the roll rao once the motions were normalised by the wave amplitude was ultimately determined it is acknowledged that due to possible non linearities the roll damping may have been overestimated for the relatively benign sea states which were considered as part of this study the moonpool with dimensions of 25 m by 12 5 m was included in both the wamit computations and the model tests in order to account for hydrodynamic resonances which could affect the heave response of the ship as the drillship operated at a near constant displacement and in relatively benign wave conditions the raos were computed for a single draft these were aligned with the centre of gravity of the vessel and were generated in wave direction increments of 15 consistent with the wave spectra the rao data were obtained at radial frequencies of between ω 0 1 rad s 1 and 1 3 rad s 1 i e 4 8s and 63s and at a resolution of d ω 0 1 rad s 1 the heave resonance corresponded to wave periods of approximately 10s with minimal heave response below 8s the pitch resonances ranged between 11s and 14s depending on the wave direction with minimal response also below 8s the roll resonance corresponded to wave periods of approximately 18s with the roll response comparatively more narrow banded and between around 10s and 30s 4 model evaluation methods 4 1 computation of motion statistics the stochastic properties of the hydrodynamic responses of the drillship were used to evaluate the performance of the model following chakrabarti 1987 for instance the response spectra of the principal motions of a floating facility can be theoretically derived as 1 φ i j ω π π h i ω β h j ω θ s ω θ d θ where i and j denote the motion of interest with 3 4 5 referring to heave roll and pitch respectively h i ω β is the response amplitude operator rao is the complex conjugate s ω θ is the directional wave spectra ω is the radial frequency and β is the relative incident wave direction with β 0 corresponding to following waves inherent in this computation is that the wave energy is temporally stationary and that the hydrodynamic responses of the ship are linear the statistical moments are of particular interest in this study which are defined as 2 m n i 0 ω n φ i i ω d ω where n 0 1 2 are the zeroth i e variance of the autospectra first and second statistical moments respectively the rayleigh approximation for the most probable maximum amplitude which is a key metric for assessing operability was computed from the equation 3 η m a x σ 2 log n where σ m 0 n t t z t z 2 π m 0 m 2 and t is the time interval in seconds over which the estimate is computed 4 2 derivation of directional wave spectra from the ship motions an independent estimate of the directional wave spectra was also derived from the stochastic properties of the ship motion response which aided in evaluating the performance of the hindcast the spectra were estimated using a parametric based approach drawing on the methodologies outlined by tannuri et al 2003 and nielsen 2017 for instance the technique is based on the assumption that the wave spectra can be approximately described using an analytical spectral model a jonswap parametric model combined with a cosine 2 s spreading function tucker and pitt 2001 was considered in this study the directional spectral density defined in the radial frequency domain is given as 4 s ω θ α h s 2 ω p 4 ω 5 exp 5 4 ω p ω 4 γ exp 1 2 ω ω p σ ω p 2

of wave propagation γ x is the gamma function and s is a spreading parameter which has a value of ω ω p 5 s m a x if ω ω p and otherwise ω ω p 2 5 s m a x these parameters therefore conveniently enable the model to describe a wide range of wave spectra that could be observed in the open sea including relatively narrow banded swells in this study the parameters h s t p γ and θ were sought as the region considered was dominated by swells with limited directional spreading a constant value of s m a x 50 was assumed similarly nielsen and stredulinsky 2012 fixed the value of s m a x and investigations also confirmed that the estimates in this study were not significantly affected by this simplification it should also be noted that the model as implemented here is intended for describing a single modal sea state which was appropriate for the majority of the cases considered in this study however as is subsequently demonstrated multi modal sea states can be considered by applying the single peak model to a subset of wave periods corresponding to the mode of interest provided that their spectral content is adequately separated in frequency space in order to solve for these unknown parameters a cost function of the following form was derived for each spectral density component 5 s r r 1 σ i 2 σ j 2 2 m 1 m φ i j ω m δ θ n 1 n h i ω m θ n h j ω m θ n s ω m θ n 2 where the measured variances σ i 2 etc have been used for normalization and which ensures that the spectral shape is preserved in order to facilitate the solver performance the model was applied to the heave roll and pitch ship responses which were assumed to be less affected particularly at longer wave periods by the action of the thrusters than the surge sway and yaw motions for computational efficiency the equations were solved in matrix form the hermitian nature of spectral density relations implies that the cost function can be constructed using the following vector ϕ 33 ϕ 44 ϕ 55 r e ϕ 34 r e ϕ 35 r e ϕ 45 i m ϕ 34 i m ϕ 35 i m ϕ 45 t the non linearity in the equations and the possibility of multiple local minima necessitates the use of a global optimisation routine while the matlab multistart algorithm the mathworks and inc 2015 was employed in this study it is possible to employ alternative methods such as a genetic algorithm see e g pascoal et al 2006 further details regarding the application of the parametric model are given by milne and zed 2018 5 results the performance of the model was evaluated for a range of sea states and operational conditions that were experienced by the ship during the drilling campaign fig 3 shows an example of time histories of the standard deviations i e σ m 0 and 10 minute most probable maximum amplitudes of the heave roll and pitch displacements measured by the ship and estimated using the hindcast at consecutive 1 hr intervals over a 14 day period the corresponding significant wave height peak period and mean incident wave direction estimated from the hindcast are also presented for reference to facilitate the comparisons the wave statistics were computed by integrating the wave energy spectral frequencies corresponding to the swell mode only and do not include contributions from wind waves which the ship was not sensitive to although relatively small at the site during the selected 14 day period the hindcast predicted swells arriving at the site in intervals of approximately 5 days with peak wave periods of up to 22s in general the comparisons demonstrate that the model was able to replicate the underlying trends in the ship motion statistics in response to these swells the histories elucidate that the agreement between the magnitudes of the measured and modelled response statistics was generally most favourable for peak wave periods of less than approximately 15s in these instances the agreement in the heave and pitch was typically within 10 the discrepancy in the roll was comparatively larger though for waves from the stern and bow the magnitude of the roll was generally relatively small to further facilitate the model evaluation a series of sea states and vessel heading combinations were specifically examined which were considered to be representative of both typical and less ideal operational conditions table 1 summarises the cases considered herein and compares the hindcast based estimates and measured values of the standard deviations and the most probable maximum amplitudes of the dynamic motions the wave spectral properties obtained from the hindcast and with those derived by the parametric model are also listed in the table for reference the first two cases are representative of the condition where the ship heading was aligned approximately with the principal direction of a relatively moderate swell i e when the ship followed the waves and the waves approached from ahead respectively these conditions are generally favoured operationally in order to minimise the roll motions referring to table 1 the agreement in the heave and pitch response statistics between the model and measured values was generally favourable i e between 2 and 20 percent whilst the estimates for the roll were underestimated by the model figs 4 and 5 serve to demonstrate that the estimated autospectra of the heave and pitch responses aligned relatively well with the measured data with the dominant energy encompassing the equivalent wave frequency bands the magnitude of the spectral energy near the peak frequency estimated by the model was however larger than that measured the application of the approach using the analytical wave model combined with the vessel raos to describe the motion response spectra hereafter simply referred to as the parametric model is also shown in fig 4 and fig 5 these demonstrate that generally favourable agreement with the measured data was achieved and that the parametric model results aligned closer than the hindcast values it is noteworthy to consider that given the autospectra of the heave and pitch motions are typically similar for cases of waves incident from either the bow or stern it is the quadrature component of φ 35 which has enabled the wave direction to be distinguished the directional spectra computed using the parametric model for the two cases are also compared with the respective hindcast spectra in fig 6 and fig 7 these show that the mean direction spreading and wave periods were generally consistent between the hindcast and parametric based estimates whilst the energy density of the parametric model was smaller given this latter result and the finding the hindcast based statistics exceeded the measured values it suggests that the hindcast estimates of the significant wave height differed from the parametric model by approximately 10 although conditions where a drillship is aligned with the waves may be more frequently experienced or favoured operationally it is useful to consider instances where significant wave energy is incident from the side of the ship for these cases the dynamic motions of the ship may be more appreciable particularly for roll but potentially unavoidable during a campaign cases 3 and 4 are representative of both a relatively benign quartering swell and more energetic beam on swell respectively and are summarized in table 1 in these scenarios the motion statistics estimated by the hindcast were in fair agreement with the measured values the comparisons of the wave spectra estimated from the hindcast and derived using the parametric model for the cases are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively these demonstrate that the distributions of the spectral energy estimates were also in reasonable agreement but again suggest that the hindcast overestimated the significant wave heights it is also important to acknowledge that while the previous cases have considered only single peaked wave spectra more complex sea states are common in the open sea such sea states can potentially result in resonant excitations of multiple motions constituents e g heave and roll and be particularly challenging to model fig 10 shows the hindcast directional sea state corresponding to case 5 which comprised two swell modes as well as a higher frequency wind wave component the motion statistics for all three motions considered were in generally favourable agreement particularly in spite of the inherent complexities the application of the parametric model to estimate the spectral energy corresponding to the two swell modes is demonstrated in fig 11 in this instance given that the frequency content of the two swell modes was deemed to be sufficiently distinct the single mode based parametric model was applied to resolve the swells independently by restricting the wave periods utilised in the computation in order to identify the shorter period swell mode wave periods greater than 15s were excluded to prevent the significant near resonant roll motion that was present around 18s from compromising the performance of the solver conversely the longer swell period mode was resolved by considering only wave periods greater than 15s such that the dominant heave and pitch responses arising from the shorter period swell were sufficiently excluded with this simple constraint the model is demonstrated to have yielded estimates which aligned generally well with that of the hindcast this case also serves as a very useful demonstration that the ship has minimal response to wind waves which is reflected by both the numerical and measured motion spectra shown in fig 11 having very little energy at wave periods corresponding to the higher frequency wind waves for a numerical modeller this is a salient point and reinforces the notion that it is not necessary to resolve the wind waves in the model in order to quantify the motions of interest to the drillship 6 discussion the acquisition of high quality motion data from a dynamically positioned drillship has provided a valuable new opportunity to evaluate the potential of a numerical wave spectra hindcast approach to quantify the dynamic response of floating facilities in general the results presented in the study provide encouraging support for the application of the model to obtain reliable estimates of the hydrodynamic motions of interest for operability assessments for the practitioner there are two independent sources of uncertainty inherent in the approach which must be appreciated those owing to errors in the hindcast and those associated with the characterisation of the hydrodynamic response of the ship to the incident waves in lieu of in situ concurrent measured wave data the parametric approach has been demonstrated to serve as a useful aid in evaluating the performance of the numerical wave spectra hindcasts the results suggest that generally favourable estimates of the peak spectral period and mean wave direction can be obtained from the hindcast for the majority of the cases investigated however the comparisons of the motion statistics and the parametric based wave spectra suggests differences in magnitudes of the spectral energy between that estimated by the hindcast and what was observed to explore this further measurements of the seastate from a wave buoy acquired at another swell dominated site were compared with estimates computed from a numerical hindcast fig 12 shows the respective time histories of the significant wave heights and the peak spectral periods these comparisons demonstrate the peak spectral periods generally aligned well and were similar to the range of wave periods observed by the drillship whilst the general trends in the significant wave height histories were consistent there was however comparatively greater disparity in their values in particular the histories elucidate that in several instances the arrival time of swell predicted by the hindcast was in error based on these results it is therefore plausible that the relatively large errors observed in the statistics for the relatively long wave periods could have arisen from similar arrival time issues it is also interesting to consider the measured and modelled directional wave spectra corresponding to day 19 presented in fig 13 the spectra serve to demonstrate that in spite of the near equivalent values of the significant wave height and peak spectra periods the modelled spectra under resolved the spectral peak and the directional spreading this can be attributed in part to the idealised nature of the model and the inability to resolve the spread of conditions across different directions at the swell frequencies which results in energy focused into a narrow section of the spectrum it is important to also appreciate that the pronounced asymmetrical nature of the observed spectra would not be accounted for by the analytical spreading assumed in the parametric model either for a vessel aligned with the mean direction of the waves representative of cases 1 and 2 the larger directional spreading evident in the observations could be expected to give rise to increased roll motions in particular as identified in the study to understand the possible cause of these discrepancies it is worth noting that in order to describe wave energy distributed over a wide frequency range ww3 utilises a logarithmic scaling of the frequencies such that f i 1 1 1 f i while this implies that the wind waves may be well resolved this is at the expense of the resolution of the swells this issue was briefly highlighted by tolman et al 2001 where it was attributed to leading to under resolved spectral peaks in the swell energy band as well as errors in the swell arrival times while the frequency resolution is a recognized area of the numerical modelling which may require further attention studies which have treated it in depth are scarce the present study therefore provides a useful demonstration of its possible significance in the context of offshore engineering in regards to the uncertainties associated with characterising the hydrodynamic response the rao discretisation may have also attributed to differences between the measured and modelled responses the roll response of a ship in particular is highly sensitive to both the wave period and direction based on the previous discussions it is plausible that the nature of the roll response was under resolved in the models this is perhaps best demonstrated by the hindcast estimates as well as the parametric model application for the cases in which the waves were nearly aligned with the ship heading the magnitude of the roll response decreases significantly towards zero as the wave direction coincides with the principal axis of a ship it can be expected that this trend would be relatively poorly resolved with a directional discretisation of 15 however whilst the discrepancy in the roll may be large for these typical operating states it is important to appreciate that the roll magnitudes remain relatively small and thus may not govern operability it is also important to acknowledge the presence of a moonpool in an assessment of the hydrodynamic uncertainties of a vessel such as a drillship a hydrodynamic piston type resonance in the moonpool could possibly affect the heave response of the vessel if not accounted for the natural frequency corresponding to the piston type resonance can be estimated to first order as equal to ω n g d where g is gravitational acceleration and d is the vessel draft faltinsen 1993 for the drillship considered in this study the natural frequency corresponded to a wave period of approximately 7s as there was minimal wave energy content in this wave period range in the present study such a resonance is unlikely to have been excited however the possibility of a moonpool resonance could potentially be an important consideration for the practitioner if a numerical hindcast approach were to be applied to a different site or vessel draught 7 concluding remarks knowledge of the wave induced hydrodynamic motions on a floating facility is critical for feasibility assessments structural integrity the safety of personnel onboard and ultimately vessel selection in practice a key shortcoming of historical approaches for conducting a feasibility assessment of a vessel at an offshore location has not been accounting for the frequency and directional characteristics of the wave energy and the specific response characteristics of the vessel of interest as relatively large heave roll and pitch amplitudes may be excited in the open sea this can have significant consequences on an operation and a poor vessel selection can ultimately result in significant downtime motivated by the need for accurate and rapid vessel motion prediction methodologies to support schedule optimisation and facility selection this study has presented a valuable new series of results in which to assess the applicability of a fully numerical method to estimate the dynamic motions of a floating facility it has been demonstrated that reliable estimates of key statistical properties which characterise the motions of a drillship can be obtained from a model which combines metocean hindcasts and first order predictions of the wave responses the frequency based approach of this methodology results in high computational efficiency enabling the approach to be further utilised in heading optimisation over short term forecast horizons for maximizing operational performance it is important to reinforce that owing to the idealised nature of the model it is possible that the long period wave energy may be under resolved by the hindcast which has implications for swell dominated sites in particular it has been demonstrated that errors in the magnitude of the swell energy swell arrival time and degree of spreading could be a possible consequence of this it is particularity important to acknowledge the potential issue with the swell arrival time if the model is to be employed for realtime operations which are time critical such as drilling the possibility to predict the swell wave climate that the study presents is also particularly useful at remote locations during preliminary drilling campaigns as the offshore oil and gas industry moves to more remote locations the availability of long term wave records are scarce the information provided by this methodology makes effective use of standard monitoring equipment onboard most floating facilities to efficiently and economically provide additional data on the wave energy content that a vessel would be sensitive to acknowledgments this work

23083,in offshore areas quaternary loose seabed soils widely distribute around the world and a great number of offshore structures actually have been constructed on quaternary seabed floors in practical engineering it is highly necessary to evaluate the stability of offshore structures built on quaternary seabed floors under the impact of extreme ocean waves based on the varans equation and the dynamic biot s equation an integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d has been developed by ye et al 2013b to investigate the interaction between ocean waves marine structures and their seabed foundations in this study taking the composite breakwater project in the west harbour zone of yantai port in china as an engineering case the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d is used to evaluate the stability of the composite breakwater under the impact of fortified ocean waves with a 50 years recurrence period computational results indicate that the composite breakwater at west harbour zone of yantai port would be generally stable during its service life this application demonstrates that the integrated model fssi cas 2d is applicable and suitable for practical engineering the case study illustrated in this study can provide ocean engineers with an excellent case demonstration of engineering application to evaluate the stability of offshore structures under the impact of extreme ocean waves keywords composite breakwater stability analysis fssi cas 2d liquefaction west harbour zone yantai port 1 introduction in last 20 years a great number of marine structures such as breakwaters have been constructed in offshore areas the stability of offshore marine structures under ocean wave loading is the main concern of ocean engineers involved in design in offshore environment newly deposited quaternary seabed soil is widely distributed for example the loose silty soil in the zone of the estuary of yellow river in china actually a great number of offshore structures have been built on quaternary sediments the particle arrangement of quaternary seabed soil generally is relatively loose far from being very dense under cyclic ocean wave loading seabed soil particles re arrange their relative positions to a more dense status accompanied by a pore water drainage process in this process the pore water pressure builds up making soil liquefy or soften as a result the overlaying marine structures would lose their stability therefore it is of great importance to quantitatively evaluate the stability of offshore marine structures constructed on quaternary loose seabed floors the preconditions for evaluating the stability of offshore marine structures include two aspects 1 understanding the mechanism of wave structure seabed interaction 2 development of numerical models for stability evaluation in early stage analytical solutions were widely proposed to study the mechanism of wave seabed interaction in which marine structures could not be considered due to the limitation of analytical methods seabed soil must be very dense in which elastic deformation is dominant under wave loading in analytical solutions the dense seabed could be infinite yamamoto et al 1978 madsen 1978 or finite hsu and jeng 1994 jeng and hsu 1996 in depth it also could be isotropic or anisotropic the waves adopted in these analytical solutions were all based on stokes wave theory involving progressive wave standing wave or short crested wave hsu and jeng 1994 the governing equation for seabed soil could be the consolidation equation the u p approximation and the u w equation liao et al 2015 actually the uncoupled method was adopted in these analytical solutions there was no feedback from seabed soil to ocean wave when seabed responding to ocean wave besides numerical methods are also powerful tool to investigate the wave seabed interaction however most previous numerical investigations were also limited to very dense elastic seabed soil such as those in ye and jeng 2012 gatmiri 1990 jeng and lin 1996 zhou et al 2005 and luan and wang 2001 for the interaction between ocean waves and loose seabed floors few investigations were undertaken until recently yang and ye 2017 and yang and ye 2018 systematically study the dynamics characteristics of loose seabed floor under the impact of standing wave and wave current for the scientific problem of wave structure seabed interaction it seems that numerical methods are the only feasible ways due to the complexity of the interaction between ocean wave marine structures and their seabed foundations mase et al 1994 developed a fem numerical model to investigate the wave induced pore water pressures and effective stresses in a sandy seabed foundation beneath a composite caisson type breakwater based on biot s consolidation equation after that mizutani et al 1998 and mizutani et al 1999 developed a bem fem combination numerical model to study the wave seabed structure interaction by adopting a prototype model their work greatly promoted the progress on wave structure seabed interaction however the numerical models proposed by mase et al 1994 and mizutani et al 1998 could not yet be applied in practice engineering due to the following two reasons first the potential flow theory involving laplace s equation used in mizutani et al 1998 could not simulate the complicated motion of seawater in extreme ocean waves such as breaking and turbulence in real life large scale cases second only a poro elastic soil model could be used in their numerical models as presented above a great number of offshore structures have been built on quaternary loose seabed floor the wave induced behaviour of loose seabed foundation must be characterized using poro elasto plastic soil models to overcome the above two difficulties ye et al 2013b developed an integrated model fssi cas 2d for the problem of fluid structures seabed interaction fssi in the integrated model fssi cas 2d the volume average renolds average navier stokes varans equation was adopted to simulate the complicated motion of seawater in ocean waves as well as porous flow in porous seabeds the dynamic biot s equation was adopted to describe the nonlinear behaviour of marine structures and their seabed foundations a one way integrating algorithm based on the radial point interpolation method was developed to link the two equations by guaranteeing the continuity of pressure and velocity at interfaces between the seawater domain and the seabed foundation marine structures the integrated model fssi cas 2d has been widely validated by an analytical solution and a series of wave flume tests ye et al 2013b most importantly several poro elasto plastic soil models such as mohr coulomb modified cambridge clay pastor zienkiewics mark iii etc are available to describe the behaviour of loose seabed foundation in fssi cas 2d so far this integrated numerical model has been successfully applied to investigate the dynamics of composite breakwater and its seabed foundation involving breaking wave ye et al 2014 tsunami wave ye et al 2013a and loose seabed soil ye et al 2015 it is indicated by these successful cases that the integrated model fssi cas 2d can be applied in practice engineering to evaluate the stability of offshore marine structures in this study taking the composite breakwater project at the west harbour zone of yantai port in china as the engineering case the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d was adopted to evaluate the stability of the composite breakwater under the impact of fortified ocean waves with a 50 years recurrence period computational results indicate that the composite breakwater at west harbour zone of yantai port would be generally stable in its service life this case application demonstrates that the integrated model fssi cas 2d is applicable in the practical engineering and this integrated model also can be utilized to optimize the design of offshore structures in the future 2 integrated model fssi cas 2d 2 1 governing equations the dynamic biot s equation known as u p approximation proposed in zienkiewicz et al 1980 is used to describe the

cas 2d was developed by ye 2012 in fssi cas 2d the volume average reynolds average navier stokes varans equation hsu et al 2002 governs wave motion and porous flow in porous seabed the above dynamic biot s equation governs the dynamic behaviour of offshore structure and its seabed foundation a coupled algorithm is developed to couple the varans equation and biot s dynamics equation together more detailed information about the coupled model can be found in ye et al 2013b ye 2012 and zienkiewicz et al 1999 in this study large deformation occurs in the seabed foundation near to breakwater built on loose liquefiable seabed under seismic wave shaking the updated lagrangian method is adopted to deal with this large deformation problem in the computation the coordinates of nodes status variables of soil which are dependent on the effective stress history such as void ratio e and permeability k are updated in each time step based on deformation correspondingly the coefficient matrices m k q g s h f 1 f 2 as well as boundary values on boundaries are also updated 2 2 constitutive model pastor zienkiewics mark iii based on classical plasticity theory the constitutive relationship for the

under monotonic and cyclic loading zienkiewicz et al 1999 2 3 verification the validity and reliability of the developed integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d have been widely verified by ye 2012 adopting the analytical solution proposed by hsu and jeng 1994 and a series of laboratory wave flume tests conducted by lu 2005 for regular wave and cnoidal wave tsai and lee 1995 for standing wave mizutani et al 1998 for submerged breakwater and mostafa et al 1999 for composite breakwater the developed semi coupled numerical model fssi cas 2d was used to reproduce the dynamic response of elastic seabed foundation and or breakwater the good agreement between the predicted numerical results and the corresponding experimental data indicated that fssi cas 2d is a highly reliable for the problem of wave seabed structure interaction furthermore the validity and reliability of fssi cas 2d for the problem of wave loose seabed soil interaction was also verified by a wave flume test teh et al 2003 and a geotechnical centrifuge test sassa and sekiguchi 1999 more detailed information about the verification work can be found in ye 2012 and related work has been published in ye et al 2013b additionally the integrated model fssi cas 2d incorporating pziii soil model has been successfully applied to investigate the dynamics and stability of an idealized composite breakwater built on a loose seabed foundation ye et al 2015 3 engineering background yantai port is located on the southwest coastal line of bohai bay china it is geographically affiliated to the city of yantai shandong province china as illustrated in fig 1 currently yantai port includes four harbour zones they are chifu bay zone west harbour zone longkou harbour zone and penglai harbour zone respectively among them the west harbour zone is the largest one and is a core asset for development of the yantai port total length of the wharfs in the west harbour zone is 19 km the maximum water depth in front of the wharfs is 28 m the west harbour zone is divided into 8 functional zones such as container chemical liquid bulk cargo general bulk crude oil and lng etc totally 65 berths with capacity 50 000 to 300 000 tons will be constructed the planned ultimate bearing capacities of the west harbour zone will be up to 200 million tonnes and 15 million standard containers per year in order to guarantee the safety of vessels when docking in front of the wharfs for loading and unloading a group of deep water breakwaters have been constructed to surround a harbour basin with area about 5 km2 as illustrated in fig 2 in the west harbour zone the whole breakwater construction project is divided into two phases the structure form of phase i is the sloping rubble mound breakwater covered by accropodes and it is the composite breakwater in phase ii as shown in fig 3 currently the construction of breakwaters in phase i and phase ii have all been finished undoubtedly the stability of these breakwaters under extreme ocean waves is the key factor for the long term service ability of west harbour zone of yantai port it is of great significance to evaluate the stability of the breakwaters at the west harbour zone of yantai port in this study taking the composite breakwaters in phase ii of the west harbour zone as the representative the newly developed model fssi cas 2d is adopted to evaluate the stability of the composite breakwaters under fortified ocean wave to implement this application the profiles and basic physical properties of the seabed soil layers which is as the foundation of the breakwaters at the west harbour zone were collected from the company in charge of the in situ geotechnical survey for the phase ii project as demonstrated in fig 4 there are mainly five soil layers in the seabed foundation of the breakwaters they are muddy silt clay ①1 silty clay ①2 clay ③1 silty clay ③2 and silt ③4 respectively their basic physical properties of the five seabed soil layers obtained by performing a series of geotechnical tests are listed in table 1 it can be seen that the muddy silt clay ①1 and ①2 are the weak soil layers with thickness of 12 m 14 m their water content is up to 39 6 and 32 3 void ratio is around 1 0 and the bearing capacity f is only 70 90 kpa respectively in engineering practice the surface layer of a thickness of 2 m of the first soil layer ①1 exactly beneath the composite breakwater was replaced with coarse sand to enhance the bearing capacity of the seabed foundation furthermore a great number of plastic drainage strips with a length of 12 m were inserted into the soil layers ①1 and ①2 with a spacing of 1 0 m to improve their seepage permeability this engineering measure can effectively to accelerate the process of consolidation of the seabed foundation as well as the subsiding of overlying composite breakwaters in table 1 it is also can be found that the seabed soil layers ③1 ③2 ③3 all have excellent bearing performance with bearing capacities are in the range of 180 kpa 200 kpa fortified parameters of ocean wave for the breakwaters in the west harbour zone of yantai port also are necessary in design practice for the evaluation of stability of these breakwaters a third party consulting company was employed by the owner of yantai port to specially observe the ocean wave parameters in the area near to the west harbour zone in long term based on the long term observation data of ocean waves the owner of yantai port set out the fortified parameters of ocean wave for the breakwaters in the west harbour zone as listed in table 2 in which h 1 is the average height of the highest 1 wave height h 5 is the average height of the highest 5 wave height and h 13 is the average height of the highest 13 wave height in this study in order to examine the stability of the composite breakwater in the west harbour zone under the most extreme sea state the ocean wave parameters related to the 50 years recurrence period are chosen they are 6 5 m in wave height 9 6s in wave period and 3 56 m in water level elevation due to the fact that the average elevation of the seabed foundation surface is 18 m the water depth in this study is 21 5 m 4 computational domain boundary condition and soil parameters according to the design diagram of the composite breakwater in the west harbour zone of yantai port shown in fig 3 and the profiles of seabed soil layers in fig 4 the computational domain used in this study to evaluate the stability of the composite breakwater of phase ii project in the west harbour zone of yantai port is illustrated in fig 5 the total length of the computational domain is 750 m x 350 m to x 1100 m the width of the rubble mound is 100 m its distance to the left and right boundary of the seabed foundation is 400 m and 250 m respectively due to the fact the maximum depth of surveying boreholes in the seabed floor on which this composite breakwater is built is only 35 5 m the thickness of the seabed foundation in the computation is set as 35 5 m correspondingly in this study the seabed surface is set as z 0 m and the left side of the seabed foundation is set as x 350 m the wave maker is located at x 0 m in the fluid domain the distance from the wave maker to the composite breakwater is 750 m about 6 times of the wave length in stability analysis the following boundary conditions are applied 1 the lateral sides of seabed foundation are fixed in horizontal 14 u s l e f t s i d e u s r i g h t s i d e 0 2 the bottom of seabed foundation is fixed in both horizontal and vertical and treated as a impermeable board 15 u s w s 0 a n d p s z 0 a t z 35 5 m 3 on the surface of the seabed floor and the outer surfaces of the composite breakwater the total pressure including hydrostatic and wave induced hydrodynamic pressure is applied 4 since the caisson is made of concrete it can be treated as an impermeable object as a result an upward buoyancy acting on the bottom of the caisson induced by hydrostatic and wave induced hydrodynamic pressure must be applied it is an indisputable fact in the field of geomechanics that the reliability of the computational results is highly dependent on the accuracy of soil rock s physical parameters in this study the constitutive soil model pziii is used to describe the mechanical behaviour of the seabed soil foundation therefore it is necessary to determine the model parameters needed by pziii model for the five soil layers of the seabed foundation however only conventional geotechnical testing work in the field survey stage was conducted according to the code for investigation of geotechnical engineering of ports jts 133 1 2010 and the code of design and construction of breakwaters jts 154 1 2011 in china at the design stage it was not planned that the integrated model fssi cas 2d would be applied to examine the stability of the composite breakwater in the west harbour zone of yantai port as a result geotechnical testing work such as dynamic triaxial test to determine the model parameters of the five layers seabed foundation soil for pziii soil model was not performed the only way is to estimate these model parameters of the seabed foundation soil based on their basic properties as listed in table 1 in the future a series of geotechnical tests are highly recommended to be conducted to determine the model parameters of seabed foundation soil if fssi cas 2d is adopted to examine the stability of offshore structures in the pziii soil model there are totally 13 soil parameters among them p 0 is a reference pressure at which the soil parameters measured in the tests as listed in table 1 the deformation modulus of soil e s was measured in the stress range of 100 200 kpa based on this p 0 is estimated as 150 kpa in this study k e v o and g e s o is the bulk modulus and shear modulus of soil at reference pressure p 0 respectively estimated according to the following theoretic formulations 16 e 1 ν 1 2 ν 1 ν e s 17 k e v o e 3 1 2 ν a n d g e s o e 2 1 ν where ν is poisson s ratio of soil according to previous experience ν 0 38 for soil layers ①1 and ①2 ν 0 3 for soil layers ③1 ③2 and ③3 m f is the slope of critical state line csl of soils one can be estimated as 18 m f 6 sin ϕ 3 sin ϕ in which ϕ is the friction angle of soil m g is a soil parameter related to plastic potential surface similar to m f generally m g is less than m f in this study m g m f is set as 0 9 referring to the soil parameters of nevada sands given by zienkiewicz et al 1999 h 0 is a parameter describing the modulus of soil at the first loading stage elastic deformation is dominant referring the elastic modulus e at p 0 h 0 can be estimated as h 0 e p 0 according to the definition of loading modulus h l in equation 12 h u 0 is the unloading modulus of soil at the first unloading stage if there is no plastic deformation generated at the first unloading stage then h u 0 should be equal to the elastic modulus of soil e in theory if plastic deformation is generated h u 0 should be e 1 r a t i o p l a s t i c in which r a t i o p l a s t i c is the percentage of plastic deformation in the total deformation due to the fact that the soil layers ①1 and ①2 are relatively soft and weak plastic deformation in cyclic loading and unloading processes must be significant the r a t i o p l a s t i c is set as 40 for soil layers ①1 and ①2 meanwhile the bearing capacity of soil layers ③1 ③2 and ③3 reaches up to around 200 kpa as illustrated in table 1 the plastic deformation in cyclic loading and unloading process should be apparently less than that of ①1 and ①2 the r a t i o p l a s t i c is set as 15 for soil layers ③1 ③2 and ③3 in this study the other six parameters α f α g β 0 β 1 γ u and γ d m are material coefficients related to soil properties these material coefficients can be reliably calibrated by geotechnical testing data such as dynamic triaxial test due to the fact that the test data is not available in the current situation the values suggested by zienkiewicz et al 1999 are used in this study all the estimated soil parameters of the five seabed soil layers for pziii soil model are listed in table 3 the composite breakwater in the west harbour zone of yantai port consists of concrete caisson and its underlying rubble mound in stability analysis the caisson is treated as an impermeable rigid object and the rubble mound is treated as a kind of porous medium with great porosity the poro elastic model is adopted for the caisson and rubble mound with parameters listed in table 4 in this study the saturation of the five soil layers of the seabed foundation soil are all set as 98 as presented above a series of plastic drainage strips have been inserted into the soil layers ①1 and ①2 in the zone beneath the composite breakwater to enhance their permeability to consider this effect the permeability coefficients of soil layers ①1 and ①2 in the zone beneath the composite breakwater are set to 100 times their original value as illustrated in table 1 in the computation 5 initial condition in offshore environments the seabed soil usually experiences consolidation under its own weight additionally seabed foundation beneath breakwaters will be loaded by the weight of breakwater after construction resulting in the generation of excess pore pressure in seabed foundation at the early stage excess pore pressure will be dissipated over time meanwhile breakwater subsides downward until a new balanced consolidation state is reached this consolidation process of seabed foundation under a composite breakwater has been studied in shen et al 2017 in the stability analysis of the composite breakwater in the west harbour zone this balanced consolidation state is taken as the initial condition in fig 6 the distribution of the displacement effective stresses and pore pressure in the seabed foundation after consolidation is demonstrated it can be seen that the composite breakwater subsides about 20 cm under its own self weight after consolidation due to the gravity compression of the breakwater the effective stress σ z in the zone under the composite breakwater increases dramatically relative to the zone far away from the breakwater in the seabed floor away from the composite breakwater the distribution of effective stress σ x and σ z is layered indicating that the effect of offshore structures on effective stress is only limited in the zone around offshore structure itself it also found that there are two concentration zones of shear stress in the seabed foundation beneath the composite breakwater due to the gravity compression of breakwater the maximum magnitude of the shear stress could reach up to about 50 kpa the distribution of pore pressure in the seabed foundation is layered hydrostatic pressure even in the zone beneath the breakwater it indicates that the excess pore pressure in the seabed foundation has completely dissipated due to the impermeability of caisson the pore pressure in the caisson is all zero 6 stability analysis 6 1 hydrodynamics ocean waves are the main driving factor for the failure of offshore structures in practice before examining the stability of the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone of yantai port under the fortified ocean wave it is necessary to firstly investigate the characteristics of the fortified ocean wave when it interacts with the composite breakwater and the seabed foundation so as to determine the wave induced force acting on the composite breakwater the wave profile distribution of pore pressure dynamic pore pressure velocity and turbulent energy k of fortified wave at 30t and 60t are shown in fig 7 compared the hydrodynamic characteristics at t 30t with those at t 60t it is found that the wave profile and the distribution of velocity are both harmonic at t 30t howevr the fortified wave is sightly breaking at t 60t the distribution of velocity is correspondingly disordered it also can be observed from the distribution of turbulent energy k that the turbulence at t 30t is minor the maximum k is only o 1j at this moment located at the area far away from the composite breakwater in front of the breakwater the turbulent energy k is nearly zero however the situation at t 60t is significantly different the turbulence becomes considerable at t 60t the maximum k reaches up to 1 5j which is one order greater than that at t 30t the turbulence of the fortified wave mainly occurs in the areas near to the free surface and in front of the breakwater overall it seems that the fortified ocean wave tends to become unstable and breaks with time when interacting with the composite breakwater when the fortified ocean wave is simulated the seabed foundation and rubble mound is treated as porous medium and the caisson is treated as impermeable rigid object as a result there is distribution of water pore pressure in the seabed foundation and rubble mound however there is no pore pressure in the caisson as shown in fig 7 the distribution of pore pressure in the seabed foundation and rubble mound is wavy directly influenced by the ocean waves wave induced dynamic pressure is the driving force causing the seabed foundation response for example the pore pressure in the seabed could build up leading to the softening of seabed soil as shown in fig 7 the distribution of the wave induced dynamic pressure is periodic under the wave crest the dynamic pressure is positive meanwhile it is negative value under the wave trough the maximum magnitude of the dynamic pressure acting on the caisson induced by the fortified wave can reach up to about 30 kpa in the engineering practice wave induced force on offshore structures is an important parameter for the stability design of structures fortunately fssi cas 2d can quantitatively predict this wave induced force applied on offshore structures as illustrated in fig 8 it is demonstrated in fig 8 that the amplitude of the dynamics force acting on the caisson induced by the fortified ocean wave is about 800 kn per meter of breakwater ocean engineers must make sure that the composite breakwater in the west harbour zone can resist the risk of overturning under this dynamic force another important factor that needs to be considered is the seawater of overtopping fig 9 illustrates the time history of the accumulated volume of seawater unit l m overtopping the composite breakwater it is found that the accumulated volume of seawater overtopping per meter breakwater is about 350 l in the period of 90s time 155s 245s the average rate of seawater overtopping is as little as 3 9 l s m it is indicated that the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone of yantai port has adequate abilities to resist the seawater overtopping induced by the fortified ocean wave 6 2 dynamics of structure seabed foundation system the dynamics of structure and seabed foundation forms the base for evaluation of the stability of offshore structures in this section the dynamics of the composite breakwater and its foundation at the west harbour zone of yantai port is analyzed under the impact of the fortified ocean wave in the design stage ocean engineers generally would like to know whether their design structures subside or not and how much would the structure subside under a fortified ocean wave for the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone of yantai port the computational result illustrated in fig 10 can answer the above two questions the time history of the displacement of the left top corner of the breakwater clearly indicates that the composite breakwater would subside dramatically reaching 120 cm after 60t impacted by the fortified ocean wave at the meantime the horizontal displacement of composite breakwater reaches 180 cm to the left side the dramatical horizontal displacement and subsidence indicate that the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone is gradually tilting to the left side in the impact process of the fortified ocean wave this tilting process of the composite breakwater is demonstrated in fig 11 it can be seen that the composite breakwater is basically stable even through it has subsided 120 cm and tilts to the left side 180 cm under the impact of fortified ocean wave an interesting phenomenon observed in fig 11 is the deformation of the seabed foundation and rubble mound due to the fact that the seabed foundation soil at the west harbour zone of yantai port is relatively loose and has a weak bearing capacity pore pressure in the seabed foundation will build up under cyclic wave loading resulting in the softening or liquefaction in the seabed foundation exactly because of this reason the overlaying composite breakwater subsides and tilts to one side forcing the seabed foundation to deform as shown in fig 11 the seabed soil near to the left part of the rubble mound moves up simultaneously to the left due to the compression of the settled composite breakwater because of the requirement for deformation coordination between the rubble mound and the seabed soil around it uplift also occurs in the leftmost part of the rubble mound the magnitude of deformation in the composite breakwater and its seabed foundation is illustrated in fig 12 it is clearly seen that the deformation in the foundation zone around the left part of the rubble mound is most significant the maximum magnitude of the uplift displacement of the seabed soil in this zone is up to 100 cm except for the deformation variation of pore pressure and effective stresses in the seabed foundation are also important characteristics of the dynamics to illustrate this two typical positions in the seabed foundation are chosen as representative they are position a x 650 m z 2 5 m far away from the composite breakwater and position c x 800 m z 2 5 m under the left part of rubble mound as shown in fig 5 the time histories of pore pressure and effective stresses at the two typical positions a and c are shown in fig 13 and fig 14 in fig 13 it can be seen that pore pressure at position a builds up under the impact of the fortified wave correspondingly the effective stress σ x and σ x reduce from their initial values 15 kpa and 22 kpa resulting in the softening of the seabed foundation to the time t 350s σ z becomes about 1 kpa which means that the current stress between soil particles at position a is less than 5 of its initial value more than 95 of contact stress between soil particles has vanished at this moment the seabed soil at position a can be treated as liquefied soil correspondingly the shear stress at position a basically becomes nearly zero at this moment because the liquefied soil behaves like a heavy fluid losing the ability to resist shear stress as illustrated in fig 13 the variation of the effective stresses induced by the fortified ocean wave is complicated it is shown that the magnitude of the effective stresses σ x and σ z as well as the amplitude of shear stress τ x z at position a increase gradually with the impact of the fortified ocean wave after the seabed soil has become liquefied this phenomenon can not be explained from a linear perspective and precisely reflects the nonlinear characteristics for the interaction between the wave and the seabed foundation in fig 14 it can be seen that the characteristic of the dynamic response to the fortified ocean wave at position c under the composite breakwater is significantly different with that at position a it can be clearly observed that the residual pore pressure at position c dramatically builds up from 225 kpa to 395 kpa before t 310s and then it quickly reduces into a range of 350 360 kpa this reduction process of the pore pressure can undoubtedly be attributed to the mechanism of pore pressure dissipation actually the build up and dissipation of pore pressure in seabed soil both simultaneously exist excess pore pressure occurs in seabed soil exactly due to the fact that the rate of build up of pore pressure is greater than the rate of dissipation it is also can be seen in fig 14 that the effective stresses σ x σ z and τ x z all increase before t 210s however they all are reduced after t 210s finally σ x σ z and τ x z all approach to zero from the time t 400s indicating that the seabed soil at position c becomes liquefied at t 400s in fig 14 there is an interesting phenomenon to which we need to pay attention as stated above the effective stresses at position c all increase before t 210s however the corresponding pore pressure also increases in this period furthermore the pore pressure at position c reduces in the period of t 310s 400s while its effective stresses also reduce in this period it seems that the classic theory for the effective stress principle in soil mechanics is not established in this case according to the effective stress principle the effective stresses should reduce in the process of pore pressure build up actually there is a precondition for the above statement that the total stress must be constant in this study the effect of the composite breakwater is significant from the analysis of the displacement of the composite breakwater it is known that the composite breakwater subsides downward and tilts to left side under the impact of the fortified ocean wave in the process of subsiding and tilting the composite breakwater will apply an additional force on the soil at position c due to the offset of the gravity of the breakwater as a result the total stress at position c is not constant before t 210s the total stress at position c increases after that it reduces the complicated variation of the total stress at position c directly leads to the above stated interesting phenomenon demonstrated in fig 14 actually the classic theory for the effective stress principle in soil mechanics is still applicable in this study from the above analysis it is known that the interaction between ocean wave offshore structures and seabed foundation is highly nonlinear numerical models are the only ways to handle these kinds of complicated engineering problems the above analysis is only based on the computational results at two typical positions in the seabed foundation of the composite breakwater it is necessary to further study the distribution of wave induced effective stresses and pore pressure in the seabed foundation fig 15 demonstrates these distributions at t 60t it is found that the effect of the fortified ocean wave is mainly concentrated in the seabed at the open sea side the distribution of σ x σ z in the seabed foundation are wavy obviously significantly affected by the applied wave in the seabed foundation the area with red colour where σ x σ z approach to zero is huge indicating that soil liquefaction has occurred in a large area in the seabed foundation especially in the area under the composite breakwater another phenomenon observed in the distribution of pore pressure is that there are a series of core shape areas in which the pore pressure is higher than that in the surrounding zone it indicates that the build up of pore pressure is not uniform in seabed foundation under ocean wave loading it also can be seen in the distribution of σ z that there is a narrow banded area in which effective stress is huge in the seabed foundation beneath the composite breakwater this high effective stress banded area behaves like a pile supporting the overlying composite breakwater otherwise the composite breakwater will sink into the liquefied foundation and finally be submerged 6 3 liquefaction estimation it has been widely verified that loose seabed soil can liquefy under ocean wave loading by laboratory tests sassa and sekiguchi 1999 and field records sassa et al 2006 there are generally two types of liquefaction mechanisms for seabed soil one is momentary liquefaction only occurring in very dense sand under wave troughs its effect on the transient stability of offshore structures is minor however momentary liquefaction could boost the scouring of seabed soil around offshore structures another is residual liquefaction due to the pore pressure building up in loose soil the liquefaction occurring in the loose seabed foundation at the west harbour zone of yantai port in this study is exactly residual liquefaction generally residual liquefaction in seabed foundations has fatal effects on the stability of offshore structures in this section the liquefaction is quantitatively estimated for the seabed foundation of composite breakwater at the west harbour zone under fortified ocean wave impacting following yang and ye 2017 a parameter being referred to as residual liquefaction potential l p o t e n t i a l is defined to quantitatively estimate the liquefaction zone in seabed foundation 19 l p o t e n t i a l σ z d σ z 0 α c where σ z d σ z σ z 0 is wave induced dynamic vertical effective stress σ z 0 is initial vertical effective stress σ z is current vertical effective stress c is cohesion of seabed soil α is a material coefficient in equation 19 the cohesion of seabed soil is considered from the point of view that cohesive soil is much more difficult to become liquefied under cyclic loading it indicates that soil cohesion could effectively boost the liquefaction resistance of soil l r σ z 0 α c liu and jeng 2016 therefore cohesion c of soil must be considered when defining liquefaction potential due to the fact that macroscopic cohesion c of soil is not absolutely equivalent to microscopic liquefaction resistance of soil particles a material coefficient must be added to the cohesion c of soil in equation 19 currently investigations on the effect of cohesion of soil on its liquefaction resistance are limited in this study the value of the material coefficient α is set as 0 1 in theory when l p o t e n t i a l is greater than or equal to 1 0 the seabed soil becomes liquefied according to this definition l p o t e n t i a l is estimated in the seabed foundation of the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone of yantai port based on the computational results of the effective stresses the distribution of l p o t e n t i a l in the seabed foundation at times t 10t t 20t t 40t and t 60t are illustrated in fig 16 the zone with red colour where l p o t e n t i a l 1 0 is the predicted liquefaction zone it can be seen that 1 liquefaction first occurs in the zone near to the surface of the seabed foundation 2 the liquefaction zone in the seabed foundation gradually enlarges with the impact of the fortified ocean wave 3 the frontier of the liquefaction zone is wavy and progressively downward up to the time t 60t most of the seabed foundation soil beneath the composite breakwater becomes liquefied however there is still a non liquefaction banded area beneath the composite breakwater as stated above this non liquefaction zone with high effective stress behaves like a pile supporting the overlying composite breakwater even though most parts of the seabed foundation at west harbour zone of yantai port become liquefied at t 60t under the impact of the fortified ocean wave the computation results given by the integrated model fssi cas 2d clearly indicate that the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone only subsides 120 cm and moves 180 cm to the left the composite breakwater can still steadily stand on the seabed foundation indicating that the stability of composite breakwater at the west harbour zone can be guaranteed under the impact of the extreme fortified ocean wave due to the fact that there are terms only related to the effective stress in equation 19 this criteria is actually a stress based liquefaction criteria except for stress based criteria there is another liquefaction criteria based on excess pore pressure defined as 20 l p p e x c e s s σ z 0 where p e x c e s s is the excess pore pressure this criteria is a pore pressure based liquefaction criteria if there is only the seabed floor without a marine structure then the stress based liquefaction criteria equation 19 is essentially similar to the pore pressure based liquefaction criteria equation 20 because the total stress is kept constant if there is no effect of marine structure the value of excess pore pressure should be equal to the wave induced dynamic effective stress according to effective stress principle however the difference between the stress based criteria and the pore pressure based criteria is considerable if there are marine structures on the seabed foundation because the total stress is no longer a constant in such cases according to the definition of soil liquefaction that the effective stress vanishes between soil particles the stress based criteria is a direct criteria to estimate the occurrence of soil liquefaction regardless of whether there are marine structures or not in the practice of computation seabed soil can be treated as liquefied soil so long as the current effective stress between soil particles approach to zero correspondingly the pore pressure based criteria is an indirect criteria due to the fact the development of excess pore pressure is complicated in nonlinear cases where marine structures are involved it is relatively difficult to link the magnitude of excess pore pressure to soil liquefaction in other words there is no absolute connection between excess pore pressure and soil liquefaction in the cases involving marine structures seabed soil can not become liquefied even the excess pore pressure has exceeded the initial effective stress therefore the pore pressure based liquefaction criteria is not reliable in cases marine structures are involved this unreliability of the pore pressure based liquefaction criteria is illustrated taking the seabed foundation at the west harbour zone of yantai port as a example fig 17 illustrates the time history of σ z p e x c e s s and l p p e x c e s s σ z 0 at position c in the seabed foundation of the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone it can be seen that the effective stress σ z becomes zero from time t 400s indicating that the seabed soil at position c is liquefied after t 400s because the effective stress between soil particles has completely vanished however the excess pore pressure at position c is only about 100 kpa and l p p e x c e s s σ z 0 based on the pore pressure based criteria is only around 0 3 after t 400s therefore the seabed soil at position c is estimated to be non liquefied after t 400s according to the pore pressure based criteria this result is of course contradictory to the real situation where the seabed soil has become liquefied the distribution of l p p e x c e s s σ z 0 based on the pore pressure based criteria in the seabed foundation at t 30t and 60t are further shown in fig 18 compared with the predicted liquefaction zone adopting the stress based criteria shown in fig 16 it is found that the predicted liquefaction zone adopting pore pressure based criteria is disordered and significantly different to that shown in fig 16 it indicates that the pore pressure based criteria to estimate liquefaction zone is unreliable in cases where marine structures are involved it is highly recommended to adopt the stress based criteria to judge the occurrence of seabed soil liquefaction in the engineering practice 7 conclusions in this study dynamic response characteristics of the composite breakwater and its seabed foundation at the west harbour zone of yantai port under the impact of an extreme fortified ocean wave are comprehensively investigated using the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d as the computation tool based on the computational results the stability of the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone of yantai port is further evaluated this study provides ocean engineers with a demonstration case for the application of integrated model fssi cas 2d in practice finally the following outcomes are obtained from this application case 1 the rate of seawater per meter overtopping over the composite breakwater is as little as 3 9 l s m it indicates that the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone of yantai port has adequate abilities to resist seawater overtopping induced by the fortified ocean wave 2 the amplitude of the wave induced horizontal impact force acting on the caisson lateral side is 800 kn per meter of breakwater 3 liquefaction can occur in most parts of the seabed foundation on the open sea side under the long term impact of the fortified ocean wave this factor would be fatal for the stability of the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone of yantai port however the computation results also confirm that the composite breakwater subsides 1 2 m and moves 1 8 m to the left side at t 60t for such a large scale composite breakwater this is only slight tilting unacceptable subsidence and tilting do not occur for the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone of yantai port under the impact of the extreme fortified ocean wave summarily the stability of the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone of yantai port could be guaranteed for a long term service period 4 the case study demonstrates that the integrated model fssi cas 2d is proved to be applicable in the practice of complicated engineering and this integrated model also can be utilized to optimize the design of offshore structures in the future acknowledgements professor

23083,in offshore areas quaternary loose seabed soils widely distribute around the world and a great number of offshore structures actually have been constructed on quaternary seabed floors in practical engineering it is highly necessary to evaluate the stability of offshore structures built on quaternary seabed floors under the impact of extreme ocean waves based on the varans equation and the dynamic biot s equation an integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d has been developed by ye et al 2013b to investigate the interaction between ocean waves marine structures and their seabed foundations in this study taking the composite breakwater project in the west harbour zone of yantai port in china as an engineering case the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d is used to evaluate the stability of the composite breakwater under the impact of fortified ocean waves with a 50 years recurrence period computational results indicate that the composite breakwater at west harbour zone of yantai port would be generally stable during its service life this application demonstrates that the integrated model fssi cas 2d is applicable and suitable for practical engineering the case study illustrated in this study can provide ocean engineers with an excellent case demonstration of engineering application to evaluate the stability of offshore structures under the impact of extreme ocean waves keywords composite breakwater stability analysis fssi cas 2d liquefaction west harbour zone yantai port 1 introduction in last 20 years a great number of marine structures such as breakwaters have been constructed in offshore areas the stability of offshore marine structures under ocean wave loading is the main concern of ocean engineers involved in design in offshore environment newly deposited quaternary seabed soil is widely distributed for example the loose silty soil in the zone of the estuary of yellow river in china actually a great number of offshore structures have been built on quaternary sediments the particle arrangement of quaternary seabed soil generally is relatively loose far from being very dense under cyclic ocean wave loading seabed soil particles re arrange their relative positions to a more dense status accompanied by a pore water drainage process in this process the pore water pressure builds up making soil liquefy or soften as a result the overlaying marine structures would lose their stability therefore it is of great importance to quantitatively evaluate the stability of offshore marine structures constructed on quaternary loose seabed floors the preconditions for evaluating the stability of offshore marine structures include two aspects 1 understanding the mechanism of wave structure seabed interaction 2 development of numerical models for stability evaluation in early stage analytical solutions were widely proposed to study the mechanism of wave seabed interaction in which marine structures could not be considered due to the limitation of analytical methods seabed soil must be very dense in which elastic deformation is dominant under wave loading in analytical solutions the dense seabed could be infinite yamamoto et al 1978 madsen 1978 or finite hsu and jeng 1994 jeng and hsu 1996 in depth it also could be isotropic or anisotropic the waves adopted in these analytical solutions were all based on stokes wave theory involving progressive wave standing wave or short crested wave hsu and jeng 1994 the governing equation for seabed soil could be the consolidation equation the u p approximation and the u w equation liao et al 2015 actually the uncoupled method was adopted in these analytical solutions there was no feedback from seabed soil to ocean wave when seabed responding to ocean wave besides numerical methods are also powerful tool to investigate the wave seabed interaction however most previous numerical investigations were also limited to very dense elastic seabed soil such as those in ye and jeng 2012 gatmiri 1990 jeng and lin 1996 zhou et al 2005 and luan and wang 2001 for the interaction between ocean waves and loose seabed floors few investigations were undertaken until recently yang and ye 2017 and yang and ye 2018 systematically study the dynamics characteristics of loose seabed floor under the impact of standing wave and wave current for the scientific problem of wave structure seabed interaction it seems that numerical methods are the only feasible ways due to the complexity of the interaction between ocean wave marine structures and their seabed foundations mase et al 1994 developed a fem numerical model to investigate the wave induced pore water pressures and effective stresses in a sandy seabed foundation beneath a composite caisson type breakwater based on biot s consolidation equation after that mizutani et al 1998 and mizutani et al 1999 developed a bem fem combination numerical model to study the wave seabed structure interaction by adopting a prototype model their work greatly promoted the progress on wave structure seabed interaction however the numerical models proposed by mase et al 1994 and mizutani et al 1998 could not yet be applied in practice engineering due to the following two reasons first the potential flow theory involving laplace s equation used in mizutani et al 1998 could not simulate the complicated motion of seawater in extreme ocean waves such as breaking and turbulence in real life large scale cases second only a poro elastic soil model could be used in their numerical models as presented above a great number of offshore structures have been built on quaternary loose seabed floor the wave induced behaviour of loose seabed foundation must be characterized using poro elasto plastic soil models to overcome the above two difficulties ye et al 2013b developed an integrated model fssi cas 2d for the problem of fluid structures seabed interaction fssi in the integrated model fssi cas 2d the volume average renolds average navier stokes varans equation was adopted to simulate the complicated motion of seawater in ocean waves as well as porous flow in porous seabeds the dynamic biot s equation was adopted to describe the nonlinear behaviour of marine structures and their seabed foundations a one way integrating algorithm based on the radial point interpolation method was developed to link the two equations by guaranteeing the continuity of pressure and velocity at interfaces between the seawater domain and the seabed foundation marine structures the integrated model fssi cas 2d has been widely validated by an analytical solution and a series of wave flume tests ye et al 2013b most importantly several poro elasto plastic soil models such as mohr coulomb modified cambridge clay pastor zienkiewics mark iii etc are available to describe the behaviour of loose seabed foundation in fssi cas 2d so far this integrated numerical model has been successfully applied to investigate the dynamics of composite breakwater and its seabed foundation involving breaking wave ye et al 2014 tsunami wave ye et al 2013a and loose seabed soil ye et al 2015 it is indicated by these successful cases that the integrated model fssi cas 2d can be applied in practice engineering to evaluate the stability of offshore marine structures in this study taking the composite breakwater project at the west harbour zone of yantai port in china as the engineering case the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d was adopted to evaluate the stability of the composite breakwater under the impact of fortified ocean waves with a 50 years recurrence period computational results indicate that the composite breakwater at west harbour zone of yantai port would be generally stable in its service life this case application demonstrates that the integrated model fssi cas 2d is applicable in the practical engineering and this integrated model also can be utilized to optimize the design of offshore

detailed information about the coupled model can be found in ye et al 2013b ye 2012 and zienkiewicz et al 1999 in this study large deformation occurs in the seabed foundation near to breakwater built on loose liquefiable seabed under seismic wave shaking the updated lagrangian method is adopted to deal with this large deformation problem in the computation the coordinates of nodes status variables of soil which are dependent on the effective stress history such as void ratio e and permeability k are updated in each time step based on deformation correspondingly the coefficient matrices m k q g

under monotonic and cyclic loading zienkiewicz et al 1999 2 3 verification the validity and reliability of the developed integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d have been widely verified by ye 2012 adopting the analytical solution proposed by hsu and jeng 1994 and a series of laboratory wave flume tests conducted by lu 2005 for regular wave and cnoidal wave tsai and lee 1995 for standing wave mizutani et al 1998 for submerged breakwater and mostafa et al 1999 for composite breakwater the developed semi coupled numerical model fssi cas 2d was used to reproduce the dynamic response of elastic seabed foundation and or breakwater the good agreement between the predicted numerical results and the corresponding experimental data indicated that fssi cas 2d is a highly reliable for the problem of wave seabed structure interaction furthermore the validity and reliability of fssi cas 2d for the problem of wave loose seabed soil interaction was also verified by a wave flume test teh et al 2003 and a geotechnical centrifuge test sassa and sekiguchi 1999 more detailed information about the verification work can be found in ye 2012 and related work has been published in ye et al 2013b additionally the integrated model fssi cas 2d incorporating pziii soil model has been successfully applied to investigate the dynamics and stability of an idealized composite breakwater built on a loose seabed foundation ye et al 2015 3 engineering background yantai port is located on the southwest coastal line of bohai bay china it is geographically affiliated to the city of yantai shandong province china as illustrated in fig 1 currently yantai port includes four harbour zones they are chifu bay zone west harbour zone longkou harbour zone and penglai harbour zone respectively among them the west harbour zone is the largest one and is a core asset for development of the yantai port total length of the wharfs in the west harbour zone is 19 km the maximum water depth in front of the wharfs is 28 m the west harbour zone is divided into 8 functional zones such as container chemical liquid bulk cargo general bulk crude oil and lng etc totally 65 berths with capacity 50 000 to 300 000 tons will be constructed the planned ultimate bearing capacities of the west harbour zone will be up to 200 million tonnes and 15 million standard containers per year in order to guarantee the safety of vessels when docking in front of the wharfs for loading and unloading a group of deep water breakwaters have been constructed to surround a harbour basin with area about 5 km2 as illustrated in fig 2 in the west harbour zone the whole breakwater construction project is divided into two phases the structure form of phase i is the sloping rubble mound breakwater covered by accropodes and it is the composite breakwater in phase ii as shown in fig 3 currently the construction of breakwaters in phase i and phase ii have all been finished undoubtedly the stability of these breakwaters under extreme ocean waves is the key factor for the long term service ability of west harbour zone of yantai port it is of great significance to evaluate the stability of the breakwaters at the west harbour zone of yantai port in this study taking the composite breakwaters in phase ii of the west harbour zone as the representative the newly developed model fssi cas 2d is adopted to evaluate the stability of the composite breakwaters under fortified ocean wave to implement this application the profiles and basic physical properties of the seabed soil layers which is as the foundation of the breakwaters at the west harbour zone were collected from the company in charge of the in situ geotechnical survey for the phase ii project as demonstrated in fig 4 there are mainly five soil layers in the seabed foundation of the breakwaters they are muddy silt clay ①1 silty clay ①2 clay ③1 silty clay ③2 and silt ③4 respectively their basic physical properties of the five seabed soil layers obtained by performing a series of geotechnical tests are listed in table 1 it can be seen that the muddy silt clay ①1 and ①2 are the weak soil layers with thickness of 12 m 14 m their water content is up to 39 6 and 32 3 void ratio is around 1 0 and the bearing capacity f is only 70 90 kpa respectively in engineering practice the surface layer of a thickness of 2 m of the first soil layer ①1 exactly beneath the composite breakwater was replaced with coarse sand to enhance the bearing capacity of the seabed foundation furthermore a great number of plastic drainage strips with a length of 12 m were inserted into the soil layers ①1 and ①2 with a spacing of 1 0 m to improve their seepage permeability this engineering measure can effectively to accelerate the process of consolidation of the seabed foundation as well as the subsiding of overlying composite breakwaters in table 1 it is also can be found that the seabed soil layers ③1 ③2 ③3 all have excellent bearing performance with bearing capacities are in the range of 180 kpa 200 kpa fortified parameters of ocean wave for the breakwaters in the west harbour zone of yantai port also are necessary in design practice for the evaluation of stability of these breakwaters a third party consulting company was employed by the owner of yantai port to specially observe the ocean wave parameters in the area near to the west harbour zone in long term based on the long term observation data of ocean waves the owner of yantai port set out the fortified parameters of ocean wave for the breakwaters in the west harbour zone as listed in table 2 in which h 1 is the average height of the highest 1 wave height h 5 is the average height of the highest 5 wave height and h 13 is the average height of the highest 13 wave height in this study in order to examine the stability of the composite breakwater in the west harbour zone under the most extreme sea state the ocean wave parameters related to the 50 years recurrence period are chosen they are 6 5 m in wave height 9 6s in wave period and 3 56 m in water level elevation due to the fact that the average elevation of the seabed foundation surface is 18 m the water depth in this study is 21 5 m 4 computational domain boundary condition and soil parameters according to the design diagram of the composite breakwater in the west harbour zone of yantai port shown in fig 3 and the profiles of seabed soil layers in fig 4 the computational domain used in this study to evaluate the stability of the composite breakwater of phase ii project in the west harbour zone of yantai port is illustrated in fig 5 the total length of the computational domain is 750 m x 350 m to x 1100 m the width of the rubble mound is 100 m its distance to the left and right boundary of the seabed foundation is 400 m and 250 m respectively due to the fact the maximum depth of surveying boreholes in the seabed floor on which this composite breakwater is built is only 35 5 m the thickness of the seabed foundation in the computation is set as 35 5 m correspondingly in this study the seabed surface is set as z 0 m and the left side of the seabed foundation is set as x 350 m the wave maker is located at x 0 m in the fluid domain the distance from the wave maker to the composite breakwater is 750 m about 6 times of the wave length in stability analysis the following boundary conditions are applied 1 the lateral sides of seabed foundation are fixed in horizontal 14 u s l e f t s i d e u s r i g h t s i d e 0 2 the bottom of seabed foundation is fixed in both horizontal and vertical and treated as a impermeable board 15 u s w s 0 a n d p s z 0 a t z 35 5 m 3 on the surface of the seabed floor and the outer surfaces of the composite breakwater the total pressure including hydrostatic and wave induced hydrodynamic pressure is applied 4 since the caisson is made of concrete it can be treated as an impermeable object as a result an upward buoyancy acting on the bottom of the caisson induced by hydrostatic and wave induced hydrodynamic pressure must be applied it is an indisputable fact in the field of geomechanics that the reliability of the computational results is highly dependent on the accuracy of soil rock s physical parameters in this study the constitutive soil model pziii is used to describe the mechanical behaviour of the seabed soil foundation therefore it is necessary to determine the model parameters needed by pziii model for the five soil layers of the seabed foundation however only conventional geotechnical testing work in the field survey stage was conducted according to the code for investigation of geotechnical engineering of ports jts 133 1 2010 and the code of design and construction of breakwaters jts 154 1 2011 in china at the design stage it was not planned that the integrated model fssi cas 2d would be applied to examine the stability of the composite breakwater in the west harbour zone of yantai port as a result geotechnical testing work such as dynamic triaxial test to determine the model parameters of the five layers seabed foundation soil for pziii soil model was not performed the only way is to estimate these model parameters of the seabed foundation soil based on their basic properties as listed in table 1 in the future a series of geotechnical tests are highly recommended to be conducted to determine the model parameters of seabed foundation soil if fssi cas 2d is adopted to examine the stability of offshore structures in the pziii soil model there are totally 13 soil parameters among them p 0 is a reference pressure at which the soil parameters measured in the tests as listed in table 1 the deformation modulus of soil e s was measured in the stress range of 100 200 kpa based on this p 0 is estimated as 150 kpa in this study k e v o and g e s o is the bulk modulus and shear modulus of soil at reference pressure p 0 respectively estimated according to the following theoretic formulations 16 e 1 ν 1 2 ν 1 ν e s 17 k e v o e 3 1 2 ν a n d g e s o e 2 1 ν where ν is poisson s ratio of soil according to previous experience ν 0 38 for soil layers ①1 and ①2 ν 0 3 for soil layers ③1 ③2 and ③3 m f is the slope of critical state line csl of soils one can be estimated as 18 m f 6 sin ϕ 3 sin ϕ in which ϕ is the friction angle of soil m g is a soil parameter related to plastic potential surface similar to m f generally m g is less than m f in this study m g m f is set as 0 9 referring to the soil parameters of nevada sands given by zienkiewicz et al 1999 h 0 is a parameter describing the modulus of soil at the first loading stage elastic deformation is dominant referring the elastic modulus e at p 0 h 0 can be estimated as h 0 e p 0 according to the definition of loading modulus h l in equation 12 h u 0 is the unloading modulus of soil at the first unloading stage if there is no plastic deformation generated at the first unloading stage then h u 0 should be equal to the elastic modulus of soil e in theory if plastic deformation is generated h u 0 should be e 1 r a t i o p l a s t i c in which r a t i o p l a s t i c is the percentage of plastic deformation in the total deformation due to the fact that the soil layers ①1 and ①2 are relatively soft and weak plastic deformation in cyclic loading and unloading processes must be significant the r a t i o p l a s t i c is set as 40 for soil layers ①1 and ①2 meanwhile the bearing capacity of soil layers ③1 ③2 and ③3 reaches up to around 200 kpa as illustrated in table 1 the plastic deformation in cyclic loading and unloading process should be apparently less than that of ①1 and ①2 the r a t i o p l a s t i c is set as 15 for soil layers ③1 ③2 and ③3 in this study the other six parameters α f α g β 0 β 1 γ u and γ d m are material coefficients related to soil properties these material coefficients can be reliably calibrated by geotechnical testing data such as dynamic triaxial test due to the fact that the test data is not available in the current situation the values suggested by zienkiewicz et al 1999 are used in this study all the estimated soil parameters of the five seabed soil layers for pziii soil model are listed in table 3 the composite breakwater in the west harbour zone of yantai port consists of concrete caisson and its underlying rubble mound in stability analysis the caisson is treated as an impermeable rigid object and the rubble mound is treated as a kind of porous medium with great porosity the poro elastic model is adopted for the caisson and rubble mound with parameters listed in table 4 in this study the saturation of the five soil layers of the seabed foundation soil are all set as 98 as presented above a series of plastic drainage strips have been inserted into the soil layers ①1 and ①2 in the zone beneath the composite breakwater to enhance their permeability to consider this effect the permeability coefficients of soil layers ①1 and ①2 in the zone beneath the composite breakwater are set to 100 times their original value as illustrated in table 1 in the computation 5 initial condition in offshore environments the seabed soil usually experiences consolidation under its own weight additionally seabed foundation beneath breakwaters will be loaded by the weight of breakwater after construction resulting in the generation of excess pore pressure in seabed foundation at the early stage excess pore pressure will be dissipated over time meanwhile breakwater subsides downward until a new balanced consolidation state is reached this consolidation process of seabed foundation under a composite breakwater has been studied in shen et al 2017 in the stability analysis of the composite breakwater in the west harbour zone this balanced consolidation state is taken as the initial condition in fig 6 the distribution of the displacement effective stresses and pore pressure in the seabed foundation after consolidation is demonstrated it can be seen that the composite breakwater subsides about 20 cm under its own self weight after consolidation due to the gravity compression of the breakwater the effective stress σ z in the zone under the composite breakwater increases dramatically relative to the zone far away from the breakwater in the seabed floor away from the composite breakwater the distribution of effective stress σ x and σ z is layered indicating that the effect of offshore structures on effective stress is only limited in the zone around offshore structure itself it also found that there are two concentration zones of shear stress in the seabed foundation beneath the composite breakwater due to the gravity compression of breakwater the maximum magnitude of the shear stress could reach up to about 50 kpa the distribution of pore pressure in the seabed foundation is layered hydrostatic pressure even in the zone beneath the breakwater it indicates that the excess pore pressure in the seabed foundation has completely dissipated due to the impermeability of caisson the pore pressure in the caisson is all zero 6 stability analysis 6 1 hydrodynamics ocean waves are the main driving factor for the failure of offshore structures in practice before examining the stability of the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone of yantai port under the fortified ocean wave it is necessary to firstly investigate the characteristics of the fortified ocean wave when it interacts with the composite breakwater and the seabed foundation so as to determine the wave induced force acting on the composite breakwater the wave profile distribution of pore pressure dynamic pore pressure velocity and turbulent energy k of fortified wave at 30t and 60t are shown in fig 7 compared the hydrodynamic characteristics at t 30t with those at t 60t it is found that the wave profile and the distribution of velocity are both harmonic at t 30t howevr the fortified wave is sightly breaking at t 60t the distribution of velocity is correspondingly disordered it also can be observed from the distribution of turbulent energy k that the turbulence at t 30t is minor the maximum k is only o 1j at this moment located at the area far away from the composite breakwater in front of the breakwater the turbulent energy k is nearly zero however the situation at t 60t is significantly different the turbulence becomes considerable at t 60t the maximum k reaches up to 1 5j which is one order greater than that at t 30t the turbulence of the fortified wave mainly occurs in the areas near to the free surface and in front of the breakwater overall it seems that the fortified ocean wave tends to become unstable and breaks with time when interacting with the composite breakwater when the fortified ocean wave is simulated the seabed foundation and rubble mound is treated as porous medium and the caisson is treated as impermeable rigid object as a result there is distribution of water pore pressure in the seabed foundation and rubble mound however there is no pore pressure in the caisson as shown in fig 7 the distribution of pore pressure in the seabed foundation and rubble mound is wavy directly influenced by the ocean waves wave induced dynamic pressure is the driving force causing the seabed foundation response for example the pore pressure in the seabed could build up leading to the softening of seabed soil as shown in fig 7 the distribution of the wave induced dynamic pressure is periodic under the wave crest the dynamic pressure is positive meanwhile it is negative value under the wave trough the maximum magnitude of the dynamic pressure acting on the caisson induced by the fortified wave can reach up to about 30 kpa in the engineering practice wave induced force on offshore structures is an important parameter for the stability design of structures fortunately fssi cas 2d can quantitatively predict this wave induced force applied on offshore structures as illustrated in fig 8 it is demonstrated in fig 8 that the amplitude of the dynamics force acting on the caisson induced by the fortified ocean wave is about 800 kn per meter of breakwater ocean engineers must make sure that the composite breakwater in the west harbour zone can resist the risk of overturning under this dynamic force another important factor that needs to be considered is the seawater of overtopping fig 9 illustrates the time history of the accumulated volume of seawater unit l m overtopping the composite breakwater it is found that the accumulated volume of seawater overtopping per meter breakwater is about 350 l in the period of 90s time 155s 245s the average rate of seawater overtopping is as little as 3 9 l s m it is indicated that the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone of yantai port has adequate abilities to resist the seawater overtopping induced by the fortified ocean wave 6 2 dynamics of structure seabed foundation system the dynamics of structure and seabed foundation forms the base for evaluation of the stability of offshore structures in this section the dynamics of the composite breakwater and its foundation at the west harbour zone of yantai port is analyzed under the impact of the fortified ocean wave in the design stage ocean engineers generally would like to know whether their design structures subside or not and how much would the structure subside under a fortified ocean wave for the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone of yantai port the computational result illustrated in fig 10 can answer the above two questions the time history of the displacement of the left top corner of the breakwater clearly indicates that the composite breakwater would subside dramatically reaching 120 cm after 60t impacted by the fortified ocean wave at the meantime the horizontal displacement of composite breakwater reaches 180 cm to the left side the dramatical horizontal displacement and subsidence indicate that the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone is gradually tilting to the left side in the impact process of the fortified ocean wave this tilting process of the composite breakwater is demonstrated in fig 11 it can be seen that the composite breakwater is basically stable even through it has subsided 120 cm and tilts to the left side 180 cm under the impact of fortified ocean wave an interesting phenomenon observed in fig 11 is the deformation of the seabed foundation and rubble mound due to the fact that the seabed foundation soil at the west harbour zone of yantai port is relatively loose and has a weak bearing capacity pore pressure in the seabed foundation will build up under cyclic wave loading resulting in the softening or liquefaction in the seabed foundation exactly because of this reason the overlaying composite breakwater subsides and tilts to one side forcing the seabed foundation to deform as shown in fig 11 the seabed soil near to the left part of the rubble mound moves up simultaneously to the left due to the compression of the settled composite breakwater because of the requirement for deformation coordination between the rubble mound and the seabed soil around it uplift also occurs in the leftmost part of the rubble mound the magnitude of deformation in the composite breakwater and its seabed foundation is illustrated in fig 12 it is clearly seen that the deformation in the foundation zone around the left part of the rubble mound is most significant the maximum magnitude of the uplift displacement of the seabed soil in this zone is up to 100 cm except for the deformation variation of pore pressure and effective stresses in the seabed foundation are also important characteristics of the dynamics to illustrate this two typical positions in the seabed foundation are chosen as representative they are position a x 650 m z 2 5 m far away from the composite breakwater and position c x 800 m z 2 5 m under the left part of rubble mound as shown in fig 5 the time histories of pore pressure and effective stresses at the two typical positions a and c are shown in fig 13 and fig 14 in fig 13 it can be seen that pore pressure at position a builds up under the impact of the fortified wave correspondingly the effective stress σ x and σ x reduce from their initial values 15 kpa and 22 kpa resulting in the softening of the seabed foundation to the time t 350s σ z becomes about 1 kpa which means that the current stress between soil particles at position a is less than 5 of its initial value more than 95 of contact stress between soil particles has vanished at this moment the seabed soil at position a can be treated as liquefied soil correspondingly the shear stress at position a basically becomes nearly zero at this moment because the liquefied soil behaves like a heavy fluid losing the ability to resist shear stress as illustrated in fig 13 the variation of the effective stresses induced by the fortified ocean wave is complicated it is shown that the magnitude of the effective stresses σ x and σ z as well as the amplitude of shear stress τ x z at position a increase gradually with the impact of the fortified ocean wave after the seabed soil has become liquefied this phenomenon can not be explained from a linear perspective and precisely reflects the nonlinear characteristics for the interaction between the wave and the seabed foundation in fig 14 it can be seen that the characteristic of the dynamic response to the fortified ocean wave at position c under the composite breakwater is significantly different with that at position a it can be clearly observed that the residual pore pressure at position c dramatically builds up from 225 kpa to 395 kpa before t 310s and then it quickly reduces into a range of 350 360 kpa this reduction process of the pore pressure can undoubtedly be attributed to the mechanism of pore pressure dissipation actually the build up and dissipation of pore pressure in seabed soil both simultaneously exist excess pore pressure occurs in seabed soil exactly due to the fact that the rate of build up of pore pressure is greater than the rate of dissipation it is also can be seen in fig 14 that the effective stresses σ x σ z and τ x z all increase before t 210s however they all are reduced after t 210s finally σ x σ z and τ x z all approach to zero from the time t 400s indicating that the seabed soil at position c becomes liquefied at t 400s in fig 14 there is an interesting phenomenon to which we need to pay attention as stated above the effective stresses at position c all increase before t 210s however the corresponding pore pressure also increases in this period furthermore the pore pressure at position c reduces in the period of t 310s 400s while its effective stresses also reduce in this period it seems that the classic theory for the effective stress principle in soil mechanics is not established in this case according to the effective stress principle the effective stresses should reduce in the process of pore pressure build up actually there is a precondition for the above statement that the total stress must be constant in this study the effect of the composite breakwater is significant from the analysis of the displacement of the composite breakwater it is known that the composite breakwater subsides downward and tilts to left side under the impact of the fortified ocean wave in the process of subsiding and tilting the composite breakwater will apply an additional force on the soil at position c due to the offset of the gravity of the breakwater as a result the total stress at position c is not constant before t 210s the total stress at position c increases after that it reduces the complicated variation of the total stress at position c directly leads to the above stated interesting phenomenon demonstrated in fig 14 actually the classic theory for the effective stress principle in soil mechanics is still applicable in this study from the above analysis it is known that the interaction between ocean wave offshore structures and seabed foundation is highly nonlinear numerical models are the only ways to handle these kinds of complicated engineering problems the above analysis is only based on the computational results at two typical positions in the seabed foundation of the composite breakwater it is necessary to further study the distribution of wave induced effective stresses and pore pressure in the seabed foundation fig 15 demonstrates these distributions at t 60t it is found that the effect of the fortified ocean wave is mainly concentrated in the seabed at the open sea side the distribution of σ x σ z in the seabed foundation are wavy obviously significantly affected by the applied wave in the seabed foundation the area with red colour where σ x σ z approach to zero is huge indicating that soil liquefaction has occurred in a large area in the seabed foundation especially in the area under the composite breakwater another phenomenon observed in the distribution of pore pressure is that there are a series of core shape areas in which the pore pressure is higher than that in the surrounding zone it indicates that the build up of pore pressure is not uniform in seabed foundation under ocean wave loading it also can be seen in the distribution of σ z that there is a narrow banded area in which effective stress is huge in the seabed foundation beneath the composite breakwater this high effective stress banded area behaves like a pile supporting the overlying composite breakwater otherwise the composite breakwater will sink into the liquefied foundation and finally be submerged 6 3 liquefaction estimation it has been widely verified that loose seabed soil can liquefy under ocean wave loading by laboratory tests sassa and sekiguchi 1999 and field records sassa et al 2006 there are generally two types of liquefaction mechanisms for seabed soil one is momentary liquefaction only occurring in very dense sand under wave troughs its effect on the transient stability of offshore structures is minor however momentary liquefaction could boost the scouring of seabed soil around offshore structures another is residual liquefaction due to the pore pressure building up in loose soil the liquefaction occurring in the loose seabed foundation at the west harbour zone of yantai port in this study is exactly residual liquefaction generally residual liquefaction in seabed foundations has fatal effects on the stability of offshore structures in this section the liquefaction is quantitatively estimated for the seabed foundation of composite breakwater at the west harbour zone under fortified ocean wave impacting following yang and ye 2017 a parameter being referred to as residual liquefaction potential l p o t e n t i a l is defined to quantitatively estimate the liquefaction zone in seabed foundation 19 l p o t e n t i a l σ z d σ z 0 α c where σ z d σ z σ z 0 is wave induced dynamic vertical effective stress σ z 0 is initial vertical effective stress σ z is current vertical effective stress c is cohesion of seabed soil α is a material coefficient in equation 19 the cohesion of seabed soil is considered from the point of view that cohesive soil is much more difficult to become liquefied under cyclic loading it indicates that soil cohesion could effectively boost the liquefaction resistance of soil l r σ z 0 α c liu and jeng 2016 therefore cohesion c of soil must be considered when defining liquefaction potential due to the fact that macroscopic cohesion c of soil is not absolutely equivalent to microscopic liquefaction resistance of soil particles a material coefficient must be added to the cohesion c of soil in equation 19 currently investigations on the effect of cohesion of soil on its liquefaction resistance are limited in this study the value of the material coefficient α is set as 0 1 in theory when l p o t e n t i a l is greater than or equal to 1 0 the seabed soil becomes liquefied according to this definition l p o t e n t i a l is estimated in the seabed foundation of the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone of yantai port based on the computational results of the effective stresses the distribution of l p o t e n t i a l in the seabed foundation at times t 10t t 20t t 40t and t 60t are illustrated in fig 16 the zone with red colour where l p o t e n t i a l 1 0 is the predicted liquefaction zone it can be seen that 1 liquefaction first occurs in the zone near to the surface of the seabed foundation 2 the liquefaction zone in the seabed foundation gradually enlarges with the impact of the fortified ocean wave 3 the frontier of the liquefaction zone is wavy and progressively downward up to the time t 60t most of the seabed foundation soil beneath the composite breakwater becomes liquefied however there is still a non liquefaction banded area beneath the composite breakwater as stated above this non liquefaction zone with high effective stress behaves like a pile supporting the overlying composite breakwater even though most parts of the seabed foundation at west harbour zone of yantai port become liquefied at t 60t under the impact of the fortified ocean wave the computation results given by the integrated model fssi cas 2d clearly indicate that the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone only subsides 120 cm and moves 180 cm to the left the composite breakwater can still steadily stand on the seabed foundation indicating that the stability of composite breakwater at the west harbour zone can be guaranteed under the impact of the extreme fortified ocean wave due to the fact that there are terms only related to the effective stress in equation 19 this criteria is actually a stress based liquefaction criteria except for stress based criteria there is another liquefaction criteria based on excess pore pressure defined as 20 l p p e x c e s s σ z 0 where p e x c e s s is the excess pore pressure this criteria is a pore pressure based liquefaction criteria if there is only the seabed floor without a marine structure then the stress based liquefaction criteria equation 19 is essentially similar to the pore pressure based liquefaction criteria equation 20 because the total stress is kept constant if there is no effect of marine structure the value of excess pore pressure should be equal to the wave induced dynamic effective stress according to effective stress principle however the difference between the stress based criteria and the pore pressure based criteria is considerable if there are marine structures on the seabed foundation because the total stress is no longer a constant in such cases according to the definition of soil liquefaction that the effective stress vanishes between soil particles the stress based criteria is a direct criteria to estimate the occurrence of soil liquefaction regardless of whether there are marine structures or not in the practice of computation seabed soil can be treated as liquefied soil so long as the current effective stress between soil particles approach to zero correspondingly the pore pressure based criteria is an indirect criteria due to the fact the development of excess pore pressure is complicated in nonlinear cases where marine structures are involved it is relatively difficult to link the magnitude of excess pore pressure to soil liquefaction in other words there is no absolute connection between excess pore pressure and soil liquefaction in the cases involving marine structures seabed soil can not become liquefied even the excess pore pressure has exceeded the initial effective stress therefore the pore pressure based liquefaction criteria is not reliable in cases marine structures are involved this unreliability of the pore pressure based liquefaction criteria is illustrated taking the seabed foundation at the west harbour zone of yantai port as a example fig 17 illustrates the time history of σ z p e x c e s s and l p p e x c e s s σ z 0 at position c in the seabed foundation of the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone it can be seen that the effective stress σ z becomes zero from time t 400s indicating that the seabed soil at position c is liquefied after t 400s because the effective stress between soil particles has completely vanished however the excess pore pressure at position c is only about 100 kpa and l p p e x c e s s σ z 0 based on the pore pressure based criteria is only around 0 3 after t 400s therefore the seabed soil at position c is estimated to be non liquefied after t 400s according to the pore pressure based criteria this result is of course contradictory to the real situation where the seabed soil has become liquefied the distribution of l p p e x c e s s σ z 0 based on the pore pressure based criteria in the seabed foundation at t 30t and 60t are further shown in fig 18 compared with the predicted liquefaction zone adopting the stress based criteria shown in fig 16 it is found that the predicted liquefaction zone adopting pore pressure based criteria is disordered and significantly different to that shown in fig 16 it indicates that the pore pressure based criteria to estimate liquefaction zone is unreliable in cases where marine structures are involved it is highly recommended to adopt the stress based criteria to judge the occurrence of seabed soil liquefaction in the engineering practice 7 conclusions in this study dynamic response characteristics of the composite breakwater and its seabed foundation at the west harbour zone of yantai port under the impact of an extreme fortified ocean wave are comprehensively investigated using the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d as the computation tool based on the computational results the stability of the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone of yantai port is further evaluated this study provides ocean engineers with a demonstration case for the application of integrated model fssi cas 2d in practice finally the following outcomes are obtained from this application case 1 the rate of seawater per meter overtopping over the composite breakwater is as little as 3 9 l s m it indicates that the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone of yantai port has adequate abilities to resist seawater overtopping induced by the fortified ocean wave 2 the amplitude of the wave induced horizontal impact force acting on the caisson lateral side is 800 kn per meter of breakwater 3 liquefaction can occur in most parts of the seabed foundation on the open sea side under the long term impact of the fortified ocean wave this factor would be fatal for the stability of the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone of yantai port however the computation results also confirm that the composite breakwater subsides 1 2 m and moves 1 8 m to the left side at t 60t for such a large scale composite breakwater this is only slight tilting unacceptable subsidence and tilting do not occur for the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone of yantai port under the impact of the extreme fortified ocean wave summarily the stability of the composite breakwater at the west harbour zone of yantai port could be guaranteed for a long term service period 4 the case study demonstrates that the integrated model fssi cas 2d is proved to be applicable in the practice of complicated engineering and this integrated model also can be utilized to optimize the design of offshore structures in the future acknowledgements professor

23084,sst shear stress transport k ω and newmark β methods are used to comprehensively understand vortex induced vibration viv characteristics of a cylindrical structure with a mass ratio of 2 6 in a range of reduced velocity from 2 0 to 14 0 the details of drag and lift forces cross flow and streamwise displacements vortex pattern trajectory and frequency of viv are presented and compared systematically with the experimental work of jauvtis and williamson that first captured the super upper branch in viv with the maximum value of 1 5 d diameter in this study the numerical simulation results successfully captured the initial branch the lower branch and the super upper branch very few research studies have successfully simulated the super upper branch by numerical methods the vibration amplitude corresponding to the super upper branch is stable and the maximum value of the super upper branch is 1 46 d which is fairly consistent with the results of the jauvtis and williamson experiment this research also successfully captured the law of trajectory under different reduced velocities with the reduced velocity increasing the trajectories switch from an irregular shape to a regular figure 8 shape and then enter into an irregular movement finally again into a regular movement of a figure 8 shape or crescent in the range of the super upper branch the vibration trajectories gradually change from a figure 8 shape to a crescent shape with the increase of the transverse vibration amplitude this work has successfully captured the different vortex patterns corresponding to each branch under different reduced velocities and found the transitional forms of 2s to 2t 2t to 2p and 2p to 2s respectively keywords vortex induced vibration super upper branch low mass ratio fluid structure interaction numerical simulation 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv is a widespread natural phenomenon especially in the field of ocean engineering where the viv of a riser is a common phenomenon much research on the viv of marine risers has been conducted with bearman 2012 williamson 1996 williamson 2004 2008 sarpkaya 2004 gabbai and benaroya 2005 wu et al 2012 summarizing the research results of a cylindrical structure or a riser viv in recent decades early research was mainly focused on the study of a cylindrical structure viv especially the study of one degree of freedom 1 dof viv which considers only transverse vibration feng 1968 khalak and williamson 1996 1999 govarhan and williamson 2000 brika and laneville 1993 1997 and anagnostopoulos 1994 published representative results for 1 dof viv of a cylindrical structure however the vortex shedding produced not only lift that caused transverse vibration of a cylindrical structure but also pulsating resistance that caused streamwise vibration of a cylindrical structure the streamwise vibrations affected the transverse amplitude which became a matter of concern for research as the research progressed moe and wu 1990 for the first time experimented with two degrees of freedom 2 dof viv of a cylindrical structure compared with the 1 dof system that restricts the streamwise movement of a cylindrical structure the 2 dof system stimulated a larger transverse amplitude but the increment was smaller subsequently sarpkaya 1995 studied the viv of a cylindrical structure with different natural frequency ratios f x f y and found that when f x f y 1 0 the maximum transverse amplitude of the 2 dof system was 19 higher than that of the 1 dof system with the maximum transverse amplitude reaching 1 1 d diameter jauvtis and williamson 2003 2004 studied the viv characteristics of a cylindrical structure at low mass and damping with 1 dof and 2 dof and found that when the mass ratio m was equal to 7 0 the maximum amplitude of the 2 dof system was similar to that of the 1 dof system that restricted the streamwise movement of a cylindrical structure when the mass ratio m dropped to 2 6 the 2 dof system developed a super upper branch of transverse response amplitude the largest response amplitude reaching 1 5 d a result that all previous experiments had failed to obtain and the 2t vortex mode corresponding to the maximum transverse amplitude was observed blevins and coughran 2009 adopted a physical experiment method to comprehensively study the viv of a cylindrical structure with 1 dof and 2 dof with variable mass ratios and found that the measured maximum amplitude was 1 75 d for a smooth 2 dof cylinder at a reynolds number re of 139000 much research based on experimental study has been performed to study viv numerically most scholars have used two dimensional 2d numerical simulation to study the viv of a cylindrical structure with low mass damping brika and laneville 1993 newman and karniadakis 1997 zhou et al 1999 blackburn et al 2001 for re 100 200 numerical simulations brika and laneville 1993 newman and karniadakis 1997 zhou et al 1999 blackburn et al 2001 including our previous research han et al 2015 2016 2017 gave similar amplitude results a d 0 6 that were lower than the expected values subsequently some scholars simulated the viv of a cylindrical structure with re 1000 with the amplitude of transverse vibration reaching a value of a d 0 7 all these numerical simulations were carried out at low reynolds numbers well below the reynolds numbers used in the classic experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 for this reason numerical simulation seemed to capture only the initial and lower branches whereas the upper and super upper branches were absent recently some scholars began to use numerical simulation methods to study the viv of a cylindrical structure at reynolds numbers matched with the classic experimental values guilmineau and queutey 2004 used a rans numerical scheme to simulate the viv of a cylindrical structure for 1 dof and compared their results with the experimental data reported by khalak and williamson 1996 the numerical scheme acquired the vortex shedding pattern of the initial branch the lower branch and the maximum vibration amplitude corresponded to the experimental data but the super upper branch data were not consistent with the experimental results wanderley et al 2008 used an upwind tvd 2d numerical scheme to solve the rans equations and used the k ɛ turbulence model to simulate the viv of a cylindrical structure for 1 dof with the mass ratio being equal to 1 8 the numerical simulation results were compared with the benchmarking experimental results when the mass ratio was equal to 2 4 khalak and williamson 1996 the numerical results were in a good agreement with the experimental data and captured the corresponding response branch and vortex patterns pan et al 2007 adopted rans codes and the sst k ω turbulence model to simulate the viv of a cylindrical structure for 1 dof and the result was compared with the experimental data reported by khalak and williamson 1996 that numerical simulation also failed to capture the super upper branch and the authors explained the possible reasons srinil et al 2013 studied a flexibly mounted circular cylinder for 2 dof with variable nature frequency ratios f x f y using experimental and numerical methods and reported that when f x f y 1 0 and mass ratio m 3 5 the transverse amplitude of the numerical simulation was much smaller than that of the experimental value the super upper branch predicted by gsell et al 2016 using a direct numerical simulation method was lower than that obtained by jauvtis and williamson 2004 it was necessary to show that re 3900 in the numerical simulation whereas re was in the 1000 15000 range in experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 by using the 2d rans code and the sst k omega method zhao and cheng 2010 2011 obtained the super upper branch and 2t vortex shedding pattern with initial conditions of velocity increasing constantly which was in a good agreement with the experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 however the numerical results did not detail the time history of the drag and lift forces cross flow and streamwise displacements vortex pattern trajectory frequency of viv compared with the reported experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 li et al 2014 adopted two typical turbulent models to simulate the viv of a cylindrical structure for 1 dof and the predicted maximum amplitude was lower than that obtained by khalak and williamson 1996 kang et al 2017 applied a modified sst model based on openfoam to simulate experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 and it captured the maximum amplitude reaching values of 1 4 d when the entrance velocity was made to increase constantly in the process of numerical simulation although the results obtained by kang et al 2017 were consistent in trend with experimental results representing considerable progress the result still left room for improvement i e 1 the reduced velocity corresponding to the maximum amplitude was lower than that of experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 2 the amplitude of time histories of transverse displacement y d was not stable in the simulation especially in the later stages of numerical simulation when the transverse vibration amplitude fell into the lower branch which was not consistent with the reported experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 overall within the scope of the low reynolds numbers numerical simulation of the viv of a cylindrical structure has been performed systematically and successfully but at higher reynolds numbers the numerical simulation of that viv still encounters some problems for example in the simulation of the super upper branch the stability of the vibration amplitude corresponding to the super upper branch the details of the drag and lift forces the cross flow and streamwise displacements vortex pattern trajectory and frequency of viv under varied reduced velocities compared with previous studies this study grabs the missing details of previous studies which are essential to successfully simulate the super upper branch of viv the initialization of numerical simulation started from a cylinder with a specified reduced velocity case i e the inflow velocity is kept constant the dynamic viscosity μ 0 000784 n s m 2 and the density of the fluid ρ 995 3 k g m 3 jauvtis and williamson 2004 at the freestream boundary the turbulence intensity was 0 9 govardhan and williamson 2006 the turbulence length scale was 0 04 d wanderley and soares 2015 in addition in this study the rans code the sst k ω and the newmark β methods are adopted to simulate the viv of a cylindrical structure and the numerical results are compared systematically with the experiment data reported by jauvtis and williamson 2004 the details of drag and lift forces cross flow and streamwise displacements vortex pattern trajectory and frequency of viv are presented the simulation results obtained for the super upper branch initial branch and lower branch are more accurate than those from previous reports the vibration amplitude corresponding to the super upper branch is stable and more consistent with the experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 2 numerical method 2 1 fluid governing equations the flow field of the viv of a cylindrical structure can be considered as an unsteady incompressible two dimensional turbulent flow field therefore the fluid governing equation used in this study is the unsteady and incompressible rans equation written as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j 2 ν s i j u i u j where x i is the cartesian coordinates in the x i direction x 1 x x 2 y represent the streamwise direction and the transverse direction respectively u i is the fluid velocity component of the x i direction ρ p ν and t are fluid density pressure molecular kinetic viscosity and time respectively s ij is the mean strain rate tensor that is computed by equation 3 u i u j is the reynolds stress tensor defined by equation 4 3 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i 4 u i u j ν t u i x j u j x i 2 3 k δ i j where ν t is the turbulent viscosity and k is the turbulent energy in the present work the sst k ω turbulence model menter 2012 is used for modeling the reynolds stress tensor the rans equation is discretized using the finite volume method the simpec method is used for pressure velocity coupled equations the pressure staggering option presto scheme and quadratic upwind interpolation for convection kinetics quick are used to discretize pressure and momentum respectively a second order upwind scheme is used for the turbulent kinetic energy and a first order upwind for specific dissipation a second order implicit method is used for the time domain 2 2 structural dynamic model the dynamic equations of vibration of a cylindrical structure are as follows 5 m 2 x t 2 c x t k x f x t 6 m 2 y t 2 c y t k y f y t where x is the displacement in the streamwise direction y is the displacement in the transverse direction m c and k are the mass damping and stiffness respectively the relationship between damping c and damping ratio ξ is c 2 ξ k m m a in which ma is added mass all these parameters are consistent with the experiment reported by jauvits and williamson 2004 f x t and f y t are the drag force in the streamwise direction and the lift force in the transverse direction respectively equations 5 and 6 are solved by using the newmark β method 2 3 dynamic grid update method the movement of the boundary of a cylindrical structure is realized through the dynamic grid method han et al 2016 the mesh motion is governed by the diffusion equation 7 γ u 0 where u is the velocity of the grid movement the laplace equation in equation 7 describes how the prescribed boundary motion diffuses into the interior of the deforming mesh the diffusion coefficient γ 1 d θ in equation 7 can be used to control how the boundary motion affects the interior mesh motion in which d is a normalized boundary distance θ 0 2 0 2 4 the fluid structure coupling method the flow chart of the fluid structure coupling method is shown in fig 1 as shown the method includes calculation of the flow field around a cylindrical structure and calculation of the vibration model of a cylindrical structure in an iterative process at every time step first equations 1 and 2 are solved by adopting the rans code and the sst k ω method packaged in the commercial computational fluid dynamics software fluent to obtain the variable information of the flow field including the force of a cylindrical structure second based on the fluent secondary development platform user defined function udf code is specially written to obtain the drag force in the streamwise direction and the lift force in the transverse direction of a cylindrical structure and substitute the results into equations 5 and 6 third the displacement of a cylindrical structure is obtained using the udf code of the newmark method to solve equations 5 and 6 and finally using the dynamic grid update method the fluid grid is updated based on the displacement of a cylindrical structure the interactive process is repeated iteratively as shown in fig 2 beginning at a time step t n the initial conditions can be used to calculate the variable information of the flow field at a time step t n δ t and to substitute the flow force into the structural dynamic model and then to calculate the displacement of a cylindrical structure at a time step t n δ t finally the displacement of the cylindrical structure is transferred to fluid calculation at time step t n 2 δ t and so on so that the interactions between fluid and the cylinder can be calculated correctly 3 computation domain and mesh 3 1 computational domain the setting of the calculation domain has a crucial influence on the numerical simulation of the flow field and a reasonable setting of the computational domain is helpful for the accuracy and speed of the calculation a schematic diagram of a cylindrical structure viv calculation model is shown in fig 3 the center of the cylinder is at the origin of the coordinate system the distance between the inlet and the center of the cylinder is 20 d and d is the cylinder diameter the distance from the left or right side to the center of the cylindrical structure is also 20 d and the distance between the outlet and the center of the cylindrical structure is 40 d the upper and lower boundaries are symmetrical u y 0 v 0 the outlet boundary is the pressure outflow u x 0 v x 0 the hydrostatic pressure is set to be 0 all the computations are initialized with a static body and this initialization condition is critical to capture the super upper branch in the numerical simulation at the freestream boundary the turbulence intensity was 0 9 govardhan and williamson 2006 the turbulence length scale was 0 04 d wanderley and soares 2015 k and m are the stiffness and the mass of the cylinder respectively for the convenience of direct comparison with the experiment of jauvtis and williamson 2004 the simulation parameters here are the same as the parameters used in the experiment i e d 0 0381 m m m m d 2 6 where m d 1 4 ρ π d 2 mass damping factor m c a ζ 0 013 where c a 1 0 is the added mass coefficient the natural frequency in water f n 0 4 3 2 grid partitioning the purpose of grid partitioning is usually to provide a set of computable mesh for the flow field the further requirement of the grid is satisfied with the requirements of accuracy and speed of calculation for viv problems grid partitioning needs certain characteristics in particular there are strict requirements for the mesh near a cylindrical structure and at the wake of a cylindrical structure we used the boundary layer mesh to calculate the flow field near a cylindrical structure especially the flow field in contact with a cylindrical structure so that the force of the cylindrical structure could be accurately calculated the accuracy of this force was essential for calculating vivs the mesh of the entire flow field is a structured mesh the grid near a cylindrical structure is dense the further away from a cylindrical structure the sparser the grid becomes as shown in fig 4 a we adopted this grid partitioning strategy on one hand because the flow field near a cylindrical structure was more marked so that a relatively dense mesh was needed to better simulate the flow field and on the other hand the flow field of the area away from a cylindrical structure was relatively stable such that a sparse grid could simulate the flow field well for the sake of the accuracy and speed of calculation fig 4 b shows the grid distribution of a cylindrical structure the first layer of the grid must meet the condition of y y μ ρ τ w 1 as shown in fig 4 b where y is the distance from the first layer of the grid to the wall τ w is the shear stress on the wall μ is the dynamic viscosity and ρ is the density of the fluid according to the reynolds number at specific normalized velocity given in figure 11 and 19 of the literature jauvtis and williamson 2004 the dynamic viscosity is μ 0 000784 n s m 2 and the density of the fluid is ρ 995 3 k g m 3 the cylindrical structure was divided into 160 grids at the circumference in accordance with the above grid partitioning strategy the entire flow field grid consisted of 226800 quadrilateral elements 4 results and discussion 4 1 characteristics of the vibration response under different reduced velocities in order to simulate the viv of a cylindrical structure when the numerical result is compared systematically with the experiment data reported by jauvtis and williamson 2004 the reduced velocity u ranging from 2 0 to 14 0 at intervals of 0 5 is used fig 5 shows the response amplitudes of the streamwise and transverse directions under different reduced velocities ax and ay are response amplitudes in the streamwise and transverse directions respectively d is the cylinder diameter fig 5 shows the latest numerical simulation results in the current literature gsell et al 2016 kang et al 2017 for simulating the super upper branch compared with the experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 the numerical simulation results obtained from this study successfully capture the symmetric streamwise ss branch antisymmetric streamwise as branch initial branch super upper branch and lower branch in the transverse direction the maximum dimensionless amplitude corresponding to the super upper branch is 1 46 slightly less than jauvtis and williamson 2004 s experimental value of 1 5 the corresponding reduced velocity range of each branch is consistent with the experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 in the streamwise direction the reduced velocity range corresponding to each branch and the trends of each branch are in an agreement with the experimental results the largest amplitude also fits well with the experimental results but in the range of reduced velocities u 5 5 8 3 in addition to u 7 5 the results of numerical calculation are less than the experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 and the numerical simulation results gsell et al 2016 both the present results and the numerical simulation results reported by gsell et al 2016 do not capture the transition between the ss branch and as branch in this study fig 6 shows the ratio of transverse vibration frequency to natural frequency under different reduced velocities with the latest numerical simulation results gsell et al 2016 kang et al 2017 and the experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 there are three distinct branches in fig 6 the first branch from left to right corresponds with the frequency characteristics of the ss branches and as branches the second branch from left to right corresponds with the frequency characteristics of the initial branches and super upper branches and the third branch from left to right corresponds with the frequency characteristics of the lower branch the viv of a cylinder may be a single frequency vibration or a multi frequency vibration but in fig 6 only the point of the domain frequency is drawn when the cylinder is in the first branch the vortex vibration frequency of the cylindrical structure is 0 5 0 6 times the natural frequency when the cylinder just enters the second branch the viv frequency of the cylindrical structure is consistent with the frequency of st which can be seen from fig 6 as the cylindrical viv frequency almost overlaps a straight line corresponding to the st frequency when the cylinder is in the first branch the vortex vibration frequency of the cylindrical structure is 0 5 0 6 times the natural frequency when the reduction velocity u 5 0 8 3 the ratio of the vortex vibration frequency to the natural frequency is near 1 0 at that time the viv of the cylindrical structure enters into lock in and its transverse vibration amplitude corresponds with the super upper branch when the vortex vibration of the cylinder is in the lower branch its vibration frequency corresponds with the third branch as shown in fig 6 and the ratio of the vortex vibration frequency to the natural frequency is about 1 3 in general the numerical simulation results are highly consistent with the experimental results and better than those of other published work gsell et al 2016 kang et al 2017 and the frequency characteristics of different stages are effectively captured in this study 4 2 time histories of the force and response under different reduced velocity fig 7 shows the time histories of lift coefficient cl drag coefficient cd transverse displacements y d and streamwise displacements x d under different reduced velocities when the reduced velocity is less than 3 0 the transverse amplitude is relatively small and the amplitude of the streamwise direction is larger about 0 125 d according to fig 6 this frequency of transverse vibration is about 0 5 times the natural frequency and the vibration frequency in the streamwise direction is about twice the transverse vibration that is close to the natural frequency of the cylindrical structure that is why the amplitude in the streamwise direction is larger than that in the transverse direction at this stage when u 2 0 2 5 the lift and drag are more chaotic and the cylinder is affected by multi frequency forces when u 3 0 3 5 the force and responses of the cylinder are relatively stable and regular when the cylinder enters into the stage of reduced velocity u 4 0 4 5 the cylinder clearly shows multi frequency vibration characteristics a feature that is called beat after reduction of the velocity u 5 0 the cylinder is again subjected to stable and regular vibration after that the transverse amplitude also suddenly increases indicating that the cylinder vibration enters into a lock in state i e into the super upper branch as the reduced velocity u increases when it reaches 8 5 the lift and drag coefficients transverse vibration amplitude and streamwise vibration amplitude all suddenly decrease indicating that the cylinder vibration has entered into the lower branch at this point the cylinder vibration displays a very interesting phenomenon in that the phase difference between lift and transverse vibration is 180 before that the phase difference between lift and transverse vibration is near to 0 in general with the increase in the reduced velocity viv of the cylinder changes from a multi frequency vibration to a single frequency vibration then to a multi frequency vibration and finally again to a single frequency vibration 4 3 characteristics of the trajectory fig 8 shows the trajectory of an elastic cylinder under different reduced velocities when the reduced velocity is relatively small that is u 2 0 2 5 the trajectory of the vortex vibration of the cylinder is quite chaotic and it is difficult to distinguish any obvious trajectory shape the main reason for this phenomenon is that the transverse vibration amplitude is smaller and the frequency of the vibration is locked into the natural frequency of the cylinder therefore the frequency of transverse vibration is affected by the streamwise vibration and the trajectory is more chaotic with the increase in the reduced velocity that is u 3 0 3 5 the trajectory of the vortex vibration of the cylinder becomes more regular showing an obvious fig 8 shape then when u 4 0 4 5 the trajectory of the vortex vibration of the cylinder enters into a chaotic state again that is because the transverse vibration of the cylinder is in the beat stage the vortex shedding frequency is in competition with the natural frequency of the cylinder the vibration of the cylinder is in a multi frequency state so the trajectory is more chaotic thereafter after u 5 0 the trajectory of the viv of the cylinder show an obvious fig 8 shape or a crescent shape in general the simulation results of the trajectory of the viv of the cylinder here are consistent with the experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 and the trajectory characteristics of each stage are captured successfully 4 4 characteristics of the vortex in the wake fig 9 shows the vorticity contours under different reduced velocities when the reduced velocity varies from 2 0 to 2 5 the cylindrical structure is in the resonance stage the vibration amplitude in the streamwise direction is bigger and the transverse vibration amplitude is smaller so the vortex pattern in the wake is a symmetric pair of vortex modes consistent with the experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 when the reduced velocity u 3 0 4 5 the vortex pattern in the wake is a 2s mode which is also consistent with the experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 with the increase in the reduced velocity the amplitude of transverse vibration increases continuously when the transverse vibration amplitude reaches the super upper branch the vortex pattern in the wake is a 2t mode the same pattern of vortex shedding was reported in the experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 subsequently after u 8 5 the transverse vibration amplitude decreases continuously the transverse vibration amplitude also enters the lower branch and the vortex pattern in the wake is a 2s mode consistent with the experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 5 conclusion this study constructs a program for the viv of a cylindrical structure and adopts the sst k ω and newmark β methods to simulate cylindrical vortex induced vibrations with a low mass ratio compared with the numerical simulation results of previous studies pan et al 2007 srinil et al 2013 gsell et al 2016 zhao and cheng 2010 2011 li et al 2014 kang et al 2017 our results successfully capture the initial branch the lower branch and the super upper branch with more accurate results the corresponding reduced velocity range of each branch is consistent with the classical experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 the maximum value of the super upper branch is 1 46 d the vibration amplitude corresponding with the super upper branch is stable and more consistent with the experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 under different reduced velocities the transverse vibration frequency of the cylinder is divided into three distinct branches that correspond with the initial branch super upper branch and lower branch of transverse displacement this research also systematically analyzes and summarizes the characteristic of the lift coefficient cl drag coefficient cd transverse displacements y d and streamwise displacements x d of a cylindrical structure under different reduced speeds with the increase in reduced velocity the cylindrical structure first displays multi frequency vibration then switches to a single frequency vibration next switches to multi frequency vibration and finally reverts to the single frequency with the increase in reduced velocity the trajectory switches from an irregular shape to a regular fig 8 shape then enters into an irregular movement and finally reverts to a regular fig 8 movement or a crescent shape the vortex pattern at different reduced velocities is simulated successfully the viv of the streamwise direction is in a resonance state at a low reduced velocity and the vortex pattern in the wake is a symmetric pair in vortex modes with the increase in reduced velocity the transverse amplitude increases continuously the cylindrical structure response enters the super upper branch and the vortex pattern switches from 2s to 2t when the reduced velocity increases further the cylindrical structure s response enters the lower branch and the vortex pattern becomes 2p with further increase in the reduced velocity the transverse amplitude decreases continuously and the vortex pattern becomes 2s acknowledgements this study was supported by a middle aged and young

23084,sst shear stress transport k ω and newmark β methods are used to comprehensively understand vortex induced vibration viv characteristics of a cylindrical structure with a mass ratio of 2 6 in a range of reduced velocity from 2 0 to 14 0 the details of drag and lift forces cross flow and streamwise displacements vortex pattern trajectory and frequency of viv are presented and compared systematically with the experimental work of jauvtis and williamson that first captured the super upper branch in viv with the maximum value of 1 5 d diameter in this study the numerical simulation results successfully captured the initial branch the lower branch and the super upper branch very few research studies have successfully simulated the super upper branch by numerical methods the vibration amplitude corresponding to the super upper branch is stable and the maximum value of the super upper branch is 1 46 d which is fairly consistent with the results of the jauvtis and williamson experiment this research also successfully captured the law of trajectory under different reduced velocities with the reduced velocity increasing the trajectories switch from an irregular shape to a regular figure 8 shape and then enter into an irregular movement finally again into a regular movement of a figure 8 shape or crescent in the range of the super upper branch the vibration trajectories gradually change from a figure 8 shape to a crescent shape with the increase of the transverse vibration amplitude this work has successfully captured the different vortex patterns corresponding to each branch under different reduced velocities and found the transitional forms of 2s to 2t 2t to 2p and 2p to 2s respectively keywords vortex induced vibration super upper branch low mass ratio fluid structure interaction numerical simulation 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv is a widespread natural phenomenon especially in the field of ocean engineering where the viv of a riser is a common phenomenon much research on the viv of marine risers has been conducted with bearman 2012 williamson 1996 williamson 2004 2008 sarpkaya 2004 gabbai and benaroya 2005 wu et al 2012 summarizing the research results of a cylindrical structure or a riser viv in recent decades early research was mainly focused on the study of a cylindrical structure viv especially the study of one degree of freedom 1 dof viv which considers only transverse vibration feng 1968 khalak and williamson 1996 1999 govarhan and williamson 2000 brika and laneville 1993 1997 and anagnostopoulos 1994 published representative results for 1 dof viv of a cylindrical structure however the vortex shedding produced not only lift that caused transverse vibration of a cylindrical structure but also pulsating resistance that caused streamwise vibration of a cylindrical structure the streamwise vibrations affected the transverse amplitude which became a matter of concern for research as the research progressed moe and wu 1990 for the first time experimented with two degrees of freedom 2 dof viv of a cylindrical structure compared with the 1 dof system that restricts the streamwise movement of a cylindrical structure the 2 dof system stimulated a larger transverse amplitude but the increment was smaller subsequently sarpkaya 1995 studied the viv of a cylindrical structure with different natural frequency ratios f x f y and found that when f x f y 1 0 the maximum transverse amplitude of the 2 dof system was 19 higher than that of the 1 dof system with the maximum transverse amplitude reaching 1 1 d diameter jauvtis and williamson 2003 2004 studied the viv characteristics of a cylindrical structure at low mass and damping with 1 dof and 2 dof and found that when the mass ratio m was equal to 7 0 the maximum amplitude of the 2 dof system was similar to that of the 1 dof system that restricted the streamwise movement of a cylindrical structure when the mass ratio m dropped to 2 6 the 2 dof system developed a super upper branch of transverse response amplitude the largest response amplitude reaching 1 5 d a result that all previous experiments had failed to obtain and the 2t vortex mode corresponding to the maximum transverse amplitude was observed blevins and coughran 2009 adopted a physical experiment method to comprehensively study the viv of a cylindrical structure with 1 dof and 2 dof with variable mass ratios and found that the measured maximum amplitude was 1 75 d for a smooth 2 dof cylinder at a reynolds number re of 139000 much research based on experimental study has been performed to study viv numerically most scholars have used two dimensional 2d numerical simulation to study the viv of a cylindrical structure with low mass damping brika and laneville 1993 newman and karniadakis 1997 zhou et al 1999 blackburn et al 2001 for re 100 200 numerical simulations brika and laneville 1993 newman and karniadakis 1997 zhou et al 1999 blackburn et al 2001 including our previous research han et al 2015 2016 2017 gave similar amplitude results a d 0 6 that were lower than the expected values subsequently some scholars simulated the viv of a cylindrical structure with re 1000 with the amplitude of transverse vibration reaching a value of a d 0 7 all these numerical simulations were carried out at low reynolds numbers well below the reynolds numbers used in the classic experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 for this reason numerical simulation seemed to capture only the initial and lower branches whereas the upper and super upper branches were absent recently some scholars began to use numerical simulation methods to study the viv of a cylindrical structure at reynolds numbers matched with the classic experimental values guilmineau and queutey 2004 used a rans numerical scheme to simulate the viv of a cylindrical structure for 1 dof and compared their results with the experimental data reported by khalak and williamson 1996 the numerical scheme acquired the vortex shedding pattern of the initial branch the lower branch and the maximum vibration amplitude corresponded to the experimental data but the super upper branch data were not consistent with the experimental results wanderley et al 2008 used an upwind tvd 2d numerical scheme to solve the rans equations and used the k ɛ turbulence model to simulate the viv of a cylindrical structure for 1 dof with the mass ratio being equal to 1 8 the numerical simulation results were compared with the benchmarking experimental results when the mass ratio was equal to 2 4 khalak and williamson 1996 the numerical results were in a good agreement with the experimental data and captured the corresponding response branch and vortex patterns pan et al 2007 adopted rans codes and the sst k ω turbulence model to simulate the viv of a cylindrical structure for 1 dof and the result was compared with the experimental data reported by khalak and williamson 1996 that numerical simulation also failed to capture the super upper branch and the authors explained the possible reasons srinil et al 2013 studied a flexibly mounted circular cylinder for 2 dof with variable nature frequency ratios f x f y using experimental and numerical methods and reported that when f x f y 1 0 and mass ratio m 3 5 the transverse amplitude of the numerical simulation was much smaller than that of the experimental value the super upper branch predicted by gsell et al 2016 using a direct numerical simulation method was lower than that obtained by jauvtis and williamson 2004 it was necessary to show that re 3900 in the numerical simulation whereas re was in the 1000 15000 range in experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 by using the 2d rans code and the sst k omega method zhao and cheng 2010 2011 obtained the super upper branch and 2t vortex shedding pattern with initial conditions of velocity increasing constantly which was in a good agreement with the experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 however the numerical results did not detail the time history of the drag and lift forces cross flow and streamwise displacements vortex pattern trajectory frequency of viv compared with the reported experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 li et al 2014 adopted two typical turbulent models to simulate the viv of a cylindrical structure for 1 dof and the predicted maximum amplitude was lower than that obtained by khalak and williamson 1996 kang et al 2017 applied a modified sst model based on openfoam to simulate experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 and it captured the maximum amplitude reaching values of 1 4 d when the entrance velocity was made to increase constantly in the process of numerical simulation although the results obtained by kang et al 2017 were consistent in trend with experimental results representing considerable progress the result still left room for improvement i e 1 the reduced velocity corresponding to the maximum amplitude was lower than that of experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 2 the amplitude of time histories of transverse displacement y d was not stable in the simulation especially in the later stages of numerical simulation when the transverse vibration amplitude fell into the lower branch which was not consistent with the reported experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 overall within the scope of the low reynolds numbers numerical simulation of the viv of a cylindrical structure has been performed systematically and successfully but at higher reynolds numbers the numerical simulation of that viv still encounters some problems for example in the simulation of the super upper branch the stability of the vibration amplitude corresponding to the super upper branch the details of the drag and lift forces the cross flow and streamwise displacements vortex pattern trajectory and frequency of viv under varied reduced velocities compared with previous studies this study grabs the missing details of previous studies which are essential to successfully simulate the super upper branch of viv the initialization of numerical simulation started from a cylinder with a specified reduced velocity case i e the inflow velocity is kept constant the dynamic viscosity μ 0 000784 n s m 2 and the density of the fluid ρ 995 3 k g m 3 jauvtis and williamson 2004 at the freestream boundary the turbulence intensity was 0 9 govardhan and williamson 2006 the turbulence length scale was 0 04 d wanderley and soares 2015 in addition in this study the rans code the sst k ω and the newmark β methods are adopted to simulate the viv of a cylindrical structure and the numerical results are compared systematically with the experiment data reported by jauvtis and williamson 2004 the details of drag and lift forces cross flow and streamwise displacements vortex pattern trajectory and frequency of viv are presented the simulation results obtained for the super upper branch initial branch and lower branch are more accurate than those from previous reports the vibration amplitude corresponding to the super upper branch is stable and more consistent with the experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 2 numerical method 2 1 fluid governing equations the flow field of the viv of a cylindrical structure can be considered as an unsteady incompressible two dimensional turbulent flow field therefore the fluid governing equation used in this study is the unsteady and incompressible rans equation written as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j 2 ν s i j u i u j where x i is the cartesian coordinates in the x i direction x 1 x x 2 y represent the streamwise direction and the transverse direction respectively u i is the fluid velocity component of the x i direction ρ p ν and t are fluid density pressure molecular kinetic viscosity and time respectively s ij is the mean strain rate tensor that is computed by equation 3 u i u j is the reynolds stress tensor defined by equation 4 3 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i 4 u i u j ν t u i x j u j x i 2 3 k δ i j where ν t is the turbulent viscosity and k is the turbulent energy in the present work the sst k ω turbulence model menter 2012 is used for modeling the reynolds stress tensor the rans equation is discretized using the finite volume method the simpec method is used for pressure velocity coupled equations the pressure staggering option presto scheme and quadratic upwind interpolation for convection kinetics quick are used to discretize pressure and momentum respectively a second order upwind scheme is used for the turbulent kinetic energy and a first order upwind for specific dissipation a second order implicit method is used for the time domain 2 2 structural dynamic model the dynamic equations of vibration of a cylindrical structure are as follows 5 m 2 x t 2 c x t k x f x t 6 m 2 y t 2 c y t k y f y t where x is the displacement in the streamwise direction y is the displacement in the transverse direction m c and k are the mass damping and stiffness respectively the relationship between damping c and damping ratio ξ is c 2 ξ k m m a in which ma is added mass all these parameters are consistent with the experiment reported by jauvits and williamson 2004 f x t and f y t are the drag force in the streamwise direction and the lift force in the transverse direction respectively equations 5 and 6 are solved by using the newmark β method 2 3 dynamic grid update method the movement of the boundary of a cylindrical structure is realized through the dynamic grid method han et al 2016 the mesh motion is governed by the diffusion equation 7 γ u 0 where u is the velocity of the grid movement the laplace equation in equation 7 describes how the prescribed boundary motion diffuses into the interior of the deforming mesh the diffusion coefficient γ 1 d θ in equation 7 can be used to control how the boundary motion affects the interior mesh motion in which d is a normalized boundary distance θ 0 2 0 2 4 the fluid structure coupling method the flow chart of the fluid structure coupling method is shown in fig 1 as shown the method includes calculation of the flow field around a cylindrical structure and calculation of the vibration model of a cylindrical structure in an iterative process at every time step first equations 1 and 2 are solved by adopting the rans code and the sst k ω method packaged in the commercial computational fluid dynamics software fluent to obtain the variable information of the flow field including the force of a cylindrical structure second based on the fluent secondary development platform user defined function udf code is specially written to obtain the drag force in the streamwise direction and the lift force in the transverse direction of a cylindrical structure and substitute the results into equations 5 and 6 third the displacement of a cylindrical structure is obtained using the udf code of the newmark method to solve equations 5 and 6 and finally using the dynamic grid update method the fluid grid is updated based on the displacement of a cylindrical structure the interactive process is repeated iteratively as shown in fig 2 beginning at a time step t n the initial conditions can be used to calculate the variable information of the flow field at a time step t n δ t and to substitute the flow force into the structural dynamic model and then to calculate the displacement of a cylindrical structure at a time step t n δ t finally the displacement of the cylindrical structure is transferred to fluid calculation at time step t n 2 δ t and so on so that the interactions between fluid and the cylinder can be calculated correctly 3 computation domain and mesh 3 1 computational domain the setting of the calculation domain has a crucial influence on the numerical simulation of the flow field and a reasonable setting of the computational domain is helpful for the accuracy and speed of the calculation a schematic diagram of a cylindrical structure viv calculation model is shown in fig 3 the center of the cylinder is at the origin of the coordinate system the distance between the inlet and the center of the cylinder is 20 d and d is the cylinder diameter the distance from the left or right side to the center of the cylindrical structure is also 20 d and the distance between the outlet and the center of the cylindrical structure is 40 d the upper and lower boundaries are symmetrical u y 0 v 0 the outlet boundary is the pressure outflow u x 0 v x 0 the hydrostatic pressure is set to be 0 all the computations are initialized with a static body and this initialization condition is critical to capture the super upper branch in the numerical simulation at the freestream boundary the turbulence intensity was 0 9 govardhan and williamson 2006 the turbulence length scale was 0 04 d wanderley and soares 2015 k and m are the stiffness and the mass of the cylinder respectively for the convenience of direct comparison with the experiment of jauvtis and williamson 2004 the simulation parameters here are the same as the parameters used in the experiment i e d 0 0381 m m m m d 2 6 where m d 1 4 ρ π d 2 mass damping factor m c a ζ 0 013 where c a 1 0 is the added mass coefficient the natural frequency in water f n 0 4 3 2 grid partitioning the purpose of grid partitioning is usually to provide a set of computable mesh for the flow field the further requirement of the grid is satisfied with the requirements of accuracy and speed of calculation for viv problems grid partitioning needs certain characteristics in particular there are strict requirements for the mesh near a cylindrical structure and at the wake of a cylindrical structure we used the boundary layer mesh to calculate the flow field near a cylindrical structure especially the flow field in contact with a cylindrical structure so that the force of the cylindrical structure could be accurately calculated the accuracy of this force was essential for calculating vivs the mesh of the entire flow field is a structured mesh the grid near a cylindrical structure is dense the further away from a cylindrical structure the sparser the grid becomes as shown in fig 4 a we adopted this grid partitioning strategy on one hand because the flow field near a cylindrical structure was more marked so that a relatively dense mesh was needed to better simulate the flow field and on the other hand the flow field of the area away from a cylindrical structure was relatively stable such that a sparse grid could simulate the flow field well for the sake of the accuracy and speed of calculation fig 4 b shows the grid distribution of a cylindrical structure the first layer of the grid must meet the condition of y y μ ρ τ w 1 as shown in fig 4 b where y is the distance from the first layer of the grid to the wall τ w is the shear stress on the wall μ is the dynamic viscosity and ρ is the density of the fluid according to the reynolds number at specific normalized velocity given in figure 11 and 19 of the literature jauvtis and williamson 2004 the dynamic viscosity is μ 0 000784 n s m 2 and the density of the fluid is ρ 995 3 k g m 3 the cylindrical structure was divided into 160 grids at the circumference in accordance with the above grid partitioning strategy the entire flow field grid consisted of 226800 quadrilateral elements 4 results and discussion 4 1 characteristics of the vibration response under different reduced velocities in order to simulate the viv of a cylindrical structure when the numerical result is compared systematically with the experiment data reported by jauvtis and williamson 2004 the reduced velocity u ranging from 2 0 to 14 0 at intervals of 0 5 is used fig 5 shows the response amplitudes of the streamwise and transverse directions under different reduced velocities ax and ay are response amplitudes in the streamwise and transverse directions respectively d is the cylinder diameter fig 5 shows the latest numerical simulation results in the current literature gsell et al 2016 kang et al 2017 for simulating the super upper branch compared with the experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 the numerical simulation results obtained from this study successfully capture the symmetric streamwise ss branch antisymmetric streamwise as branch initial branch super upper branch and lower branch in the transverse direction the maximum dimensionless amplitude corresponding to the super upper branch is 1 46 slightly less than jauvtis and williamson 2004 s experimental value of 1 5 the corresponding reduced velocity range of each branch is consistent with the experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 in the streamwise direction the reduced velocity range corresponding to each branch and the trends of each branch are in an agreement with the experimental results the largest amplitude also fits well with the experimental results but in the range of reduced velocities u 5 5 8 3 in addition to u 7 5 the results of numerical calculation are less than the experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 and the numerical simulation results gsell et al 2016 both the present results and the numerical simulation results reported by gsell et al 2016 do not capture the transition between the ss branch and as branch in this study fig 6 shows the ratio of transverse vibration frequency to natural frequency under different reduced velocities with the latest numerical simulation results gsell et al 2016 kang et al 2017 and the experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 there are three distinct branches in fig 6 the first branch from left to right corresponds with the frequency characteristics of the ss branches and as branches the second branch from left to right corresponds with the frequency characteristics of the initial branches and super upper branches and the third branch from left to right corresponds with the frequency characteristics of the lower branch the viv of a cylinder may be a single frequency vibration or a multi frequency vibration but in fig 6 only the point of the domain frequency is drawn when the cylinder is in the first branch the vortex vibration frequency of the cylindrical structure is 0 5 0 6 times the natural frequency when the cylinder just enters the second branch the viv frequency of the cylindrical structure is consistent with the frequency of st which can be seen from fig 6 as the cylindrical viv frequency almost overlaps a straight line corresponding to the st frequency when the cylinder is in the first branch the vortex vibration frequency of the cylindrical structure is 0 5 0 6 times the natural frequency when the reduction velocity u 5 0 8 3 the ratio of the vortex vibration frequency to the natural frequency is near 1 0 at that time the viv of the cylindrical structure enters into lock in and its transverse vibration amplitude corresponds with the super upper branch when the vortex vibration of the cylinder is in the lower branch its vibration frequency corresponds with the third branch as shown in fig 6 and the ratio of the vortex vibration frequency to the natural frequency is about 1 3 in general the numerical simulation results are highly consistent with the experimental results and better than those of other published work gsell et al 2016 kang et al 2017 and the frequency characteristics of different stages are effectively captured in this study 4 2 time histories of the force and response under different reduced velocity fig 7 shows the time histories of lift coefficient cl drag coefficient cd transverse displacements y d and streamwise displacements x d under different reduced velocities when the reduced velocity is less than 3 0 the transverse amplitude is relatively small and the amplitude of the streamwise direction is larger about 0 125 d according to fig 6 this frequency of transverse vibration is about 0 5 times the natural frequency and the vibration frequency in the streamwise direction is about twice the transverse vibration that is close to the natural frequency of the cylindrical structure that is why the amplitude in the streamwise direction is larger than that in the transverse direction at this stage when u 2 0 2 5 the lift and drag are more chaotic and the cylinder is affected by multi frequency forces when u 3 0 3 5 the force and responses of the cylinder are relatively stable and regular when the cylinder enters into the stage of reduced velocity u 4 0 4 5 the cylinder clearly shows multi frequency vibration characteristics a feature that is called beat after reduction of the velocity u 5 0 the cylinder is again subjected to stable and regular vibration after that the transverse amplitude also suddenly increases indicating that the cylinder vibration enters into a lock in state i e into the super upper branch as the reduced velocity u increases when it reaches 8 5 the lift and drag coefficients transverse vibration amplitude and streamwise vibration amplitude all suddenly decrease indicating that the cylinder vibration has entered into the lower branch at this point the cylinder vibration displays a very interesting phenomenon in that the phase difference between lift and transverse vibration is 180 before that the phase difference between lift and transverse vibration is near to 0 in general with the increase in the reduced velocity viv of the cylinder changes from a multi frequency vibration to a single frequency vibration then to a multi frequency vibration and finally again to a single frequency vibration 4 3 characteristics of the trajectory fig 8 shows the trajectory of an elastic cylinder under different reduced velocities when the reduced velocity is relatively small that is u 2 0 2 5 the trajectory of the vortex vibration of the cylinder is quite chaotic and it is difficult to distinguish any obvious trajectory shape the main reason for this phenomenon is that the transverse vibration amplitude is smaller and the frequency of the vibration is locked into the natural frequency of the cylinder therefore the frequency of transverse vibration is affected by the streamwise vibration and the trajectory is more chaotic with the increase in the reduced velocity that is u 3 0 3 5 the trajectory of the vortex vibration of the cylinder becomes more regular showing an obvious fig 8 shape then when u 4 0 4 5 the trajectory of the vortex vibration of the cylinder enters into a chaotic state again that is because the transverse vibration of the cylinder is in the beat stage the vortex shedding frequency is in competition with the natural frequency of the cylinder the vibration of the cylinder is in a multi frequency state so the trajectory is more chaotic thereafter after u 5 0 the trajectory of the viv of the cylinder show an obvious fig 8 shape or a crescent shape in general the simulation results of the trajectory of the viv of the cylinder here are consistent with the experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 and the trajectory characteristics of each stage are captured successfully 4 4 characteristics of the vortex in the wake fig 9 shows the vorticity contours under different reduced velocities when the reduced velocity varies from 2 0 to 2 5 the cylindrical structure is in the resonance stage the vibration amplitude in the streamwise direction is bigger and the transverse vibration amplitude is smaller so the vortex pattern in the wake is a symmetric pair of vortex modes consistent with the experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 when the reduced velocity u 3 0 4 5 the vortex pattern in the wake is a 2s mode which is also consistent with the experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 with the increase in the reduced velocity the amplitude of transverse vibration increases continuously when the transverse vibration amplitude reaches the super upper branch the vortex pattern in the wake is a 2t mode the same pattern of vortex shedding was reported in the experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 subsequently after u 8 5 the transverse vibration amplitude decreases continuously the transverse vibration amplitude also enters the lower branch and the vortex pattern in the wake is a 2s mode consistent with the experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 5 conclusion this study constructs a program for the viv of a cylindrical structure and adopts the sst k ω and newmark β methods to simulate cylindrical vortex induced vibrations with a low mass ratio compared with the numerical simulation results of previous studies pan et al 2007 srinil et al 2013 gsell et al 2016 zhao and cheng 2010 2011 li et al 2014 kang et al 2017 our results successfully capture the initial branch the lower branch and the super upper branch with more accurate results the corresponding reduced velocity range of each branch is consistent with the classical experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 the maximum value of the super upper branch is 1 46 d the vibration amplitude corresponding with the super upper branch is stable and more consistent with the experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 under different reduced velocities the transverse vibration frequency of the cylinder is divided into three distinct branches that correspond with the initial branch super upper branch and lower branch of transverse displacement this research also systematically analyzes and summarizes the characteristic of the lift coefficient cl drag coefficient cd transverse displacements y d and streamwise displacements x d of a cylindrical structure under different reduced speeds with the increase in reduced velocity the cylindrical structure first displays multi frequency vibration then switches to a single frequency vibration next switches to multi frequency vibration and finally reverts to the single frequency with the increase in reduced velocity the trajectory switches from an irregular shape to a regular fig 8 shape then enters into an irregular movement and finally reverts to a regular fig 8 movement or a crescent shape the vortex pattern at different reduced velocities is simulated successfully the viv of the streamwise direction is in a resonance state at a low reduced velocity and the vortex pattern in the wake is a symmetric pair in vortex modes with the increase in reduced velocity the transverse amplitude increases continuously the cylindrical structure response enters the super upper branch and the vortex pattern switches from 2s to 2t when the reduced velocity increases further the cylindrical structure s response enters the lower branch and the vortex pattern becomes 2p with further increase in the reduced velocity the transverse amplitude decreases continuously and the vortex pattern becomes 2s acknowledgements this study was supported by a middle aged and young
