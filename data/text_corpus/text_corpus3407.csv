17035,1 4 dioxane is one of the most persistent organic micropollutants in conventional drinking water treatment processes vacuum ultraviolet vuv treatment is a promising means of removing micropollutants such as 1 4 dioxane from source water but this approach has not yet been implemented in a full scale water treatment plant partly because the operating parameters for pilot and full scale vuv photoreactors have not been optimized here we developed a computational fluid dynamics based method for optimizing vuv photoreactor performance through energy based analyses that take into account the effects of two important operating parameters flow rate and radiant exitance first we constructed a computational fluid dynamics model and determined the sole parameter required for the model the pseudo first order rate constant for the reaction of 1 4 dioxane by simple batch experiment then we validated the model by using a pilot scale flow through annular photoreactor finally we used the validated model to examine the effects of flow rate and radiant exitance on the efficiency of 1 4 dioxane degradation in a virtual annular photoreactor radiation efficiency which was defined as the ratio of the logarithmic residual ratio of 1 4 dioxane to the theoretical minimum logarithmic residual ratio best possible performance under the given operating conditions was calculated as an energy based index of cost effectiveness radiation efficiency was found to increase with increasing flow rate but decreasing radiant exitance an electrical energy per order eeo analysis suggested that vuv treatment under laminar flow was most economical when low power lamps and a high flow rate were used in contrast vuv treatment under turbulent flow was suggested to be most economical when high power lamps were used at a high flow rate graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation process modeling radiation efficiency eeo 1 introduction 1 4 dioxane has received growing social and scientific attention due to its ubiquitous presence in the aquatic environment stepien et al 2014 1 4 dioxane has many uses in many commercial processes european communities 2004 mohr et al 2020 and it is found in a wide range of consumer products e g detergents shampoos and cosmetics as a by product of polyester synthesis zenker et al 2003 after being released into natural waters 1 4 dioxane which is little adsorbed by sediments log k ow 0 27 dietz and schnoor 2001 eventually contaminates groundwater through recharge with contaminated surface water stepien et al 2014 toxicological studies have revealed that 1 4 dioxane is a possible carcinogen suggesting that using contaminated surface waters and groundwaters as sources of drinking water may increase the risk of cancer in end users european communities 2004 usepa 2013 the world health organization suggests a guideline value of 50 μg l for 1 4 dioxane in drinking water who 2005 however conventional drinking water treatment processes i e coagulation sedimentation activated carbon adsorption and sand filtration are generally ineffective at removing 1 4 dioxane from source water mcguire et al 1978 ozonation and chlorination are also ineffective at degrading 1 4 dioxane adams et al 1994 indeed some drinking water treatment plants in the united states were forced to close when their source waters were found to be contaminated with 1 4 dioxane weimar 1980 thus an additional purification process is needed to improve conventional drinking water treatment processes advanced oxidation processes involving the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh radicals via reaction of o3 h2o2 suh and mohseni 2004 uv tio2 coleman et al 2007 hill et al 1997 or uv h2o2 matsushita et al 2015 are reported to degrade 1 4 dioxane in terms of the actual application however these methods are constrained by the high costs of chemical storage and removal of residual chemical additives at the end of the treatment process in contrast to these advanced oxidation processes vacuum ultraviolet vuv treatment does not use chemical additives and is therefore a promising economical approach for meeting increasingly stringent drinking water standards imoberdorf and mohseni 2012 xie et al 2018 indeed in a previous laboratory scale study we found that vuv treatment followed by activated carbon treatment was an economical means of removing 1 4 dioxane from water without inducing the formation of by products from coexisting natural organic matter matsushita et al 2015 however real world implementation of vuv treatment processes is stymied partly because of a lack of systematic optimization of operating parameters for pilot or large scale photoreactors bagheri and mohseni 2017 bagheri and mohseni 2014 2015 2017 have reported several computational fluid dynamics cfd models for analyzing the degradation of micropollutants in a vuv photoreactor however their models describe the effect of flow rate on micropollutant degradation under only a single flow regime i e either laminar or turbulent flow so knowledge of micropollutant degradation under different flow regimes remains limited moreover their models do not consider the effect of radiant exitance which is an important operating parameter in the vuv treatment process for effective photoreactor operation flow rate and radiant exitance must be optimized here we developed a cfd model that takes into consideration the effects of flow rate and radiant exitance on 1 4 dioxane degradation during vuv treatment in our model the chemical reaction kinetics of 1 4 dioxane were simplified to a pseudo first order reaction rate constant k m2 j which was determined by a simple batch degradation experiment the model was validated via experiments carried out using a pilot scale flow through annular photoreactor under different flow rates and different radiant exitances we then used the validated model to examine the effects of flow rate and radiant exitance on 1 4 dioxane degradation in a virtual annular photoreactor finally the effects of flow rate and radiant exitance on treatment performance were examined by electrical energy per order eeo analysis to our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the effect of radiant exitance on photoreactor performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 analytical modeling 2 1 1 gray box kinetic model during vuv treatment oh radicals form when water is irradiated by vuv photons imoberdorf and mohseni 2012 oppenlander 2007 almost all of these oh radicals are generated directly from the photolysis of water 1 h 2 o h v 185 nm oh h φ 1 0 33 2 h 2 o h v 185 nm oh h e φ 2 0 045 where φ1 and φ2 are the quantum yields the generated radicals react very quickly with coexisting species in the water such as oh radical scavengers and therefore the oh radical concentration reaches a steady state almost immediately de laat et al 1999 sharpless and linden 2003 the equilibrium concentration of the oh radicals c oh st can be calculated using 3 c oh st φ 1 φ 2 k i c i i n a e 185 α w ln 10 where ki is the rate constant for the reaction between oh radical consuming species i and oh radicals ci is the concentration of oh radical consuming species i i is the vuv fluence rate e 185 is the energy of a photon na is avogadro s constant and α w is the absorption coefficient of the pure water at 185 nm the degradation of 1 4 dioxane occurs by reaction with oh radicals and the other species such as cl related radicals have little effect on the degradation li et al 2017 matsushita et al 2015 patton et al 2017 therefore the degradation rate of 1 4 dioxane r d is expressed as 4 r d k oh c oh st c where k oh is the second order rate constant for the reaction between 1 4 dioxane and oh radicals and c is the concentration of 1 4 dioxane substituting the second term in eq 4 with eq 1 gives the following expression for the rate of 1 4 dioxane degradation 5 r d k oh φ 1 φ 2 k i c i i n a e 185 α w ln 10 c the factor kici describes the reactions of all of the oh radical consuming species in the water since the number of oh radical consuming species is very large the equations for the reactions of each species are not individually solved instead the reactions are treated as one overall reaction with a certain rate constant wols et al 2011 accordingly for each water the coefficient of ic is a constant determined by the background species present in the water water quality 6 r d k i c where k is the apparent reaction rate constant m2 j in the present study the value of k was determined for each water via a batch degradation experiment see section 2 3 2 2 1 2 cfd lagrangian particle tracking approach the lagrangian particle tracking approach has been shown to be appropriate for the prediction of micropollutant degradation by uv treatment wols and hofman caris 2012a in this approach the term particle refers to a small volume of water in which vuv photon induced reactions take place the motion of these particles comprises an advection displacement induced by the computed velocity field and a diffusion displacement induced by turbulent fluctuation both the velocity field and the diffusion are calculated by the viscous models provided by cfd software the vuv dose d j m2 experienced by a particle is calculated by integrating the fluence rate over the particle trajectory 7 d 0 t i r t d t where t is irradiation time and r t is the position vector along the trajectory for predicting 1 4 dioxane degradation within a particle eq 6 is solved using i r t of the particle trajectory from the inlet to the outlet of the reactor the concentration at the outlet of the reactor c calculated using the lagrangian approach can be simplified by using the initial concentration at the inlet c 0 and the vuv dose d at the outlet 8 c c 0 exp k d the concentration at the outlet c is calculated by using the mass flow weighted wi weight of particle i w i 1 average of the concentration in each fluid particle ci irradiated with the respective vuv dose di as follows 9 c w i c i w i c 0 exp k d i 2 1 3 radiation efficiency according to jensen s inequality text s1 c in eq 9 has a minimum value c min maximum degradation ratio at which all the particles receive the same vuv dose d mass flow weighted average vuv dose 10 c w i c 0 exp k d i c 0 exp k w i d i c 0 exp k d c min in practical terms d can be determined as a function of vuv power input p vuv flow rate q vuv absorption coefficient α and water layer thickness h text s2 11 d p vuv q α 1 10 α h p vuv q α from a practical point of view however it is impossible to achieve c min because the particles do not receive a uniform vuv dose the radiation efficiency η as a metric of energy based efficiency is therefore determined as follows wols et al 2015 12 η ln c c 0 ln c min c 0 ln c c 0 k d ln c c 0 k p vuv q α where ln c c 0 is the actual log degradation in the present study radiation efficiency was determined as the ratio of the actual observed degradation to the theoretical maximum achievable degradation which assuming no variation in vuv dose among the particles 2 2 cfd modeling ansys workbench 2019r was used to build and discretize a 1 6 m long pilot scale flow through vuv photoreactor with an annular configuration fig 1 two viscosity models in ansys fluent were used the laminar model was used for reynolds numbers re 2000 and the realizable k ε model coupled with standard wall function was used for re 2000 the radiation field for vuv photons was computed by solving the radiative transfer equation using a non gray discrete ordinate sub model the vuv inputs are summarized in table 1 using the lagrangian approach we released 4000 evenly distributed particles at the inlet a user defined function was used to record the vuv fluence rate along the pathline of each particle and to integrate it into the vuv dose the concentration of 1 4 dioxane in each particle at the outlet was calculated by using eq 8 and the concentration of 1 4 dioxane in the whole fluid was then calculated by using eq 9 the computational domain of the photoreactor was divided into 2 5 million cells constituting an unstructured mesh to guarantee proper resolution of the boundary layer a 2 mm layer with 10 layers of inflated prisms was placed close to the sleeve to investigate the effect of flow rate and radiant exitance on 1 4 dioxane degradation a simple virtual annular photoreactor which is a common photoreactor arrangement was constructed by using the same model set up procedure described above fig s1 the virtual photoreactor had the same cross section as the pilot scale flow through annular photoreactor although the length was set at 1 0 m and the whole of the photoreactor was assumed to be irradiated assuming fully developed laminar or turbulent flow inlet velocity distributions at different flow rates and a given re were set by using the appropriate profile in ansys fluent radiant exitance was defined as the direct irradiation on the external surface of the quartz sleeve the computational domain of the photoreactor was divided into 4 million cells constituting a structured hexahedral prism mesh 2 3 experimental set up and procedures 2 3 1 chemicals and water samples all chemicals were purchased commercially and used without further purification reagent solutions for the experiments were prepared with guaranteed reagent grade chemicals and milli q water 18 2 mω cm milli q advantage millipore co bedford ma usa two types of water were used for the experiments natural groundwater gw and synthetic water sw the gw was collected from the raw water input to a full scale drinking water treatment plant tachikawa japan and stored at 4 c until use no 1 4 dioxane was artificially added to the gw because it was already contaminated with 1 4 dioxane the sw was prepared by passing laboratory tap water through an activated carbon cartridge filter tcc wh t0cp toyo roshi kaisha japan to remove residual free chlorine and then adjusting the ph and alkalinity using sodium hydroxide and sodium bicarbonate respectively to match those of the gw the sw was spiked with 100 μg l of 1 4 dioxane prior to use the main properties of the gw and sw are presented in table s1 2 3 2 batch experiment for determining reaction rate constant to determine the pseudo first order rate constant for the reaction of 1 4 dioxane eq 6 in gw and sw a quasi collimated beam vuv apparatus equipped with a vacuum mercury lamp was used fig 2 the distance between the top of the water to the radiation source was 30 cm milli q water spiked with 100 μg l of 1 4 dioxane was used for comparison the ph of the milli q water was not controlled a 100 ml glass beaker with a diameter of 4 5 cm exposure area 15 9 cm2 was used as the reaction vessel a water sample 60 ml the path length of the quasi collimated beam is 3 8 cm was poured into the beaker and then covered with a wooden radiation shielding sheet until the experiment was started because 3 8 cm of the path length may be somewhat long compared with the depth of the layer in which the reactions between vuv photons and water molecules take place a magnetic stirrer was used to thoroughly mix the solution during the irradiation a 65 w low pressure mercury lamp emitting both 185 nm vuv and 254 nm uv photons was used as the radiation source niq60 35xl heraeus noblelight gmbh hanau germany to suppress the absorption of vuv photons by oxygen in the gas phase nitrogen gas was introduced into the reactor to obtain a volume fraction of oxygen of less than 2 before turning on the lamp to ensure a steady radiation output the lamp was turned on at least 20 min before each experiment a calibrated radiometer c9536 h9535 hamamatsu photonics k k hamamatsu japan was installed parallel to the surface of the irradiated water sample to determine the fluence rate during the experiments the vuv and uv fluence rates at the center of the vessel were 1 0 and 3 2 w m2 respectively the volume averaged vuv dose was calculated by the method described in text s3 to observe the change in 1 4 dioxane concentration individual experiments with an irradiation time of 3 6 9 or 12 min were conducted after the irradiation an aliquot of the solution was withdrawn and the 1 4 dioxane remaining in the solution was quantified the pseudo first order reaction rate constant in eq 6 was determined for the waters from the water absorption ratio α w α and the slope of the relationship of the natural logarithm of the residual ratio against the mean absorbed vuv dose assuming that the irradiation was uniform because of stirring bolton and stefan 2002 2 3 3 pilot scale experiment for model validation validation experiments were conducted using a pilot scale flow through vuv photoreactor made of stainless steel fig 1 the internal radius of the reactor and the external radius of the quartz sleeve were 23 9 and 11 5 mm respectively resulting in a radial gap of 12 4 mm which corresponded to a hydraulic diameter of 24 8 mm for the water flowing through the reactor to provide a large range of radiation exitance and investigate its effect in the pilot scale photoreactor two types of low pressure mercury lamps 65 and 240 w heraeus noblelight gmbh hanau germany and two types of quartz sleeves with different vuv radiation transmittance were used to mimic lower power lamps a 65 w lamp was coated with a synthetic fluororesin film reducing the vuv radiation exitance iwasaki electric co ltd tokyo japan the lamps provided a 1 4 m long cylindrical radiation zone within the 1 6 m photoreactor the stable vuv and uv photon emissions on the external surface of the quartz sleeve were measured for each lamp table 1 by the same radiometer use in 2 3 2 to validate the model with the respect to the effect of flow rate on 1 4 dioxane degradation flow through experiments were conducted with the photoreactor equipped with the 240 w lamp at room temperature using gw at flow rates ranging from 1 5 to 10 5 l min to validate the model with respect to the effect of radiant exitance on 1 4 dioxane degradation similar experiments were conducted with the photoreactor equipped with different lamps and different quartz sleeves table 1 at room temperature using sw at a flow rate of 6 9 l min samples were withdrawn from the sampling points at the inlet and the outlet and the concentrations of 1 4 dioxane in the samples were measured 2 3 4 quantification methods the concentration of 1 4 dioxane was measured by using a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer qp2010 plus shimadzu corporation kyoto japan equipped with a purge and trap sample concentrator aqua pt 5000 j plus gl science inc tokyo japan a capillary column hp 5ms length 30 m i d 250 μm thickness 0 25 μm agilent technologies palo alto ca usa was used for sample separation the temperatures of the ion source injector and transfer line were controlled at 200 180 and 180 c respectively gas chromatography mass spectrometry was performed in the selected ion monitoring mode with d 8 1 4 dioxane fujifilm wako pure chemical as the internal standard the fragment ions of 1 4 dioxane and d 8 1 4 dioxane were detected at m z 88 and 96 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of reaction rate constant by batch experiment in our model the pseudo first order reaction rate constant was used to simplify the reaction of oh radicals with background oh radical consuming species see section 2 1 1 the pseudo first order reaction rate constant of 1 4 dioxane in each water was determined by batch experiment in milli q water fig 3 1 4 dioxane rapidly degraded to a residual ratio of approximately 5 at a volume averaged vuv dose of 100 j m2 in contrast at the similar vuv dose 100 125 j m2 absorbed by water the residual ratios in sw and gw were 0 18 and 0 55 respectively values which are much higher than that in milli q water indicating that 1 4 dioxane degradation was suppressed in sw and gw compared with in milli q water this was attributed mainly to the absorption of 185 nm radiation by chloride furatian and mohseni 2018 and scavenging of oh radicals by bicarbonate imoberdorf and mohseni 2012 and nitrate matsushita et al 2019 although the natural organic matter has been reported to scavenge oh radicals during the vuv process wols and hofman caris 2012b in the present study the contribution of natural organic matter to the suppression of degradation was most likely negligible because the concentration of doc was low even in gw 0 09 mg l table s1 the slope of the natural logarithm of the residual ratio against the mean absorbed vuv dose for sw and gw were determined to be 1 4 10 2 and 5 2 10 3 m2 j respectively the reaction constants in sw and gw calculated by these values and the water absorption ratio were used in the cfd model simulation 3 2 model validation using a pilot scale flow through annular photoreactor two sets of experiments were carried out using the pilot scale flow through annular photoreactor one set using different flow rates 1 5 10 5 l min a radiant exitance of 105 w m2 and gw and one set using different radiant exitances 7 3 105 w m2 a flow rate of 6 96 l min and sw because laminar turbulent transitional flow occurs at re values between 1800 and 2800 darbyshire and mullin 2005 our use of a fully developed laminar or turbulent model may have introduced errors into the result within this re range however the laminar model closely predicted the experimental degradation ratios obtained at re values smaller than 2000 and the turbulent model closely predicted the experimental degradation ratios at re values greater than 2000 fig 4 a thus we excluded the need for any parameter fitting likewise the predicted and experimental values under different radiant exitances were also similar fig 4b overall the model provided degradation ratios that followed the same trend as the experimental data as flow rate re and radiant exitance were changed thus we concluded that our model was valid for predicting the effects of flow rate and radiant exitance on 1 4 dioxane degradation in our previous research we proposed a computational kinetic model for predicting 1 4 dioxane degradation during vuv treatment that took into account the effects of coexisting inorganic ions on the reaction kinetics matsushita et al 2019 however this model was applicable to only one operating condition i e fixed flow rate and fixed radiant exitance although the gray box kinetic model using the pseudo first order reaction rate constant in the present study may be relatively coarse compared with our previous model we considered the present model to be able to predict 1 4 dioxane degradation with sufficient engineering accuracy under different flow rates and different radiant exitances 3 3 effects of flow rate on 1 4 dioxane degradation the effects of flow rate on 1 4 dioxane degradation were examined by using our validated model and a virtual annular photoreactor see section 2 2 to ensure that our simulation results were reliable the cfd lagrangian approach used in the model was further validated both retention time and mass flow weighted average vuv dose in the virtual photoreactor calculated by our model were compared with their respective theoretical values fig s2 and text s2 good agreement between our simulation results and the theoretical values confirmed the reliability of our model the effect of flow rate on 1 4 dioxane degradation was investigated by simulation with different flow rates from laminar to turbulent flow and a fixed radiant exitance of 100 w m2 using gw and the virtual photoreactor the observed degradation ratios followed the same trend as that observed in the validation experiments using the pilot scale photoreactor that is the degradation ratio decreased with increasing flow rate re under the same flow regime fig 5 which was attributed to the retention time of water in the reactor decreasing with increasing flow rate in contrast radiation efficiency was found to increase with increasing flow rate irrespective of flow regime the vuv radiation field in the photoreactor was non uniform the fluence rate decreased exponentially with distance from the lamp fig s3 therefore the vuv dose of each particle varied according to its trajectory under laminar flow because water migrates in parallel layers that do not mix the vuv fluence rate of the particle does not change along its trajectory thus the vuv dose range of the particles was large fig s4a because particles close to the quartz sleeve received high vuv doses high fluence rate and long retention time whereas those far from the quartz sleeve received low vuv doses low fluence rate or short retention time or both in contrast under turbulent flow chaotic changes in pressure and velocity occur while the particles pass through the photoreactor resulting in a relatively narrow dose distribution fig s4b under both flow regimes increasing the flow rate re did not change the shape of the cumulative vuv dose curve but did shift it to the left which means that the vuv doses of all the particles decreased by the same ratio these decreases resulted in an increase in radiation efficiency according to jensen s inequality text s1 although our model provided values that showed the same trends as those found in the validation experiments discontinuous changes in degradation ratio and radiation efficiency were observed as the re value was increased from 2000 to 2400 this was attributed to the use of different models for the two flow regimes laminar model for re values of 2000 turbulent model for re values of 2400 the actual degradation ratio was expected to be between the values predicted by the laminar and the turbulent models in the re range of 1800 2800 because the real flow in this re range was laminar turbulent transitional flow such transitional flow results in more physical modeling uncertainty than does fully developed laminar or turbulent flow versteeg and malalasekera 2007 to accurately predict the result for every flow rate in this range high resolution experiments consisting of several runs at different flow rates and a deep understanding of fluid dynamics for transitional flows would be required however the aim of the present study was to investigate the changes in degradation ratio and radiation efficiency for optimizing the operating parameters under fully developed laminar or turbulent flow therefore this discontinuity is not discussed in detail here 3 4 effect of radiant exitance on 1 4 dioxane degradation the effects of radiant exitance on 1 4 dioxane degradation were also examined by using our validated model and a virtual annular photoreactor in the simulation different radiant exitances 20 100 w m2 under laminar re 800 or turbulent flow re 4000 were examined with sw used as the water fig 6 as the radiant exitance increased the degradation ratio increased under both flow regimes which was consistent with our observations in the validation experiments in contrast as the radiant exitance increased the radiation efficiency decreased under both flow regimes increasing the radiant exitance proportionally increases the vuv fluence rate at every position in the photoreactor regardless of flow type eq s11 therefore the vuv doses of the particles were increased by the same ratio as the radiant exitance was increased resulting in a decrease of radiation efficiency according to jensen s inequality text s1 vuv dose distribution is important in improving degradation and radiation efficiency 3 5 optimization of operating parameters based on eeo analysis under the same flow regime in the annular vuv photoreactor the degradation ratio and the radiation efficiency showed opposite trends as the operating parameters were changed increasing the flow rate decreased the degradation ratio but increased the radiation efficiency whereas increasing the radiant exitance increased the degradation ratio but decreased the radiation efficiency as a consequence degradation ratio and radiation efficiency could not be improved simultaneously i e the highest removal ratio at the highest efficiency by adjusting these operating parameters under the same flow regime next radiation efficiency which was calculated by using the actual residual ratio and the average vuv dose eqs 11 and 12 was used as an index of cost effectiveness with respect to radiation energy input in practical applications eeo kwh m3 order has been widely used for comparing cost effectiveness among advanced oxidation processes and operating conditions bolton and stefan 2002 13 eeo w p p l q log 10 c in c out where w p and p l are the electrical energy input kw of the pump and lamp respectively q is the volumetric flow rate m3 h and c in and c out are concentrations of 1 4 dioxane at the inlet and outlet of the reactor respectively in the present study because the required pump input calculated by pressure loss was much smaller than the lamp power text s4 w p was considered to be negligible in eq 13 based on eqs 12 and 13 a connection between radiation efficiency and eeo can be established through the actual log degradation ratio 14 eeo a 1 η α k p l p vuv where a is the conversion factor to convert watts to kilowatts the natural logarithm to the common logarithm and seconds to hours assuming the fourth term in eq 14 is a constant eeo is a monotonic function of radiation efficiency thus the results of radiation efficiency in 3 3 and 3 4 can be used to examine eeo with changes in operating parameters in the present study we assumed that the average power conversion efficiency of the vuv lamp with the transmittance sleeve the reciprocal of the fourth term in eq 14 was 4 5 text s5 as a consequence the eeo value will decrease as the flow rate increase under the same flow regime or the radiation exitance decrease fig 7 shows eeo values calculated by using the radiation efficiencies obtained in the simulations under different flow rates re 400 4000 and radiant exitances 20 100 w m2 for gw in the virtual photoreactor under laminar flow fig 7a eeo was highly sensitive to both flow rate and radiant exitance eeo decreased with both increasing flow rate which is in agreement with previous research bagheri and mohseni 2015 and decreasing radiant exitance suggesting that vuv treatment using low power lamps and a high flow rate would be the most economical set up under laminar flow conditions under turbulent flow fig 7b eeo was less sensitive to flow rate and radiant exitance compared with under laminar flow although the change was limited eeo decreased with increasing flow rate which is in agreement with previous research bagheri and mohseni 2017 likewise eeo slightly decreased with decreasing radiant exitance overall at the high flow rate eeo was insensitive to the changes in radiant exitance thus vuv treatment using high power lamps and at the high flow rate is recommended under turbulent flow because the degradation ratio markedly increased with increasing radiant exitance fig s6 even if there was no marked change in eeo 4 conclusions 1 a cfd model that takes into account the effects of flow rate and radiant exitance on 1 4 dioxane degradation during vuv treatment was developed the model required only one parameter the pseudo first order rate constant for the reaction of 1 4 dioxane which was determined by a simple batch degradation experiment the model successfully predicted 1 4 dioxane degradation in a pilot scale flow through annular photoreactor operated at different flow rates and radiant exitances confirming the reliability of the model 2 model simulation in a virtual photoreactor revealed that both increasing flow rate and decreasing radiant exitance increased radiation efficiency which was findings that agreed with those from the experiments using the pilot scale photoreactor 3 eeo analysis suggested that vuv treatment using low power lamps and a high flow rate was the most economical set up under laminar flow in contrast treatment using high power lamps at the high flow rate was suggested to be the most economical set up under turbulent flow

implementation of vuv treatment processes is stymied partly because of a lack of systematic optimization of operating parameters for pilot or large scale photoreactors bagheri and mohseni 2017 bagheri and mohseni 2014 2015 2017 have reported several computational fluid dynamics cfd models for analyzing the degradation of micropollutants in a vuv photoreactor however their models describe the effect of flow rate on micropollutant degradation under only a single flow regime i e either laminar or turbulent flow so knowledge of micropollutant degradation under different flow regimes remains limited moreover their models do not consider the effect of radiant exitance which is an important operating parameter in the vuv treatment process for effective photoreactor operation flow rate and radiant exitance must be optimized here we developed a cfd model that takes into consideration the effects of flow rate and radiant exitance on 1 4 dioxane degradation during vuv treatment in our model the chemical reaction kinetics of 1 4 dioxane were simplified to a pseudo first order reaction rate constant k m2 j which was determined by a simple batch degradation experiment the model was validated via experiments carried out using a pilot scale flow through annular photoreactor under different flow rates and different radiant exitances we then used the validated model to examine the effects of flow rate and radiant exitance on 1 4 dioxane degradation in a virtual annular photoreactor finally the effects of flow rate and radiant exitance on treatment performance were examined by electrical energy per order eeo analysis to our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the effect of radiant exitance on photoreactor performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 analytical modeling 2 1 1 gray box kinetic model during vuv treatment oh radicals form when water is irradiated by vuv photons imoberdorf and mohseni 2012 oppenlander 2007 almost all of these oh radicals are generated directly from the photolysis of water 1 h 2 o h v 185 nm oh h φ 1 0 33 2 h 2 o h v 185 nm oh h e φ 2 0 045 where φ1 and φ2 are the quantum yields the generated radicals react very quickly with coexisting species in the water such as oh radical scavengers and therefore the oh radical concentration reaches a steady state almost immediately de laat et al 1999 sharpless and linden 2003 the equilibrium concentration of the oh radicals c oh st can be calculated using 3 c oh st φ 1 φ 2 k i c i i n a e 185 α w ln 10 where ki is the rate constant for the reaction between oh radical consuming species i and oh radicals ci is the concentration of oh radical consuming species i i is the vuv fluence rate e 185 is the energy of a photon na is avogadro s constant and α w is the absorption coefficient of the pure water at 185 nm the degradation of 1 4 dioxane occurs by reaction with oh radicals and the other species such as cl related radicals have little effect on the degradation li et al 2017 matsushita et al 2015 patton et al 2017 therefore the degradation rate of 1 4 dioxane r d is expressed as 4 r d k oh c oh st c where k oh is the second order rate constant for the reaction between 1 4 dioxane and oh radicals and c is the concentration of 1 4 dioxane substituting the second term in eq 4 with eq 1 gives the following expression for the rate of 1 4 dioxane degradation 5 r d k oh φ 1 φ 2 k i c i i n a e 185 α w ln 10 c the factor kici describes the reactions of all of the oh radical consuming species in the water since the number of oh radical consuming species is very large the equations for the reactions of each species are not individually solved instead the reactions are treated as one overall reaction with a certain rate constant wols et al 2011 accordingly for each water the coefficient of ic is a constant determined by the background species present in the water water quality 6 r d k i c where k is the apparent reaction rate constant m2 j in the present study the value of k was determined for each water via a batch degradation experiment see section 2 3 2 2 1 2 cfd lagrangian particle tracking approach the lagrangian particle tracking approach has been shown to be appropriate for the prediction of micropollutant degradation by uv treatment wols and hofman caris 2012a in this approach the term particle refers to a small volume of water in which vuv photon induced reactions take place the motion of these particles comprises an advection displacement induced by the computed velocity field and a diffusion displacement induced by turbulent fluctuation both the velocity field and the diffusion are calculated by the viscous models provided by cfd software the vuv dose d j m2 experienced by a particle is calculated by integrating the fluence rate over the particle trajectory 7 d 0 t i r t d t where t is irradiation time and r t is the position vector along the trajectory for predicting 1 4 dioxane degradation within a particle eq 6 is solved using i r t of the particle trajectory from the inlet to the outlet of the reactor the concentration at the outlet of the reactor c calculated using the lagrangian approach can be simplified by using the initial concentration at the inlet c 0 and the vuv dose d at the outlet 8 c c 0 exp k d the concentration at the outlet c is calculated by using the mass flow weighted wi weight of particle i w i 1 average of the concentration in each fluid particle ci irradiated with the respective vuv dose di as follows 9 c w i c i w i c 0 exp k d i 2 1 3 radiation efficiency according to jensen s inequality text s1 c in eq 9 has a minimum value c min maximum degradation ratio at which all the particles receive the same vuv dose d mass flow weighted average vuv dose 10 c w

text s2 11 d p vuv q α 1 10 α h p vuv q α from a practical point of view however it is impossible to achieve c min because the particles do not receive a uniform vuv dose the radiation efficiency η as a metric of energy based efficiency is therefore determined as follows wols et al 2015 12 η ln c c 0 ln c min c 0 ln c c 0 k d ln c c 0 k p vuv q α where ln c c 0 is the actual log degradation in the present study radiation efficiency was determined as the ratio of the actual observed degradation to the theoretical maximum achievable degradation which assuming no variation in vuv dose among the particles 2 2 cfd modeling ansys workbench 2019r was used to build and discretize a 1 6 m long pilot scale flow through vuv photoreactor with an annular configuration fig 1 two viscosity models in ansys fluent were used the laminar model was used for reynolds numbers re 2000 and the realizable k ε model coupled with standard wall function was used for re 2000 the radiation field for vuv photons was computed by solving the radiative transfer equation using a non gray discrete ordinate sub model the vuv inputs are summarized in table 1 using the lagrangian approach we released 4000 evenly distributed particles at the inlet a user defined function was used to record the vuv fluence rate along the pathline of each particle and to integrate it into the vuv dose the concentration of 1 4 dioxane in each particle at the outlet was calculated by using eq 8 and the concentration of 1 4 dioxane in the whole fluid was then calculated by using eq 9 the computational domain of the photoreactor was divided into 2 5 million cells constituting an unstructured mesh to guarantee proper resolution of the boundary layer a 2 mm layer with 10 layers of inflated prisms was placed close to the sleeve to investigate the effect of flow rate and radiant exitance on 1 4 dioxane degradation a simple virtual annular photoreactor which is a common photoreactor arrangement was constructed by using the same model set up procedure described above fig s1 the virtual photoreactor had the same cross section as the pilot scale flow through annular photoreactor although the length was set at 1 0 m and the whole of the photoreactor was assumed to be irradiated assuming fully developed laminar or turbulent flow inlet velocity distributions at different flow rates and a given re were set by using the appropriate profile in ansys fluent radiant exitance was defined as the direct irradiation on the external surface of the quartz sleeve the computational domain of the photoreactor was divided into 4 million cells constituting a structured hexahedral prism mesh 2 3 experimental set up and procedures 2 3 1 chemicals and water samples all chemicals were purchased commercially and used without further purification reagent solutions for the experiments were prepared with guaranteed reagent grade chemicals and milli q water 18 2 mω cm milli q advantage millipore co bedford ma usa two types of water were used for the experiments natural groundwater gw and synthetic water sw the gw was collected from the raw water input to a full scale drinking water treatment plant tachikawa japan and stored at 4 c until use no 1 4 dioxane was artificially added to the gw because it was already contaminated with 1 4 dioxane the sw was prepared by passing laboratory tap water through an activated carbon cartridge filter tcc wh t0cp toyo roshi kaisha japan to remove residual free chlorine and then adjusting the ph and alkalinity using sodium hydroxide and sodium bicarbonate respectively to match those of the gw the sw was spiked with 100 μg l of 1 4 dioxane prior to use the main properties of the gw and sw are presented in table s1 2 3 2 batch experiment for determining reaction rate constant to determine the pseudo first order rate constant for the reaction of 1 4 dioxane eq 6 in gw and sw a quasi collimated beam vuv apparatus equipped with a vacuum mercury lamp was used fig 2 the distance between the top of the water to the radiation source was 30 cm milli q water spiked with 100 μg l of 1 4 dioxane was used for comparison the ph of the milli q water was not controlled a 100 ml glass beaker with a diameter of 4 5 cm exposure area 15 9 cm2 was used as the reaction vessel a water sample 60 ml the path length of the quasi collimated beam is 3 8 cm was poured into the beaker and then covered with a wooden radiation shielding sheet until the experiment was started because 3 8 cm of the path length may be somewhat long compared with the depth of the layer in which the reactions between vuv photons and water molecules take place a magnetic stirrer was used to thoroughly mix the solution during the irradiation a 65 w low pressure mercury lamp emitting both 185 nm vuv and 254 nm uv photons was used as the radiation source niq60 35xl heraeus noblelight gmbh hanau germany to suppress the absorption of vuv photons by oxygen in the gas phase nitrogen gas was introduced into the reactor to obtain a volume fraction of oxygen of less than 2 before turning on the lamp to ensure a steady radiation output the lamp was turned on at least 20 min before each experiment a calibrated radiometer c9536 h9535 hamamatsu photonics k k hamamatsu japan was installed parallel to the surface of the irradiated water sample to determine the fluence rate during the experiments the vuv and uv fluence rates at the center of the vessel were 1 0 and 3 2 w m2 respectively the volume averaged vuv dose was calculated by the method described in text s3 to observe the change in 1 4 dioxane concentration individual experiments with an irradiation time of 3 6 9 or 12 min were conducted after the irradiation an aliquot of the solution was withdrawn and the 1 4 dioxane remaining in the solution was quantified the pseudo first order reaction rate constant in eq 6 was determined for the waters from the water absorption ratio α w α and the slope of the relationship of the natural logarithm of the residual ratio against the mean absorbed vuv dose assuming that the irradiation was uniform because of stirring bolton and stefan 2002 2 3 3 pilot scale experiment for model validation validation experiments were conducted using a pilot scale flow through vuv photoreactor made of stainless steel fig 1 the internal radius of the reactor and the external radius of the quartz sleeve were 23 9 and 11 5 mm respectively resulting in a radial gap of 12 4 mm which corresponded to a hydraulic diameter of 24 8 mm for the water flowing through the reactor to provide a large range of radiation exitance and investigate its effect in the pilot scale photoreactor two types of low pressure mercury lamps 65 and 240 w heraeus noblelight gmbh hanau germany and two types of quartz sleeves with different vuv radiation transmittance were used to mimic lower power lamps a 65 w lamp was coated with a synthetic fluororesin film reducing the vuv radiation exitance iwasaki electric co ltd tokyo japan the lamps provided a 1 4 m long cylindrical radiation zone within the 1 6 m photoreactor the stable vuv and uv photon emissions on the external surface of the quartz sleeve were measured for each lamp table 1 by the same radiometer use in 2 3 2 to validate the model with the respect to the effect of flow rate on 1 4 dioxane degradation flow through experiments were conducted with the photoreactor equipped with the 240 w lamp at room temperature using gw at flow rates ranging from 1 5 to 10 5 l min to validate the model with respect to the effect of radiant exitance on 1 4 dioxane degradation similar experiments were conducted with the photoreactor equipped with different lamps and different quartz sleeves table 1 at room temperature using sw at a flow rate of 6 9 l min samples were withdrawn from the sampling points at the inlet and the outlet and the concentrations of 1 4 dioxane in the samples were measured 2 3 4 quantification methods the concentration of 1 4 dioxane was measured by using a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer qp2010 plus shimadzu corporation kyoto japan equipped with a purge and trap sample concentrator aqua pt 5000 j plus gl science inc tokyo japan a capillary column hp 5ms length 30 m i d 250 μm thickness 0 25 μm agilent technologies palo alto ca usa was used for sample separation the temperatures of the ion source injector and transfer line were controlled at 200 180 and 180 c respectively gas chromatography mass spectrometry was performed in the selected ion monitoring mode with d 8 1 4 dioxane fujifilm wako pure chemical as the internal standard the fragment ions of 1 4 dioxane and d 8 1 4 dioxane were detected at m z 88 and 96 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of reaction rate constant by batch experiment in our model the pseudo first order reaction rate constant was used to simplify the reaction of oh radicals with background oh radical consuming species see section 2 1 1 the pseudo first order reaction rate constant of 1 4 dioxane in each water was determined by batch experiment in milli q water fig 3 1 4 dioxane rapidly degraded to a residual ratio of approximately 5 at a volume averaged vuv dose of 100 j m2 in contrast at the similar vuv dose 100 125 j m2 absorbed by water the residual ratios in sw and gw were 0 18 and 0 55 respectively values which are much higher than that in milli q water indicating that 1 4 dioxane degradation was suppressed in sw and gw compared with in milli q water this was attributed mainly to the absorption of 185 nm radiation by chloride furatian and mohseni 2018 and scavenging of oh radicals by bicarbonate imoberdorf and mohseni 2012 and nitrate matsushita et al 2019 although the natural organic matter has been reported to scavenge oh radicals during the vuv process wols and hofman caris 2012b in the present study the contribution of natural organic matter to the suppression of degradation was most likely negligible because the concentration of doc was low even in gw 0 09 mg l table s1 the slope of the natural logarithm of the residual ratio against the mean absorbed vuv dose for sw and gw were determined to be 1 4 10 2 and 5 2 10 3 m2 j respectively the reaction constants in sw and gw calculated by these values and the water absorption ratio were used in the cfd model simulation 3 2 model validation using a pilot scale flow through annular photoreactor two sets of experiments were carried out using the pilot scale flow through annular photoreactor one set using different flow rates 1 5 10 5 l min a radiant exitance of 105 w m2 and gw and one set using different radiant exitances 7 3 105 w m2 a flow rate of 6 96 l min and sw because laminar turbulent transitional flow occurs at re values between 1800 and 2800 darbyshire and mullin 2005 our use of a fully developed laminar or turbulent model may have introduced errors into the result within this re range however the laminar model closely predicted the experimental degradation ratios obtained at re values smaller than 2000 and the turbulent model closely predicted the experimental degradation ratios at re values greater than 2000 fig 4 a thus we excluded the need for any parameter fitting likewise the predicted and experimental values under different radiant exitances were also similar fig 4b overall the model provided degradation ratios that followed the same trend as the experimental data as flow rate re and radiant exitance were changed thus we concluded that our model was valid for predicting the effects of flow rate and radiant exitance on 1 4 dioxane degradation in our previous research we proposed a computational kinetic model for predicting 1 4 dioxane degradation during vuv treatment that took into account the effects of coexisting inorganic ions on the reaction kinetics matsushita et al 2019 however this model was applicable to only one operating condition i e fixed flow rate and fixed radiant exitance although the gray box kinetic model using the pseudo first order reaction rate constant in the present study may be relatively coarse compared with our previous model we considered the present model to be able to predict 1 4 dioxane degradation with sufficient engineering accuracy under different flow rates and different radiant exitances 3 3 effects of flow rate on 1 4 dioxane degradation the effects of flow rate on 1 4 dioxane degradation were examined by using our validated model and a virtual annular photoreactor see section 2 2 to ensure that our simulation results were reliable the cfd lagrangian approach used in the model was further validated both retention time and mass flow weighted average vuv dose in the virtual photoreactor calculated by our model were compared with their respective theoretical values fig s2 and text s2 good agreement between our simulation results and the theoretical values confirmed the reliability of our model the effect of flow rate on 1 4 dioxane degradation was investigated by simulation with different flow rates from laminar to turbulent flow and a fixed radiant exitance of 100 w m2 using gw and the virtual photoreactor the observed degradation ratios followed the same trend as that observed in the validation experiments using the pilot scale photoreactor that is the degradation ratio decreased with increasing flow rate re under the same flow regime fig 5 which was attributed to the retention time of water in the reactor decreasing with increasing flow rate in contrast radiation efficiency was found to increase with increasing flow rate irrespective of flow regime the vuv radiation field in the photoreactor was non uniform the fluence rate decreased exponentially with distance from the lamp fig s3 therefore the vuv dose of each particle varied according to its trajectory under laminar flow because water migrates in parallel layers that do not mix the vuv fluence rate of the particle does not change along its trajectory thus the vuv dose range of the particles was large fig s4a because particles close to the quartz sleeve received high vuv doses high fluence rate and long retention time whereas those far from the quartz sleeve received low vuv doses low fluence rate or short retention time or both in contrast under turbulent flow chaotic changes in pressure and velocity occur while the particles pass through the photoreactor resulting in a relatively narrow dose distribution fig s4b under both flow regimes increasing the flow rate re did not change the shape of the cumulative vuv dose curve but did shift it to the left which means that the vuv doses of all the particles decreased by the same ratio these decreases resulted in an increase in radiation efficiency according to jensen s inequality text s1 although our model provided values that showed the same trends as those found in the validation experiments discontinuous changes in degradation ratio and radiation efficiency were observed as the re value was increased from 2000 to 2400 this was attributed to the use of different models for the two flow regimes laminar model for re values of 2000 turbulent model for re values of 2400 the actual degradation ratio was expected to be between the values predicted by the laminar and the turbulent models in the re range of 1800 2800 because the real flow in this re range was laminar turbulent transitional flow such transitional flow results in more physical modeling uncertainty than does fully developed laminar or turbulent flow versteeg and malalasekera 2007 to accurately predict the result for every flow rate in this range high resolution experiments consisting of several runs at different flow rates and a deep understanding of fluid dynamics for transitional flows would be required however the aim of the present study was to investigate the changes in degradation ratio and radiation efficiency for optimizing the operating parameters under fully developed laminar or turbulent flow therefore this discontinuity is not discussed in detail here 3 4 effect of radiant exitance on 1 4 dioxane degradation the effects of radiant exitance on 1 4 dioxane degradation were also examined by using our validated model and a virtual annular photoreactor in the simulation different radiant exitances 20 100 w m2 under laminar re 800 or turbulent flow re 4000 were examined with sw used as the water fig 6 as the radiant exitance increased the degradation ratio increased under both flow regimes which was consistent with our observations in the validation experiments in contrast as the radiant exitance increased the radiation efficiency decreased under both flow regimes increasing the radiant exitance proportionally increases the vuv fluence rate at every position in the photoreactor regardless of flow type eq s11 therefore the vuv doses of the particles were increased by the same ratio as the radiant exitance was increased resulting in a decrease of radiation efficiency according to jensen s inequality text s1 vuv dose distribution is important in improving degradation and radiation efficiency 3 5 optimization of operating parameters based on eeo analysis under the same flow regime in the annular vuv photoreactor the degradation ratio and the radiation efficiency showed opposite trends as the operating parameters were changed increasing the flow rate decreased the degradation ratio but increased the radiation efficiency whereas increasing the radiant exitance increased the degradation ratio but decreased the radiation efficiency as a consequence degradation ratio and radiation efficiency could not be improved simultaneously i e the highest removal ratio at the highest efficiency by adjusting these operating parameters under the same flow regime next radiation efficiency which was calculated by using the actual residual ratio and the average vuv dose eqs 11 and 12 was used as an index of cost effectiveness with respect to radiation energy input in practical applications eeo kwh m3 order has been widely used for comparing cost effectiveness among advanced oxidation processes and operating conditions bolton and stefan 2002 13 eeo w p p l q log 10 c in c out where w p and p l are the electrical energy input kw of the pump and lamp respectively q is the volumetric flow rate m3 h and c in and c out are concentrations of 1 4 dioxane at the inlet and outlet of the reactor respectively in the present study because the required pump input calculated by pressure loss was much smaller than the lamp power text s4 w p was considered to be negligible in eq 13 based on eqs 12 and 13 a connection between radiation efficiency and eeo can be established through the actual log degradation ratio 14 eeo a 1 η α k p l p vuv where a is the conversion factor to convert watts to kilowatts the natural logarithm to the common logarithm and seconds to hours assuming the fourth term in eq 14 is a constant eeo is a monotonic function of radiation efficiency thus the results of radiation efficiency in 3 3 and 3 4 can be used to examine eeo with changes in operating parameters in the present study we assumed that the average power conversion efficiency of the vuv lamp with the transmittance sleeve the reciprocal of the fourth term in eq 14 was 4 5 text s5 as a consequence the eeo value will decrease as the flow rate increase under the same flow regime or the radiation exitance decrease fig 7 shows eeo values calculated by using the radiation efficiencies obtained in the simulations under different flow rates re 400 4000 and radiant exitances 20 100 w m2 for gw in the virtual photoreactor under laminar flow fig 7a eeo was highly sensitive to both flow rate and radiant exitance eeo decreased with both increasing flow rate which is in agreement with previous research bagheri and mohseni 2015 and decreasing radiant exitance suggesting that vuv treatment using low power lamps and a high flow rate would be the most economical set up under laminar flow conditions under turbulent flow fig 7b eeo was less sensitive to flow rate and radiant exitance compared with under laminar flow although the change was limited eeo decreased with increasing flow rate which is in agreement with previous research bagheri and mohseni 2017 likewise eeo slightly decreased with decreasing radiant exitance overall at the high flow rate eeo was insensitive to the changes in radiant exitance thus vuv treatment using high power lamps and at the high flow rate is recommended under turbulent flow because the degradation ratio markedly increased with increasing radiant exitance fig s6 even if there was no marked change in eeo 4 conclusions 1 a cfd model that takes into account the effects of flow rate and radiant exitance on 1 4 dioxane degradation during vuv treatment was developed the model required only one parameter the pseudo first order rate constant for the reaction of 1 4 dioxane which was determined by a simple batch degradation experiment the model successfully predicted 1 4 dioxane degradation in a pilot scale flow through annular photoreactor operated at different flow rates and radiant exitances confirming the reliability of the model 2 model simulation in a virtual photoreactor revealed that both increasing flow rate and decreasing radiant exitance increased radiation efficiency which was findings that agreed with those from the experiments using the pilot scale photoreactor 3 eeo analysis suggested that vuv treatment using low power lamps and a high flow rate was the most economical set up under laminar flow in contrast treatment using high power lamps at the high flow rate was suggested to be the most economical set up under turbulent flow

17036,fluid flow through a bed of solid particles is an important process that occurs in full scale water treatment operations the carman kozeny model remains highly popular for estimating the resistance across the bed it is common practice to use particle shape factors in fixed bed state to match the predicted drag coefficient with experimentally obtained drag coefficients in fluidised state however where the same particles are considered this particle shape factor is usually simply omitted from the model without providing appropriate reasoning in this research it is shown that a shape factor is not a constant particle property but is dependent on the fluid properties as well this dynamic shape factor for irregularly shaped grains increases from approximately 0 6 to 1 0 in fluidised state we found that unstable packed beds in moderate up flow conditions are pseudo fixed and in a setting state this results in a decreasing bed voidage and simultaneously in a decreasing drag coefficient which seems quite contradictory this can be explained by the collapse of local channels in the bed leading to a more uniform flow distribution through the bed and improving the available surface for flow through our experimental measurements show that the drag coefficient decreases considerably in the laminar and transition regions this is most likely caused by particle orientation realignment and rearrangement in particles packing position a thorough hydraulic analysis shows that up flow filtration in rapid sand filters under backwash conditions causes the particle bed to collapse almost imperceptibly in addition an improved expression of the drag coefficient demonstrated that the carman kozeny model constant however often assumed to be constant is in fact not constant for increasing flow rates furthermore we propose a new pseudo 3d image analysis for particles with an irregular shape in this way we can explain the successful method using optimisation of

rsf rapid sand filtration who world health organisation 1 introduction the downward flow of fluid through a bed of solid particles is an important process that occurs in full scale water treatment operations crittenden et al 2012 in the field of drinking water treatment rapid sand filtration rsf is the most common unit operation applied to capture fine particles from the water in the filter bed accumulated particles cause a gradual increase in head loss and reduce overall effectiveness of the filter bed howe et al 2012 when the head loss exceeds a certain threshold after a period of time the filter is backwashed usually assisted by some auxiliary scouring during backwashing an upward water flow expands the filter bed and flushes out the collected fine particles after a filtration and backwashing sequence the cycle starts again edzwald 2011 to reduce the passage of particles through restarted filters immediately after a backwash procedure amburgey proposed the extended terminal sub fluidisation wash method etsw to remove significantly higher amounts of backwash remnant particles amburgey 2005 etsw is a proven method of terminating the backwash cycle with a sub fluidisation wash for a time interval adequate to pass one theoretical filter volume of water upward through the filter amburgey and amirtharajah 2005 etsw is a relatively straightforward process comprising an appropriate additional sub fluidisation wash step at the end of a normal backwash procedure the etsw washing phase is started at the end of the backwash sequence with the purpose of rinsing out the remainder of the particles sheared from the filter during the fluidisation stage of the backwash the estw is set to a wash water flow rate below the minimum fluidisation velocity for a time sufficient to displace one entire filter volume of particle laden water the results presented by amburgey 2005 show a significant improvement in water quality by reducing or eliminating the initial particle passage during the restart of a packed filter after backwashing etsw reduces the turbidity during filter maturation and particle number spikes in practice but no hydraulic explanation for its effectiveness was provided in this paper we report laboratory measurements in which up flow filtration procedures were simulated during the experiments an unexpected reduction in both bed voidage and bed resistance was detected which could not be explained by traditional drag coefficient correlations as a function of the particle reynolds number we propose this can be explained by differences in preferred orientation of particles under different hydraulic conditions 2 hydraulic drag 2 1 hydraulic models for fluid flow in particle beds well known hydraulic models for flow through particle beds have been introduced for the laminar flow regime by blake 1922 and kozeny 1927 based on darcy 1856 for the turbulent flow regime by burke and plummer 1928 and for the transitional flow regime by ergun 1952 and carman 1937 based on the forchheimer flow conditions forchheimer 1930 in the laminar regime the fluid flows in smooth parallel layers without any disturbance between the layers while in the turbulent flow regime the fluid undergoes irregular fluctuations and changes in both magnitude and direction transitional flow is a mixture of laminar and turbulent flow with turbulence in the centre of pore spaces and laminar flow near the particle surfaces each of these flows behaves in different ways in terms of their frictional energy loss de facto the most commonly used and most accurate říha et al 2018 equation for expressing the relationship between permeability and voidage particle size and tortuosity is the carman kozeny equation this equation is applied in various fields such as groundwater flow water treatment and many other water processes camp 1946 the carman kozeny equation is important not only for the determination of permeability in porous media yang 2003 but also for the estimation of the voidage in a fluidised bed kramer et al 2020a in groundwater flow the flow regime is generally considered to be laminar crittenden et al 2012 in fluidised beds however not only laminar but also transitional and to a certain degree turbulent flow regimes occur the resistance of laminar flow through a granular bed can be calculated using the well known equation proposed by blake 1922 kozeny 1927 and carman 1937 1 δ p δ l 180 v s η d p 2 1 ε 2 ε 3 r e ε 2 where δ p δ l is the pressure drop head loss v s is the superficial velocity η the dynamic fluid viscosity d p the average or equivalent particle diameter ε the bed voidage and r e ϵ the modified particle reynolds number eq 3 this equation shows that the resistance of laminar flow is linear with the viscosity and with the superficial velocity as is also known to be the case for laminar flow through pipes according to hagen poiseuille munson et al 2020 and laminar flow through aquifers darcy 1856 the experimentally obtained value of 180 is often indicated as the kozeny drag coefficient kozeny 1927 further background information about the carman equation is elucidated in the supplementary material section 3 since in water treatment the operational field lies in the vicinity of incipient fluidisation and since turbulent flow regimes are exceptional there is a preference for using the carman kozeny drag relation kozeny proposed a fixed pore shape factor k 180 in eq 1 to fit the model results to experimental data in the literature many other values are proposed ozgumus et al 2014 erdim et al 2015 hoyland 2017 schulz et al 2019 of which k 150 is also often used burke and plummer 1928 ergun 1952 kramer et al 2020a the factor 180 does not appear to be constant at higher velocities when the flow is no longer laminar r e ε 2 as carman 1937 showed he introduced a drag coefficient which can be written in the laminar form f l or in the turbulent form f t as a function of the reynolds number r e ε 2 f l f t r e ε 180 2 9 r e ε 0 9 r e ε 600 where f l is the dimensionless drag coefficient laminar representation and f t the dimensionless drag coefficient turbulent representation and where the modified particle reynolds number r e ε is defined as 3 r e ε ρ f d p v s η 1 1 ε where ρ f is the fluid density the experimentally obtained relation for f l or f t will be indicated below as the carman drag coefficient carman 1937 for further background information on the many forms of this equation reference is made to the literature erdim et al 2015 and model derivations given in the supplementary material section 3 2 2 particle correction shape factors within hydraulic modelling particles are often idealised to spheres for mathematical convenience water treatment related particles generally have more complex geometric features summarised under the term shape including the geometric shape the presence of surface disparities such as protuberances and re entrant features as well as particle property irregularities shape is therefore difficult to define although the literature on particle shape is extensive gauvin and katta 1973 holdich 2002 seville and yu 2016 and a number of shape factors and descriptors have been proposed clift et al 1978 allen 1990 there is no universal agreement on how to define particle shape therefore there is no agreement on how to correctly measure it nor does the literature provide consistent methods to cope with naturally irregularly shaped particles that can be used in voidage prediction models for liquid solid fluidisation systems the size and shape of the particles has important implications for for instance filter design crittenden et al 2012 but there is no easy way to account for this in the literature wadell 1933 cleasby et al 1981 michaelide et al 2017 particle shape is often characterised by sphericity which is generally defined as the ratio of the surface area of an equal volume sphere to the surface area of the granule that being said sphericity has limited value in actual practice for several reasons first filter media are currently still routinely measured and specified using a laborious sieve analysis procedure and less by means of advanced image analysis techniques second in the literature there is no general consensus on how to apply sphericity for commercially available granular media if the particle has a known geometric shape sphericity can be calculated mathematically however for irregularly shaped particles indirect methods are required to determine shape factors several empirical fitting models are available dharmarajah 1982 often these models are based on head loss or voidage experiments carman 1937 proposed that the k value was independent of media properties and introduced a correction factor to account for the non spherical nature of filter grains using sphericity and the shape factor fair et al 1933 according to yang 2003 shape factors are open to criticism because a range of granules with different shapes may have the same shape factor which is inevitable if complex shapes are to be described by only a single parameter wen and yu 1966 proposed shape factor corrections used in the ergun equation based on experimental data for the minimum fluidisation voidage according to the literature dharmarajah 1982 crittenden et al 2012 a commonly used particle shape factor in fixed bed state is necessary in order to match the carman kozeny predicted drag coefficient with the experimentally obtained drag coefficient the main drawback of this approach is that the model parameters often have no direct connection to the underlying porous medium structure schulz et al 2019 do not have a physical interpretation or are difficult or even impossible to measure especially by means of sieve analysis di felice 1995 in contrast in the fluidised state particle shape factors are usually omitted to match the carman kozeny predicted drag coefficient with the experimentally obtained drag coefficient without providing any explanation most likely this is done because these parameters are difficult to measure directly de jong and nomden 1974 hoyland 2017 hunce et al 2018 this is remarkable at the very least since the same particles are involved in fixed as well as fluidised states in addition particle shape factors as a function of fluid velocity and temperature in liquid solid fluidised systems are rarely evaluated in the literature in the practice of filtration crittenden et al 2012 and other forms of flow through granular beds the measured resistance does not appear to correspond with the calculated resistance to obtain a fit an experimentally determined shape factor ϕ s is used to modify the measured diameter d into an effective diameter d p 4 d p ϕ s d where d is the measured diameter and ϕ s the diameter shape correction factor for further background information on the manifold empirical adjustments for flow resistance reference is made to the literature říha et al 2018 3 research aims based on theoretical factors and the specific etsw procedure as applied after filter backwashing it is clear that in order to obtain a thorough understanding of the hydraulics of up flow filtration systems applied in full scale water treatment unit operation several goals must be met initially a more effective drag coefficient must be introduced to be able to visualise changes in drag for various velocities and temperatures the magnitudes of particle correction shape factors must be shown in fixed and fluidised state to demonstrate the degree of irregularity of considered granular material as well as to determine preferred particle orientation an applicable image analysis method must be developed in addition a hydraulic explanation must be offered for the effective etsw method for future optimisation purposes water throughput and operational time and to improve water quality 4 materials and methods 4 1 particle selection and physical properties for up flow filtration and fluidisation experiments rapid filtration sand grains were selected the particle density was determined using measured differential pressures and a laboratory pycnometer the hydraulic equivalent particle diameter dallavalle 1948 crittenden et al 2012 davis 2010 was calculated using the sieve diameters expressed in eq 5 5 d p d s 1 d s 2 where d s i is the sieve mesh diameter the dimensions of the particles were also determined by using imagej as a particle analyser ferreira and rasband 2012 for which a 4 188 g sample of filter sand was scanned on an a4 flatbed scanner at a resolution of 2400 dpi irregularly shaped particles in particular elongated parts tend to lie horizontally oriented imagej determines for each individual particle which pixel in the 2d image belongs to this particle for each particle the software determines some 34 size parameters such as equivalent circle diameter and equivalent ellipse dimensions with related morphological particle properties table 1 such as aspect ratio ferret diameter circularity and solidity statistical information such as mean range and frequency distribution can be determined from all these measurements the total mass and measured density were used to calculate the total volume of the particles assuming an ellipsoid based on length and width of the average of the 2d dimensions gives a pseudo 3d height as average value for all particles 4 2 hydraulic experimental set up filtration and expansion experiments were carried out at three locations in waternet s weesperkarspel drinking water pilot plant located in amsterdam the netherlands at the university of applied sciences utrecht the netherlands and at queen mary university of london united kingdom in all experiments locally produced drinking water was used the set up fig 1 consisted of a 4 m high transparent pvc pipe with an inner diameter of 57 mm water temperature was regulated with a boiler a cooler and a thermostat by recirculating water through a buffer vessel connected to a water reservoir an overflow at the top of the reactor returned water to the buffer vessel from the buffer vessel water was pumped through the reservoir connected to the thermostat which was set to a programmed water temperature through filtration and expansion experiments bed voidage and pressure drop were measured as a function of various linear fluid flow rates and temperatures hydraulic experiments were started in fixed bed state obtained after an initial backwash with full fluidisation which resembled the typical practical conditions of rapid sand and multimedia filters by increasing the flow rate the bed height was carefully observed and measured to determine any change in bed height and consequently average voidage by measuring the differential pressure the flow rate of the incipient fluidisation point was detected by further increasing the flow rate a sequence of bed voidages and differential pressures was measured to be able to compose an expansion curve based on acquired bed voidage differential pressure superficial fluid velocity particle size and kinematic fluid viscosity the drag coefficients were determined as presented in section 2 1 photographs of particles technical information about experimental set up devices and operational procedures can be found in the supplementary material sections 1 and 2 4 3 dynamic shape factor determination to investigate the variability of the particle shape factor the ratio of the measured drag coefficient f l and the drag coefficient for carman kozeny f l c k using eq 2 was calculated we hypothesised that this ratio would depend on the hydraulic state i e on the ratio r e ε r e ε m f of the actual modified particle reynolds number eq 3 and that for incipient fluidisation inverting the carman kozeny equation for the measured voidage velocity and viscosity it was possible to estimate the average particle size accordingly a dynamic shape factor could be determined for various flow rates using a numerical solving method based on bolzano s numerical intermediate value theorem this is a straightforward solving method described in apostol 1967 a simplified equation states 6 ϕ s f l c k f l where f l c k is the dimensionless drag coefficient laminar representation for carman kozeny 5 results and discussion 5 1 particle properties samples of rsf granules were obtained from a full scale rsf unit operation located at the waternet facility in loenderveen the netherlands the applied filter sand range see fig 2 was obtained by using sieves of 0 80 and 1 25 mm this was confirmed by sieving with 10 sieves between 0 6 2 8 mm nen en 933 2 n d showing that 10 wt of the particles were smaller and 1 wt were larger than this range which corresponds to a respective 20 and 1 in terms of the number of particles we measured an average particle diameter of d 50 0 90 mm based on particle counting the full colour scan obtained from the a4 flatbed scanner was initially converted into a single colour picture for maximum particle distinction from which a binary black and white picture was created with a pixel size of around 0 01 mm 2400 dpi the size of each black particle was measured through pixel counting observed particles with their particle numbers can be shown as outlines on top of the original scan see fig 3 the 4 188 g sample contained 2040 particles each analysed by its size shape and other morphological properties in imagej figs 4 and 5 show the measured distribution and cumulative frequency respectively of observed equivalent particle diameter the green areas indicate the specification of the filter material based on information from the supplier of the two sieves bottom sieve and top sieve the projected area per particle determined with imagej was used to obtain the equivalent diameter of a circle resembling the basics of square sieve grids as illustrated in fig 4 giving the exact contours per particle allows for the calculation of an equivalent ellipse with the same area for each particle giving two independent diameters d 50 of 1 57 and 1 21 mm on average with an aspect ratio of 1 30 assuming that an ellipsoid with these two axes has the same volume as the average particle gives the third diameter of 0 78 mm this dimension explains the sieve passage as particles are passing sieves in an upright orientation contrary to the scanned particles lying in a horizontal orientation fig 5 illustrates how smaller particles are obtained which did not pass through the lowest sieve with the smallest mesh size probably as a result of short sieving time in contrast hardly any larger particles were found since they did not pass through the top sieve with the largest mesh size fig 5 also shows that the particles are not perfect spheres as a sieve curve would suggest but that they are much better described as an ellipsoid with three distinct dimensions width height and length in sum it can be concluded that the analysed rsf grains are moderately irregularly shaped and far from spherical in the next section it will become clear why this information is important in relation to decreasing bed resistance for increasing flow rates particle analysis using flatbed scans with pseudo 3d image processing is superior to 1d sieve analyses the determined particle properties of rsf grains are presented in table 2 in industrial practice samples of granules are still commonly sieved to obtain information about the particle size distribution for process monitoring with this method the morphological properties of the particles are lost however as irregularly shaped particles and rod like particles in particular can realign and pass to lower sieves this gives a distorted view of the actual particle sizes the easily acquired particle information i e average particle size is entered accordingly into the drag coefficient or voidage prediction model in practice this classical method works well for spherical particles but it is less accurate for irregularly shaped particles such as rsf grains fig 2 irregularly shaped particles experience anisotropic drag in fixed and fluidised state due to the surrounding fluid and interactions with adjacent particles and the wall mahajan et al 2018 5 2 hydraulic experiments and expansion curves the hydraulic experiments we conducted provided crucial information about differential pressure and bed height in fixed incipient and fluidised states as a function of linear flow rates and water temperatures in total eight up flow experiments were conducted for rsf grains at six different water temperatures 6 29 c additional expansion experiments were performed at seven different water temperatures 5 36 c to determine the minimum or incipient fluidisation points causing the first particles to expand as well as allowing the precise expansion behaviour of rsf grains to be determined for up flow filtration the fluid flow was gradually increased until the incipient fluidisation point was reached where the differential pressure levelled at a maximum value for moderate fluidised state the fluid flow was slightly further increased under constant maximum differential pressure the expansion curve for rsf grains is presented in fig 6 the measured voidage in fixed bed state varies between ε 0 0 44 0 03 the voidage at the minimum fluidisation velocity is ε m f 0 45 0 01 fig 6 shows the expansion behaviour of rsf grains in the fluidised state the measured bed voidages at various water temperatures agree reasonably well with the predicted values according to the carman kozeny model the influence of the water temperature in the fluidised state can be seen in fig 7 the temperature effect in the fixed bed state was less clearly observable fig 6 a moderate linear relationship r2 0 99 between the degree of subsidence of the packed bed and water temperature 5 35 c was found δ ε ε 0 0001 t 0 008 the temperature dependence of the bed setting is caused by the changes in viscosity of water which affects the frictional forces acting on the filter bed experimental data tabulation section 9 minimum fluidisation points section 5 and model predictions section 3 are given in the supplementary material 5 3 measured and predicted drag coefficients the drag coefficient against the modified reynolds number r e ε for rsf grains is presented in turbulent representation f t in fig 8 and in laminar representation f l in fig 9 in both figures the kozeny and carman eq 2 drag relations are plotted fig 8 shows a clear deviation between the measured and predicted values for low reynolds numbers r e ε 10 in most other literature references burke and plummer 1928 carman 1937 ergun 1952 gibilaro 2001 bird et al 2007 hoyland 2017 such deviations between measurements and drag models are artificially hidden by the use of logarithmic scales over several orders of magnitude for relatively high reynolds numbers r e ε 10 the predicted carman values coincide relatively well with the measured values for low reynolds numbers especially r e ε 5 the measured f l values are significantly larger than the theoretically expected f l 180 corresponding to the kozeny pore shape factor k 180 the laminar representation of f l makes changes in drag much more concise compared to the commonly used turbulent representation of f t fig 9 clearly shows that the drag decreases considerably in case the fluid flow increases slightly under laminar or transitional conditions this is happening while the particles are still assumed to be packed in the fixed bed state more information about the carman model can be found in the supplementary material sections 3 to show explicitly that the drag decreases mainly in the supposedly fixed bed the ratio of measured to predicted drag f l f l c k is plotted against the reynolds number ratio r e ε r e ε m f in fig 10 for increasing flow rates where r e ε r e ε m f is still well below 1 the ratio f l f l c k decreases rapidly for every percent that the bed voidage drops the drag coefficient f l decreases by a factor 4 the large ratio of measured to predicted drag occurs at r e ε r e ε m f 0 5 which indicates that it cannot be explained by effects occurring around v m f this will be investigated further in the next subsection a practical approach is to use a particle shape factor to compensate for observed deviations in f l the use of a shape factor however becomes redundant in the fluidised state since the prediction of the voidage is increasingly consistent with the models for r e ε 10 in figs 9 and 10 we reiterate that the common use of two different shape factors in the literature for fixed beds ergun 1952 yang 2003 li et al 2018 and fluidised beds di felice 1995 gibilaro 2001 rhodes 2008 is remarkable because it concerns the same particles using eq 6 shape factors were calculated for rsf grains fig 11 shows that in the fixed bed state the particle shape factor varies between approximately 0 6 ϕ s 0 9 in the fluidised state however the shape factor slowly approaches ϕ s 1 5 4 hydraulic explanation for up flow filtration and etsw when a fluid flows in upward direction through a particle bed in fixed state the fluid exerts a certain drag on the particles the transition from a fixed bed to a fluidised bed occurs when the pressure drop across a packed bed reaches a constant maximum value after the fluid flow exceeds the minimum fluidisation velocity the particles start to elevate and irregularly shaped particles also show changing orientation realignment and rearrangement in their packing position during the pilot plant experiments the observed bed height decreased slightly approximately 1 which can be seen in fig 12 figs 13 and 14 videos of rsf grains kramer and van schaik 2020 as well as calcite pellets kramer et al 2020b at flow rates well below the minimum fluidisation points show clearly that particles already start to move locally while overall they remain in a fixed bed state the collapse of the packed bed caused by etsw is also demonstrated in four videos the collapse of the particles in the fixed beds below the incipient fluidisation point is most likely caused by particle orientation realignment and rearrangement in their packing position an unsteady packed bed in moderate up flow conditions is pseudo fixed and in a setting state this results in a decreasing bed voidage and simultaneously in a decreasing drag coefficient which seems quite contradictory however this can be explained by the collapse of local channels figs 15b and c in the bed leading to a more uniform flow distribution through the bed and improving the available surface for flow through hassett 1961 this is the reason why etsw as an additional method to a backwash filter recipe works effectively fig 15 since it levels the voidage in the particle bed in this way the successful etsw method proposed by amburgey 2005 can be explained during full scale operational etsw procedures small 1 10 mm spouting channels were observed this is shown in fig 15 b and fig 15 c the amount and intensity of spouts decreased during the procedure a plausible explanation is that the up flow filtration caused the channels to collapse in the bed leading to a more uniform flow distribution through the bed and improving the available surface for flow through we hypothesise that this phenomenon has a positive effect on water quality since the magnitude of turbidity and particle count spikes decrease therefore the successful optimisation etsw filter backwashing procedure proposed by amburgey 2005 can be explained hydraulically 5 5 preliminary considerations of hydraulics based etsw according to amburgey 2005 adjustments in fluid velocity should be limited to the minimal fluidisation velocity since this velocity depends on both the filter bed material and on water temperature optimising the up flow velocity could become complicated due to different packing materials and seasonal temperature fluctuations smaller rsf grains fluidise more easily compared to the larger rsf grains resulting in a gradual transition in other words because of differences in particle size the minimum fluidisation velocity cannot be determined exactly in the event that during etsw velocities occur that are too high the benefits of bed setting a more uniform flow distribution throughout the bed and better available surface for through flow are nullified therefore when optimising the etsw time it may be more important to focus on effective bed subsidence instead of focussing on incipient fluidisation amburgey 2005 assumed that at least one bed volume would be required to wash out remaining particles as we provide a hydraulic explanation for improved water quality this assumption does not need to apply therefore considering this hydraulic explanation the etsw time could potentially be shortened to less than one bed volume this would decrease down time due to backwashing and increase up time filtration time as breakthrough at restart will be significantly reduced or even eliminated with regard to water quality and costs the elimination of breakthrough at restart will improve the overall bulk quality of the produced water increase the total volume produced in between backwashes and subsequently save overall production costs in practice the first half hour of filtration after backwashing is discarded as this contains the highest concentrations of remaining particulates and contamination 5 6 full scale consequences of utilising the etsw procedure turbidity is a measure of the amount of particulate matter in water and is one of the most widely used parameters for measuring water quality prior to disinfection edzwald 2011 high turbidity levels can reduce disinfection capacity adequate turbidity removal implies the partial removal of pathogens in water lechevallier et al 1991 since most pathogens tend to aggregate with particles before 2016 at the full scale rsf in loenderveen the netherlands considerable turbidity spikes were detected in the first filtrate after backwash cycles after a backwash cycle had been completed and the filter returned to operational mode the turbidity of the first filtrate was measured in four filters fig 16 after approximately 30 min the turbidity increased from 0 2 ftu up to 1 3 ftu a similar elevated pattern could be seen for bacterial levels enterococci n 4 10 l e coli n 14 10 l and traces of sulphite reducing clostridia n 103 10 l the who world health organization 2017 promotes a turbidity threshold of below 0 2 ntu accordingly an optimisation process has been started at the full scale facility in loenderveen to improve water quality by reducing bacterial breakthroughs the goal was to decrease the concentrations of bacteria to improve the oxidation and disinfection efficiency in the ozonation unit operation down stream van der helm 2007 the etsw procedure was initialised on the full scale facilities additional to the standard backwash procedure furthermore we investigated whether it was desirable to remove the first filtrate for approximately three hours after the etsw procedure was utilised turbidity spikes in the first filtrates were excluded fig 17 in favour of water quality 6 conclusions our experiments showed that irregularly shaped particles such as rsf grains in fixed beds under moderate up flow conditions show non monotonous hydraulic behaviour related to changing orientation realignment and rearrangement in particle packing position this happens in such a manner that the bed offers the maximum flow passage i e voidage to the fluid initially the bed voidage the flow through interface available in the bed as well the drag decrease and accordingly increase for larger fluid flows these phenomena also affect the volume based voidage prediction something that to the best of our knowledge has not been elucidated in the literature in the field of engineering a shape factor is applied to compensate for the above aspect in the fixed and incipient fluidisation but is omitted when the fluidised state is described in this research it was shown that such a shape factor is not a constant particle property but is dependent on the fluid properties as well this dynamic shape factor for irregularly shaped rsf grains increases from approximately 0 6 until 1 0 in fairly fluidised state the use of constant shape factors regarding natural irregularly shaped granules is therefore not recommended our new straightforward image analysis method based on a weighted particle sample to estimate the mean measures of spheroids shows that sieve measures are not representative of natural irregularly shaped granules based on experimental data obtained in this work it is shown that for increasing fluid flow rates the fixed bed voidage decreases slightly approximately 1 while the drag coefficients decline to a considerable degree the drag coefficient reached values up to 450 in laminar representation which is considerably larger than the well known kozeny value of 180 the reduction in bed voidage as well as bed resistance is due to the realignment of the particles in the packed bed and the collapse of flow channels created during a normal backwash procedure particle orientation realignment and rearrangement implies unstable fixed beds that become denser in laminar up flow conditions this results in a decreasing bed voidage and simultaneously in a decreasing drag coefficient a complete fluidised state i e exceeding the minimum fluidisation velocity is not necessary in addition besides the particle size also the particle shape is a decisive factor in the phenomena occurring in the particle beds the collapse of local channels in the bed leads to a more uniform flow distribution through the bed and improves the available surface for flow through in this way the successful etsw method proposed by amburgey 2005 can be explained 7 recommendations with the knowledge acquired during these experiments the etsw procedure can in future research be further optimised by adjustments to the up flow velocity and time during our experiments it was possible to capture the almost unnoticeable changes in the particle bed on video in a full scale installation real time monitoring of the particle collapse in the rapid sand filter bed is practically impossible thorough pilot plant research is required to fully understand the specific processes of a particular water treatment every water treatment plant has a different context i e water quality load of particulate material bed composition different process strategies and different water temperatures since the configuration of the particles in the packed filter bed is generated by frictional forces it is recommended to investigate alternative methods that include frictional forces so that subsidence can take place although filter resting could also be a solution to acquire bed setting and prevent the first filtrate turbidity spike after the backwash expansion it reduces the operational up time in order to extend the hydraulic impact discussed here to an even more effective etsw a model to predict the permeability and bed setting of the filter bed needs to be further substantiated and developed to be able to optimise the etsw procedure the newly proposed pseudo 3d imagej analysis method can be used for future cfd modelling research

17036,fluid flow through a bed of solid particles is an important process that occurs in full scale water treatment operations the carman kozeny model remains highly popular for estimating the resistance across the bed it is common practice to use particle shape factors in fixed bed state to match the predicted drag coefficient with experimentally obtained drag coefficients in fluidised state however where the same particles are considered this particle shape factor is usually simply omitted from the model without providing appropriate reasoning in this research it is shown that a shape factor is not a constant particle property but is dependent on the fluid properties as well this dynamic shape factor for irregularly shaped grains increases from approximately 0 6 to 1 0 in fluidised state we found that unstable packed beds in moderate up flow conditions are pseudo fixed and in a setting state this results in a decreasing bed voidage and simultaneously in a decreasing drag coefficient which seems quite contradictory this can be explained by the collapse of local channels in the bed leading to a more uniform flow distribution through the bed and improving the available surface for flow through our experimental measurements show that the drag coefficient decreases considerably in the laminar and transition regions this is most likely caused by particle orientation realignment and rearrangement in particles packing position a thorough hydraulic analysis shows that up flow filtration in rapid sand filters under backwash conditions causes the particle bed to collapse almost imperceptibly in addition an improved expression of the drag coefficient demonstrated that the carman kozeny model constant however often assumed to be constant is in fact not constant for increasing flow rates furthermore we propose a new pseudo 3d image analysis for particles with an irregular shape in this way we can explain the successful method using optimisation of the extended terminal sub fluidisation wash etsw filter backwashing procedure in which turbidity and peaks in the number of particles are reduced with a positive effect on water quality graphical

rsf rapid sand filtration who world health organisation 1 introduction the downward flow of fluid through a bed of solid particles is an important process that occurs in full scale water treatment operations crittenden et al 2012 in the field of drinking water treatment rapid sand filtration rsf is the most common unit operation applied to capture fine particles from the water in the filter bed accumulated particles cause a gradual increase in head loss and reduce overall effectiveness of the filter bed howe et al 2012 when the head loss exceeds a certain threshold after a period of time the filter is backwashed usually assisted by some auxiliary scouring during backwashing an upward water flow expands the filter bed and flushes out the collected fine particles after a filtration and backwashing sequence the cycle starts again edzwald 2011 to reduce the passage of particles through restarted filters immediately after a backwash procedure amburgey proposed the extended terminal sub fluidisation wash method etsw to remove significantly higher amounts of backwash remnant particles amburgey 2005 etsw is a proven method of terminating the backwash cycle with a sub fluidisation wash for a time interval adequate to pass one theoretical filter volume of water upward through the filter amburgey and amirtharajah 2005 etsw is a relatively straightforward process comprising an appropriate additional sub fluidisation wash step at the end of a normal backwash procedure the etsw washing phase is started at the end of the backwash sequence with the purpose of rinsing out the remainder of the particles sheared from the filter during the fluidisation stage of the backwash the estw is set to a wash water flow rate below the minimum fluidisation velocity for a time sufficient to displace one entire filter volume of particle laden water the results presented by amburgey 2005 show a significant improvement in water quality by reducing or eliminating the initial particle passage during the restart of a packed filter after backwashing etsw reduces the turbidity during filter maturation and particle number spikes in practice but no hydraulic explanation for its effectiveness was provided in this paper we report laboratory measurements in which up flow filtration procedures were simulated during the experiments an unexpected reduction in both bed voidage and bed resistance was detected which could not be explained by traditional drag coefficient correlations as a function of the particle reynolds number we propose this can be explained by differences in preferred orientation of particles under different hydraulic conditions 2 hydraulic drag 2 1 hydraulic models for fluid flow in particle beds well known hydraulic models for flow through particle beds have been introduced for the laminar flow regime by blake 1922 and kozeny 1927 based on darcy 1856 for the turbulent flow regime by burke and plummer 1928 and for the transitional flow regime by ergun 1952 and carman 1937 based on the forchheimer flow conditions forchheimer 1930 in the laminar regime the fluid flows in smooth parallel layers without any disturbance between the layers while in the turbulent flow regime the fluid undergoes irregular fluctuations and changes in both magnitude and direction transitional flow is a mixture of laminar and turbulent flow with turbulence in the centre of pore spaces and laminar flow near the particle surfaces each of these flows behaves in different ways in terms of their frictional energy loss de facto the most commonly used and most accurate říha et al 2018 equation for expressing the relationship between permeability and voidage particle size and tortuosity is the carman kozeny equation this equation is applied in various fields such as groundwater flow water treatment and many other water processes camp 1946 the carman kozeny equation is important not only for the determination of permeability in porous media yang 2003 but also for the estimation of the voidage in a fluidised bed kramer et al 2020a in groundwater flow the flow regime is generally considered to be laminar crittenden et al 2012 in fluidised beds however not only laminar but also transitional and to a certain degree turbulent flow regimes occur the resistance of laminar flow through a granular bed can be calculated using the well known equation proposed by blake 1922 kozeny 1927 and carman 1937 1 δ p δ l 180 v s η d p 2 1 ε 2 ε 3 r e ε 2 where δ p δ l is the pressure drop head loss v s is the superficial velocity η the dynamic fluid viscosity d p the average or equivalent particle diameter ε the bed voidage and r e ϵ the modified particle reynolds number eq 3 this equation shows that the resistance of laminar flow is linear with the viscosity and with the superficial velocity as is also known to be the case for laminar flow through pipes according to hagen poiseuille munson et al 2020 and laminar flow through aquifers darcy 1856 the experimentally obtained value of 180 is often indicated as the kozeny drag coefficient kozeny 1927 further background information about the carman equation is elucidated in the supplementary material section 3 since in water treatment the operational field lies in the vicinity of incipient fluidisation and since turbulent flow regimes are exceptional there is a preference for using the carman kozeny drag relation kozeny proposed a fixed pore shape factor k 180 in eq 1 to fit the model results to experimental data in the literature many other values are proposed ozgumus et al 2014 erdim et al 2015 hoyland 2017 schulz et al 2019 of which k 150 is also often used burke and plummer 1928 ergun 1952 kramer et al 2020a the factor 180 does not appear to be constant at higher velocities when the flow is no longer laminar r e ε 2 as carman 1937 showed he introduced a drag coefficient which can be written in the laminar form f l or in the turbulent form f t as a function of the reynolds number r e ε 2 f l f t r e ε 180 2 9 r e ε 0 9 r e ε 600 where f l is the dimensionless drag coefficient laminar representation and f t the dimensionless drag coefficient turbulent representation and where the modified particle reynolds number r e ε is defined as 3 r e ε ρ f d p v s η 1 1 ε where ρ f is the fluid density the experimentally obtained relation for f l or f t will be indicated below as the carman drag coefficient carman 1937 for further background information on the many forms of this equation reference is made to the literature erdim et al 2015 and model derivations given in the supplementary material section 3 2 2 particle correction shape factors within hydraulic modelling particles are often idealised to spheres for mathematical convenience water treatment related particles generally have more complex geometric features summarised under the term shape including the geometric shape the presence of surface disparities such as protuberances and re entrant features as well as particle property irregularities shape is therefore difficult to define although the literature on particle shape is extensive gauvin and katta 1973 holdich 2002 seville and yu 2016 and a number of shape factors and descriptors have been proposed clift et al 1978 allen 1990 there is no universal agreement on how to define particle shape therefore there is no agreement on how to correctly measure it nor does the literature provide consistent methods to cope with naturally irregularly shaped particles that can be used in voidage prediction models for liquid solid fluidisation systems the size and shape of the particles has important implications for for instance filter design crittenden et al 2012 but there is no easy way to account for this in the literature wadell 1933 cleasby et al 1981 michaelide et al 2017 particle shape is often characterised by sphericity which is generally defined as the ratio of the surface area of an equal volume sphere to the surface area of the granule that being said sphericity has limited value in actual practice for several reasons first filter media are currently still routinely measured and specified using a laborious sieve analysis procedure and less by means of advanced image analysis techniques second in the literature there is no general consensus on how to apply sphericity for commercially available granular media if the particle has a known geometric shape sphericity can be calculated mathematically however for irregularly shaped particles indirect methods are required to determine shape factors several empirical fitting models are available dharmarajah 1982 often these models are based on head loss or voidage experiments carman 1937 proposed that the k value was independent of media properties and introduced a correction factor to account for the non spherical nature of filter grains using sphericity and the shape factor fair et al 1933 according to yang 2003 shape factors are open to criticism because a range of granules with different shapes may have the same shape factor which is inevitable if complex shapes are to be described by only a single parameter wen and yu 1966 proposed shape factor corrections used in the ergun equation based on experimental data for the minimum fluidisation voidage according to the literature dharmarajah 1982 crittenden et al 2012 a commonly used particle shape factor in fixed bed state is necessary in order to match the carman kozeny predicted drag coefficient with the experimentally obtained drag coefficient the main drawback of this approach is that the model parameters often have no direct connection to the underlying porous medium structure schulz et al 2019 do not have a physical interpretation or are difficult or even impossible to measure especially by means of sieve analysis di felice 1995 in contrast in the fluidised state particle shape factors are usually omitted to match the carman kozeny predicted drag coefficient with the experimentally obtained drag coefficient without providing any explanation most likely this is done because these parameters are difficult to measure directly de jong and nomden 1974 hoyland 2017 hunce et al 2018 this is remarkable at the very least since the same particles are involved in fixed as well as fluidised states in addition particle shape factors as a function of fluid velocity and temperature in liquid solid fluidised systems are rarely evaluated in the literature in the practice of filtration crittenden et al 2012 and other forms of flow through granular beds the measured resistance does not appear to correspond with the calculated resistance to obtain a fit an experimentally determined shape factor ϕ s is used to modify the measured diameter d into an effective diameter d p 4 d p ϕ s d where d is the measured diameter and ϕ s the diameter shape correction factor for further background information on the manifold empirical adjustments for flow resistance reference is made to the literature říha et al 2018 3 research aims based on theoretical factors and the specific etsw procedure as applied after filter backwashing it is clear that in order to obtain a thorough understanding of the hydraulics of up flow filtration systems applied in full scale water treatment unit operation several goals must be met initially a more effective drag coefficient must be introduced to be able to visualise changes in drag for various velocities and temperatures the magnitudes of particle correction shape factors must be shown in fixed and fluidised state to demonstrate the degree of irregularity of considered granular material as well as to determine preferred particle orientation an applicable image analysis method must be developed in addition a hydraulic explanation must be offered for the effective etsw method for future optimisation purposes water throughput and operational time and to improve water quality 4 materials and methods 4 1 particle selection and physical properties for up flow filtration and fluidisation experiments rapid filtration sand grains were selected the particle density was determined using measured differential pressures and a laboratory pycnometer the hydraulic equivalent particle diameter dallavalle 1948 crittenden et al 2012 davis 2010 was calculated using the sieve diameters expressed in eq 5 5 d p d s 1 d s 2 where d s i is the sieve mesh diameter the dimensions of the particles were also determined by using imagej as a particle analyser ferreira and rasband 2012 for which a 4 188 g sample of filter sand was scanned on an a4 flatbed scanner at a resolution of 2400 dpi irregularly shaped particles in particular elongated parts tend to lie horizontally oriented imagej determines for each individual particle which pixel in the 2d image belongs to this particle for each particle the software determines some 34 size parameters such as equivalent circle diameter and equivalent ellipse dimensions with related morphological particle properties table 1 such as aspect ratio ferret diameter circularity and solidity statistical information such as mean range and frequency distribution can be determined from all these measurements the total mass and measured density were used to calculate the total volume of the particles assuming an ellipsoid based on length and width of the average of the 2d dimensions gives a pseudo 3d height as average value for all particles 4 2 hydraulic experimental set up filtration and expansion experiments were carried out at three locations in waternet s weesperkarspel drinking water pilot plant located in amsterdam the netherlands at the university of applied sciences utrecht the netherlands and at queen mary university of london united kingdom in all experiments locally produced drinking water was used the set up fig 1 consisted of a 4 m high transparent pvc pipe with an inner diameter of 57 mm water temperature was regulated with a boiler a cooler and a thermostat by recirculating water through a buffer vessel connected to a water reservoir an overflow at the top of the reactor returned water to the buffer vessel from the buffer vessel water was pumped through the reservoir connected to the thermostat which was set to a programmed water temperature through filtration and expansion experiments bed voidage and pressure drop were measured as a function of various linear fluid flow rates and temperatures hydraulic experiments were started in fixed bed state obtained after an initial backwash with full fluidisation which resembled the typical practical conditions of rapid sand and multimedia filters by increasing the flow rate the bed height was carefully observed and measured to determine any change in bed height and consequently average voidage by measuring the differential pressure the flow rate of the incipient fluidisation point was detected by further increasing the flow rate a sequence of bed voidages and differential pressures was measured to be able to compose an expansion curve based on acquired bed voidage differential pressure superficial fluid velocity particle size and kinematic fluid viscosity the drag coefficients were determined as presented in section 2 1 photographs of particles technical information about experimental set up devices and operational procedures can be found in the supplementary material sections 1 and 2 4 3 dynamic shape factor determination to investigate the variability of the particle shape factor the ratio of the measured drag coefficient f l and the drag coefficient for carman kozeny f l c k using eq 2 was calculated we hypothesised that this ratio would depend on the hydraulic state i e on the ratio r e ε r e ε m f of the actual modified particle reynolds number eq 3 and that for incipient fluidisation inverting the carman kozeny equation for the measured voidage velocity and viscosity it was possible to estimate the average particle size accordingly a dynamic shape factor could be determined for various flow rates using a numerical solving method based on bolzano s numerical intermediate value theorem this is a straightforward solving method described in apostol 1967 a simplified equation states 6 ϕ s f l c k f l where f l c k is the dimensionless drag coefficient laminar representation for carman kozeny 5 results and discussion 5 1 particle properties samples of rsf granules were obtained from a full scale rsf unit operation located at the waternet facility in loenderveen the netherlands the applied filter sand range see fig 2 was obtained by using sieves of 0 80 and 1 25 mm this was confirmed by sieving with 10 sieves between 0 6 2 8 mm nen en 933 2 n d showing that 10 wt of the particles were smaller and 1 wt were larger than this range which corresponds to a respective 20 and 1 in terms of the number of particles we measured an average particle diameter of d 50 0 90 mm based on particle counting the full colour scan obtained from the a4 flatbed scanner was initially converted into a single colour picture for maximum particle distinction from which a binary black and white picture was created with a pixel size of around 0 01 mm 2400 dpi the size of each black particle was measured through pixel counting observed particles with their particle numbers can be shown as outlines on top of the original scan see fig 3 the 4 188 g sample contained 2040 particles each analysed by its size shape and other morphological properties in imagej figs 4 and 5 show the measured distribution and cumulative frequency respectively of observed equivalent particle diameter the green areas indicate the specification of the filter material based on information from the supplier of the two sieves bottom sieve and top sieve the projected area per particle determined with imagej was used to obtain the equivalent diameter of a circle resembling the basics of square sieve grids as illustrated in fig 4 giving the exact contours per particle allows for the calculation of an equivalent ellipse with the same area for each particle giving two independent diameters d 50 of 1 57 and 1 21 mm on average with an aspect ratio of 1 30 assuming that an ellipsoid with these two axes has the same volume as the average particle gives the third diameter of 0 78 mm this dimension explains the sieve passage as particles are passing sieves in an upright orientation contrary to the scanned particles lying in a horizontal orientation fig 5 illustrates how smaller particles are obtained which did not pass through the lowest sieve with the smallest mesh size probably as a result of short sieving time in contrast hardly any larger particles were found since they did not pass through the top sieve with the largest mesh size fig 5 also shows that the particles are not perfect spheres as a sieve curve would suggest but that they are much better described as an ellipsoid with three distinct dimensions width height and length in sum it can be concluded that the analysed rsf grains are moderately irregularly shaped and far from spherical in the next section it will become clear why this information is important in relation to decreasing bed resistance for increasing flow rates particle analysis using flatbed scans with pseudo 3d image processing is superior to 1d sieve analyses the determined particle properties of rsf grains are presented in table 2 in industrial practice samples of granules are still commonly sieved to obtain information about the particle size distribution for process monitoring with this method the morphological properties of the particles are lost however as irregularly shaped particles and rod like particles in particular can realign and pass to lower sieves this gives a distorted view of the actual particle sizes the easily acquired particle information i e average particle size is entered accordingly into the drag coefficient or voidage prediction model in practice this classical method works well for spherical particles but it is less accurate for irregularly shaped particles such as rsf grains fig 2 irregularly shaped particles experience anisotropic drag in fixed and fluidised state due to the surrounding fluid and interactions with adjacent particles and the wall mahajan et al 2018 5 2 hydraulic experiments and expansion curves the hydraulic experiments we conducted provided crucial information about differential pressure and bed height in fixed incipient and fluidised states as a function of linear flow rates and water temperatures in total eight up flow experiments were conducted for rsf grains at six different water temperatures 6 29 c additional expansion experiments were performed at seven different water temperatures 5 36 c to determine the minimum or incipient fluidisation points causing the first particles to expand as well as allowing the precise expansion behaviour of rsf grains to be determined for up flow filtration the fluid flow was gradually increased until the incipient fluidisation point was reached where the differential pressure levelled at a maximum value for moderate fluidised state the fluid flow was slightly further increased under constant maximum differential pressure the expansion curve for rsf grains is presented in fig 6 the measured voidage in fixed bed state varies between ε 0 0 44 0 03 the voidage at the minimum fluidisation velocity is ε m f 0 45 0 01 fig 6 shows the expansion behaviour of rsf grains in the fluidised state the measured bed voidages at various water temperatures agree reasonably well with the predicted values according to the carman kozeny model the influence of the water temperature in the fluidised state can be seen in fig 7 the temperature effect in the fixed bed state was less clearly observable fig 6 a moderate linear relationship r2 0 99 between the degree of subsidence of the packed bed and water temperature 5 35 c was found δ ε ε 0 0001 t 0 008 the temperature dependence of the bed setting is caused by the changes in viscosity of water which affects the frictional forces acting on the filter bed experimental data tabulation section 9 minimum fluidisation points section 5 and model predictions section 3 are given in the supplementary material 5 3 measured and predicted drag coefficients the drag coefficient against the modified reynolds number r e ε for rsf grains is presented in turbulent representation f t in fig 8 and in laminar representation f l in fig 9 in both figures the kozeny and carman eq 2 drag relations are plotted fig 8 shows a clear deviation between the measured and predicted values for low reynolds numbers r e ε 10 in most other literature references burke and plummer 1928 carman 1937 ergun 1952 gibilaro 2001 bird et al 2007 hoyland 2017 such deviations between measurements and drag models are artificially hidden by the use of logarithmic scales over several orders of magnitude for relatively high reynolds numbers r e ε 10 the predicted carman values coincide relatively well with the measured values for low reynolds numbers especially r e ε 5 the measured f l values are significantly larger than the theoretically expected f l 180 corresponding to the kozeny pore shape factor k 180 the laminar representation of f l makes changes in drag much more concise compared to the commonly used turbulent representation of f t fig 9 clearly shows that the drag decreases considerably in case the fluid flow increases slightly under laminar or transitional conditions this is happening while the particles are still assumed to be packed in the fixed bed state more information about the carman model can be found in the supplementary material sections 3 to show explicitly that the drag decreases mainly in the supposedly fixed bed the ratio of measured to predicted drag f l f l c k is plotted against the reynolds number ratio r e ε r e ε m f in fig 10 for increasing flow rates where r e ε r e ε m f is still well below 1 the ratio f l f l c k decreases rapidly for every percent that the bed voidage drops the drag coefficient f l decreases by a factor 4 the large ratio of measured to predicted drag occurs at r e ε r e ε m f 0 5 which indicates that it cannot be explained by effects occurring around v m f this will be investigated further in the next subsection a practical approach is to use a particle shape factor to compensate for observed deviations in f l the use of a shape factor however becomes redundant in the fluidised state since the prediction of the voidage is increasingly consistent with the models for r e ε 10 in figs 9 and 10 we reiterate that the common use of two different shape factors in the literature for fixed beds ergun 1952 yang 2003 li et al 2018 and fluidised beds di felice 1995 gibilaro 2001 rhodes 2008 is remarkable because it concerns the same particles using eq 6 shape factors were calculated for rsf grains fig 11 shows that in the fixed bed state the particle shape factor varies between approximately 0 6 ϕ s 0 9 in the fluidised state however the shape factor slowly approaches ϕ s 1 5 4 hydraulic explanation for up flow filtration and etsw when a fluid flows in upward direction through a particle bed in fixed state the fluid exerts a certain drag on the particles the transition from a fixed bed to a fluidised bed occurs when the pressure drop across a packed bed reaches a constant maximum value after the fluid flow exceeds the minimum fluidisation velocity the particles start to elevate and irregularly shaped particles also show changing orientation realignment and rearrangement in their packing position during the pilot plant experiments the observed bed height decreased slightly approximately 1 which can be seen in fig 12 figs 13 and 14 videos of rsf grains kramer and van schaik 2020 as well as calcite pellets kramer et al 2020b at flow rates well below the minimum fluidisation points show clearly that particles already start to move locally while overall they remain in a fixed bed state the collapse of the packed bed caused by etsw is also demonstrated in four videos the collapse of the particles in the fixed beds below the incipient fluidisation point is most likely caused by particle orientation realignment and rearrangement in their packing position an unsteady packed bed in moderate up flow conditions is pseudo fixed and in a setting state this results in a decreasing bed voidage and simultaneously in a decreasing drag coefficient which seems quite contradictory however this can be explained by the collapse of local channels figs 15b and c in the bed leading to a more uniform flow distribution through the bed and improving the available surface for flow through hassett 1961 this is the reason why etsw as an additional method to a backwash filter recipe works effectively fig 15 since it levels the voidage in the particle bed in this way the successful etsw method proposed by amburgey 2005 can be explained during full scale operational etsw procedures small 1 10 mm spouting channels were observed this is shown in fig 15 b and fig 15 c the amount and intensity of spouts decreased during the procedure a plausible explanation is that the up flow filtration caused the channels to collapse in the bed leading to a more uniform flow distribution through the bed and improving the available surface for flow through we hypothesise that this phenomenon has a positive effect on water quality since the magnitude of turbidity and particle count spikes decrease therefore the successful optimisation etsw filter backwashing procedure proposed by amburgey 2005 can be explained hydraulically 5 5 preliminary considerations of hydraulics based etsw according to amburgey 2005 adjustments in fluid velocity should be limited to the minimal fluidisation velocity since this velocity depends on both the filter bed material and on water temperature optimising the up flow velocity could become complicated due to different packing materials and seasonal temperature fluctuations smaller rsf grains fluidise more easily compared to the larger rsf grains resulting in a gradual transition in other words because of differences in particle size the minimum fluidisation velocity cannot be determined exactly in the event that during etsw velocities occur that are too high the benefits of bed setting a more uniform flow distribution throughout the bed and better available surface for through flow are nullified therefore when optimising the etsw time it may be more important to focus on effective bed subsidence instead of focussing on incipient fluidisation amburgey 2005 assumed that at least one bed volume would be required to wash out remaining particles as we provide a hydraulic explanation for improved water quality this assumption does not need to apply therefore considering this hydraulic explanation the etsw time could potentially be shortened to less than one bed volume this would decrease down time due to backwashing and increase up time filtration time as breakthrough at restart will be significantly reduced or even eliminated with regard to water quality and costs the elimination of breakthrough at restart will improve the overall bulk quality of the produced water increase the total volume produced in between backwashes and subsequently save overall production costs in practice the first half hour of filtration after backwashing is discarded as this contains the highest concentrations of remaining particulates and contamination 5 6 full scale consequences of utilising the etsw procedure turbidity is a measure of the amount of particulate matter in water and is one of the most widely used parameters for measuring water quality prior to disinfection edzwald 2011 high turbidity levels can reduce disinfection capacity adequate turbidity removal implies the partial removal of pathogens in water lechevallier et al 1991 since most pathogens tend to aggregate with particles before 2016 at the full scale rsf in loenderveen the netherlands considerable turbidity spikes were detected in the first filtrate after backwash cycles after a backwash cycle had been completed and the filter returned to operational mode the turbidity of the first filtrate was measured in four filters fig 16 after approximately 30 min the turbidity increased from 0 2 ftu up to 1 3 ftu a similar elevated pattern could be seen for bacterial levels enterococci n 4 10 l e coli n 14 10 l and traces of sulphite reducing clostridia n 103 10 l the who world health organization 2017 promotes a turbidity threshold of below 0 2 ntu accordingly an optimisation process has been started at the full scale facility in loenderveen to improve water quality by reducing bacterial breakthroughs the goal was to decrease the concentrations of bacteria to improve the oxidation and disinfection efficiency in the ozonation unit operation down stream van der helm 2007 the etsw procedure was initialised on the full scale facilities additional to the standard backwash procedure furthermore we investigated whether it was desirable to remove the first filtrate for approximately three hours after the etsw procedure was utilised turbidity spikes in the first filtrates were excluded fig 17 in favour of water quality 6 conclusions our experiments showed that irregularly shaped particles such as rsf grains in fixed beds under moderate up flow conditions show non monotonous hydraulic behaviour related to changing orientation realignment and rearrangement in particle packing position this happens in such a manner that the bed offers the maximum flow passage i e voidage to the fluid initially the bed voidage the flow through interface available in the bed as well the drag decrease and accordingly increase for larger fluid flows these phenomena also affect the volume based voidage prediction something that to the best of our knowledge has not been elucidated in the literature in the field of engineering a shape factor is applied to compensate for the above aspect in the fixed and incipient fluidisation but is omitted when the fluidised state is described in this research it was shown that such a shape factor is not a constant particle property but is dependent on the fluid properties as well this dynamic shape factor for irregularly shaped rsf grains increases from approximately 0 6 until 1 0 in fairly fluidised state the use of constant shape factors regarding natural irregularly shaped granules is therefore not recommended our new straightforward image analysis method based on a weighted particle sample to estimate the mean measures of spheroids shows that sieve measures are not representative of natural irregularly shaped granules based on experimental data obtained in this work it is shown that for increasing fluid flow rates the fixed bed voidage decreases slightly approximately 1 while the drag coefficients decline to a considerable degree the drag coefficient reached values up to 450 in laminar representation which is considerably larger than the well known kozeny value of 180 the reduction in bed voidage as well as bed resistance is due to the realignment of the particles in the packed bed and the collapse of flow channels created during a normal backwash procedure particle orientation realignment and rearrangement implies unstable fixed beds that become denser in laminar up flow conditions this results in a decreasing bed voidage and simultaneously in a decreasing drag coefficient a complete fluidised state i e exceeding the minimum fluidisation velocity is not necessary in addition besides the particle size also the particle shape is a decisive factor in the phenomena occurring in the particle beds the collapse of local channels in the bed leads to a more uniform flow distribution through the bed and improves the available surface for flow through in this way the successful etsw method proposed by amburgey 2005 can be explained 7 recommendations with the knowledge acquired during these experiments the etsw procedure can in future research be further optimised by adjustments to the up flow velocity and time during our experiments it was possible to capture the almost unnoticeable changes in the particle bed on video in a full scale installation real time monitoring of the particle collapse in the rapid sand filter bed is practically impossible thorough pilot plant research is required to fully understand the specific processes of a particular water treatment every water treatment plant has a different context i e water quality load of particulate material bed composition different process strategies and different water temperatures since the configuration of the particles in the packed filter bed is generated by frictional forces it is recommended to investigate alternative methods that include frictional forces so that subsidence can take place although filter resting could also be a solution to acquire bed setting and prevent the first filtrate turbidity spike after the backwash expansion it reduces the operational up time in order to extend the hydraulic impact discussed here to an even more effective etsw a model to predict the permeability and bed setting of the filter bed needs to be further substantiated and developed to be able to optimise the etsw procedure the newly proposed pseudo 3d imagej analysis method can be used for future cfd modelling research

17037,the oil water interface formed during an oil spill represents a challenging environment for pelagic communities living in aquatic ecosystems at this anoxic barrier we report the formation of a microbial hydrocarbonoclastic biofilm capable of electron transfer along the water column this biofilm generated a membrane of surface active compounds that allowed the spontaneous separation of electrical charges causing the establishment of an anodic and a cathodic region and as a result the spontaneous creation of a liquid microbial fuel cell such floating biofilm was connected to the water column underneath by floating filaments that could contribute to oxygen reduction at distance the filaments revealed an unusual lipid content induced by anoxic conditions with prominent ultrastructural features similar to myelin found in oligodendrocytes of the vertebrate nervous system furthermore these filaments showed an interesting cross reactivity towards different epitopes of the myelin basic protein mbp and claudin 11 o4 of human oligodendrocytes the presence of a network of filaments similar to myelin suggests the probable existence of evolutionary connections between very distant organisms collectively these results suggest a possible mechanism for how lake microbial communities can adapt to oil spills while offering an interesting starting point for technological developments of liquid microbial fuel cells related to the study of hydrocarbon water interfaces the data that support the findings of this study are openly available in figshare at https figshare com s 72bc73ae14011dc7920d graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction massive oil spills in natural waters have an immediate effect on oxygen levels in the water bodies due to the reduction in atmospheric gaseous exchange and lowered availability of light for phytoplankton especially in the euphotic zone williams and mann 2020 additionally oxygen under the water surface is consumed by microbial oxidation processes with a consequent slowdown in the degradation of hydrocarbon substances atlas 1995 although in these circumstances successional microbial communities of facultative aerobic or anaerobic hydrocarbonoclastic species can complete this degradation hazen et al 2010 gutierrez et al 2016 the creation of a zonal anoxic barrier in the ecosystem niches represents a challenge for oxygenotrophic species that must complete their oxidative processes bacterial biofilms are three dimensional structures that usually grow adherent to abiotic or biotic surfaces and represent an emerging issue in all environments flemming et al 2016 creating biofilm communities at oil spill sites could be a way to improve the microorganism s planktonic life moreover the matrix biofilm determines an efficient milieu for hydrocarbon degradation wherein microbes are capable of protecting themselves from environmental stress and enhances their ability to adapt decho 2000 the biofilm growth beneath hydrocarbon substances seems to be associated with the ability of these bacteria to detect at the level of the hydrocarbon water interface the bioavailability of nutrients which constitute a source of carbon and energy klein et al 2010 although the existence of biofilm at the hydrocarbon water interface is documented klein et al 2010 there is currently no experimental evidence on how these aquatic communities are structured to cope with the anoxic barriers that are usually produced during hydrocarbon degradation moreover it is not known how hydrocarbonoclastic biofilms can organize themselves to guarantee the flow of energy from the oil water interface to the water column the aim of this study was to study the microbiome and ex situ response of a lake microbial community and its adaptations under conditions of hydrocarbon spills in the present study we have demonstrated the formation of a hydrocarbonoclastic and electrogenic biofilm with filamentous bacteria along water column during oil spills where a putative electrical conduction system antigenically and ultrastructurally similar to myelin can be observed additionally

oligodendrocytes the results were confirmed in three independent experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrocarbonoclastic floating biofilm as a mixed bacterial community hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria in collected water samples were enriched in microcosms where diesel oil was added as the sole carbon source this microbial population showed the ability to colonize the static oil water interface by producing a significant number of floating flock like aggregates the growth of this community was analyzed by sem which showed bacterial cells meshed in a substantial amount of extracellular polymeric substance that contributed together with cellular debris in developing this flock like structures floating on the static oil water interface fig 1a numerous fibrillar elements were also observed in the extracellular matrix and created a rough biofilm scaffold fig 1b and some more giant filamentous structures composed of barrel shaped cells contained in a large sheath connecting thick regions of the floating biofilm fig 1c all these bacterial chains probably provided a tool both for floating and connecting the different parts of the culture from the oil water interface throughout the underneath water column moreover numerous nanowire like connections 40 60 nm in width were also observed between bacillar bacterial shapes and filamentous bacterial cells in the floating parts of the biofilm fig 1d in the same cultures some filamentous bacteria that extended themselves in the water column from the oil water level produced huge strands more than 500 µm in length containing dna detected by dapi staining fig 1e at high magnification these strands were shown as consisting of oval shaped structures queueing in a ribbon like envelope inserts 3 2 microbiome to study the freshwater microbial community at the oil water interface environmental sample 1b previously enriched in lb 1b lb was immersed in diesel for 12 months the 16s rrna gene sequences analysis at the class level for samples 1b 1b lb and 1b lb d is shown in supplementary fig 4a at the sixth month the study of microbial successions showed that in the diesel immersed sample 1b lb d compared to previous samples 1b and 1b lb the whole community 100 was composed of the proteobacteria phylum more than 97 was represented by the γ proteobacteria class and 2 2 by α proteobacteria these microcosms grown in diesel under conditions of microventilation hypoxic showed a decrease in biodiversity as already described in soils contaminated with diesel borowik et al 2018 phylum like firmicutes actinobacteria bacteroidetes and acidobacteria were absent in the microcosms 1b lb d the γ proteobacteria are a metabolically versatile class of bacteria including a large number of species present in environments characterized by massive presence of hydrocarbons hazen et al 2010 some of the best known hydrocarbonoclastic γ proteobacteria include oceanospirillales cycloclasaticus and halomonas and include those that were identified in the gulf of mexico during the deep water horizon oil spill hazen et al 2010 gutierrez et al 2016 the microbiome analysis at the genus level supplementary fig 4b showed the presence of serratia sp pseudomonas sp and shewanella sp which are known hydrocarbon degraders wongsa et al 2004 wasi et al 2013 rathoura et al 2018 growth of these facultative anaerobes could be favoured in these oxygen poor microcosms and could play a role in diesel degradation the ubiquitous shewanella sp represented over 80 bacterial abundance in our microcosms it is known for its ability to conduct electricity and also to promote the electrogenic biodegradation of diesel in microbial fuel cells under anaerobic conditions morrisa et al 2009 the presence of flavin in the shewanella sp cytoplasm allows the transport of the electrons sequestered in the dehydrogenation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh nad towards the outer membrane fonseca et al 2013 furthermore in the outer membrane the presence of different types of cytochromes c guarantees an rp difference to allow the flow of electrons through connection elements called nanowires the electrons can pass to adjacent cells to reduce oxygen heavy metals and other oxidants such as sulphates and nitrates pirbadian et al 2014 cooper et al 2003 the presence of nanowires in biofilms has been described as a factor leading to an increase in current in microbial fuel cells designed using geobacter sulfurreducens biofilms reguera et al 2006 although the data from this microbiome study confirmed the presence of putative electrogenic bacterial elements such as shewanella sp it did not reveal the nature of the filaments observed in the biofilm this could be due to difficulty in extracting nucleic acids from filaments or due to presence of bacterial genera for which no filamentous forms are known bacterial filamentation processes have been described for pseudomonas putida in which oxygen became a limiting factor during growth on a variety of liquid media jensen et al 1985 similarly serratia sp shewanella sp and aeromonas sp the latter found only in traces 1 could contribute to the filamentous shape of the biofilm observed in sample 1b lb d 3 3 liquid microbial fuel cells 3 3 1 operating l mfcs to verify the electrogenicity and hydrocarbonoclastic activity of the microbial community l mfcs were supplemented with diesel as the only energy source supplementary figs 1 2 the electrogenic trend of the microbial community grown in the l mfcs was analyzed as shown in fig 2 like in other mfcs reported previously logan et al 2006 the anode at the diesel water interface donated electrons while the underlying cathodic region containing o2 functioned as an electron acceptor supplementary fig 1 3 3 2 membrane of l mfcs electron microscopy analysis was performed to investigate how the hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas of l mfc were separated sem micrographs showed the presence of a membrane at the oil water interface which could be constituted by a lipid layer that separated diesel from hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria present in the hydrophilic phase fig 3 a infrared spectroscopic analysis at diesel water interface showed the formation of an n acylsphingosine ceramide together with some phospholipids fig 3b these molecules represent surface active compounds sac georgiou et al 1992 which consist of hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains preferably distributed over the interface they could ensure bioavailability and consequent degradation of hydrocarbons at the interface level as previously described klein et al 2010 as shown in fig 4 a the l mfc produced current only by placing the electrode of the micropositioner in contact with this membrane position b while positioning it in diesel did not generate electrical signals position a this observation suggested that the anodic region of the l mfc was located on the membrane of the diesel water interface and that it functioned as a charge separator allowing evocation of rp therefore this kind of l mfc could represent a natural battery present in the hydrocarbon water interface not yet identified until now 3 3 3 rp o2 and ph in l mfcs an l mfc prototype supplementary fig 2 was built for studying the changes in bacterial growth biofilm formation and electrogenicity as rp with the o2 variations using diesel as a sole energy source measurements were made at 6 cm from the oil water interface with carbon electrodes as described above in the first two months an increase of od could be observed with a reduction in the o2 concentration that moved from 7 mg l at t0 to suboxic values of 4 mg l at t2 when rp and biofilm began to be detected in the successive months o2 trend was opposite to rp decreasing until the 7th month from this point onwards a maintenance of an electrogenic state was observed despite hypoxic values of o2 less than 1 mg l fig 4b at month 6 rp ph and o2 were also measured all along the water column of l mfc fig 4c maximum values of rp with o2 at 3 mg l were observed at 6 7 cm with a peak of 300 mv at the bottom of the battery where the concentration of o2 dropped to almost anoxic values less than 1 mg l these data are in agreement with the characteristics of an electron donor like shewanella sp or other electrogenic bacteria that use metals as an electron acceptor under conditions of oxygen depletion sulu gambari et al 2016 castro et al 2014 although other mechanisms could be involved the reduction of these acceptors which could explain the maintenance of rp was supported by the multitude of crystals observed on the bottom of the l mfc during the hypoxic and anoxic phases of hydrocarbon degradation fig 4b and supplementary fig 5 on the contrary rp was not observed just below the biofilm 2 3 mm where o2 was not detectable rp and o2 lack were in agreement with the hypothesis of the creation of an anoxic state under the biofilm the presence of rp immediately after the anoxic zone suggested electrical connections that started from the biofilm and reached the water column fig 4c the ph trend was almost unchanged throughout the water column around the values of 6 8 7 fig 4c however an increase was expected around the oxic area due to the consumption of protons for water formation 4h 4e o2 2h2o the ph stability in l mfc was not analyzed but its increase was probably counteracted by the forced solubilization of co2 and protons released during the oxidation of hydrocarbons 3 3 4 filaments and o2 in l mfcs to determine if changes in the rp was due to the presence of a bacterial electrical network observed in the biofilm and the water column the sample was incubated in an l mfc equipped with a thin 0 50 mm blade for cutting of the water column supplementary fig 2c and video s1 the steel blade was rotated horizontally through the water column 2 3 mm below the biofilm thus transiently interrupting the network of bacterial connections this movement induced a consistent reduction in rp supplementary fig 6 bar a which was also obtained by heavily pipetting along the water column supplementary fig 6 bar b suggesting that in the water column there could be a thick component responsible for electron transfer introducing o2 along the water column up to 6 7 mg l resulted in a dramatic reduction of rp supplementary fig 6 bar c this finding suggested that there was an optimal range of oxygen concentration in l mfc for rp generation fig 4c hypoxic levels of 3 4 mg seemed to favor rp while higher o2 concentrations reduced it a shift from an anaerobic phase with electric current production to an aerobic phase without the electric current output of the facultative anaerobic community 1b lb d could explain this result supplementary fig 4 the accessibility of the biofilm or the filaments along the water column to o2 could perhaps allow the completion of the catabolic processes and make the activation of microbial electrical connections redundant to transport electrons to o2 in distant zones 3 3 5 ultrastructural analysis of filaments from the water column of l mfcs to study the filamentous elements of the l mfc enriched culture of filaments from the water column fig 1e were grown alone using diesel oil as sole energy source these microcosms were able to form biofilm at the oil water interface and to produce detectable rp in l mfc with diesel as sole energy source and in lb broth fig 5 a both conditions were optimal for the growth and study of the filaments identified in l mfcs filaments were morphologically analyzed by electron microscopy revealing their pleiotropic nature when grown in a hypoxic environment clsm and sem analyses showed bacillar and oval shapes both included in a loose tubular structure of several microns in length fig 6 a b tem negative staining of filaments confirmed the presence of an electron lucent tubular structure that wrapped more electron dense bacillar cells fig 5b this envelope contained both bacterial cells and a structure resembling bacterial spores fig 6c d rabi et al 2017 interestingly these spore like shapes were observed during the drastic reduction of o2 3 mg l after about three months of culture and over during the maturation of l mfcs when rp settled at around 400 mv fig 4b when this filamentous structure was not completely developed it revealed the presence of some complex flagellar connections between bacterial cells organized to form a string observed in the first two months of incubation of the l mfcs fig 5c it is conceivable that these flagella contributed both to the bacterial filament building and to cell cell electron transfer which in turn could be responsible for one of the potential electrogenic mechanisms in the l mfcs malvankar et al 2014 however whatever was involved in the electron transfer process these shell wrapped bacilli supported the growth of filaments from the oil water interface over long distances although it was not verified whether the filaments could conduct electrical current it was likely that they could contribute to the generation of rp in the l mfc where the filaments were present as the most abundant organisms fig 5a besides flagellar filaments other ultrastructures were observed that could be hypothesized to be responsible for the electron transport at distance indeed bacterial nanowire like structures derived from the bacilli outer membrane and nanovesicle chains composed by numerous juxtaposed extracellular vesicles 30 nm in diameter were observed by tem fig 6e f and sem fig 1d these observations were also supported by the microbiome data that showed the presence in this hydrocarbonoclastic biofilm of genera capable of producing nanowires moreover numerous nanovesicles were also detected in the area between two spore like structures enclosed in the same envelope fig 6g they all could be proposed as tools that play a role in rp production sure et al 2016 subramanian et al 2017 ramírez flores et al 2019 the variety of organized structures capable of electron conduction has recently been enriched by the observation that also cytochrome c protein chains in a liquid environment are capable of inducing electron transfer in the absence of vesicles or membranes supporting electron transport without electrical dispersion lagunas et al 2018 3 3 6 a myelin like network for the electrogenic filaments of l mfcs a more detailed tem analysis has been performed to understand the ultrastructure of these new pleiotropic bacteria when grown in a hypoxic environment ultrathin sections showed that the bacterial filaments consisted of trains of oval shaped structures contained in a coarse shell and displayed all layers usually present in a bacterial spore fig 7 a b in particular we observed an inner coat ct characterized by a fine lamellar appearance of multiple membrane layers 12 coils which strongly resembled a myelin like structure under the coat layers it was possible to discern the outer membrane om of the spore and the cortex cx the inner membrane around the core co was not visible in these ultrathin sections fig 7c the space between these wrapped spores was often filled by numerous vesicles and membrane coilings which could be involved in electron transfer fig 6g to verify the phospholipid nature of the myelin like layer clsm analysis of filaments was performed with fm1 43 a lipophilic compound usually used for staining of the myelin sheaths of schwann cells nishikawa et al 2011 live labelled samples showed an intense annular signal around the spores in the filaments probably consistent with the multi lamellar layers at the same time the bacilli string exhibited a much weaker green fluorescence indicative of a lower phospholipid content fig 7d furthermore fm1 43 and dapi staining of our filaments confirmed their ability in developing peculiar threads in which both bacilli and spores are wrapped to form giant filaments fig 7d f this complex filamentous structure thanks to the floating due to the high presence of lipids could facilitate the connection of the water column to the hydrocarbonclastic biofilm of the l mfc and could be involved in the rp detected in the water column results obtained from the cutting off the water column could support these hypotheses supplementary fig 6a b these myelin like structures entrapped in a unique filament represented a novel and exciting bacterial feature induced by such challenging environments deserves further study they have also been related to structural proteins of oligodendrocytes such as mbp boggs et al 2006 involved in membrane coiling and o4 protein this membrane integrin could be involved in electron transfer devaux et al 2008 the preliminary results data not shown obtained by immunofluorescence for o4 and three different mbp epitopes chou et al 1986 were followed by clsm observations and western blot experiments for mbp fig 8 in particular mbp and o4 proteins appeared as brilliant ring shaped fluorescence in the myelin like lipid multilayer portion where they co localized at the same time there were no apparent signs for mbp and o4 in bacillary forms of this bacteria fig 8a the different degree of mbp expression between these two bacterial forms was confirmed when the myelinated filaments were compared with the samples containing only bacillary forms by western blot analysis fig 8b lane 4f and 4 the sample 4f of filaments having spores obtained under hypoxic conditions revealed the presence of mbp epitopes albeit with an isoform pattern different from the mbp of rat oligodendrocytes fig 8b lane ol these findings open up exciting scenarios on the action that o2 depletion exerts on ecosystems and more directly on organisms the bacterial filamentation with the induction of a sort of myelination with multi layer lipid presence in anoxic environments could allow the pelagic species to have the advantage of floating along with water column and have a more efficient resistance with the possibility to donate electrons at distance furthermore the multicellularity the electrogenicity and the cross reactivity with proteins typical of the nervous system of higher organisms represent an interesting peculiarity found in these bacteria the discovery of these myelinated structures represents a unicum in the microbial world that has its equivalents in vertebrates and could constitute an example of the common evolutionary project between distant living beings morris et al 2010 that certainly deserves further study 4 conclusions collectively our data provide information on oxidative microbial mechanisms during oxygen scarcity triggered by oil spills in a lacustrine ecosystem petroleum hydrocarbons stimulated the growth of hydrocarbonoclastic floating biofilms capable of creating organic batteries called l mfc with the anodic region in the oil water interface and the cathodic one along the water column the presence of hydrocarbons allowed the biofilm to release sac generating the spontaneous separation of electrical charges through the oil water interface the existence of electrogenic genus such as shewanella sp could have been responsible for the observed electric current which passed the anoxic barrier under the hydrocarbon water interface to complete oxidative processes the floating filaments could connect the biofilm anode to the water column cathode thereby facilitating eletcron donation at distance given the respiratory preferences of shewanella sp acceptors other than o2 such as heavy metals sulphates nitrates or crystal deposits could also be involved fig 9 our findings therefore suggest a possible mechanism on how lacustrine microbial communities can adapt to oil spills and makes important contributions in enabling better remedial solutions for oil pollution events in lacustrine ecosystems in the future credit authorship contribution statement emilio d ugo conceptualization

17037,the oil water interface formed during an oil spill represents a challenging environment for pelagic communities living in aquatic ecosystems at this anoxic barrier we report the formation of a microbial hydrocarbonoclastic biofilm capable of electron transfer along the water column this biofilm generated a membrane of surface active compounds that allowed the spontaneous separation of electrical charges causing the establishment of an anodic and a cathodic region and as a result the spontaneous creation of a liquid microbial fuel cell such floating biofilm was connected to the water column underneath by floating filaments that could contribute to oxygen reduction at distance the filaments revealed an unusual lipid content induced by anoxic conditions with prominent ultrastructural features similar to myelin found in oligodendrocytes of the vertebrate nervous system furthermore these filaments showed an interesting cross reactivity towards different epitopes of the myelin basic protein mbp and claudin 11 o4 of human oligodendrocytes the presence of a network of filaments similar to myelin suggests the probable existence of evolutionary connections between very distant organisms collectively these results suggest a possible mechanism for how lake microbial communities can adapt to oil spills while offering an interesting starting point for technological developments of liquid microbial fuel cells related to the study of hydrocarbon water interfaces the data that support the findings of this study are openly available in figshare at https figshare com s 72bc73ae14011dc7920d graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction massive oil spills in natural waters have an immediate effect on oxygen levels in the water bodies due to the reduction in atmospheric gaseous exchange and lowered availability of light for phytoplankton especially in the euphotic zone williams and mann 2020 additionally oxygen under the water surface is consumed by microbial oxidation processes with a consequent slowdown in the degradation of hydrocarbon substances atlas 1995 although in these circumstances successional microbial communities of facultative aerobic or anaerobic hydrocarbonoclastic species can complete this degradation hazen et al 2010 gutierrez et al 2016 the creation of a zonal anoxic barrier in the ecosystem niches represents a challenge for oxygenotrophic species that must complete their oxidative processes bacterial biofilms are three dimensional structures that usually grow adherent to abiotic or biotic surfaces and represent an emerging issue in all environments flemming et al 2016 creating biofilm communities at oil spill sites could be a way to improve the microorganism s planktonic life moreover the matrix biofilm determines an efficient milieu for hydrocarbon degradation wherein microbes are capable of protecting themselves from environmental stress and enhances their ability to adapt decho 2000 the biofilm growth beneath hydrocarbon substances seems to be associated with the ability of these bacteria to detect at the level of the hydrocarbon water interface the bioavailability of nutrients which constitute a source of carbon and energy klein et al 2010 although the existence of biofilm at the hydrocarbon water interface is documented klein et al 2010 there is currently no experimental evidence on how these aquatic communities are structured to cope with the anoxic barriers that are usually produced during hydrocarbon degradation moreover it is not known how hydrocarbonoclastic biofilms can organize themselves to guarantee the flow of energy from the oil water interface to the water column the aim of this study was to study the microbiome and ex situ response of a lake microbial community and its adaptations under conditions of hydrocarbon spills in the present study we have demonstrated the formation of a hydrocarbonoclastic and electrogenic biofilm with filamentous bacteria along water column during oil spills where a putative electrical conduction system antigenically and ultrastructurally similar to myelin can be observed additionally a new method for developing liquid microbial fuel cells l mfcs has also been described 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling site and sample processing sampling was performed in pertusillo lake an

oligodendrocytes the results were confirmed in three independent experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrocarbonoclastic floating biofilm as a mixed bacterial community hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria in collected water samples were enriched in microcosms where diesel oil was added as the sole carbon source this microbial population showed the ability to colonize the static oil water interface by producing a significant number of floating flock like aggregates the growth of this community was analyzed by sem which showed bacterial cells meshed in a substantial amount of extracellular polymeric substance that contributed together with cellular debris in developing this flock like structures floating on the static oil water interface fig 1a numerous fibrillar elements were also observed in the extracellular matrix and created a rough biofilm scaffold fig 1b and some more giant filamentous structures composed of barrel shaped cells contained in a large sheath connecting thick regions of the floating biofilm fig 1c all these bacterial chains probably provided a tool both for floating and connecting the different parts of the culture from the oil water interface throughout the underneath water column moreover numerous nanowire like connections 40 60 nm in width were also observed between bacillar bacterial shapes and filamentous bacterial cells in the floating parts of the biofilm fig 1d in the same cultures some filamentous bacteria that extended themselves in the water column from the oil water level produced huge strands more than 500 µm in length containing dna detected by dapi staining fig 1e at high magnification these strands were shown as consisting of oval shaped structures queueing in a ribbon like envelope inserts 3 2 microbiome to study the freshwater microbial community at the oil water interface environmental sample 1b previously enriched in lb 1b lb was immersed in diesel for 12 months the 16s rrna gene sequences analysis at the class level for samples 1b 1b lb and 1b lb d is shown in supplementary fig 4a at the sixth month the study of microbial successions showed that in the diesel immersed sample 1b lb d compared to previous samples 1b and 1b lb the whole community 100 was composed of the proteobacteria phylum more than 97 was represented by the γ proteobacteria class and 2 2 by α proteobacteria these microcosms grown in diesel under conditions of microventilation hypoxic showed a decrease in biodiversity as already described in soils contaminated with diesel borowik et al 2018 phylum like firmicutes actinobacteria bacteroidetes and acidobacteria were absent in the microcosms 1b lb d the γ proteobacteria are a metabolically versatile class of bacteria including a large number of species present in environments characterized by massive presence of hydrocarbons hazen et al 2010 some of the best known hydrocarbonoclastic γ proteobacteria include oceanospirillales cycloclasaticus and halomonas and include those that were identified in the gulf of mexico during the deep water horizon oil spill hazen et al 2010 gutierrez et al 2016 the microbiome analysis at the genus level supplementary fig 4b showed the presence of serratia sp pseudomonas sp and shewanella sp which are known hydrocarbon degraders wongsa et al 2004 wasi et al 2013 rathoura et al 2018 growth of these facultative anaerobes could be favoured in these oxygen poor microcosms and could play a role in diesel degradation the ubiquitous shewanella sp represented over 80 bacterial abundance in our microcosms it is known for its ability to conduct electricity and also to promote the electrogenic biodegradation of diesel in microbial fuel cells under anaerobic conditions morrisa et al 2009 the presence of flavin in the shewanella sp cytoplasm allows the transport of the electrons sequestered in the dehydrogenation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh nad towards the outer membrane fonseca et al 2013 furthermore in the outer membrane the presence of different types of cytochromes c guarantees an rp difference to allow the flow of electrons through connection elements called nanowires the electrons can pass to adjacent cells to reduce oxygen heavy metals and other oxidants such as sulphates and nitrates pirbadian et al 2014 cooper et al 2003 the presence of nanowires in biofilms has been described as a factor leading to an increase in current in microbial fuel cells designed using geobacter sulfurreducens biofilms reguera et al 2006 although the data from this microbiome study confirmed the presence of putative electrogenic bacterial elements such as shewanella sp it did not reveal the nature of the filaments observed in the biofilm this could be due to difficulty in extracting nucleic acids from filaments or due to presence of bacterial genera for which no filamentous forms are known bacterial filamentation processes have been described for pseudomonas putida in which oxygen became a limiting factor during growth on a variety of liquid media jensen et al 1985 similarly serratia sp shewanella sp and aeromonas sp the latter found only in traces 1 could contribute to the filamentous shape of the biofilm observed in sample 1b lb d 3 3 liquid microbial fuel cells 3 3 1 operating l mfcs to verify the electrogenicity and hydrocarbonoclastic activity of the microbial community l mfcs were supplemented with diesel as the only energy source supplementary figs 1 2 the electrogenic trend of the microbial community grown in the l mfcs was analyzed as shown in fig 2 like in other mfcs reported previously logan et al 2006 the anode at the diesel water interface donated electrons while the underlying cathodic region containing o2 functioned as an electron acceptor supplementary fig 1 3 3 2 membrane of l mfcs electron microscopy analysis was performed to investigate how the hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas of l mfc were separated sem micrographs showed the presence of a membrane at the oil water interface which could be constituted by a lipid layer that separated diesel from hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria present in the hydrophilic phase fig 3 a infrared spectroscopic analysis at diesel water interface showed the formation of an n acylsphingosine ceramide together with some phospholipids fig 3b these molecules represent surface active compounds sac georgiou et al 1992 which consist of hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains preferably distributed over the interface they could ensure bioavailability and consequent degradation of hydrocarbons at the interface level as previously described klein et al 2010 as shown in fig 4 a the l mfc produced current only by placing the electrode of the micropositioner in contact with this membrane position b while positioning it in diesel did not generate electrical signals position a this observation suggested that the anodic region of the l mfc was located on the membrane of the diesel water interface and that it functioned as a charge separator allowing evocation of rp therefore this kind of l mfc could represent a natural battery present in the hydrocarbon water interface not yet identified until now 3 3 3 rp o2 and ph in l mfcs an l mfc prototype supplementary fig 2 was built for studying the changes in bacterial growth biofilm formation and electrogenicity as rp with the o2 variations using diesel as a sole energy source measurements were made at 6 cm from the oil water interface with carbon electrodes as described above in the first two months an increase of od could be observed with a reduction in the o2 concentration that moved from 7 mg l at t0 to suboxic values of 4 mg l at t2 when rp and biofilm began to be detected in the successive months o2 trend was opposite to rp decreasing until the 7th month from this point onwards a maintenance of an electrogenic state was observed despite hypoxic values of o2 less than 1 mg l fig 4b at month 6 rp ph and o2 were also measured all along the water column of l mfc fig 4c maximum values of rp with o2 at 3 mg l were observed at 6 7 cm with a peak of 300 mv at the bottom of the battery where the concentration of o2 dropped to almost anoxic values less than 1 mg l these data are in agreement with the characteristics of an electron donor like shewanella sp or other electrogenic bacteria that use metals as an electron acceptor under conditions of oxygen depletion sulu gambari et al 2016 castro et al 2014 although other mechanisms could be involved the reduction of these acceptors which could explain the maintenance of rp was supported by the multitude of crystals observed on the bottom of the l mfc during the hypoxic and anoxic phases of hydrocarbon degradation fig 4b and supplementary fig 5 on the contrary rp was not observed just below the biofilm 2 3 mm where o2 was not detectable rp and o2 lack were in agreement with the hypothesis of the creation of an anoxic state under the biofilm the presence of rp immediately after the anoxic zone suggested electrical connections that started from the biofilm and reached the water column fig 4c the ph trend was almost unchanged throughout the water column around the values of 6 8 7 fig 4c however an increase was expected around the oxic area due to the consumption of protons for water formation 4h 4e o2 2h2o the ph stability in l mfc was not analyzed but its increase was probably counteracted by the forced solubilization of co2 and protons released during the oxidation of hydrocarbons 3 3 4 filaments and o2 in l mfcs to determine if changes in the rp was due to the presence of a bacterial electrical network observed in the biofilm and the water column the sample was incubated in an l mfc equipped with a thin 0 50 mm blade for cutting of the water column supplementary fig 2c and video s1 the steel blade was rotated horizontally through the water column 2 3 mm below the biofilm thus transiently interrupting the network of bacterial connections this movement induced a consistent reduction in rp supplementary fig 6 bar a which was also obtained by heavily pipetting along the water column supplementary fig 6 bar b suggesting that in the water column there could be a thick component responsible for electron transfer introducing o2 along the water column up to 6 7 mg l resulted in a dramatic reduction of rp supplementary fig 6 bar c this finding suggested that there was an optimal range of oxygen concentration in l mfc for rp generation fig 4c hypoxic levels of 3 4 mg seemed to favor rp while higher o2 concentrations reduced it a shift from an anaerobic phase with electric current production to an aerobic phase without the electric current output of the facultative anaerobic community 1b lb d could explain this result supplementary fig 4 the accessibility of the biofilm or the filaments along the water column to o2 could perhaps allow the completion of the catabolic processes and make the activation of microbial electrical connections redundant to transport electrons to o2 in distant zones 3 3 5 ultrastructural analysis of filaments from the water column of l mfcs to study the filamentous elements of the l mfc enriched culture of filaments from the water column fig 1e were grown alone using diesel oil as sole energy source these microcosms were able to form biofilm at the oil water interface and to produce detectable rp in l mfc with diesel as sole energy source and in lb broth fig 5 a both conditions were optimal for the growth and study of the filaments identified in l mfcs filaments were morphologically analyzed by electron microscopy revealing their pleiotropic nature when grown in a hypoxic environment clsm and sem analyses showed bacillar and oval shapes both included in a loose tubular structure of several microns in length fig 6 a b tem negative staining of filaments confirmed the presence of an electron lucent tubular structure that wrapped more electron dense bacillar cells fig 5b this envelope contained both bacterial cells and a structure resembling bacterial spores fig 6c d rabi et al 2017 interestingly these spore like shapes were observed during the drastic reduction of o2 3 mg l after about three months of culture and over during the maturation of l mfcs when rp settled at around 400 mv fig 4b when this filamentous structure was not completely developed it revealed the presence of some complex flagellar connections between bacterial cells organized to form a string observed in the first two months of incubation of the l mfcs fig 5c it is conceivable that these flagella contributed both to the bacterial filament building and to cell cell electron transfer which in turn could be responsible for one of the potential electrogenic mechanisms in the l mfcs malvankar et al 2014 however whatever was involved in the electron transfer process these shell wrapped bacilli supported the growth of filaments from the oil water interface over long distances although it was not verified whether the filaments could conduct electrical current it was likely that they could contribute to the generation of rp in the l mfc where the filaments were present as the most abundant organisms fig 5a besides flagellar filaments other ultrastructures were observed that could be hypothesized to be responsible for the electron transport at distance indeed bacterial nanowire like structures derived from the bacilli outer membrane and nanovesicle chains composed by numerous juxtaposed extracellular vesicles 30 nm in diameter were observed by tem fig 6e f and sem fig 1d these observations were also supported by the microbiome data that showed the presence in this hydrocarbonoclastic biofilm of genera capable of producing nanowires moreover numerous nanovesicles were also detected in the area between two spore like structures enclosed in the same envelope fig 6g they all could be proposed as tools that play a role in rp production sure et al 2016 subramanian et al 2017 ramírez flores et al 2019 the variety of organized structures capable of electron conduction has recently been enriched by the observation that also cytochrome c protein chains in a liquid environment are capable of inducing electron transfer in the absence of vesicles or membranes supporting electron transport without electrical dispersion lagunas et al 2018 3 3 6 a myelin like network for the electrogenic filaments of l mfcs a more detailed tem analysis has been performed to understand the ultrastructure of these new pleiotropic bacteria when grown in a hypoxic environment ultrathin sections showed that the bacterial filaments consisted of trains of oval shaped structures contained in a coarse shell and displayed all layers usually present in a bacterial spore fig 7 a b in particular we observed an inner coat ct characterized by a fine lamellar appearance of multiple membrane layers 12 coils which strongly resembled a myelin like structure under the coat layers it was possible to discern the outer membrane om of the spore and the cortex cx the inner membrane around the core co was not visible in these ultrathin sections fig 7c the space between these wrapped spores was often filled by numerous vesicles and membrane coilings which could be involved in electron transfer fig 6g to verify the phospholipid nature of the myelin like layer clsm analysis of filaments was performed with fm1 43 a lipophilic compound usually used for staining of the myelin sheaths of schwann cells nishikawa et al 2011 live labelled samples showed an intense annular signal around the spores in the filaments probably consistent with the multi lamellar layers at the same time the bacilli string exhibited a much weaker green fluorescence indicative of a lower phospholipid content fig 7d furthermore fm1 43 and dapi staining of our filaments confirmed their ability in developing peculiar threads in which both bacilli and spores are wrapped to form giant filaments fig 7d f this complex filamentous structure thanks to the floating due to the high presence of lipids could facilitate the connection of the water column to the hydrocarbonclastic biofilm of the l mfc and could be involved in the rp detected in the water column results obtained from the cutting off the water column could support these hypotheses supplementary fig 6a b these myelin like structures entrapped in a unique filament represented a novel and exciting bacterial feature induced by such challenging environments deserves further study they have also been related to structural proteins of oligodendrocytes such as mbp boggs et al 2006 involved in membrane coiling and o4 protein this membrane integrin could be involved in electron transfer devaux et al 2008 the preliminary results data not shown obtained by immunofluorescence for o4 and three different mbp epitopes chou et al 1986 were followed by clsm observations and western blot experiments for mbp fig 8 in particular mbp and o4 proteins appeared as brilliant ring shaped fluorescence in the myelin like lipid multilayer portion where they co localized at the same time there were no apparent signs for mbp and o4 in bacillary forms of this bacteria fig 8a the different degree of mbp expression between these two bacterial forms was confirmed when the myelinated filaments were compared with the samples containing only bacillary forms by western blot analysis fig 8b lane 4f and 4 the sample 4f of filaments having spores obtained under hypoxic conditions revealed the presence of mbp epitopes albeit with an isoform pattern different from the mbp of rat oligodendrocytes fig 8b lane ol these findings open up exciting scenarios on the action that o2 depletion exerts on ecosystems and more directly on organisms the bacterial filamentation with the induction of a sort of myelination with multi layer lipid presence in anoxic environments could allow the pelagic species to have the advantage of floating along with water column and have a more efficient resistance with the possibility to donate electrons at distance furthermore the multicellularity the electrogenicity and the cross reactivity with proteins typical of the nervous system of higher organisms represent an interesting peculiarity found in these bacteria the discovery of these myelinated structures represents a unicum in the microbial world that has its equivalents in vertebrates and could constitute an example of the common evolutionary project between distant living beings morris et al 2010 that certainly deserves further study 4 conclusions collectively our data provide information on oxidative microbial mechanisms during oxygen scarcity triggered by oil spills in a lacustrine ecosystem petroleum hydrocarbons stimulated the growth of hydrocarbonoclastic floating biofilms capable of creating organic batteries called l mfc with the anodic region in the oil water interface and the cathodic one along the water column the presence of hydrocarbons allowed the biofilm to release sac generating the spontaneous separation of electrical charges through the oil water interface the existence of electrogenic genus such as shewanella sp could have been responsible for the observed electric current which passed the anoxic barrier under the hydrocarbon water interface to complete oxidative processes the floating filaments could connect the biofilm anode to the water column cathode thereby facilitating eletcron donation at distance given the respiratory preferences of shewanella sp acceptors other than o2 such as heavy metals sulphates nitrates or crystal deposits could also be involved fig 9 our findings therefore suggest a possible mechanism on how lacustrine microbial communities can adapt to oil spills and makes important contributions in enabling better remedial solutions for oil pollution events in lacustrine ecosystems in the future credit authorship contribution statement emilio d ugo conceptualization

in solid fractions and an overall downward trend over the lockdown period strong and significant correlation was observed in measured sars cov 2 rna concentrations between the solid and liquid wastewater fractions with the solid fraction containing majority 82 5 92 5 of the sars cov 2 rna mass and the solid liquid sars cov 2 rna concentration ratios ranging from 103 6 to 104 3 ml g the measured wastewater sars cov 2 rna concentration was normalized by three endogenous fecal rna viruses f rna coliphages group ii and iii and pepper mild mottle virus to account for variations that may

and originally focused on enteric bacterial pathogen in particular salmonella outbreaks shearer et al 1959 moore 1951 more recently studies have explored the wastewater surveillance approach for many potential applications including poliovirus eradication poyry et al 1988 enteric disease outbreak detection hellmer et al 2014 diemert and yan 2019 and to understand the diversity of microbial pathogens in human communities yang et al 2014 diemert and yan 2020 the global pandemic of covid 19 and the challenges in tracking its community transmission by the traditional clinical approaches have highlighted the unique potential advantages of the wastewater surveillance approach because wastewater consists of many types of human bodily wastes that can contain the sars cov 2 virus in particular feces cheung et al 2020 and urine jones et al 2020 sars cov 2 viral rna has been detected in raw wastewater and primary sludge samples at communities experiencing covid 19 outbreaks medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 ahmed et al 2020a peccia et al 2020 since municipal wastewater collects wastes from all covid 19 infections including asymptomatic mildly symptomatic pre symptomatic and symptomatic ones it has the potential to provide comprehensive surveillance of disease transmission in a community however the wide distribution of sars cov 2 viral rna concentration in patients

2020 have presented challenges in using wastewater to estimate covid 19 disease burden wu et al 2020 previous studies have reported rapid increasing of sars cov 2 rna concentration in wastewater at the rising limb of covid 19 outbreaks in communities medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 ahmed et al 2020a peccia et al 2020 hata et al 2021 while few studies have investigated the temporal dynamics of wastewater sars cov 2 rna during the recession limb of an outbreak graham et al 2021 d aoust et al 2021 the fact that the sewer collection system carries a continuous stream of wastewater also means that it may be used as a near real time pooled sampling instrument for the entire community providing rapid disease signals and enabling quick responses the symptomatic covid 19 infections are now known to start shedding virus in upper respiratory during the incubation period which typically lasts an average of 5 2 days li et al 2020 and the highest viral load was generally reported at the time of symptom onset jones et al 2020 accordingly pre symptomatic transmission was estimated to account for about 44 of secondary cases he et al 2020 and could contribute to sars cov 2 signals in wastewater asymptomatic infections which were estimated to represent 40 45 of total sars cov 2 infections and believed to play a significant role in viral transmission oran and topol 2020 could generate sars cov 2 signals in wastewater before emergence of clinical patients however our understanding of the temporal dynamics of sars cov 2 rna especially at fine scales such as daily in wastewater of communities that are experiencing ongoing covid 19 outbreaks remains very limited in august 2020 honolulu hawaii usa experienced a rapid surge of covid 19 cases which prompted a stay at home order that started on august 27 2020 and lasted for four weeks this provided a rare opportunity to investigate how sars cov 2 viral rna concentration in wastewater would respond to the expected rapid decreases of clinical cases in the community as a result of the emergency public health non pharmacological intervention in this study daily flow weighted composite raw wastewater samples were collected from the two largest wastewater treatment plants wwtps in honolulu and each wastewater sample was separated into a solid fraction and a liquid fraction the solid and liquid fractions of the wastewater samples were processed separately and the sars cov 2 rna concentration was measured by using three different rt qpcr assays concentrations of three endogenous fecal rna viruses which are usually used as surrogates for enteric viral pathogens in wastewater including f rna coliphages group ii g2 and group iii g3 friedman et al 2011 and pepper mild mottle virus pmmov rosario et al 2009 in the solid and liquid fractions of the samples were also determined in parallel the measured endogenous fecal rna viruses were subsequently used as global normalization to account for variations in wastewater fecal strength and the multi step quantification process 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater sampling and pre processing daily flow weighted composite samples of influent raw wastewater

august 27 2020 day 0 the total daily new covid 19 clinical case number in honolulu reached its highest peak of 303 7 day moving average of 217 on day 5 and then started trending downward reached a daily case of 82 7 day moving average of 89 on day 27 when the lockdown expired figure 1 on day 38 when the wastewater sampling campaign stopped the number of daily new cases was 41 7 day moving average of 75 corresponding to the decrease in new clinical cases resulting from the lockdown the measured sars cov 2 rna concentration in the wastewater samples also exhibited an overall downward trend and significant concentration fluctuations in both wwtps figure 2 for example in the si wwtp liquid fractions the sars cov 2 rna concentration showed ranges of 103 0 105 1 gc l 101 2 104 5 gc l and 102 0 104 5 gc l based on the n1 n2 and e gene assays respectively in the si wwtp solid fractions the sars cov 2 rna concentration also showed ranges of 104 1 105 5 gc g 101 5 106 0 gc g and 101 4 106 2 gc g based on the n1 n2 and e gene assays respectively similar concentration ranges were also detected in the wastewater liquid and solid fractions from the ho wwtp linear regression of the measured sars cov 2 rna concentration over time showed negative slopes range 0 019 to 0 070 x sx 0 039 0 019 for both liquid and solid fractions of wastewater samples from both wwtps and by all three quantification assays slopes of linear regression and pearson s r and p values are summarized in table s5 similar downward trends were also detected by calculating and plotting 7 day moving average data not shown 3 2 comparison of quantification assays measurements by the three quantification assays were plotted against each other and compared through correlation analysis figure 3 although all comparisons showed significant correlation pearson s r 0 65 0 81 p 0 001 for all comparisons the best correlation was observed between n2 and e gene in the liquid fractions pearson s r 0 81 p 0 001 between liquid and solid fractions the liquid fraction showed better pearson s r x sx 0 72 0 08 amongst the comparisons of three sars cov 2 genes and the pearson s r values were significant higher paired t test p 0 049 than those of the solid fractions x sx 0 57 0 08 3 3 sars cov 2 rna in solid and liquid fractions the time series data and their linear regression showed that in nearly all wastewater samples analyzed the solid and liquid fractions appeared to exhibit similar temporal fluctuation patterns while the solid fraction contained significantly higher quantity of sars cov 2 rna than the corresponding liquid fractions figure 2 to further investigate these relationships the measured sars cov 2 rna concentrations in the solid and liquid fractions of individual wastewater samples were plotted without the time variable and subjected to correlation analysis figure 4 significant correlation was observed between the measurements of sars cov 2 rna in the solid and liquid fractions based on all three quantification assays and in both wwtps for samples from the si wwtp figure 4a pearson s r values were 0 40 p 0 02 0 73 p 0 001 and 0 66 p 0 001 for n1 n2 and e gene assays respectively similar correlation coefficients r 0 61 p 0 001 0 82 p 0 001 and 0 70 p 0 001 for n1 n2 and e gene assays respectively were observed for the samples from the ho wwtp figure 4b when compared on an equal mass basis the measured concentrations of sars cov 2 rna in the solid fraction gc g were significantly higher than that in the liquid fraction gc ml paired t test p 0 001 the n1 concentration ratios between the solid and liquid fractions ml g were 104 00 sx 100 47 and 103 89 sx 100 35 for samples from the si and ho wwtps respectively the n2 concentration ratios between the solid and liquid fractions ml g were 104 31 sx 100 72 and 104 24 sx 100 51 for samples from the si and ho wwtps respectively the e concentration ratios between the solid and liquid fractions ml g were 103 83 sx 100 67 and 103 58 sx 100 51 for samples from the si and ho wwtps respectively since there were no statistical difference in the solid liquid concentration ratio between the si and ho wwtp t test p 0 30 0 65 and 0 08 for the n1 n2 and e assay results respectively data from the two wwtp plants were pooled to calculate the total mass distribution of sars cov 2 rna between the solid and liquid fractions of the wastewater samples after accounting for their respective mass percentages in individual samples average percentages of 90 5 sx 8 1 based on the n1 assay 92 5 sx 14 1 based on the n2 assay and 82 5 sx 19 9 based on the e assay of sars cov 2 rna resided in the solid fraction of the wastewater samples figure s3 3 4 normalization by endogenous fecal rna viruses to account for potential variations that may occur during the multi step process including fecal discharge sewer collection wastewater sample processing and the reverse transcription step of molecular quantification concentrations of three endogenous fecal rna viruses g2 g3 and pmmov in the same samples were determined and used to normalize the measured n1 n2 and e gene concentrations no obvious trend in the concentrations of the endogenous fecal rna viruses was observed in si or ho wwtp figure s4 overall the endogenous fecal rna viruses showed relatively stable concentration levels in spite of certain samples exhibiting significant variation in the wastewater samples from the si wwtp the g2 g3 and pmmov showed average concentrations in the liquid fractions of 104 1 sx 100 6 104 8 sx 100 9 and 105 8 sx 100 6 gc l respectively and average concentrations in the solid fraction of 105 0 sx 100 7 105 6 sx 100 9 and 106 2 sx 100 5 gc g respectively in the wastewater samples from the ho wwtp the g2 g3 and pmmov showed average concentrations in the liquid fractions of 105 6 sx 100 9 106 6 sx 100 8 and 106 5 sx 100 9 gc l respectively and average concentrations in the solid fraction of 104 3 sx 100 5 105 9 sx 100 7 and 106 4 sx 100 9 gc g respectively the normalized abundance of sars cov 2 rna still exhibited significant daily fluctuation and an overall downward trend over the sampling period in the wastewater samples from the si wwtp figure 5 using the e gene results as example in the liquid fractions from the si wwtp e g2 showed a range of 10 2 9 101 0 x sx 10 1 4 0 9 e g3 showed a range of 10 4 4 101 5 x sx 10 2 1 1 2 and e pmmov showed a range of 10 4 5 10 1 1 x sx 10 3 1 0 9 in the corresponding solid subsamples from the si wwtp e g2 showed a range of 10 2 9 101 0 x sx 10 1 4 1 0 e g3 showed a range of 10 5 6 100 5 x sx 10 2 5 1 4 and e pmmov showed a range of 10 5 0 10 0 7 x sx 10 3 1 0 9 a downward trend was observed in all normalized abundance in both liquid and solid fractions based on all three sars cov 2 rna quantification assays and three endogenous fecal rna viruses as indicated by the negative slopes of linear regression the slopes of the linear regression for the liquid fractions exhibited a range from 0 049 to 0 105 and the slopes of the linear regression for the solid fractions exhibited a range from 0 019 to 0 072 similar observations were made in the normalized abundance of sars cov 2 rna in the wastewater samples from the ho wwtp figure s5 slopes of linear regression and pearson s r and p values of normalized abundances are summarized in table s6 4 discussion the effectiveness of the non pharmacological intervention through a public health lockdown in controlling the covid 19 outbreak was indicated by the decreasing new clinical case numbers figure 1 and the decreasing of measured sars cov 2 rna concentration in the wastewater samples figure 2 similar trends were observed in both the solid and liquid fractions at both wwtps and by all three quantification assays which corroborated and supported the potential of using wastewater sars cov 2 concentration to monitor community disease burden this is congruent with previous observations where increasing wastewater sars cov 2 rna concentration corresponded to rapidly expanding covid 19 outbreaks medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 ahmed et al 2020a peccia et al 2020 and observations where reduction of clinical cases corresponded with decreasing wastewater sars cov 2 rna concentration graham et al 2021 the fine scale temporal dynamics enabled by the daily sampling in this study detected significant inter day fluctuation of the wastewater sars cov 2 rna abundance in both the liquid and solid fractions even within the same weeks for example the sars cov 2 rna concentration measured by the e gene assay in the liquid and solid fractions from the si wwtp decreased from 104 5 gc l and 106 2 gc g on day 3 to 103 6 gc l and 104 2 gc g on day 6 respectively recent studies also observed significant daily fluctuation of sars cov 2 rna concentration in sludge samples peccia et al 2020 many factors could have contributed to the observed inter day fluctuation including decay random measurement errors and fundamental underlying factors the relatively short hydraulic retention times of the wastewater collection systems i e a few hours in relation to the decay kinetics of sars cov 2 rna in untreated wastewater e g average t90 was shown to range from 8 04 to 27 8 days ahmed et al 2020b suggests decay may not be an important factor to the observed inter day variation since similar inter day fluctuations were observed by the three different assays figure 3 and between both solid and liquid fractions of wastewater samples figure 4 and the sample processing and molecular quantification methods used showed reasonable reproducibility i e sx of ct values of triplicate analysis less than 1 0 and 1 3 for liquid and solid fractions respectively random measurement errors in wastewater sampling and molecular analysis were unlikely to be the primary contributor to the significant inter day fluctuations observed how the fundamental underlying factors in particular varying viral shedding by infected individuals and daily fluctuations in disease burden in the community might have contributed to the observed inter day fluctuation of wastewater sars cov 2 rna concentration requires further investigation the wide range of sars cov 2 viral rna concentration detected in different patients wastes e g 102 7 7 6 gc g cheung et al 2020 pan et al 2020 and the rapid changing of fecal viral load in individual patients over the disease course jones et al 2020 wolfel et al 2020 can generate different fluxes of total sars cov 2 rna mass in the sewer systems significant daily fluctuation of new clinical cases in honolulu was also observed figure 1 which was similar to weekly inter day oscillations widely observed in other communities experiencing covid 19 disease outbreaks bukhari et al 2020 although this phenomenon has been considered by many to be primarily a reflection of diagnostic and reporting biases bergman et al 2020 contribution from fluctuations in disease burden remains as a possibility ricon becker et al 2020 as individual communities can experience different disease transmission dynamics nevertheless the observed significant inter day fluctuation could have significant implications in designing and conducting wastewater surveillance of covid 19 diseases in communities for example since daily flow weighted composite samples of influent raw wastewater could contain levels of sars cov 2 rna that differ by up to 101 7 folds as exampled above by the e gene results in the si wwtp one single daily flow weighted composite sample for a time interval e g a week may introduce significant variations in surveillance outcome although there has been no reported study on the concentration dynamics of sars cov 2 rna at even finer temporal scale e g intra day or hourly by inference wastewater grab samples are expected to experience even larger variations than daily flow weighted composite samples therefore composite samples over longer periods of time e g weekly composites may be needed to alleviate inter day fluctuation and provide smoothed depiction of disease burden in the community many rt qpcr assays with high specificity to the sars cov 2 rna have been developed to target different regions of the viral genome including e gene corman et al 2020 n gene lu et al 2020 orf1ab chinacdc 2020 and previous studies on wastewater have adopted these assays for detection in wastewater samples medema et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 graham et al 2021 sherchan et al 2020 since wastewater samples are much more complex than clinical samples this complexity needs to be taken into consideration in this study three different assays n1 n2 and e were used to provide independent analysis for redundancy and corroboration the significant correlation observed between results by the three assays figure 3 illustrated their general utility for wastewater samples interestingly the results also showed that the n2 and e gene assay results presented the best correlation coefficient than their respective correlation coefficients with the n1 assay results this is in line with previous observation that the n2 and e gene assays exhibited higher sensitivity than the n1 assay in clinical covid 19 samples nalla et al 2020b on the other hand different concentration results were obtained for the same samples by the different rt qpcr assays figure 2 which was also illustrated by the linear regression lines not passing through the origin figure 3 this can be attributed to the inherence variation in the rt qpcr processes which were also observed previously in clinical specimen nalla et al 2020a and in wastewater samples medema et al 2020 the separation of wastewater samples into solid and liquid fractions in this study not only provided a quasi replicate analysis of each wastewater sample but also allowed for side by side comparison of sars cov 2 rna concentration and calculation of its mass distribution between the solid and liquid fractions the significant correlation observed between the solid and liquid fractions by all three assays and in both wwtps figure 4 further supported the time series data observations of both the overall trend and the inter day fluctuation of the sars cov 2 rna concentration in wastewater figure 2 in spite of their different sensitivity and performance the three assays all reported significantly higher concentration of sars cov 2 in the solid fractions than in the liquid fractions with the solid liquid sars cov 2 rna concentration ratios ranging from 103 6 to 104 3 ml g several other studies have reported high levels of sars cov 2 rna in primary sludge samples peccia et al 2020 d aoust et al 2021 and also high ratios of sars cov 2 rna concentrations between primary sludge and raw influent samples e g 102 5 103 5 ml g graham et al 2021 previous laboratory experiments showed that enveloped mouse hepatitis virus mhv and bacteriophage phi6 exhibited partition coefficients of 103 2 and 103 1 ml g respectively ye et al 2016 the highly complex nature of the wastewater matrix also means that the resulting nucleic acid samples could potentially contain chemical inhibitors and a dominant background of non target nucleic acids which could introduce additional variations in both the reverse transcription and subsequent qpcr steps since chemical inhibition is most likely to occur in the reverse transcription step a highly inhibitor resistant reverse transcriptase ssiv which was shown to tolerate high level of chemical inhibitors e g 10 isopropanol and 0 05 of bile salts was used in this study to alleviate potential chemical inhibition the effectiveness of this strategy was supported by the detection of endogenous fecal indicator viruses in the wastewater samples in ranges similar to those reported in literature for example the measured pmmov concentration in the liquid and solid fractions of the wastewater samples in this study averaged at 106 5 gc l sx 100 9 gc l and 106 4 gc g sx 100 9 gc g similar concentrations were reported in the literature e g 106 6 gc l in raw wastewater kitajima et al 2014 and 106 3 gc g in wastewater sludge graham et al 2021 since the solid fraction of wastewater samples are more likely to suffer from chemical inhibition the detection of high solid liquid ratios of sars cov 2 in the wastewater samples up to 104 3 ml g further indicated that chemical inhibition although cannot be completely ruled out had limited impact on the sample analysis and particularly on the overall trend observed assuming any potential impact is consistent amongst the samples another source of potential variation was the multi step process that starts from varying fecal discharge by the community dilution and decay during sewer collection to different recovery during wastewater sample processing to globally account for the variations in the process this study also tested the feasibility of using three groups of endogenous fecal rna viruses g2 g3 and pmmov to normalize the measured sars cov 2 rna concentration g2 and g3 are inherently linked with fecal coliforms friedman et al 2011 while pmmov is highly abundant in wastewater due to human dietary consumption of pepper the latter of which has been used for sars cov 2 rna normalization in wastewater graham et al 2021 a previous study have shown that normalization of eae gene genetic marker for enteropathogenic e coli by uida gene genetic marker for general e coli in the same wastewater samples produced normalized abundance with much reduced variation over time yang et al 2014 although g2 g3 and pmmov are all non enveloped viruses which may exhibit different behaviors than enveloped viruses such as sars cov 2 during wastewater pre processing ye et al 2016 and even rna extraction their rna undergoes the same molecular quantification process and the normalized abundance is expected to remove impacts from potential chemical inhibition and or process efficiency variation within individual samples similar to the observations made with measured sars cov 2 rna concentration the normalized abundance still exhibited downward trend and inter day fluctuation over the sampling period figure 5 providing further support to the observations made by the direct concentration measurements 5 conclusion overall the study observed a downward trend of sars cov 2 rna abundance both measured concentrations and normalized abundance in the wastewater samples which corresponded to the decrease of clinical covid 19 new case numbers as a result of the public health lockdown in response to a community outbreak the fine scale temporal dynamics enabled by the daily sampling in this study detected significant daily fluctuation of the wastewater sars cov 2 rna abundance even within the same weeks indicating the fine scale temporal dynamics of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater needs to be taken into consideration in designing and implementing wastewater based surveillance the parallel quantification in solid and liquid fractions of the same wastewater samples indicated that the sars cov 2 viral rna is much more abundant in the solid fraction than in the liquid fraction because the wastewater solid fraction contains majority of the sars cov 2 mass in a wastewater sample and can be processed in a more time efficient fashion wastewater solids may be a more convenient sample matrix further research is needed to address challenges associated with potential higher likelihood of chemical inhibition and the

in solid fractions and an overall downward trend over the lockdown period strong and significant correlation was observed in measured sars cov 2 rna concentrations between the solid and liquid wastewater fractions with the solid fraction containing majority 82 5 92 5 of the sars cov 2 rna mass and the solid liquid sars cov 2 rna concentration ratios ranging from 103 6 to 104 3 ml g the measured wastewater sars cov 2 rna concentration was normalized by three endogenous fecal rna viruses f rna coliphages group ii and iii and pepper mild mottle virus to account for variations that may occur during the multi step wastewater processing and molecular quantification and the normalized abundance also exhibited similar daily fluctuations and overall downward trend over the sampling period keywords sars cov 2 covid 19 wastewater temporal dynamics solid liquid 1 introduction the use of wastewater to monitor microbial infectious diseases in human communities dates back to the 1950s and originally focused on enteric bacterial pathogen in particular salmonella outbreaks shearer et al 1959 moore 1951 more recently studies have explored the wastewater surveillance approach for many potential applications including poliovirus eradication poyry et al 1988 enteric disease outbreak detection hellmer et al 2014 diemert and yan 2019 and to understand the diversity of microbial pathogens in human communities yang et al 2014 diemert and yan 2020 the global pandemic of covid 19 and the challenges in tracking its community transmission by the traditional clinical approaches have highlighted the unique potential advantages of the wastewater surveillance approach because wastewater consists of many types of human bodily wastes that can contain the sars cov 2 virus in particular feces cheung et al 2020 and urine jones et al 2020 sars cov 2 viral rna has been detected in raw wastewater and primary sludge samples at communities experiencing covid 19 outbreaks medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 ahmed et al 2020a peccia et al 2020 since municipal wastewater collects wastes from all covid 19 infections including asymptomatic mildly symptomatic pre symptomatic and symptomatic ones it has the potential to provide comprehensive surveillance of disease transmission in a community however the wide distribution of sars cov 2 viral rna concentration in patients wastes e g 103 4 7 6 genome copies gram gc g feces cheung et al 2020 102 7 5 1 gc g pan et al 2020 and zero to 109 3 gc ml feng et al 2021 and changing viral load over the disease course wolfel et al 2020 have presented challenges in using wastewater to estimate covid 19 disease burden wu et al 2020 previous studies have reported rapid increasing of sars cov 2 rna concentration in wastewater at the rising limb of covid 19 outbreaks in communities medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 ahmed et al 2020a peccia et al 2020 hata et al 2021 while few studies have investigated the temporal dynamics of wastewater sars cov 2 rna during the recession limb of an outbreak graham et al 2021 d aoust et al 2021 the fact that the sewer collection system carries a continuous stream of wastewater also means that it may be used as a near real time pooled sampling instrument for the entire community providing rapid disease signals and enabling quick responses the symptomatic covid 19 infections are now known to start shedding virus in upper respiratory during the incubation period which typically lasts an average of 5 2 days li et al 2020 and the highest viral load was generally reported at the time of symptom onset jones et al 2020 accordingly pre symptomatic transmission was estimated to account for about 44 of secondary cases he et al 2020 and could contribute to sars cov 2 signals in wastewater asymptomatic infections which were estimated to represent 40 45 of total sars cov 2 infections and believed to play a significant role in viral transmission oran and topol 2020 could generate sars cov 2 signals in wastewater before emergence of clinical patients however our understanding of the temporal dynamics of sars cov 2 rna especially at fine scales such as daily in wastewater of communities that are experiencing ongoing covid 19 outbreaks remains very limited in august 2020 honolulu hawaii usa experienced a rapid surge of covid 19 cases which prompted a stay at home order that started on august 27 2020 and lasted for four weeks this provided a rare opportunity to investigate how sars cov 2 viral rna concentration in wastewater would respond to the expected rapid decreases of clinical cases in the community as a result of the emergency public health non pharmacological intervention in this study daily flow weighted composite raw wastewater samples were collected from the two largest wastewater treatment plants wwtps in honolulu and each wastewater sample was separated into a solid fraction and a liquid fraction the solid and liquid fractions of the wastewater samples were processed separately and the sars cov 2 rna concentration was measured by using three different rt qpcr assays concentrations of three endogenous fecal rna viruses which are usually used as surrogates for enteric viral pathogens in wastewater including f rna coliphages group ii g2 and group iii g3 friedman et al 2011 and pepper mild mottle virus pmmov rosario et al 2009 in the solid and liquid fractions of the samples were also determined in parallel the measured endogenous fecal rna viruses were subsequently used as global normalization to account for variations in wastewater fecal strength and the multi step quantification process 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater sampling and pre processing daily flow weighted composite samples of influent raw wastewater

august 27 2020 day 0 the total daily new covid 19 clinical case number in honolulu reached its highest peak of 303 7 day moving average of 217 on day 5 and then started trending downward reached a daily case of 82 7 day moving average of 89 on day 27 when the lockdown expired figure 1 on day 38 when the wastewater sampling campaign stopped the number of daily new cases was 41 7 day moving average of 75 corresponding to the decrease in new clinical cases resulting from the lockdown the measured sars cov 2 rna concentration in the wastewater samples also exhibited an overall downward trend and significant concentration fluctuations in both wwtps figure 2 for example in the si wwtp liquid fractions the sars cov 2 rna concentration showed ranges of 103 0 105 1 gc l 101 2 104 5 gc l and 102 0 104 5 gc l based on the n1 n2 and e gene assays respectively in the si wwtp solid fractions the sars cov 2 rna concentration also showed ranges of 104 1 105 5 gc g 101 5 106 0 gc g and 101 4 106 2 gc g based on the n1 n2 and e gene assays respectively similar concentration ranges were also detected in the wastewater liquid and solid fractions from the ho wwtp linear regression of the measured sars cov 2 rna concentration over time showed negative slopes range 0 019 to 0 070 x sx 0 039 0 019 for both liquid and solid fractions of wastewater samples from both wwtps and by all three quantification assays slopes of linear regression and pearson s r and p values are summarized in table s5 similar downward trends were also detected by calculating and plotting 7 day moving average data not shown 3 2 comparison of quantification assays measurements by the three quantification assays were plotted against each other and compared through correlation analysis figure 3 although all comparisons showed significant correlation pearson s r 0 65 0 81 p 0 001 for all comparisons the best correlation was observed between n2 and e gene in the liquid fractions pearson s r 0 81 p 0 001 between liquid and solid fractions the liquid fraction showed better pearson s r x sx 0 72 0 08 amongst the comparisons of three sars cov 2 genes and the pearson s r values were significant higher paired t test p 0 049 than those of the solid fractions x sx 0 57 0 08 3 3 sars cov 2 rna in solid and liquid fractions the time series data and their linear regression showed that in nearly all wastewater samples analyzed the solid and liquid fractions appeared to exhibit similar temporal fluctuation patterns while the solid fraction contained significantly higher quantity of sars cov 2 rna than the corresponding liquid fractions figure 2 to further investigate these relationships the measured sars cov 2 rna concentrations in the solid and liquid fractions of individual wastewater samples were plotted without the time variable and subjected to correlation analysis figure 4 significant correlation was observed between the measurements of sars cov 2 rna in the solid and liquid fractions based on all three quantification assays and in both wwtps for samples from the si wwtp figure 4a pearson s r values were 0 40 p 0 02 0 73 p 0 001 and 0 66 p 0 001 for n1 n2 and e gene assays respectively similar correlation coefficients r 0 61 p 0 001 0 82 p 0 001 and 0 70 p 0 001 for n1 n2 and e gene assays respectively were observed for the samples from the ho wwtp figure 4b when compared on an equal mass basis the measured concentrations of sars cov 2 rna in the solid fraction gc g were significantly higher than that in the liquid fraction gc ml paired t test p 0 001 the n1 concentration ratios between the solid and liquid fractions ml g were 104 00 sx 100 47 and 103 89 sx 100 35 for samples from the si and ho wwtps respectively the n2 concentration ratios between the solid and liquid fractions ml g were 104 31 sx 100 72 and 104 24 sx 100 51 for samples from the si and ho wwtps respectively the e concentration ratios between the solid and liquid fractions ml g were 103 83 sx 100 67 and 103 58 sx 100 51 for samples from the si and ho wwtps respectively since there were no statistical difference in the solid liquid concentration ratio between the si and ho wwtp t test p 0 30 0 65 and 0 08 for the n1 n2 and e assay results respectively data from the two wwtp plants were pooled to calculate the total mass distribution of sars cov 2 rna between the solid and liquid fractions of the wastewater samples after accounting for their respective mass percentages in individual samples average percentages of 90 5 sx 8 1 based on the n1 assay 92 5 sx 14 1 based on the n2 assay and 82 5 sx 19 9 based on the e assay of sars cov 2 rna resided in the solid fraction of the wastewater samples figure s3 3 4 normalization by endogenous fecal rna viruses to account for potential variations that may occur during the multi step process including fecal discharge sewer collection wastewater sample processing and the reverse transcription step of molecular quantification concentrations of three endogenous fecal rna viruses g2 g3 and pmmov in the same samples were determined and used to normalize the measured n1 n2 and e gene concentrations no obvious trend in the concentrations of the endogenous fecal rna viruses was observed in si or ho wwtp figure s4 overall the endogenous fecal rna viruses showed relatively stable concentration levels in spite of certain samples exhibiting significant variation in the wastewater samples from the si wwtp the g2 g3 and pmmov showed average concentrations in the liquid fractions of 104 1 sx 100 6 104 8 sx 100 9 and 105 8 sx 100 6 gc l respectively and average concentrations in the solid fraction of 105 0 sx 100 7 105 6 sx 100 9 and 106 2 sx 100 5 gc g respectively in the wastewater samples from the ho wwtp the g2 g3 and pmmov showed average concentrations in the liquid fractions of 105 6 sx 100 9 106 6 sx 100 8 and 106 5 sx 100 9 gc l respectively and average concentrations in the solid fraction of 104 3 sx 100 5 105 9 sx 100 7 and 106 4 sx 100 9 gc g respectively the normalized abundance of sars cov 2 rna still exhibited significant daily fluctuation and an overall downward trend over the sampling period in the wastewater samples from the si wwtp figure 5 using the e gene results as example in the liquid fractions from the si wwtp e g2 showed a range of 10 2 9 101 0 x sx 10 1 4 0 9 e g3 showed a range of 10 4 4 101 5 x sx 10 2 1 1 2 and e pmmov showed a range of 10 4 5 10 1 1 x sx 10 3 1 0 9 in the corresponding solid subsamples from the si wwtp e g2 showed a range of 10 2 9 101 0 x sx 10 1 4 1 0 e g3 showed a range of 10 5 6 100 5 x sx 10 2 5 1 4 and e pmmov showed a range of 10 5 0 10 0 7 x sx 10 3 1 0 9 a downward trend was observed in all normalized abundance in both liquid and solid fractions based on all three sars cov 2 rna quantification assays and three endogenous fecal rna viruses as indicated by the negative slopes of linear regression the slopes of the linear regression for the liquid fractions exhibited a range from 0 049 to 0 105 and the slopes of the linear regression for the solid fractions exhibited a range from 0 019 to 0 072 similar observations were made in the normalized abundance of sars cov 2 rna in the wastewater samples from the ho wwtp figure s5 slopes of linear regression and pearson s r and p values of normalized abundances are summarized in table s6 4 discussion the effectiveness of the non pharmacological intervention through a public health lockdown in controlling the covid 19 outbreak was indicated by the decreasing new clinical case numbers figure 1 and the decreasing of measured sars cov 2 rna concentration in the wastewater samples figure 2 similar trends were observed in both the solid and liquid fractions at both wwtps and by all three quantification assays which corroborated and supported the potential of using wastewater sars cov 2 concentration to monitor community disease burden this is congruent with previous observations where increasing wastewater sars cov 2 rna concentration corresponded to rapidly expanding covid 19 outbreaks medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 ahmed et al 2020a peccia et al 2020 and observations where reduction of clinical cases corresponded with decreasing wastewater sars cov 2 rna concentration graham et al 2021 the fine scale temporal dynamics enabled by the daily sampling in this study detected significant inter day fluctuation of the wastewater sars cov 2 rna abundance in both the liquid and solid fractions even within the same weeks for example the sars cov 2 rna concentration measured by the e gene assay in the liquid and solid fractions from the si wwtp decreased from 104 5 gc l and 106 2 gc g on day 3 to 103 6 gc l and 104 2 gc g on day 6 respectively recent studies also observed significant daily fluctuation of sars cov 2 rna concentration in sludge samples peccia et al 2020 many factors could have contributed to the observed inter day fluctuation including decay random measurement errors and fundamental underlying factors the relatively short hydraulic retention times of the wastewater collection systems i e a few hours in relation to the decay kinetics of sars cov 2 rna in untreated wastewater e g average t90 was shown to range from 8 04 to 27 8 days ahmed et al 2020b suggests decay may not be an important factor to the observed inter day variation since similar inter day fluctuations were observed by the three different assays figure 3 and between both solid and liquid fractions of wastewater samples figure 4 and the sample processing and molecular quantification methods used showed reasonable reproducibility i e sx of ct values of triplicate analysis less than 1 0 and 1 3 for liquid and solid fractions respectively random measurement errors in wastewater sampling and molecular analysis were unlikely to be the primary contributor to the significant inter day fluctuations observed how the fundamental underlying factors in particular varying viral shedding by infected individuals and daily fluctuations in disease burden in the community might have contributed to the observed inter day fluctuation of wastewater sars cov 2 rna concentration requires further investigation the wide range of sars cov 2 viral rna concentration detected in different patients wastes e g 102 7 7 6 gc g cheung et al 2020 pan et al 2020 and the rapid changing of fecal viral load in individual patients over the disease course jones et al 2020 wolfel et al 2020 can generate different fluxes of total sars cov 2 rna mass in the sewer systems significant daily fluctuation of new clinical cases in honolulu was also observed figure 1 which was similar to weekly inter day oscillations widely observed in other communities experiencing covid 19 disease outbreaks bukhari et al 2020 although this phenomenon has been considered by many to be primarily a reflection of diagnostic and reporting biases bergman et al 2020 contribution from fluctuations in disease burden remains as a possibility ricon becker et al 2020 as individual communities can experience different disease transmission dynamics nevertheless the observed significant inter day fluctuation could have significant implications in designing and conducting wastewater surveillance of covid 19 diseases in communities for example since daily flow weighted composite samples of influent raw wastewater could contain levels of sars cov 2 rna that differ by up to 101 7 folds as exampled above by the e gene results in the si wwtp one single daily flow weighted composite sample for a time interval e g a week may introduce significant variations in surveillance outcome although there has been no reported study on the concentration dynamics of sars cov 2 rna at even finer temporal scale e g intra day or hourly by inference wastewater grab samples are expected to experience even larger variations than daily flow weighted composite samples therefore composite samples over longer periods of time e g weekly composites may be needed to alleviate inter day fluctuation and provide smoothed depiction of disease burden in the community many rt qpcr assays with high specificity to the sars cov 2 rna have been developed to target different regions of the viral genome including e gene corman et al 2020 n gene lu et al 2020 orf1ab chinacdc 2020 and previous studies on wastewater have adopted these assays for detection in wastewater samples medema et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 graham et al 2021 sherchan et al 2020 since wastewater samples are much more complex than clinical samples this complexity needs to be taken into consideration in this study three different assays n1 n2 and e were used to provide independent analysis for redundancy and corroboration the significant correlation observed between results by the three assays figure 3 illustrated their general utility for wastewater samples interestingly the results also showed that the n2 and e gene assay results presented the best correlation coefficient than their respective correlation coefficients with the n1 assay results this is in line with previous observation that the n2 and e gene assays exhibited higher sensitivity than the n1 assay in clinical covid 19 samples nalla et al 2020b on the other hand different concentration results were obtained for the same samples by the different rt qpcr assays figure 2 which was also illustrated by the linear regression lines not passing through the origin figure 3 this can be attributed to the inherence variation in the rt qpcr processes which were also observed previously in clinical specimen nalla et al 2020a and in wastewater samples medema et al 2020 the separation of wastewater samples into solid and liquid fractions in this study not only provided a quasi replicate analysis of each wastewater sample but also allowed for side by side comparison of sars cov 2 rna concentration and calculation of its mass distribution between the solid and liquid fractions the significant correlation observed between the solid and liquid fractions by all three assays and in both wwtps figure 4 further supported the time series data observations of both the overall trend and the inter day fluctuation of the sars cov 2 rna concentration in wastewater figure 2 in spite of their different sensitivity and performance the three assays all reported significantly higher concentration of sars cov 2 in the solid fractions than in the liquid fractions with the solid liquid sars cov 2 rna concentration ratios ranging from 103 6 to 104 3 ml g several other studies have reported high levels of sars cov 2 rna in primary sludge samples peccia et al 2020 d aoust et al 2021 and also high ratios of sars cov 2 rna concentrations between primary sludge and raw influent samples e g 102 5 103 5 ml g graham et al 2021 previous laboratory experiments showed that enveloped mouse hepatitis virus mhv and bacteriophage phi6 exhibited partition coefficients of 103 2 and 103 1 ml g respectively ye et al 2016 the highly complex nature of the wastewater matrix also means that the resulting nucleic acid samples could potentially contain chemical inhibitors and a dominant background of non target nucleic acids which could introduce additional variations in both the reverse transcription and subsequent qpcr steps since chemical inhibition is most likely to occur in the reverse transcription step a highly inhibitor resistant reverse transcriptase ssiv which was shown to tolerate high level of chemical inhibitors e g 10 isopropanol and 0 05 of bile salts was used in this study to alleviate potential chemical inhibition the effectiveness of this strategy was supported by the detection of endogenous fecal indicator viruses in the wastewater samples in ranges similar to those reported in literature for example the measured pmmov concentration in the liquid and solid fractions of the wastewater samples in this study averaged at 106 5 gc l sx 100 9 gc l and 106 4 gc g sx 100 9 gc g similar concentrations were reported in the literature e g 106 6 gc l in raw wastewater kitajima et al 2014 and 106 3 gc g in wastewater sludge graham et al 2021 since the solid fraction of wastewater samples are more likely to suffer from chemical inhibition the detection of high solid liquid ratios of sars cov 2 in the wastewater samples up to 104 3 ml g further indicated that chemical inhibition although cannot be completely ruled out had limited impact on the sample analysis and particularly on the overall trend observed assuming any potential impact is consistent amongst the samples another source of potential variation was the multi step process that starts from varying fecal discharge by the community dilution and decay during sewer collection to different recovery during wastewater sample processing to globally account for the variations in the process this study also tested the feasibility of using three groups of endogenous fecal rna viruses g2 g3 and pmmov to normalize the measured sars cov 2 rna concentration g2 and g3 are inherently linked with fecal coliforms friedman et al 2011 while pmmov is highly abundant in wastewater due to human dietary consumption of pepper the latter of which has been used for sars cov 2 rna normalization in wastewater graham et al 2021 a previous study have shown that normalization of eae gene genetic marker for enteropathogenic e coli by uida gene genetic marker for general e coli in the same wastewater samples produced normalized abundance with much reduced variation over time yang et al 2014 although g2 g3 and pmmov are all non enveloped viruses which may exhibit different behaviors than enveloped viruses such as sars cov 2 during wastewater pre processing ye et al 2016 and even rna extraction their rna undergoes the same molecular quantification process and the normalized abundance is expected to remove impacts from potential chemical inhibition and or process efficiency variation within individual samples similar to the observations made with measured sars cov 2 rna concentration the normalized abundance still exhibited downward trend and inter day fluctuation over the sampling period figure 5 providing further support to the observations made by the direct concentration measurements 5 conclusion overall the study observed a downward trend of sars cov 2 rna abundance both measured concentrations and normalized abundance in the wastewater samples which corresponded to the decrease of clinical covid 19 new case numbers as a result of the public health lockdown in response to a community outbreak the fine scale temporal dynamics enabled by the daily sampling in this study detected significant daily fluctuation of the wastewater sars cov 2 rna abundance even within the same weeks indicating the fine scale temporal dynamics of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater needs to be taken into consideration in designing and implementing wastewater based surveillance the parallel quantification in solid and liquid fractions of the same wastewater samples indicated that the sars cov 2 viral rna is much more

17039,controlling membrane fouling in a membrane filtration system is critical to ensure high filtration performance a forecast of membrane fouling could enable preliminary actions to relieve the development of membrane fouling therefore we established a long short term memory lstm model to investigate the variations in filtration performance and fouling growth for data acquisition we first conducted lab scale membrane fouling experiments to identify the diverse fouling mechanisms of natural organic matter nom in nanofiltration nf systems four types of noms were considered as model foulants humic acid bovine serum albumin sodium alginate and tannic acid in addition real time 2d images were acquired via optical coherence tomography oct to quantify the cake layer formed on the membrane subsequently experimental data were used to train the lstm model to predict permeate flux and fouling layer thickness as output variables the model performance exhibited root mean square errors of 1 l m2 h for permeate flux and 10 µm for fouling layer thickness in both the training and validation steps in this study we demonstrated that deep learning can be used to simulate the

widely applied in water pretreatment purification or desalination processes cho et al 1999 henthorne and boysen 2015 it is a representative water treatment technology used to effectively eliminate harmful substances including suspended materials dissolved matter and ionic compounds leiknes and ødegaard 2007 radjenović et al 2008 steinle darling and reinhard 2008 xu 2005 however the membrane is susceptible to fouling which is caused by various substances present in the feed water this leads to a severe decrease in filtration performance zularisam et al 2006 in addition severe fouling necessitates cleaning or replacement of the membranes this increases the operating costs for water treatment d souza and mawson 2005 elimelech and phillip 2011 understanding the fouling formation mechanism has been considered an essential research topic for developing methods to effectively manage membrane filtration processes bao et al 2019 hoek and elimelech 2003 zularisam et al 2006 modeling studies have expanded the comprehension of filtration mechanisms by reflecting the physicochemical relationship between foulants and the filtration performance the early version of filtration models described the fouling mechanism in four cases standard pore constriction complete pore blocking intermediate blocking and cake formation hermia 1982 modified filtration models have been introduced to explain complex fouling mechanisms that cannot be elucidated via simple mathematical relationships jaffrin et al 1997 tien et al 2014 for example emami et al 2020 modified an intermediate pore blocking model to describe the fouling behavior of a highly interconnected porous membrane harouna et al 2019 combined two filtration mechanisms to optimize the filtration process which induced a transition from pore blocking to cake formation however these mathematical models exhibit limited feasibility because the mathematical model requires optimal model parameters to estimate the specific filtration performance and fouling formation in advance schmitt and do 2017 in other words the mathematical models need to be modified or newly defined despite minor variations in experimental conditions in addition their accuracies remain questionable even in lab scaling experiments which have less variability in flux and fouling shetty and chellam 2003 therefore a data driven model was proposed as an alternative to expand model feasibility and availability al aani et al 2019 newhart et al 2019 artificial neural networks anns have been used to develop fouling prediction models without requiring mathematical equations accounting for the relationship between input parameters and model outputs bowen et al 2000 ghandehari et al 2011 sargolzaei et al 2012 ann models have exhibited higher prediction accuracies than existing mathematical models of traditional filtration choi et al 2012 ghandehari et al 2011 schmitt et al 2018 recently an advanced neural network was introduced as a promising data driven model that utilizes deep learning dalto et al 2015 veselý et al 2013 deep learning is a state of the art technique that uses multiple interconnected networks for model training thereby considerably improving the training capacity and model accuracy in both classification and regression coudray et al 2018 qiu et al 2014 for the first time in membrane research park et al 2019a applied deep learning to estimate filtration performance and fouling growth based on real time fouling images and convolution neural networks cnns the result demonstrated the superiority of image based fouling prediction enabling improved prediction accuracy and visualization of fouling layer growth through 3d image production in addition the authors highlighted that this deep learning model should be further explored and applied in actual industrial fields with consideration for both experimental and modeling approaches it is noted that only a few works have focused on model development and its limitations and capability remain unexplored we introduce an advanced fouling prediction model that can evaluate diverse filtration conditions through an optimal time series prediction algorithm long short term memory lstm lstm is a representative neural network of a recurrent neural network rnn that predicts a current event based on previous sequential events the memorizing characteristic of lstm enables the provision of information regarding previous events for estimating a future event this affords a higher prediction performance than other machine learning models using ann and cnn alakus and turkoglu 2020 amarasinghe et al 2017 in this regard lstm has been successfully applied to various research fields e g meteorology and hydrology where temporal variation must be considered abbas et al 2020 le et al 2019 yaqub et al 2020 zhao et al 2017 hence lstm could be a more suitable model for membrane fouling affected by continuous filtration under varying feed water characteristics and operating conditions with this background we aim to develop a new fouling model based on lstm to estimate filtration performance and fouling development filtration experiments were conducted to obtain model training data under varying feed water and operating conditions simultaneously we considered quickly measurable water quality parameters and real time oct images as input parameters of the lstm model we expect that this approach and the findings will provide new insights into the capability of deep learning models in membrane science 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup 2 1 1 feed water preparation and nanofiltration system we prepared saline feed water by dissolving 3 5 g l of bay salt daeheung salt field korea and 1 9 g l of calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2 2h2o sigma aldrich usa in deionized water di water 18 20 mω cm with an electrical conductivity of 8 75 ms cm the bay salt mostly contained monovalent ions dissolved in seawater because its manufacturing process removes divalent ions thereafter we added large amounts of calcium ions to promote fouling driven by calcium nom complexation seidel and elimelech 2002 in addition we used four types of noms as the model foulants humic acid ha sigma aldrich bovine serum albumin bsa sigma aldrich sodium alginate sa sigma aldrich and tannic acid ta sigma aldrich these noms have distinct physicochemical properties resulting in different fouling phenomena at the membrane surface as well as the deterioration of filtration performance lee et al 2004 nghiem et al 2010 each nom was dissolved in di water and sufficiently disassembled using a sonicator hwashin tech co ltd korea for 15 min in addition each solution was filtered through a membrane filter mixed cellulose acetate advantec japan with a pore size of 0 45 μm to remove the undissolved nom in the solution a high rejection nf membrane ne 90 toray chemical japan was employed in the specially designed filtration module for real time monitoring where a transparent window was installed on top of the module for viewing the development of fouling on the membrane surface fig 1 park et al 2018 the dimensions of the flow channel inside the module were 6 6 0 8 cm width length height thus the corresponding membrane active area was 36 cm2 2 1 2 fouling test procedure five series of filtrations were designed to compare the fouling behaviors driven by different types of noms present in the feed water each filtration was performed using a single membrane as depicted in fig 2 filtration processes are described as follows step 0 prior to the fouling test di water passed through the nf membrane for 24 h under a pressure of 10 bar and a flow rate of 1 l min subsequently step 1 the di water was replaced with saline feed water 8 75 ms cm which was passed through the membrane module for 30 min step 2 nom ha at first was injected in the brackish water to achieve a dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of 20 mg c l simultaneously additional salts i e bay salt and calcium chloride were used to re adjust the electrical conductivity to 8 75 ms cm the filtration was performed under the same flow rate of 1 l min for 24 h however different pressures 10 15 and 20 bar were used steps 3 and 4 after 72 h of filtration the membrane surface was cleansed via two cleaning processes hydraulic cleaning feeding di for 24 h and chemical cleaning feeding 0 3 g l naoh for 30 min this was done under a flow rate of 2 5 l min without any applied pressure step 5 finally di water was passed through the membrane to wash out residual chemicals until the retentate water reached a ph of 7 step 6 the filtration procedure from steps 1 to 5 was repeated for individual noms bsa sa and ta and a mixture of the four noms for the mixture the doc concentration was maintained at 20 mg c l by adding equal amounts 5 mg c l of the four noms ha bsa sa and ta the operating conditions for each step are listed in table 1 2 1 3 water quality analyses the water quality parameters evaluated in this study were measured using the following methods a multi meter orion 3 star thermo fisher scientific corp usa was used to evaluate the ph and electrical conductivity of the feed water a toc analyzer toc v cph cpn shimadzu japan was used to measure the doc concentration of the nom stock solution a fluorometer cary eclipse varian usa was used to analyze the qualitative properties of the noms based on three dimensional fluorescence excitation and the emission matrix 3d feem kimura et al 2004 both excited and emitted wavelengths ranged from 220 to 500 nm at 10 nm intervals respectively each 3d feem was subtracted from that of di water to exclude the raman peak area to represent own fluorescence properties of each nom in the matrix the fluorescence of the feed solutions for each nom and the mixture was investigated as shown in fig 3 for individual noms the matrices showed distinct and individual fluorescence characteristics of each feed solution the feed solution containing ha exhibited a large peak in the 3d feem bsa exhibits two clear peaks similar to those of protein like fluorescence whereas sa and ta exhibit one clear peak and one weak peak over the investigated range similar results were reported by previous studies chen et al 2003 xia et al 2014 in the presence of various noms the observed peak was attributed to ha shen et al 2019 although the peak was slightly shifted leftward the matrix data were converted to fluorescence regional integration fri to apply as input data for the lstm model while the original fri data have five percentile indicators to refer to the relative intensity of fluorescence per designated area in the 3d feem chen et al 2003 we used a modified fri comprising 74 indicators to thoroughly account for the fluorescence characteristics of nom the modified fri was computed by considering that each indicator had a width and height of 20 nm 2 2 real time fouling investigation and image preprocessing real time monitoring of the growth of the fouling layer on the membrane surface was realized using spectral domain optical coherence tomography sd oct oz tec korea oct is a novel monitoring technology that can visualize cross sectional images of the target area with a high scanning rate and unharmful radiation li et al 2016 oct was used to visualize the center of the membrane and a target area with dimensions of 10 10 mm was monitored at intervals of 15 min throughout the filtration process to minimize observational errors caused by light scattering suspended particles etc the average of three individual images captured in a single instance was used for subsequent analyses the raw oct image data comprised 3000 1000 pixels width depth however we only adopted a high resolution rectangular area 500 500 pixels cropped above the center of the membrane this was to 1 classify objects into water membrane and fouling layer and 2 prevent quantification errors originating from an optical monitoring limitation this is because oct monitoring affords a relatively higher resolution in the central area where the camera is focused as compared to that at the edge of the monitoring area furthermore an image blurring deblurring preprocess was used to eliminate widely spread black white noise in matlab 2019b mathworks usa using a gaussian filter the cropped image was blurred with a 2d gaussian kernel 30 30 pixels under a standard deviation of 10 pixels this enabled the classification of each pixel information into three compartments water membrane and fouling based on k means clustering among the compartments modified image data were only included in two compartments membrane and fouling prior to deblurring the image data a blurred image was obtained using the deblurring gaussian filter comprising the gaussian kernel 10 10 pixels with a standard deviation of 5 binarization was applied to the deblurred image to divide the pixels as white for membrane and fouling compartments and black for water compartment in order to quantify the fouling layer thickness on the membrane surface thus the binarized image clearly represented the height of the fouling layer the number of white pixels in vertical was converted to metric scale with consideration for the calibrating factor 1 pixel 1 95 μm in real 2 3 deep learning model for fouling predictions 2 3 1 long short term memory in this study we used rnns which show superior performance for time series predictions hüsken and stagge 2003 lstm is a modified version of the rnn it can learn dependencies between time series data or sequential data in particular lstm allows the memorization of past events for estimating future events owing to its internal memory thereby overcoming the limitation of the rnn model i e the vanishing gradient problem hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 therefore this approach has been used in various research fields requiring a long short term time series estimation ma et al 2015 palangi et al 2016 sak et al 2014 as shown in fig 4 the architecture of the lstm model consists of 7 layers in the following order a sequence input layer lstm layer fully connected layer rectified linear unit relu layer dropout layer fully connected layer and regression layer the sequence input layer combines the time series input data and transfers it to the connecting neural networks for model training the lstm layer receives input data and then trains the lstm network to reflect the long term relationship of the time series data in the output results this is described in detail in the supplementary material fig s1 the fully connected layer transforms the size of vectors modified in the previous layers and transfers it to the activation function relu relu is an activation function that only extracts positive nodes thus it can determine whether the fully linearized neurons need to be activated nair and hinton 2010 the dropout layer is a representative regularization method that randomly deactivates neurons related to the result calculation thereby preventing over fitting during model training the regression layer includes a loss function to calculate the difference between the model prediction and the observation during model training 2 3 2 application of lstm for fouling prediction to simulate membrane filtration performance permeate flux and fouling thickness we considered six input parameters operation time modified fri pressure initial flux doc concentration and fouling thickness that could affect fouling development and permeate flux reduction fig s2 among the parameters the modified fri and doc concentration were used by the lstm model to discriminate the feed water characteristics the other parameters were used to provide the fundamental operational information and fouling information for model training note that the initial permeate flux is defined as the permeate flux right before the nom injection into the feed water or right after the applied pressure increases we set the time interval of all variables to 15 min and called the data acquisition time time step the input variables at four series time steps i e t 4 t 3 t 2 and t 1 were bound to one input data group enabling the lstm model to predict the output data group including the output at the next time step i e t fig 5 in other words the input variables of the input data groups were obtained 0 25 1 h earlier than the output variables consequently a total of 1420 data groups 284 groups per nom or mixed nom were prepared with the exception of the last initial four series time steps in the experiment per nom for the input output data among all groups 960 data groups 70 of total input data 192 groups per nom or the mixed noms were used to train the lstm model simplified to training dataset and the remaining 420 data groups 30 of total input data 84 groups per each nom or mixed nom were adopted to verify the validity of the trained lstm model simplified to validation dataset prior to training the model we randomly mixed the order of the data groups during training to improve the complexity of the training dataset and simultaneously prevent the lstm model from over fitting after training the lstm model with the training dataset we evaluated model performance using the validation dataset then we calculated and compared the accuracies of the prediction results for the training and validation datasets as described in the following sections 2 3 3 model assessment the model loss function is necessary to evaluate the lstm model performance by comparing the accuracy of model simulation with actual observations we applied two error indices r square r2 and root mean square error rmse they are expressed as 1 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 1 n p i p 2 i 1 2 3 n 2 rmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n i 1 2 3 n where o and p indicate the observed output values and predicted output values respectively n indicates the number of samples in each comparative group r2 is the square of the correlation coefficient that shows the relative relation between the observed and predicted values rmse is the absolute error in the predicted output values compared to the observed output values these loss functions were used to assess the observed and predicted permeate flux and fouling layer thickness respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 filtration performance permeate flux was expected to be the most characteristic parameter of membrane filtration as it represents the filtration mechanism and fouling formation the type of feed water and operating conditions determined the permeate flux and its variations during filtration kweon et al 2012 mi and elimelech 2010 in this study the initial permeate flux j0 ranged from 20 to 80 l m2 h depending on the type of model foulants and applied pressure for a consecutive filtration the permeate flux gradually decreased due to the increase of hydraulic resistance with the fouling generation while the extent was considerably different fig 6 a the filtration performance was investigated based on the change in the normalized permeate flux j j0 to elucidate the effect of fouling in specific filtration condition fig 6b the type of foulant influenced the permeate flux decline tendency different slopes were obtained depending on the foulants regardless of the applied pressure a linear decline was observed during the filtration of bsa whereas a curved decline was observed for the filtration of the other noms in addition the applied pressure affected the steepness of the flux decline curve as it determines the amount of permeate flux and fouling development under an applied pressure of 10 bar the normalized permeate flux exhibited steeper declines in the following order sa ha ta bsa this order changed to ta ha sa bsa when the applied pressure exceeded 15 bar fig 6b this change was because the effect of initial fouling on the non fouled membrane differed from that when fouling was in progress overall the normalized permeate flux plateaued after 12 h for all the filtration experiments kim and dempsey 2013 this could be explained by the change in the filtration mechanism i e pore blockage to cake filtration park et al 2020a or the approach to critical flux state in which fouling does not occur field et al 1995 meanwhile the plateau flux vanished when the applied pressure increased i e 10 to 15 bar and 15 to 20 bar but it plateaued after 12 h of filtration the initial drastic decline in permeate flux occurs when pore blocking contributes predominantly to membrane fouling park et al 2018 thereafter a linear flux decline was observed where cake formation was mainly responsible for membrane fouling during the filtration of ta a sudden decline in permeate flux was noted at all pressure conditions implying that pore blocking was the dominant fouling mechanism this is because ta has a partially lower molecular weight 0 1 1 7 kda than the molecular weight cut off mwco of the nf membrane 0 22 kda park et al 2020b in contrast ha filtration exhibited a severe flux decline that was affected by pore blockage and cake formation mainly originated from ha ca2 complexation park et al 2020a reported on the complexation effect between ha and calcium ions demonstrating a change in the filtration mechanism from pore blockage to cake filtration over time in the case of sa filtration a severe flux decline was observed at 10 bar whereas a moderate flux decline between those of ha and bsa was observed over an applied pressure of 15 bar this is because the strong intermolecular adhesion force of sa dramatically reduced the permeate flux and caused severe irreversible fouling at 10 bar melián martel et al 2018 as a result the permeate flux almost reached the limiting flux which does not increase with the transmembrane pressure increment thereby a relatively insignificant decline in the permeate flux was shown over an applied pressure of 15 bar bsa filtration exhibited the lowest flux decline among the foulants implying insignificant deterioration by pore blockage due to its substantially larger molecular weight 67 kda as compared to the mwco of the nf membrane nghiem et al 2010 for the nom mixture a complex flux decline trend was observed as the feed water comprised four noms this resulted in a curved decline in permeate flux during the initial 24 h of filtration this trend was similar to that observed during the filtration of ha sa and ta which exhibited two fouling mechanisms pore blockage and cake filtration park et al 2018 after 24 h however cake filtration became the dominant filtration mechanism representing a linear flux decline similar to that observed during bsa filtration meanwhile the permeate flux for the pristine membrane was 66 7 1 7 l m2 h under a pressure of 10 bar without any pollutant salt or foulant fig 6c but the consecutive fouling experiments gradually reduced the intrinsic permeability of the membrane because of the irreversible fouling which was not removed by the cleaning process among the foulants sa caused the most severe deterioration in the membrane permeability reducing the initial permeate flux by about 50 this result was consistent with the previous discussion about sa fouling 3 2 fouling layer growth real time oct monitoring was used to evaluate the fouling layer growth during filtration dreszer et al 2014 the obtained 2d cross sectional images provided metric scaled thickness µm information for the fouling layer formed on the nf membrane fig 7 on the membrane surface distinct fouling layers were observed when the feed water contained ha for both ha and the nom mixture fig s3 in contrast there was no distinguishable layer formed during the filtration of bsa sa or ta the development of a thick fouling layer can be explained by the fact that the carboxylic functional group of ha forms a complex with calcium ions hong and elimelech 1997 consequently the fouling layer thickness increases over time in the presence of ha meanwhile the growth rate gradually reduced over time which is likely because the amount of ha ca2 complex in the feed solution decreased over time for the batch system in the case of ha filtration most of the ha was accumulated on the membrane causing the fouling layer thickness to increase abruptly to more than 200 µm after 12 h of filtration fig 7a thereafter the fouling layer thickness continuously increased to exceed 550 µm due to the increase in applied pressure similarly the nom mixture initially led to the rapid development of the fouling layer but the growth rate gradually decreased over time fig 7b the different growth rates were most likely influenced by the amount of ha in the feed water because ha is a dominant factor in promoting the development of a distinct fouling layer on the membrane thus a relatively moderate growth rate was observed during the nom mixture filtration as compared to that during the filtration of ha alone the fouling layer thickness increased up to 200 µm during the initial phase of filtration 10 bar and slowly increased to 250 µm in the latter stages 15 and 20 bar this likely because the 5 mg c l of ha in the feed solution was consumed to form the fouling layer and the amount of available ha gradually decreased 3 3 filtration performance prediction an lstm model was developed to estimate filtration performance in accordance with the fouling development based on filtration data and feed water characteristics i e modified fri the lstm model could successfully predict the permeate flux at time t when the model receives four sequential input parameters obtained at t 4 to t 1 the prediction was well matched with the observation though the lstm model has considered only six input parameters for prediction fig s4 for the consecutive filtration the model clearly discriminated all feed water and operating conditions showing a good agreement with the observation this demonstrates that the trained lstm model could predict the permeate flux variation involving the changes in the type of the feed water and operating conditions fig 8 in addition a minor difference in prediction accuracy proved that the lstm model did not suffer from over fitting which is the most critical problem in data driven models jabbar and khan 2015 kuhn and johnson 2013 specifically the lstm model predicted individual nom filtration more accurately than the filtration of the nom mixture showing a slightly higher correlation r2 0 9992 0 9834 for training r2 0 9982 0 9706 for validation although the difference can be deemed negligible it could imply that the prediction for the nom mixture was affected by the overlapped input information i e modified fri from single nom filtration for instance the information of the nom mixture contained information regarding the four noms obtained through modified fri in addition the lstm model seemed to be influenced by the diversity of the training data as it represented partially over or under estimated permeate flux especially at the initial stages of the operation i e immediately after nom injection in the feed solution or a higher pressure was applied fig 8 hence the lstm model has a minor limitation in predicting the instant at which drastic variations occur in the permeate flux although the overall tendency of prediction corresponds with the observations this is because the lstm model reflects a series of past events to predict future events therefore it is not affected significantly by sudden changes such as the considerable increase in flux under a higher applied pressure malhotra et al 2015 sak et al 2014 nonetheless this limitation can be overcome by increasing the number of learning datasets such that they reflect various filtration cases including similar cases for deep learning models the number of datasets is a particularly important factor because it helps define a causal relationship between input information and the output this enhances the prediction performance barbedo 2018 in other words it is expected that the lstm model can recognize sudden flux variations as normal events provided it is trained on datasets of similar scenarios 3 4 fouling layer growth prediction this study applied information regarding the fouling layer thickness in the lstm model using real time monitoring images consequently the model could successfully predict thickness variations in accordance with the foulants the model prediction performance was separately compared for the cases of individual nom filtration and filtration of the nom mixture however fouling layer occurred during ha and nom mixture filtration fig 9 the lstm model prediction had a high correlation with the observation representing r2 values exceeding 0 98 for both training and validation similar to the prediction for permeate flux the prediction accuracy was slightly higher r2 0 9992 0 9910 for training r2 0 9987 0 9803 for validation when estimating the fouling layer thickness for single nom filtration compared to the nom mixture as discussed before this is caused by the interference involved in the filtration of the nom mixture in general the predicted fouling layer thickness was in good agreement with the observed thickness without irregular predictions fig s5 minor underestimation was observed when the filtration time exceeded 60 h in the case of ha filtration this is likely caused by the different fouling layer growth rates during the filtration of ha and the nom mixture after 12 h of filtration the growth rate for ha filtration was maintained whereas it continuously reduced during the filtration of the nom mixture moreover a less accurate prediction was obtained for the nom mixture filtration at a thickness of less than 150 µm fig 9d the small number of observation points may have caused this deviation which resulted in less chance to train the lstm model for predicting the thickness in the range in other words this error could be reduced by considering additional cases of fouling layer growth therefore the lstm model should be trained on additional datasets involving various feed conditions in order to achieve better predictions of filtration performance and fouling layer growth 3 5 implications and directions for future research herein we explored a deep learning model which can estimate a membrane filtration process involving feed water containing noms the proposed lstm model represented a highly accurate prediction for the deterioration of filtration performance as well as the growth of the fouling layer at time step t with consideration for time series information obtained at time steps t 4 to t 1 in addition the lstm model could perceive the complexity of membrane fouling through multiple input parameters i e operation time modified fri pressure initial permeate flux doc concentration and fouling layer thickness thereby it could consider more fouling factors compared to the conventional mathematical models and the early deep learning models park et al 2018 park et al 2019b recently proposed deep learning model was developed to estimate the membrane fouling using an image based cnn model park et al 2019b although the cnn model successfully predicted the filtration performance using fouling images and the corresponding filtration condition the cnn model lacked the reflection on feed water conditions and operating information as it considered a single filtration scenario and mainly focused on the image processing in contrast to the cnn model therefore the lstm model could be a more feasible and practical trial for industrial applications where diverse filtration conditions should be considered as we applied various noms and operating pressure in the model this is because the industrial filtration processes have performed to treat different types of feed water under varying operating conditions regarding this issue the following consideration could render the lstm model more feasible the consideration of much more operational variables and conditions e g membrane type inflow velocity ph temperature for model development it is the most basic and common strategy to extend the capability of the data driven model especially it is expected that the consideration of the cleaning process would enhance the feasibility of the model much higher because the cleaning is highly related to the recovery of the filtration performance li and elimelech 2004 mi and elimelech 2010 in actual filtration systems cleaning is a necessarily required process but there was no adequate model that takes account of the effect on the filtration performance due to lots of associating variables e g the type of cleaner the amount of cleaner the type of foulant kweon et al 2012 thus the proposed modeling approach can be applied to develop a model without identifying the complex relationships between variables simultaneously it can be a more accurate model by applying a newly developed and optimal model in order to increase the accuracy in prediction this is due to that the structure of the deep learning model is highly dependent on the purpose or characteristics of given datasets le et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 in practice it would be a good trial to combine cnn and lstm structure if the purpose and given datasets require characteristics of cnn e g image processing capability and lstm a time series prediction song et al 2019 xie et al 2020 4 conclusions in this study we experimentally identified the effects of fouling caused by noms on the filtration performance and then applied time series datasets to the lstm model to predict the variations in filtration performance and the growth of the fouling layer the major findings of this study are summarized below filtration of the four noms and their mixture exhibited complicated filtration data under different filtration conditions the lstm model was applied to estimate the filtration performance and the fouling layer thickness using time series datasets the lstm model successfully predicted two parameters permeate flux and fouling layer thickness the results were in good agreement with the observed data for both individual nom filtration and the nom mixture filtration the r2 values indicated a high prediction accuracy of the lstm model for training r2 0 98 and validation r2 0 97 in particular for individual nom filtration a relatively high prediction accuracy was observed this is because the prediction for the filtration of the nom mixture which comprised four noms was affected by the training information for individual nom filtration although the proposed lstm model showed good performance under various experimental conditions the model still involved minor issues that need to be addressed this deep learning approach for fouling prediction still requires significant attention and further developments to be applied as a global model for practical scenarios therefore we suggest that additional operational conditions and case studies should be considered to build a more practical model in future research declaration of competing interest the authors

widely applied in water pretreatment purification or desalination processes cho et al 1999 henthorne and boysen 2015 it is a representative water treatment technology used to effectively eliminate harmful substances including suspended materials dissolved matter and ionic compounds leiknes and ødegaard 2007 radjenović et al 2008 steinle darling and reinhard 2008 xu 2005 however the membrane is susceptible to fouling which is caused by various substances present in the feed water this leads to a severe decrease in filtration performance zularisam et al 2006 in addition severe fouling necessitates cleaning or replacement of the membranes this increases the operating costs for water treatment d souza and mawson 2005 elimelech and phillip 2011 understanding the fouling formation mechanism has been considered an essential research topic for developing methods to effectively manage membrane filtration processes bao et al 2019 hoek and elimelech 2003 zularisam et al 2006 modeling studies have expanded the comprehension of filtration mechanisms by reflecting the physicochemical relationship between foulants and the filtration performance the early version of filtration models described the fouling mechanism in four cases standard pore constriction complete pore blocking intermediate blocking and cake formation hermia 1982 modified filtration models have been introduced to explain complex fouling mechanisms that cannot be elucidated via simple mathematical relationships jaffrin et al 1997 tien et al 2014 for example emami et al 2020 modified an intermediate pore blocking model to describe the fouling behavior of a highly interconnected porous membrane harouna et al 2019 combined two filtration mechanisms to optimize the filtration process which induced a transition from pore blocking to cake formation however these mathematical models exhibit limited feasibility because the mathematical model requires optimal model parameters to estimate the specific filtration performance and fouling formation in advance schmitt and do 2017 in other words the mathematical models need to be modified or newly defined despite minor variations in experimental conditions in addition their accuracies remain questionable even in lab scaling experiments which have less variability in flux and fouling shetty and chellam 2003 therefore a data driven model was proposed as an alternative to expand model feasibility and availability al aani et al 2019 newhart et al 2019 artificial neural networks anns have been used to develop fouling prediction models without requiring mathematical equations accounting for the relationship between input parameters and model outputs bowen et al 2000 ghandehari et al 2011 sargolzaei et al 2012 ann models have exhibited higher prediction accuracies than existing mathematical models of traditional filtration choi et al 2012 ghandehari et al 2011 schmitt et al 2018 recently an advanced neural network was introduced as a promising data driven model that utilizes deep learning dalto et al 2015 veselý et al 2013 deep learning is a state of the art technique that uses multiple interconnected networks for model training thereby considerably improving the training capacity and model accuracy in both classification and regression coudray et al 2018 qiu et al 2014 for the first time in membrane research park et al 2019a applied deep learning to estimate filtration performance and fouling growth based on real time fouling images and convolution neural networks cnns the result demonstrated the superiority of image based fouling prediction enabling improved prediction accuracy and visualization of fouling layer growth through 3d image production in addition the authors highlighted that this deep learning model should be further explored and applied in actual industrial fields with consideration for both experimental and modeling approaches it is noted that only a few works have focused on model development and its limitations and capability remain unexplored we introduce an advanced fouling prediction model that can evaluate diverse filtration conditions through an optimal time series prediction algorithm long short term memory lstm lstm is a representative neural network of a recurrent neural network rnn that predicts a current event based on previous sequential events the memorizing characteristic of lstm enables the provision of information regarding previous events for estimating a future event this affords a higher prediction performance than other machine learning models using ann and cnn alakus and turkoglu 2020 amarasinghe et al 2017 in this regard lstm has been successfully applied to various research fields e g meteorology and hydrology where temporal variation must be considered abbas et al 2020 le et al 2019 yaqub et al 2020 zhao et al 2017 hence lstm could be a more suitable model for membrane fouling affected by continuous filtration under varying feed water characteristics and operating conditions with this background we aim to develop a new fouling model based on lstm to estimate filtration performance and fouling development filtration experiments were conducted to obtain model training data under varying feed water and operating conditions simultaneously we considered quickly measurable water quality parameters and real time oct images as input parameters of the lstm model we expect that this approach and the findings will provide new insights into the capability of deep learning models in membrane science 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup 2 1 1 feed water preparation and nanofiltration system we prepared saline feed water by dissolving 3 5 g l of bay salt daeheung salt field korea and 1 9 g l of calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2 2h2o sigma aldrich usa in deionized water di water 18 20 mω cm with an electrical conductivity of 8 75 ms cm the bay salt mostly contained monovalent ions dissolved in seawater because its manufacturing process removes divalent ions thereafter we added large amounts of calcium ions to promote fouling driven by calcium nom complexation seidel and elimelech 2002 in addition we used four types of noms as the model foulants humic acid ha sigma aldrich bovine serum albumin bsa sigma aldrich sodium alginate sa sigma aldrich and tannic acid ta sigma aldrich these noms have distinct physicochemical properties resulting in different fouling phenomena at the membrane surface as well as the deterioration of filtration performance lee et al 2004 nghiem et al 2010 each nom was dissolved in di water and sufficiently disassembled using a sonicator hwashin tech co ltd korea for 15 min in addition each solution was filtered through a membrane filter mixed cellulose acetate advantec japan with a pore size of 0 45 μm to remove the undissolved nom in the solution a high rejection nf membrane ne 90 toray chemical japan was employed in the specially designed filtration module for real time monitoring where a transparent window was installed on top of the module for viewing the development of fouling on the membrane surface fig 1 park et al 2018 the dimensions of the flow channel inside the module were 6 6 0 8 cm width length height thus the corresponding membrane active area was 36 cm2 2 1 2 fouling test procedure five series of filtrations were designed to compare the fouling behaviors driven by different types of noms present in the feed water each filtration was performed using a single membrane as depicted in fig 2 filtration processes are described as follows step 0 prior to the fouling test di water passed through the nf membrane for 24 h under a pressure of 10 bar and a flow rate of 1 l min subsequently step 1 the di water was replaced with saline feed water 8 75 ms cm which was passed through the membrane module for 30 min step 2 nom ha at first was injected in the brackish water to achieve a dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of 20 mg c l simultaneously additional salts i e bay salt and calcium chloride were used to re adjust the electrical conductivity to 8 75 ms cm the filtration was performed under the same flow rate of 1 l min for 24 h however different pressures 10 15 and 20 bar were used steps 3 and 4 after 72 h of filtration the membrane surface was cleansed via two cleaning processes hydraulic cleaning feeding di for 24 h and chemical cleaning feeding 0 3 g l naoh for 30 min this was done under a flow rate of 2 5 l min without any applied pressure step 5 finally di water was passed through the membrane to wash out residual chemicals until the retentate water reached a ph of 7 step 6 the filtration procedure from steps 1 to 5 was repeated for individual noms bsa sa and ta and a mixture of the four noms for the mixture the doc concentration was maintained at 20 mg c l by adding equal amounts 5 mg c l of the four noms ha bsa sa and ta the operating conditions for each step are listed in table 1 2 1 3 water quality analyses the water quality parameters evaluated in this study were measured using the following methods a multi meter orion 3 star thermo fisher scientific corp usa was used to evaluate the ph and electrical conductivity of the feed water a toc analyzer toc v cph cpn shimadzu japan was used to measure the doc concentration of the nom stock solution a fluorometer cary eclipse varian usa was used to analyze the qualitative properties of the noms based on three dimensional fluorescence excitation and the emission matrix 3d feem kimura et al 2004 both excited and emitted wavelengths ranged from 220 to 500 nm at 10 nm intervals respectively each 3d feem was subtracted from that of di water to exclude the raman peak area to represent own fluorescence properties of each nom in the matrix the fluorescence of the feed solutions for each nom and the mixture was investigated as shown in fig 3 for individual noms the matrices showed distinct and individual fluorescence characteristics of each feed solution the feed solution containing ha exhibited a large peak in the 3d feem bsa exhibits two clear peaks similar to those of protein like fluorescence whereas sa and ta exhibit one clear peak and one weak peak over the investigated range similar results were reported by previous studies chen et al 2003 xia et al 2014 in the presence of various noms the observed peak was attributed to ha shen et al 2019 although the peak was slightly shifted leftward the matrix data were converted to fluorescence regional integration fri to apply as input data for the lstm model while the original fri data have five percentile indicators to refer to the relative intensity of fluorescence per designated area in the 3d feem chen et al 2003 we used a modified fri comprising 74 indicators to thoroughly account for the fluorescence characteristics of nom the modified fri was computed by considering that each indicator had a width and height of 20 nm 2 2 real time fouling investigation and image preprocessing real time monitoring of the growth of the fouling layer on the membrane surface was realized using spectral domain optical coherence tomography sd oct oz tec korea oct is a novel monitoring technology that can visualize cross sectional images of the target area with a high scanning rate and unharmful radiation li et al 2016 oct was used to visualize the center of the membrane and a target area with dimensions of 10 10 mm was monitored at intervals of 15 min throughout the filtration process to minimize observational errors caused by light scattering suspended particles etc the average of three individual images captured in a single instance was used for subsequent analyses the raw oct image data comprised 3000 1000 pixels width depth however we only adopted a high resolution rectangular area 500 500 pixels cropped above the center of the membrane this was to 1 classify objects into water membrane and fouling layer and 2 prevent quantification errors originating from an optical monitoring limitation this is because oct monitoring affords a relatively higher resolution in the central area where the camera is focused as compared to that at the edge of the monitoring area furthermore an image blurring deblurring preprocess was used to eliminate widely spread black white noise in matlab 2019b mathworks usa using a gaussian filter the cropped image was blurred with a 2d gaussian kernel 30 30 pixels under a standard deviation of 10 pixels this enabled the classification of each pixel information into three compartments water membrane and fouling based on k means clustering among the compartments modified image data were only included in two compartments membrane and fouling prior to deblurring the image data a blurred image was obtained using the deblurring gaussian filter comprising the gaussian kernel 10 10 pixels with a standard deviation of 5 binarization was applied to the deblurred image to divide the pixels as white for membrane and fouling compartments and black for water compartment in order to quantify the fouling layer thickness on the membrane surface thus the binarized image clearly represented the height of the fouling layer the number of white pixels in vertical was converted to metric scale with consideration for the calibrating factor 1 pixel 1 95 μm in real 2 3 deep learning model for fouling predictions 2 3 1 long short term memory in this study we used rnns which show superior performance for time series predictions hüsken and stagge 2003 lstm is a modified version of the rnn it can learn dependencies between time series data or sequential data in particular lstm allows the memorization of past events for estimating future events owing to its internal memory thereby overcoming the limitation of the rnn model i e the vanishing gradient problem hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 therefore this approach has been used in various research fields requiring a long short term time series estimation ma et al 2015 palangi et al 2016 sak et al 2014 as shown in fig 4 the architecture of the lstm model consists of 7 layers in the following order a sequence input layer lstm layer fully connected layer rectified linear unit relu layer dropout layer fully connected layer and regression layer the sequence input layer combines the time series input data and transfers it to the connecting neural networks for model training the lstm layer receives input data and then trains the lstm network to reflect the long term relationship of the time series data in the output results this is described in detail in the supplementary material fig s1 the fully connected layer transforms the size of vectors modified in the previous layers and transfers it to the activation function relu relu is an activation function that only extracts positive nodes thus it can determine whether the fully linearized neurons need to be activated nair and hinton 2010 the dropout layer is a representative regularization method that randomly deactivates neurons related to the result calculation thereby preventing over fitting during model training the regression layer includes a loss function to calculate the difference between the model prediction and the observation during model training 2 3 2 application of lstm for fouling prediction to simulate membrane filtration performance permeate flux and fouling thickness we considered six input parameters operation time modified fri pressure initial flux doc concentration and fouling thickness that could affect fouling development and permeate flux reduction fig s2 among the parameters the modified fri and doc concentration were used by the lstm model to discriminate the feed water characteristics the other parameters were used to provide the fundamental operational information and fouling information for model training note that the initial permeate flux is defined as the permeate flux right before the nom injection into the feed water or right after the applied pressure increases we set the time interval of all variables to 15 min and called the data acquisition time time step the input variables at four series time steps i e t 4 t 3 t 2 and t 1 were bound to one input data group enabling the lstm model to predict the output data group including the output at the next time step i e t fig 5 in other words the input variables of the input data groups were obtained 0 25 1 h earlier than the output variables consequently a total of 1420 data groups 284 groups per nom or mixed nom were prepared with the exception of the last initial four series time steps in the experiment per nom for the input output data among all groups 960 data groups 70 of total input data 192 groups per nom or the mixed noms were used to train the lstm model simplified to training dataset and the remaining 420 data groups 30 of total input data 84 groups per each nom or mixed nom were adopted to verify the validity of the trained lstm model simplified to validation dataset prior to training the model we randomly mixed the order of the data groups during training to improve the complexity of the training dataset and simultaneously prevent the lstm model from over fitting after training the lstm model with the training dataset we evaluated model performance using the validation dataset then we calculated and compared the accuracies of the prediction results for the training and validation datasets as described in the following sections 2 3 3 model assessment the model loss function is necessary to evaluate the lstm model performance by comparing the accuracy of model simulation with actual observations we applied two error indices r square r2 and root mean square error rmse they are expressed as 1 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 1 n p i p 2 i 1 2 3 n 2 rmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n i 1 2 3 n where o and p indicate the observed output values and predicted output values respectively n indicates the number of samples in each comparative group r2 is the square of the correlation coefficient that shows the relative relation between the observed and predicted values rmse is the absolute error in the predicted output values compared to the observed output values these loss functions were used to assess the observed and predicted permeate flux and fouling layer thickness respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 filtration performance permeate flux was expected to be the most characteristic parameter of membrane filtration as it represents the filtration mechanism and fouling formation the type of feed water and operating conditions determined the permeate flux and its variations during filtration kweon et al 2012 mi and elimelech 2010 in this study the initial permeate flux j0 ranged from 20 to 80 l m2 h depending on the type of model foulants and applied pressure for a consecutive filtration the permeate flux gradually decreased due to the increase of hydraulic resistance with the fouling generation while the extent was considerably different fig 6 a the filtration performance was investigated based on the change in the normalized permeate flux j j0 to elucidate the effect of fouling in specific filtration condition fig 6b the type of foulant influenced the permeate flux decline tendency different slopes were obtained depending on the foulants regardless of the applied pressure a linear decline was observed during the filtration of bsa whereas a curved decline was observed for the filtration of the other noms in addition the applied pressure affected the steepness of the flux decline curve as it determines the amount of permeate flux and fouling development under an applied pressure of 10 bar the normalized permeate flux exhibited steeper declines in the following order sa ha ta bsa this order changed to ta ha sa bsa when the applied pressure exceeded 15 bar fig 6b this change was because the effect of initial fouling on the non fouled membrane differed from that when fouling was in progress overall the normalized permeate flux plateaued after 12 h for all the filtration experiments kim and dempsey 2013 this could be explained by the change in the filtration mechanism i e pore blockage to cake filtration park et al 2020a or the approach to critical flux state in which fouling does not occur field et al 1995 meanwhile the plateau flux vanished when the applied pressure increased i e 10 to 15 bar and 15 to 20 bar but it plateaued after 12 h of filtration the initial drastic decline in permeate flux occurs when pore blocking contributes predominantly to membrane fouling park et al 2018 thereafter a linear flux decline was observed where cake formation was mainly responsible for membrane fouling during the filtration of ta a sudden decline in permeate flux was noted at all pressure conditions implying that pore blocking was the dominant fouling mechanism this is because ta has a partially lower molecular weight 0 1 1 7 kda than the molecular weight cut off mwco of the nf membrane 0 22 kda park et al 2020b in contrast ha filtration exhibited a severe flux decline that was affected by pore blockage and cake formation mainly originated from ha ca2 complexation park et al 2020a reported on the complexation effect between ha and calcium ions demonstrating a change in the filtration mechanism from pore blockage to cake filtration over time in the case of sa filtration a severe flux decline was observed at 10 bar whereas a moderate flux decline between those of ha and bsa was observed over an applied pressure of 15 bar this is because the strong intermolecular adhesion force of sa dramatically reduced the permeate flux and caused severe irreversible fouling at 10 bar melián martel et al 2018 as a result the permeate flux almost reached the limiting flux which does not increase with the transmembrane pressure increment thereby a relatively insignificant decline in the permeate flux was shown over an applied pressure of 15 bar bsa filtration exhibited the lowest flux decline among the foulants implying insignificant deterioration by pore blockage due to its substantially larger molecular weight 67 kda as compared to the mwco of the nf membrane nghiem et al 2010 for the nom mixture a complex flux decline trend was observed as the feed water comprised four noms this resulted in a curved decline in permeate flux during the initial 24 h of filtration this trend was similar to that observed during the filtration of ha sa and ta which exhibited two fouling mechanisms pore blockage and cake filtration park et al 2018 after 24 h however cake filtration became the dominant filtration mechanism representing a linear flux decline similar to that observed during bsa filtration meanwhile the permeate flux for the pristine membrane was 66 7 1 7 l m2 h under a pressure of 10 bar without any pollutant salt or foulant fig 6c but the consecutive fouling experiments gradually reduced the intrinsic permeability of the membrane because of the irreversible fouling which was not removed by the cleaning process among the foulants sa caused the most severe deterioration in the membrane permeability reducing the initial permeate flux by about 50 this result was consistent with the previous discussion about sa fouling 3 2 fouling layer growth real time oct monitoring was used to evaluate the fouling layer growth during filtration dreszer et al 2014 the obtained 2d cross sectional images provided metric scaled thickness µm information for the fouling layer formed on the nf membrane fig 7 on the membrane surface distinct fouling layers were observed when the feed water contained ha for both ha and the nom mixture fig s3 in contrast there was no distinguishable layer formed during the filtration of bsa sa or ta the development of a thick fouling layer can be explained by the fact that the carboxylic functional group of ha forms a complex with calcium ions hong and elimelech 1997 consequently the fouling layer thickness increases over time in the presence of ha meanwhile the growth rate gradually reduced over time which is likely because the amount of ha ca2 complex in the feed solution decreased over time for the batch system in the case of ha filtration most of the ha was accumulated on the membrane causing the fouling layer thickness to increase abruptly to more than 200 µm after 12 h of filtration fig 7a thereafter the fouling layer thickness continuously increased to exceed 550 µm due to the increase in applied pressure similarly the nom mixture initially led to the rapid development of the fouling layer but the growth rate gradually decreased over time fig 7b the different growth rates were most likely influenced by the amount of ha in the feed water because ha is a dominant factor in promoting the development of a distinct fouling layer on the membrane thus a relatively moderate growth rate was observed during the nom mixture filtration as compared to that during the filtration of ha alone the fouling layer thickness increased up to 200 µm during the initial phase of filtration 10 bar and slowly increased to 250 µm in the latter stages 15 and 20 bar this likely because the 5 mg c l of ha in the feed solution was consumed to form the fouling layer and the amount of available ha gradually decreased 3 3 filtration performance prediction an lstm model was developed to estimate filtration performance in accordance with the fouling development based on filtration data and feed water characteristics i e modified fri the lstm model could successfully predict the permeate flux at time t when the model receives four sequential input parameters obtained at t 4 to t 1 the prediction was well matched with the observation though the lstm model has considered only six input parameters for prediction fig s4 for the consecutive filtration the model clearly discriminated all feed water and operating conditions showing a good agreement with the observation this demonstrates that the trained lstm model could predict the permeate flux variation involving the changes in the type of the feed water and operating conditions fig 8 in addition a minor difference in prediction accuracy proved that the lstm model did not suffer from over fitting which is the most critical problem in data driven models jabbar and khan 2015 kuhn and johnson 2013 specifically the lstm model predicted individual nom filtration more accurately than the filtration of the nom mixture showing a slightly higher correlation r2 0 9992 0 9834 for training r2 0 9982 0 9706 for validation although the difference can be deemed negligible it could imply that the prediction for the nom mixture was affected by the overlapped input information i e modified fri from single nom filtration for instance the information of the nom mixture contained information regarding the four noms obtained through modified fri in addition the lstm model seemed to be influenced by the diversity of the training data as it represented partially over or under estimated permeate flux especially at the initial stages of the operation i e immediately after nom injection in the feed solution or a higher pressure was applied fig 8 hence the lstm model has a minor limitation in predicting the instant at which drastic variations occur in the permeate flux although the overall tendency of prediction corresponds with the observations this is because the lstm model reflects a series of past events to predict future events therefore it is not affected significantly by sudden changes such as the considerable increase in flux under a higher applied pressure malhotra et al 2015 sak et al 2014 nonetheless this limitation can be overcome by increasing the number of learning datasets such that they reflect various filtration cases including similar cases for deep learning models the number of datasets is a particularly important factor because it helps define a causal relationship between input information and the output this enhances the prediction performance barbedo 2018 in other words it is expected that the lstm model can recognize sudden flux variations as normal events provided it is trained on datasets of similar scenarios 3 4 fouling layer growth prediction this study applied information regarding the fouling layer thickness in the lstm model using real time monitoring images consequently the model could successfully predict thickness variations in accordance with the foulants the model prediction performance was separately compared for the cases of individual nom filtration and filtration of the nom mixture however fouling layer occurred during ha and nom mixture filtration fig 9 the lstm model prediction had a high correlation with the observation representing r2 values exceeding 0 98 for both training and validation similar to the prediction for permeate flux the prediction accuracy was slightly higher r2 0 9992 0 9910 for training r2 0 9987 0 9803 for validation when estimating the fouling layer thickness for single nom filtration compared to the nom mixture as discussed before this is caused by the interference involved in the filtration of the nom mixture in general the predicted fouling layer thickness was in good agreement with the observed thickness without irregular predictions fig s5 minor underestimation was observed when the filtration time exceeded 60 h in the case of ha filtration this is likely caused by the different fouling layer growth rates during the filtration of ha and the nom mixture after 12 h of filtration the growth rate for ha filtration was maintained whereas it continuously reduced during the filtration of the nom mixture moreover a less accurate prediction was obtained for the nom mixture filtration at a thickness of less than 150 µm fig 9d the small number of observation points may have caused this deviation which resulted in less chance to train the lstm model for predicting the thickness in the range in other words this error could be reduced by considering additional cases of fouling layer growth therefore the lstm model should be trained on additional datasets involving various feed conditions in order to achieve better predictions of filtration performance and fouling layer growth 3 5 implications and directions for future research herein we explored a deep learning model which can estimate a membrane filtration process involving feed water containing noms the proposed lstm model represented a highly accurate prediction for the deterioration of filtration performance as well as the growth of the fouling layer at time step t with consideration for time series information obtained at time steps t 4 to t 1 in addition the lstm model could perceive the complexity of membrane fouling through multiple input parameters i e operation time modified fri pressure initial permeate flux doc concentration and fouling layer thickness thereby it could consider more fouling factors compared to the conventional mathematical models and the early deep learning models park et al 2018 park et al 2019b recently proposed deep learning model was developed to estimate the membrane fouling using an image based cnn model park et al 2019b although the cnn model successfully predicted the filtration performance using fouling images and the corresponding filtration condition the cnn model lacked the reflection on feed water conditions and operating information as it considered a single filtration scenario and mainly focused on the image processing in contrast to the cnn model therefore the lstm model could be a more feasible and practical trial for industrial applications where diverse filtration conditions should be considered as we applied various noms and operating pressure in the model this is because the industrial filtration processes have performed to treat different types of feed water under varying operating conditions regarding this issue the following consideration could render the lstm model more feasible the consideration of much more operational variables and conditions e g membrane type inflow velocity ph temperature for model development it is the most basic and common strategy to extend the capability of the data driven model especially it is expected that the consideration of the cleaning process would enhance the feasibility of the model much higher because the cleaning is highly related to the recovery of the filtration performance li and elimelech 2004 mi and elimelech 2010 in actual filtration systems cleaning is a necessarily required process but there was no adequate model that takes account of the effect on the filtration performance due to lots of associating variables e g the type of cleaner the amount of cleaner the type of foulant kweon et al 2012 thus the proposed modeling approach can be applied to develop a model without identifying the complex relationships between variables simultaneously it can be a more accurate model by applying a newly developed and optimal model in order to increase the accuracy in prediction this is due to that the structure of the deep learning model is highly dependent on the purpose or characteristics of given datasets le et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 in practice it would be a good trial to combine cnn and lstm structure if the purpose and given datasets require characteristics of cnn e g image processing capability and lstm a time series prediction song et al 2019 xie et al 2020 4 conclusions in this study we experimentally identified the effects of fouling caused by noms on the filtration performance and then applied time series datasets to the lstm model to predict the variations in filtration performance and the growth of the fouling layer the major findings of this study are summarized below filtration of the four noms and their mixture exhibited complicated filtration data under different filtration conditions the lstm model was applied to estimate the filtration performance and the fouling layer thickness using time series datasets the lstm model successfully predicted two parameters permeate flux and fouling layer thickness the results were in good agreement with the observed data for both individual nom filtration and the nom mixture filtration the r2 values indicated a high prediction accuracy of the lstm model for training r2 0 98 and validation r2 0 97 in particular for individual nom filtration a relatively high prediction accuracy was observed this is because the prediction for the filtration of the nom mixture which comprised four noms was affected by the training information for individual nom filtration although the proposed lstm model showed good performance under various experimental conditions the model still involved minor issues that need to be addressed this deep learning approach for fouling prediction still requires significant attention and further developments to be applied as a global model for practical scenarios therefore we suggest that additional operational conditions and case studies should be considered to build a more practical model in future research declaration of competing interest the authors
