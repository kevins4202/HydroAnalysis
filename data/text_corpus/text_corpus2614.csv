13070,this study developed machine learning ml models to predict nutrient removal using an anaerobic anoxic oxic membrane bioreactor a2o mbr an extreme gradient boosting xgboost model was applied using a grid search strategy grid xgboost to predict the removal of nutrients including ammonium nh4 total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn the models were validated against a commonly used multilayer perceptron mlp neural network the input parameters were divided into operating conditions including dissolved oxygen oxidation reduction potential and mixed liquor suspended solids these conditions were also partitioned based on influent characteristics such as nh4 tn tp total organic content chemical oxygen demand and suspended solids a total of nine models were developed for each ml technique using the operating conditions and influent characteristics as separate datasets and combining them for each target nutrient it was observed that using only operating conditions or influent characteristics as input parameters for xgboost and mlp yielded poor results moreover a significant improvement in the predictive efficacy of the model was observed when all parameters for the target nutrient removal predictions were considered the prediction of nh4 by the xgboost model had the highest r2 values of 0 763 0 814 and 0 876 when the operating conditions influent characteristics and combined dataset were used as input parameters respectively overall the ensemble xgboost model demonstrated better performance than the mlp model in all cases however the performance of both the models was found to be inadequate for predicting tn and tp removal in any scenario the proposed xgboost model is a reliable and robust ml technique for predicting nh4 removal which may contribute to

eutrophication is the nutrient based water pollution that primarily results from the discharge of phosphorus and nitrogen compounds discharged from natural or anthropogenic processes 1 primary sources of eutrophication are the anthropogenic activities including discharge from agricultural sites fossil fuel combustion wastewater treatment and stormwater runoff from urban areas this form of pollution causes changes in taste odor color and opacity of natural water and biodiversity degradation and depletion of oxygen in water resources 2 3 thus the removal of nutrients from streams is an important research area biological chemical and membrane technologies have been used to remove nutrients from wastewater 4 7 biological methods are unable to meet effluent standards for total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp 8 whereas chemical treatments increase sludge production 5 a membrane based method integrated with chemical and biological processes has shown promise as a method for nutrient removal thus increasing the technical and economic feasibility of the system 9 membrane bioreactors are an attractive option for potable reuse because of their ecological footprint pathogen reduction and low capital costs the anaerobic anoxic oxic membrane bioreactor a2o mbr has achieved outstanding results by effectively applying a step feed anoxic oxic process for nutrient removal 10 11 additionally using floating plastic carriers with an anoxic oxic step feed process in aerobic units can improve existing wastewater treatment plants 12 this study was aimed to investigate the a2o mbr system for nutrient removal in a full scale wastewater treatment plant the operating conditions and influent characteristics can optimize the nutrient removal efficiency of the a2o mbr system this may be carried out by a one factor at a time modeling technique mainly used to optimize and control wastewater treatment systems 13 14 using a series of laboratory experiments in conventional modeling methods is expensive and time consuming 15 and cannot model complex mechanisms of a2o mbr 16 machine learning tools are capable of resolving the difficulties encountered in conventional modeling approaches 17 artificial neural network ann modeling methods can efficiently model complex and non linear biological wastewater treatment systems compared to traditional modeling techniques 18 previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning models in simulating wastewater treatment systems for heavy metal removal and modeling water bodies and soil for heavy metals adsorption 19 an ann model was effectively used to track the nutrient removal efficiency of tidal flow in constructed wetlands and the partial nitrification process 20 21 the hypochlorous acid production process was successfully optimized using ann and response surface methodology 22 previous studies have reliably predicted copper removal from wastewater through adsorption using ann models 23 and heavy metal contamination using the ensemble model 24 others have used ann model in micellar enhanced ultrafiltration to predict heavy metal removal from wastewater with more accurately 25 27 the application of these models with genetic algorithms to optimize the biogas and methane production processes resulted in an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket pilot plant with relatively accurate predictions 28 nutrient removal in an electrically enhanced mbr was successfully traced to determine its relationship with wastewater treatment inputs 29 and predict chemical oxygen demand cod in a multi stage biological treatment system for petroleum refinery wastewater 30 the support vector machine and accelerating genetic algorithm optimized the a2o system for nutrient removal in a full scale wastewater treatment plant 31 moreover a q learning based technique was implemented to maximize the biological phosphorus removal using an influent response control approach 13 in a previous study researchers applied the long short term memory lstm model to predict the nutrient removal efficiency of an a2o mbr at a wastewater treatment plant they predicted the relationship between dissolved oxygen do oxidation reduction potential orp mixed liquor suspended solids mlss total organic content toc tn tp cod ammonium nh4 suspended solids ss and the nutrient removal efficiency of the plant 32 a lstm model was developed using input parameters to predict the nutrients nh4 tn and tp as output in a single model in addition only two statistical values were calculated to assess the performance of the proposed lstm model mean square error mse and root mse observation standard deviation ratio rsr this demonstrates the lack of two key aspects 1 separately investigating the individual effects of operating conditions and influent characteristics to predict the removal of a specific nutrient and 2 a comparative study with other machine learning models and model validation using limited performance matrices a multilayer perceptron mlp supplements a feed forward neural network where data flows in the forward direction from the input to the output layer and is mainly used for prediction and approximation extreme gradient boosting xgboost offers several advanced features for model tuning computing environments and algorithm enhancement this technique supports fine tuning and the inclusion of regularization parameters and can perform three main forms of gradient boosting gb gb regularized gb and stochastic gb the xgboost and mlp models were not applied to simulate the a2o mbr to predict nutrient removal efficiency in this study we used multiple input scenarios to develop the xgboost and mlp models to evaluate the features selected to enhance the learning capacity of a machine learning model to predict individual nutrients in wastewater treatment systems this study aimed to i develop xgboost and mlp models to predict nutrient removal under different input and output scenarios ii validate the proposed xgboost and mlp models based on performance measuring statistics and iii compare xgboost mlp and previously proposed lstm models to identify the optimal model to predict nutrient removal by a2o mbr at a wastewater treatment plant 2 methodology 2 1 description of the selected wastewater treatment plant for one year of operation we monitored the nutrient removal performance for nh4 tn and tp of an a2o mbr at a wastewater treatment plant in okcheon republic of korea the block diagram in fig 1 shows that the treatment system contains a primary sedimentation tank anaerobic anoxic and oxic membrane reactors and a clarifier the primary sedimentation tank received the influent to increase the acidification and hydrolysis of particulate matter thus maintaining a constant inflow to the anaerobic reactor the mixers were used in the anaerobic and anoxic reactors to improve the treatment efficiency and to adapt to the microbial conditions through reaction kinetics the total membrane surface area and nominal pore size of the mbr were 64 000m2 and 0 4 μm respectively the membrane was made of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf the mbr was constructed using numerous hollow fiber membrane modules positioned in an anoxic reactor with air diffusers to maintain the do concentration a suction pump was used for continuous mbr membrane filtration when the transmembrane pressure increased above 40 kpa the membrane module was removed from the reactor and washed using water and a 0 5 sodium hypochlorite solution in addition the standard limit of the mlss concentration in the oxic mbr was maintained the operating conditions and influent characteristics monitored at wwtp were do orp mlss toc tp tn cod nh4 and ss the controllable operating conditions and influent characteristics provide essential information regarding the oxidizable matter parameters which play a vital role in wastewater treatment 33 nitrogen and phosphorus based nutrients are pollutants of concern due to their adverse impact on the aquatic environment 34 all parameters were considered in the development of an ml model to establish a relationship between the input parameters and targeted nutrient removal in the a2o mbr system 2 2 analytical methods the temperature orp do and ph were measured using installed online sensors and recorded and the toc and tn concentrations were also analyzed using an online analyzer shimadzu toc l the mlss cod nh4 ss and tp were tested using standard water and wastewater analysis methods 35 each parameter was monitored and recorded every hour throughout the one year study period 2 3 prediction models fig 2 presents the input parameters and their abbreviations we developed two machine learning predictive models xgboost and mlp models using different input and output scenarios to predict the nutrient removal efficiency of a wwtp fig 3 a comprehensive description of these models is provided in the following sections 2 3 1 xgboost model a potential improvement of gradient boosting to a scalable end to end tree boosting structure has been introduced and applied in engineering and science 36 xgboost is often used because it enables easy tuning of the model hyperparameters 37 to minimize errors conventional approaches rely on literature recommendations user experience and trial and error methods 38 in contrast in xgboost models the booster parameters including max depth boosting iterations eta and gamma are used to optimize the grid search approach max depth is used to manage the depth of a tree reducing the chance of overfitting and upgrading the loss function within a specified limit in addition iteration boosting may also help combat model overfitting the feature weights are adjusted by eta which is known as the learning rate to attain the optimum values gamma is applied to control regularization to minimize overfitting and manage each iteration s weight and bias changes 39 the xgboost model suggests developments in the conventional decision tree method for regression models generally a regularized objective loss function f l for the lth iteration is calculated using eq 1 1 f l i 1 n l y i y l p j 1 l φ f j where n denotes the number of samples y l p denotes the prediction of the ith sample at iteration l l represents the loss function and φ expresses the regularization event φ is calculated using eq 2 2 φ f γn 1 2 σ j 1 n ω j 2 where n denotes the number of leaf nodes and σ and ω are constants used to manage regularization the number of trees in the regression model was optimized to produce accurate predictions for a specific iteration number 39 2 3 2 multiple layer perceptron mlp model the feed forward back propagation neural network approach contains more than one perceptron and comprises an input output and one or more hidden layers 40 the training step of the mlp model is essential in model development to determine the relationship between the input and output the training of the model is conducted in three steps 1 feed forward 2 error computation and 3 back propagation of error during the feed forward step the input dataset is multiplied by randomly selected weights and passed to the hidden layers the predictions from the model are then calculated with bias adding at each layer to minimize the calculated error between the model predicted and actual results by back propagating the weights or hyper parameters hps and biases are tuned during the training step 41 the details of the computational steps are provided in eq 3 as an example neuron function in mlp modeling 3 y f i 1 n w i x i b where x i denotes inputs y represents the output f is the activation function w i is the weight of the neuron and b represents the bias the error between the model predicted and actual results may be minimized by varying the weights and biases through an iterative process in this study mlp models were developed to verify the proposed xgboost models for a comparative study further information on the mlp model can be found in previous studies 39 42 2 4 data analysis and preparation in ml models data analysis is essential for understanding trends within a dataset input data operating parameters and influent wastewater characteristics toc tn tp cod nh4 n ss do orp and mlss were obtained through an experimental study to evaluate the efficiency of the a2o mbr system at a wwtp the removal of each nutrient i e nh4 tn and tp was separately investigated the total number of observations and variables was 7897 and 9 respectively the removal of nh4 showed minimum outliers and reduced noise therefore the trend was smoother than that of tn and tp this means that the expected learning of the ml models will be more accurate because of the minor deviation from the mean value in the dataset table 1 presents the statistical analyses of the experimental datasets showing a slight negative and positive skewness in the inputs such as tn nh4 toc tp cod orp and mlss there was a largely negative in nh4 tn and tp for the output parameters and less positive skewness input parameter were ss and do 3 models development all input parameters were divided into influent characteristics and operating conditions the dataset was divided into three scenarios the first scenario m1 m2 and m3 considered the operating conditions the second scenario m4 m5 and m6 considered input parameters and the third scenario m7 m8 and m9 considered the operating conditions along with the influent characteristics see fig 2 in each scenario three models were developed for xgboost and mlp for each nutrient removal prediction to identify the optimal model the performances of the developed models were compared focusing on the input parameters to evaluate the model performance several input scenarios m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 m6 m7 m8 and m9 were considered which were created on the basis of the operating conditions and influent characteristics to determine the most economical model one scenario was eliminated in each evaluation run the input dataset was divided into scenarios to investigate the importance of the features selected in each set for nutrient removal from wastewater fig 3 illustrates the scheme of the developed models xgboost and mlp each scenario was defined by input variables the first scenario contained three inputs for each model second scenario contained six inputs and third scenario contained nine inputs similarly the output variable which focuses on nutrient removal was considered as a single node in the output layer 3 1 development of xgboost model python software version 3 9 2021 06 05 was used for xgboost model development the library known as sklearn was used to split the data into training and testing datasets through the train test split and subset functions hyperparameter tuning is an important step in developing a model and various techniques such as grid search random search or bayes search can be used to obtain optimum parameters because limited number of combinations was considered for this study therefore we selected gridsearch technique as used in the literature 43 to obtain the optimal hyperparameters for the xgboost model the gridsearch method was applied using n estimators 10 1000 large datasets were randomly divided into training and testing such as 90 and 10 respectively the model parameters were as base score 0 1 booster gbtree colsample bylevel 1 colsample bynode 1 colsample bytree 1 gamma 0 gpu id 1 importance type gain interaction constraints learning rate 0 001 max delta step 0 max depth 9 min child weight 1 monotone constraints n estimators 1000 n jobs 4 num parallel tree 2 random state 5 reg alpha 0 reg lambda 1 scale pos weigh t 1 subsample 1 tree method exact validate parameters 1 verbosity 0 and activation function was sigmoid function because dataset varies between 0 and 1 these hyperparameters were tuned using grid search with the xgboost model to achieve minimum error and the optimum values were considered in the development of the xgboost model 3 2 development of mlp model python software version 3 9 2021 06 05 was used to develop an mlp model the input dataset was randomly divided into training and testing and fed to the model with one hidden layer a different number of neurons was tested for each scenario the tuning of the mlp model hyperparameters was primarily conducted using the trial and error method which identified major hyperparameters such as the learning rate number of neurons in the hidden layer random state and iterations a random state was employed to replicate a similar dataset for each run and a pseudo random number was randomly generated the learning rate is another important hyperparameter that regulates the variation in the model response based on the generated error and helps adjust the weights of the model the model performance was tested by plotting the residual and r2 values for the testing dataset the proposed mlp model was developed by importing libraries such as sklearn preprocessing to scale the dataset from sklearn model selection imported from train test split and sklearn neural network known as the mlpregressor as we have a large dataset it was randomly divided into 90 for training and 10 for testing the rectified linear activation function relu was selected to overcome the vanishing gradient problem allowing models to learn faster and perform better because it is the default activation function when developing mlp models the following key hyperparameters were tuned against each model scenario by varying their values to achieve the best predicted results hidden layer sizes 4 30 activation relu solver lbfgs alpha 0 01 000001 random state 3 19 max iter 100 100 and warm start true 3 3 model performance matrices the performance of the developed predictive models was evaluated based on statistical metrics such as the root mean squared error rmse mean absolute percentage error mape mean absolute error mae coefficient of determination r2 and modified index of agreement md these performance matrices were calculated using the following eqs 4 8 4 mae 1 n i 1 n p i y i 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i y i 2 6 mape 1 n i 1 n p i y i y i 7 r 2 1 p i y i 2 p i u a 2 8 md 1 i 1 n y i p i i 1 n p i y y i y where n denotes the total number of datasets y i represents the actual values p i indicates the predicted values u a is the mean of p i values y is the average of the actual values and i indicates the number of observations 4 results and discussion 4 1 xgboost model predictions following adequate training of the xgboost model the predictive capability and reliability of the model was tested by feeding an unseen testing dataset containing 790 rows the prediction results of the proposed xgboost model were evaluated based on the mae rmse mape r2 and md values as presented in table 2 if the error is zero there is a good fit between the model predicted and actual results however this is very unlikely the results showed the best model learning for nh4 predictions under all scenarios which may be due to the consistent dataset trends however higher variations in the dataset resulted in a relatively lower accuracy compared to the other nutrients therefore the model predictions for these nutrients were less accurate as suggested by the model performance matrices for the unseen testing dataset the best mae rmse mape r2 and md values occurred in the m1 m4 and m7 models for the testing dataset the rmse results showed that the smallest values were observed in the nh4 removal prediction by the a2o mbr system the other statistical performance measurements supported these results this demonstrates that modeling can efficiently predict nh4 removal the prediction results for tn and tp may also be considered concurrently however it is important to include other factors that may significantly impact their removal the mae rmse mape r2 and md values of the developed xgboost m1 model were 0 00197 0 0031 1 34 0 764 and 0 926 respectively these values demonstrate the model performance in ascending order of m7 m4 m1 the remaining models showed poor results the most optimal model was m7 as it traced input and output relationships accurately demonstrating the importance of considering the operating conditions influent characteristics and factors that may enhance model predictions the xgboost predictive model showed how effectively nh4 removal by the a2o mbr system could be predicted by applying the proposed m7 model fig 4 presents the scatter plots of the predicted and experimental values as shown in fig 4 the actual and model predicted values closely match in the m1 model whereas a significant fluctuation occurs in the m2 and m3 models similarly the m4 model performed better than the m1 model by predicting with an accuracy of more than 80 in contrast the m5 and m6 models showed nearly the same results as the m1 and m2 models the last scenario considered all parameters including the operating conditions and influent characteristics producing higher predictive results the model learning pattern was best for nh4 predictions in contrast despite improvements in the tn and tp predictions the predictive accuracy was below 60 for these nutrients these results indicate that the overall nh4 predictions were within the acceptable range for all selected scenarios while models developed to predict other nutrients showed poor results this may be associated with the high deviation within the dataset which decreased the model learning capability producing poor predictions for tn and tp thus to increase the learning competence of a machine learning model data analysis is essential when deciding the pre treatment of the dataset and the specific type of machine learning model the nh4 removal predictions were reasonably better than tn and tp with approximately 56 and 59 prediction accuracy respectively which is close to but below the acceptable limit of 70 as a result an xgboost model identifies the relationships for accurately measured and collected datasets without extensive deviation it may help analyze the nutrient concentrations in the effluent and assist decision makers in changing the controllable parameters and maintaining the effluent standards therefore the proposed model may predict the nutrient removal of an a2o mbr system in wwtp and contribute to optimizing the system the results demonstrate that the xgboost model may predict the nh4 removal efficiency of wwtp if an accurately measured dataset is input into the model to support the discussion residual plots were established for all the defined scenarios the residuals of the model predicted and actual results are compared in the following section as shown in fig 5 separate plots were established for each nutrient for comparative evaluation and to illustrate the model accuracy the residuals between model predicted m1 m4 and m7 and actual testing values were at a minimum for the prediction of nh4 which ranged between 0 10 in contrast the tn and tp predictions were less accurate with the high residual values fluctuating at 25 this shows that the proposed xgboost models m1 m4 and m7 were the most optimal models for nh4 removal by the a2o mbr system whereas the models failed to predict the tn and tp removal efficiency of the system these results support the discussion above based on the statistical performance values and scatter plots of the testing dataset 4 2 mlp model predictions we developed the mlp model by changing the number of neurons in the input layer as predetermined for each scenario there was one hidden layer and one output layer with one neuron the primary concern in developing an mlp model is the selection of the activation function and output layer the error signal was back propagated to update the model this continued until the results were below the specified loss function mean square error the objective was to attain the lowest value of the loss function while training the model for each scenario therefore the optimum architecture differed for each model as determined by the trial and error method the trials were conducted by adjusting the hyperparameters until the overfitting and underfitting problems were insignificant table 3 presents the performance results for each scenario based on the statistical measurements although mlp models were comparatively less accurate their prediction trends were similar to xgboost the mlp model predictions for nh4 were good which was attributed to the consistent trends in the dataset however the predictions for the other nutrients showed less accurate results because of the high variations in their datasets the best mae rmse mape r2 and md values occurred in the m1 m4 and m7 models the rmse results showed that the minimum error occurred in the prediction of nh4 removal by the a2o mbr system the other statistical performance measurements supported these results this demonstrates that the model accurately predicted nh4 removal the mae rmse mape r2 and md values of the proposed mlp m1 model were 0 00063 0 00031 0 1299 0 703 and 0 849 respectively the r2 values were used to rank model performance in the ascending order of m4 m7 m1 the other models showed poor results the most optimum model was m4 because it accurately traced input and output relationships and proved that the considering influent characteristics were important the performance of the model improved with the addition of other parameters the mlp model was able to predict nh4 removal using the a2o mbr system within acceptable limits a difference between the mlp and xgboost models is that the operating conditions and influent characteristics affect nutrient removal in the mlp model however in the mlp model influent parameters were more important because 78 accuracy was achieved using only the influent characteristics fig 6 shows the scatter plots of the actual and model predicted values actual and model predicted values closely matched in the m1 model whereas significant fluctuations were observed in the m2 and m3 models similarly the m4 model performed better than m1 by predicting the nutrient removal with more than 78 accuracy in contrast the m5 and m6 models showed nearly the same results as the m1 and m2 models the last scenario considered all parameters including the operating conditions and influent characteristics resulting in more accurate predictive results for the xgboost models however this was not the case for mlp the learning of the mlp model was the best for nh4 predictions whereas the tn and tp predictions showed accuracies of approximately 30 and 40 respectively these results indicate that overall nh4 predictions exceeded 70 accuracy across all selected scenarios while the models developed to predict other nutrients showed poor results this may be associated with the high deviation in the dataset which decreased the learning capability of the model and produced low accuracy predictions for tn and tp removal the xgboost model can support the analysis of nutrient concentrations in effluent and enables decision makers to modify controllable parameters to meet standard limits the proposed models may assist in predicting nh4 removal accurately while further research is required to accurately model tn and tp in the a2o mbr system future studies may include other parameters to identify the most suitable relationship that will help predict the tn and tp removal efficiency within a wwtp with a good level of accuracy and confidence to support the discussion residual plots for all selected scenarios were prepared where each nutrient was considered individually the residuals between the model predicted and actual results are illustrated and compared in the following section and are presented in fig 7 the residuals between the predictions by the m1 m4 and m7 models and the actual testing values were very similar for nh4 fluctuating at 10 in contrast the tn and tp predictions were less accurate as evidenced by the high residuals that fluctuated between 0 25 and 20 to 40 respectively therefore it is clear that the proposed mlp models m1 m4 and m7 were the most optimum models for predicting nh4 removal by the a2o mbr system however the models failed to predict the tn and tp removal efficiently these results support the discussion above based on the statistical performance of the testing dataset and scatter plots 4 3 comparative study of the proposed models the xgboost and mlp models were compared using residual plots between model predicted and actual values of all developed models fig 8 presents the violin plots of the residual error for all scenarios of the mlp and xgboost models in the violin plots the middle of each density curve is a small box plot with the rectangle showing the ends of the first and third quartiles and the central dot as the median in the violin plot the wider and skinnier sections in the distribution shape of a residual plot represent a higher and lower probability respectively the shape of the distribution extremely skinny on each end and wide in the middle indicates that the weights of the residual values are highly concentrated around the median the violin plot of residuals between the predicted and actual values showed the lowest interquartile range in the case of the m1 m4 and m7 for both the mlp and xgboost models the performance of the proposed models was found to be in the order of m7 m4 m1 however the overall performance of xgboost was comparatively better than that of mlp as the minimum residual distribution for nh4 was observed moreover the xgboost predictions by m8 and m9 for tn and tp considering the influent characteristics and operating conditions are reasonable compared to mlp predictions the predictions for nh4 removal almost matched the actual results although some variations were observed based on the evaluation of different scenarios the m1 m4 and m7 models demonstrated better performance as evidenced by the lower statistical values for other xgboost and mlp models therefore the best models were considered based on other performance statistical values to validate the proposed models for predicting nh4 removal by a2o mbr tables 2 and 3 present the comparative analysis of the proposed models xgboost and mlp compared using performance matrices including mae rmse mape and r sq the predictions for nh4 removal almost matched the actual results although some variations were observed at the beginning of the data collection based on the evaluation of different scenarios the m1 m4 and m7 models demonstrated better performance as evidenced by the lower statistical values for other xgboost and mlp models this indicates that the predictions for nh4 were more accurate than the predicted results for tn and tp the data visualization trend for nh4 removal was less noisy and more stable than tn and tp removal by a2o mbr although the best model learning occurred to predict nh4 removal by the xgboost and mlp models the overall results of the xgboost model were superior to the mlp mode therefore the model designed based on the m1 m4 and m7 models demonstrated the best results as observed by the training testing and performance measuring statistics as shown in fig 9 the regression plots of the best models m1 m4 and m7 using the xgboost and mlp models were drawn to observe how well the predictions matched the actual results in the xgboost models the plots showing the nh4 removal predictions best fit the observations while the tn and tp removal predictions were less accurate for the a2o mbr system the r2 values of the m1 m4 and m7 models developed by the xgboost technique were 0 764 0 813 and 0 877 respectively the mlp models for the same set of scenarios showed r2 values of 0 703 0 787 and 0 782 for the m1 m4 and m7 models respectively this indicates that the xgboost performs better than the mlp models for a similar set of scenarios predicting nh4 removal when using an a2o mbr system these findings align with previous research that developed the lstm model to predict nutrient removal efficiency using an a2o mbr system the proposed lstm model successfully traces the input output relationship by considering one model s nh4 tn and tp outputs 32 in this study we tested an ensemble model of machine learning xgboost and compared it with an mlp neural network by considering different scenarios of input parameters and one nutrient at a time the objective was to explore the significance of the features when the operating conditions and influent characteristics were considered separately it was observed that all features were important in modeling the a2o mbr system to predict the removal of individual nutrients the results show that the xgboost model can trace the input output relationship to predict nutrient removal efficiency in a wwtp a previous study demonstrated that xgboost is an efficient model compared to other machine learning tools to predict manganese removal from water 44 these results support the concept that machine learning modeling may be used in complex wastewater treatment applications to inform decision makers concerning plant operation and optimization to meet environmental regulations although an element of surprise is high in predictive machine learning models the use of analytics tools best algorithms selection of hyperparameters and training and validation of models with an unseen dataset can help overcome the failure of models 5 conclusion an ensemble model known as xgboost was developed and validated against mlp neural networks to predict nh4 tn and tp removal using an a2o mbr system at a wwtp to validate and compare the model predictions different scenarios were modeled using the xgboost method and a similar set of scenarios were tested for the mlp model these scenarios were defined by considering the operating conditions do orp and mlss and influent parameters toc tn tp cod nh4 n and ss separately or in combination the effects of these scenarios were tested across nine models m1 m9 which were developed using the xgboost and mlp techniques the predictive capability of the proposed xgboost model was the maximum after tuning the hps to predict nh4 removal m1 m4 and m7 the nh4 removal predictions were the most accurate because the dataset was less noisy more stable and had minimum outliers the proposed models provided the most accurate results for the unseen testing datasets in contrast the tn and tp removal predictions were comparatively inaccurate because of the high deviation in their datasets the mlp models were tested with the same scenarios to validate the xgboost models the same set of scenarios showed better results m1 m4 and m7 in both the models these results were supported by the statistical performance values such as mae rmse mape r2 and md therefore modeling the a2o mbr system at a wwtp is accurate when the datasets have minimal noise this study is an extension of a previous study in which the lstm model was used to simulate the same system to predict the removal of all nutrients as one output in comparison these models provided further insight into different modeling scenarios where it was possible to determine which model best predicted a specific scenario in future studies it may help to predict nutrient removal by an a2o mbr system and forecast the tentative concentration of nutrients in advance for wastewater treatment systems the findings of this study can be beneficial for researchers in controlling operable parameters

13070,this study developed machine learning ml models to predict nutrient removal using an anaerobic anoxic oxic membrane bioreactor a2o mbr an extreme gradient boosting xgboost model was applied using a grid search strategy grid xgboost to predict the removal of nutrients including ammonium nh4 total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn the models were validated against a commonly used multilayer perceptron mlp neural network the input parameters were divided into operating conditions including dissolved oxygen oxidation reduction potential and mixed liquor suspended solids these conditions were also partitioned based on influent characteristics such as nh4 tn tp total organic content chemical oxygen demand and suspended solids a total of nine models were developed for each ml technique using the operating conditions and influent characteristics as separate datasets and combining them for each target nutrient it was observed that using only operating conditions or influent characteristics as input parameters for xgboost and mlp yielded poor results moreover a significant improvement in the predictive efficacy of the model was observed when all parameters for the target

eutrophication is the nutrient based water pollution that primarily results from the discharge of phosphorus and nitrogen compounds discharged from natural or anthropogenic processes 1 primary sources of eutrophication are the anthropogenic activities including discharge from agricultural sites fossil fuel combustion wastewater treatment and stormwater runoff from urban areas this form of pollution causes changes in taste odor color and opacity of natural water and biodiversity degradation and depletion of oxygen in water resources 2 3 thus the removal of nutrients from streams is an important research area biological chemical and membrane technologies have been used to remove nutrients from wastewater 4 7 biological methods are unable to meet effluent standards for total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp 8 whereas chemical treatments increase sludge production 5 a membrane based method integrated with chemical and biological processes has shown promise as a method for nutrient removal thus increasing the technical and economic feasibility of the system 9 membrane bioreactors are an attractive option for potable reuse because of their ecological footprint pathogen reduction and low capital costs the anaerobic anoxic oxic membrane bioreactor a2o mbr has achieved outstanding results by effectively applying a step feed anoxic oxic process for nutrient removal 10 11 additionally using floating plastic carriers with an anoxic oxic step feed process in aerobic units can improve existing wastewater treatment plants 12 this study was aimed to investigate the a2o mbr system for nutrient removal in a full scale wastewater treatment plant the operating conditions and influent characteristics can optimize the nutrient removal efficiency of the a2o mbr system this may be carried out by a one factor at a time modeling technique mainly used to optimize and control wastewater treatment systems 13 14 using a series of laboratory experiments in conventional modeling methods is expensive and time consuming 15 and cannot model complex mechanisms of a2o mbr 16 machine learning tools are capable of resolving the difficulties encountered in conventional modeling approaches 17 artificial neural network ann modeling methods can efficiently model complex and non linear biological wastewater treatment systems compared to traditional modeling techniques 18 previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning models in simulating wastewater treatment systems for heavy metal removal and modeling water bodies and soil for heavy metals adsorption 19 an ann model was effectively used to track the nutrient removal efficiency of tidal flow in constructed wetlands and the partial nitrification process 20 21 the hypochlorous acid production process was successfully optimized using ann and response surface methodology 22 previous studies have reliably predicted copper removal from wastewater through adsorption using ann models 23 and heavy metal contamination using the ensemble model 24 others have used ann model in micellar enhanced ultrafiltration to predict heavy metal removal from wastewater with more accurately 25 27 the application of these models with genetic algorithms to optimize the biogas and methane production processes resulted in an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket pilot plant with relatively accurate predictions 28 nutrient removal in an electrically enhanced mbr was successfully traced to determine its relationship with wastewater treatment inputs 29 and predict chemical oxygen demand cod in a multi stage biological treatment system for petroleum refinery wastewater 30 the support vector machine and accelerating genetic algorithm optimized the a2o system for nutrient removal in a full scale wastewater treatment plant 31 moreover a q learning based technique was implemented to maximize the biological phosphorus removal using an influent response control approach 13 in a previous study researchers applied the long short term memory lstm model to predict the nutrient removal efficiency of an a2o mbr at a wastewater treatment plant they predicted the relationship between dissolved oxygen do oxidation reduction potential orp mixed liquor suspended solids mlss total organic content toc tn tp cod ammonium nh4 suspended solids ss and the nutrient removal efficiency of the plant 32 a lstm model was developed using input parameters to predict the nutrients nh4 tn and tp as output in a single model in addition only two statistical values were calculated to assess the performance of the proposed lstm model mean square error mse and root mse observation standard deviation ratio rsr this demonstrates the lack of two key aspects 1 separately investigating the individual effects of operating conditions and influent characteristics to predict the removal of a specific nutrient and 2 a comparative study with other machine learning models and model validation using limited performance matrices a multilayer perceptron mlp supplements a feed forward neural network where data flows in the forward direction from the input to the output layer and is mainly used for prediction and approximation extreme gradient boosting xgboost offers several advanced features for model tuning computing environments and algorithm enhancement this technique supports fine tuning and the inclusion of regularization parameters and can perform three main forms of gradient boosting gb gb regularized gb and stochastic gb the xgboost and mlp models were not applied to simulate the a2o mbr to predict nutrient removal efficiency in this study we used multiple input scenarios to develop the xgboost and mlp models to evaluate the features selected to enhance the learning capacity of a machine learning model to predict individual nutrients in wastewater treatment systems this study aimed to i develop xgboost and mlp models to predict nutrient removal under different input and output scenarios ii validate the proposed xgboost and mlp models based on performance measuring statistics and iii compare xgboost mlp and previously proposed lstm models to identify the optimal model to predict nutrient removal by a2o mbr at a wastewater treatment plant 2 methodology 2 1 description of the selected wastewater treatment plant for one year of operation we monitored the nutrient removal performance for nh4 tn and tp of an a2o mbr at a wastewater treatment plant in okcheon republic of korea the block diagram in fig 1 shows that the treatment system contains a primary sedimentation tank anaerobic anoxic and oxic membrane reactors and a clarifier the primary sedimentation tank received the influent to increase the acidification and hydrolysis of particulate matter thus maintaining a constant inflow to the anaerobic reactor the mixers were used in the anaerobic and anoxic reactors to improve the treatment efficiency and to adapt to the microbial conditions through reaction kinetics the total membrane surface area and nominal pore size of the mbr were 64 000m2 and 0 4 μm respectively the membrane was made of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf the mbr was constructed using numerous hollow fiber membrane modules positioned in an anoxic reactor with air diffusers to maintain the do concentration a suction pump was used for continuous mbr membrane filtration when the transmembrane pressure increased above 40 kpa the membrane module was removed from the reactor and washed using water and a 0 5 sodium hypochlorite solution in addition the standard limit of the mlss concentration in the oxic mbr was maintained the operating conditions and influent characteristics monitored at wwtp were do orp mlss toc tp tn cod nh4 and ss the controllable operating conditions and influent characteristics provide essential information regarding the oxidizable matter parameters which play a vital role in wastewater treatment 33 nitrogen and phosphorus based nutrients are pollutants of concern due to their adverse impact on the aquatic environment 34 all parameters were considered in the development of an ml model to establish a relationship between the input parameters and targeted nutrient removal in the a2o mbr system 2 2 analytical methods the temperature orp do and ph were measured using installed online sensors and recorded and the toc and tn concentrations were also analyzed using an online analyzer shimadzu toc l the mlss cod nh4 ss and tp were tested using standard water and wastewater analysis methods 35 each parameter was monitored and recorded every hour throughout the one year study period 2 3 prediction models fig 2 presents the input parameters and their abbreviations we developed two machine learning predictive models xgboost and mlp models using different input and output scenarios to predict the nutrient removal efficiency of a wwtp fig 3 a comprehensive description of these models is provided in the following sections 2 3 1 xgboost model a potential improvement of gradient boosting to a scalable end to end tree boosting structure has been introduced and applied in engineering and science 36 xgboost is often used because it enables easy tuning of the model hyperparameters 37 to minimize errors conventional approaches rely on literature recommendations user experience and trial and error methods 38 in contrast in xgboost models the booster parameters including max depth boosting iterations eta and gamma are used to optimize the grid search approach max depth is used to manage the depth of a tree reducing the chance of overfitting and upgrading the loss function within a specified limit in addition iteration boosting may also help combat model overfitting the feature weights are adjusted by eta which is known as the learning rate to attain the optimum values gamma is applied to control regularization to minimize overfitting and manage each iteration s weight and bias changes 39 the xgboost model suggests developments in the conventional decision tree method for regression models generally a regularized objective loss function f l for the lth iteration is calculated using eq 1 1 f l i 1 n l y i y l p j 1 l φ f j where n denotes the number of samples y l p denotes the prediction of the ith sample at iteration l l represents the loss function and φ expresses the regularization event φ is calculated using eq 2 2 φ f γn 1 2 σ j 1 n ω j 2 where n denotes the number of leaf nodes and σ and ω are constants used to manage regularization the number of trees in the regression model was optimized to produce accurate predictions for a specific iteration number 39 2 3 2 multiple layer perceptron mlp model the feed forward back propagation neural network approach contains more than one perceptron and comprises an input output and one or more hidden layers 40 the training step of the mlp model is essential in model development to determine the relationship between the input and output the training of the model is conducted in three steps 1 feed forward 2 error computation and 3 back propagation of error during the feed forward step the input dataset is multiplied by randomly selected weights and passed to the hidden layers the predictions from the model are then calculated with bias adding at each layer to minimize the calculated error between the model predicted and actual results by back propagating the weights or hyper parameters hps and biases are tuned during the training step 41 the details of the computational steps are provided in eq 3 as an example neuron function in mlp modeling 3 y f i 1 n w i x i b where x i denotes inputs y represents the output f is the activation function w i is the weight of the neuron and b represents the bias the error between the model predicted and actual results may be minimized by varying the weights and biases through an iterative process in this study mlp models were developed to verify the proposed xgboost models for a comparative study further information on the mlp model can be found in previous studies 39 42 2 4 data analysis and preparation in ml models data analysis is essential for understanding trends within a dataset input data operating parameters and influent wastewater characteristics toc tn tp cod nh4 n ss do orp and mlss were obtained through an experimental study to evaluate the efficiency of the a2o mbr system at a wwtp the removal of each nutrient i e nh4 tn and tp was separately investigated the total number of observations and variables was 7897 and 9 respectively the removal of nh4 showed minimum outliers and reduced noise therefore the trend was smoother than that of tn and tp this means that the expected learning of the ml models will be more accurate because of the minor deviation from the mean value in the dataset table 1 presents the statistical analyses of the experimental datasets showing a slight negative and positive skewness in the inputs such as tn nh4 toc tp cod orp and mlss there was a largely negative in nh4 tn and tp for the output parameters and less positive skewness input parameter were ss and do 3 models development all input parameters were divided into influent characteristics and operating conditions the dataset was divided into three scenarios the first scenario m1 m2 and m3 considered the operating conditions the second scenario m4 m5 and m6 considered input parameters and the third scenario m7 m8 and m9 considered the operating conditions along with the influent characteristics see fig 2 in each scenario three models were developed for xgboost and mlp for each nutrient removal prediction to identify the optimal model the performances of the developed models were compared focusing on the input parameters to evaluate the model performance several input scenarios m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 m6 m7 m8 and m9 were considered which were created on the basis of the operating conditions and influent characteristics to determine the most economical model one scenario was eliminated in each evaluation run the input dataset was divided into scenarios to investigate the importance of the features selected in each set for nutrient removal from wastewater fig 3 illustrates the scheme of the developed models xgboost and mlp each scenario was defined by input variables the first scenario contained three inputs for each model second scenario contained six inputs and third scenario contained nine inputs similarly the output variable which focuses on nutrient removal was considered as a single node in the output layer 3 1 development of xgboost model python software version 3 9 2021 06 05 was used for xgboost model development the library known as sklearn was used to split the data into training and testing datasets through the train test split and subset functions hyperparameter tuning is an important step in developing a model and various techniques such as grid search random search or bayes search can be used to obtain optimum parameters because limited number of combinations was considered for this study therefore we selected gridsearch technique as used in the literature 43 to obtain the optimal hyperparameters for the xgboost model the gridsearch method was applied using n estimators 10 1000 large datasets were randomly divided into training and testing such as 90 and 10 respectively the model parameters were as base score 0 1 booster gbtree colsample bylevel 1 colsample bynode 1 colsample bytree 1 gamma 0 gpu id 1 importance type gain interaction constraints learning rate 0 001 max delta step 0 max depth 9 min child weight 1 monotone constraints n estimators 1000 n jobs 4 num parallel tree 2 random state 5 reg alpha 0 reg lambda 1 scale pos weigh t 1 subsample 1 tree method exact validate parameters 1 verbosity 0 and activation function was sigmoid function because dataset varies between 0 and 1 these hyperparameters were tuned using grid search with the xgboost model to achieve minimum error and the optimum values were considered in the development of the xgboost model 3 2 development of mlp model python software version 3 9 2021 06 05 was used to develop an mlp model the input dataset was randomly divided into training and testing and fed to the model with one hidden layer a different number of neurons was tested for each scenario the tuning of the mlp model hyperparameters was primarily conducted using the trial and error method which identified major hyperparameters such as the learning rate number of neurons in the hidden layer random state and iterations a random state was employed to replicate a similar dataset for each run and a pseudo random number was randomly generated the learning rate is another important hyperparameter that regulates the variation in the model response based on the generated error and helps adjust the weights of the model the model performance was tested by plotting the residual and r2 values for the testing dataset the proposed mlp model was developed by importing libraries such as sklearn preprocessing to scale the dataset from sklearn model selection imported from train test split and sklearn neural network known as the mlpregressor as we have a large dataset it was randomly divided into 90 for training and 10 for testing the rectified linear activation function relu was selected to overcome the vanishing gradient problem allowing models to learn faster and perform better because it is the default activation function when developing mlp models the following key hyperparameters were tuned against each model scenario by varying their values to achieve the best predicted results hidden layer sizes 4 30 activation relu solver lbfgs alpha 0 01 000001 random state 3 19 max iter 100 100 and warm start true 3 3 model performance matrices the performance of the developed predictive models was evaluated based on statistical metrics such as the root mean squared error rmse mean absolute percentage error mape mean absolute error mae coefficient of determination r2 and modified index of agreement md these performance matrices were calculated using the following eqs 4 8 4 mae 1 n i 1 n p i y i 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i y i 2 6 mape 1 n i 1 n p i y i y i 7 r 2 1 p i y i 2 p i u a 2 8 md 1 i 1 n y i p i i 1 n p i y y i y where n denotes the total number of datasets y i represents the actual values p i indicates the predicted values u a is the mean of p i values y is the average of the actual values and i indicates the number of observations 4 results and discussion 4 1 xgboost model predictions following adequate training of the xgboost model the predictive capability and reliability of the model was tested by feeding an unseen testing dataset containing 790 rows the prediction results of the proposed xgboost model were evaluated based on the mae rmse mape r2 and md values as presented in table 2 if the error is zero there is a good fit between the model predicted and actual results however this is very unlikely the results showed the best model learning for nh4 predictions under all scenarios which may be due to the consistent dataset trends however higher variations in the dataset resulted in a relatively lower accuracy compared to the other nutrients therefore the model predictions for these nutrients were less accurate as suggested by the model performance matrices for the unseen testing dataset the best mae rmse mape r2 and md values occurred in the m1 m4 and m7 models for the testing dataset the rmse results showed that the smallest values were observed in the nh4 removal prediction by the a2o mbr system the other statistical performance measurements supported these results this demonstrates that modeling can efficiently predict nh4 removal the prediction results for tn and tp may also be considered concurrently however it is important to include other factors that may significantly impact their removal the mae rmse mape r2 and md values of the developed xgboost m1 model were 0 00197 0 0031 1 34 0 764 and 0 926 respectively these values demonstrate the model performance in ascending order of m7 m4 m1 the remaining models showed poor results the most optimal model was m7 as it traced input and output relationships accurately demonstrating the importance of considering the operating conditions influent characteristics and factors that may enhance model predictions the xgboost predictive model showed how effectively nh4 removal by the a2o mbr system could be predicted by applying the proposed m7 model fig 4 presents the scatter plots of the predicted and experimental values as shown in fig 4 the actual and model predicted values closely match in the m1 model whereas a significant fluctuation occurs in the m2 and m3 models similarly the m4 model performed better than the m1 model by predicting with an accuracy of more than 80 in contrast the m5 and m6 models showed nearly the same results as the m1 and m2 models the last scenario considered all parameters including the operating conditions and influent characteristics producing higher predictive results the model learning pattern was best for nh4 predictions in contrast despite improvements in the tn and tp predictions the predictive accuracy was below 60 for these nutrients these results indicate that the overall nh4 predictions were within the acceptable range for all selected scenarios while models developed to predict other nutrients showed poor results this may be associated with the high deviation within the dataset which decreased the model learning capability producing poor predictions for tn and tp thus to increase the learning competence of a machine learning model data analysis is essential when deciding the pre treatment of the dataset and the specific type of machine learning model the nh4 removal predictions were reasonably better than tn and tp with approximately 56 and 59 prediction accuracy respectively which is close to but below the acceptable limit of 70 as a result an xgboost model identifies the relationships for accurately measured and collected datasets without extensive deviation it may help analyze the nutrient concentrations in the effluent and assist decision makers in changing the controllable parameters and maintaining the effluent standards therefore the proposed model may predict the nutrient removal of an a2o mbr system in wwtp and contribute to optimizing the system the results demonstrate that the xgboost model may predict the nh4 removal efficiency of wwtp if an accurately measured dataset is input into the model to support the discussion residual plots were established for all the defined scenarios the residuals of the model predicted and actual results are compared in the following section as shown in fig 5 separate plots were established for each nutrient for comparative evaluation and to illustrate the model accuracy the residuals between model predicted m1 m4 and m7 and actual testing values were at a minimum for the prediction of nh4 which ranged between 0 10 in contrast the tn and tp predictions were less accurate with the high residual values fluctuating at 25 this shows that the proposed xgboost models m1 m4 and m7 were the most optimal models for nh4 removal by the a2o mbr system whereas the models failed to predict the tn and tp removal efficiency of the system these results support the discussion above based on the statistical performance values and scatter plots of the testing dataset 4 2 mlp model predictions we developed the mlp model by changing the number of neurons in the input layer as predetermined for each scenario there was one hidden layer and one output layer with one neuron the primary concern in developing an mlp model is the selection of the activation function and output layer the error signal was back propagated to update the model this continued until the results were below the specified loss function mean square error the objective was to attain the lowest value of the loss function while training the model for each scenario therefore the optimum architecture differed for each model as determined by the trial and error method the trials were conducted by adjusting the hyperparameters until the overfitting and underfitting problems were insignificant table 3 presents the performance results for each scenario based on the statistical measurements although mlp models were comparatively less accurate their prediction trends were similar to xgboost the mlp model predictions for nh4 were good which was attributed to the consistent trends in the dataset however the predictions for the other nutrients showed less accurate results because of the high variations in their datasets the best mae rmse mape r2 and md values occurred in the m1 m4 and m7 models the rmse results showed that the minimum error occurred in the prediction of nh4 removal by the a2o mbr system the other statistical performance measurements supported these results this demonstrates that the model accurately predicted nh4 removal the mae rmse mape r2 and md values of the proposed mlp m1 model were 0 00063 0 00031 0 1299 0 703 and 0 849 respectively the r2 values were used to rank model performance in the ascending order of m4 m7 m1 the other models showed poor results the most optimum model was m4 because it accurately traced input and output relationships and proved that the considering influent characteristics were important the performance of the model improved with the addition of other parameters the mlp model was able to predict nh4 removal using the a2o mbr system within acceptable limits a difference between the mlp and xgboost models is that the operating conditions and influent characteristics affect nutrient removal in the mlp model however in the mlp model influent parameters were more important because 78 accuracy was achieved using only the influent characteristics fig 6 shows the scatter plots of the actual and model predicted values actual and model predicted values closely matched in the m1 model whereas significant fluctuations were observed in the m2 and m3 models similarly the m4 model performed better than m1 by predicting the nutrient removal with more than 78 accuracy in contrast the m5 and m6 models showed nearly the same results as the m1 and m2 models the last scenario considered all parameters including the operating conditions and influent characteristics resulting in more accurate predictive results for the xgboost models however this was not the case for mlp the learning of the mlp model was the best for nh4 predictions whereas the tn and tp predictions showed accuracies of approximately 30 and 40 respectively these results indicate that overall nh4 predictions exceeded 70 accuracy across all selected scenarios while the models developed to predict other nutrients showed poor results this may be associated with the high deviation in the dataset which decreased the learning capability of the model and produced low accuracy predictions for tn and tp removal the xgboost model can support the analysis of nutrient concentrations in effluent and enables decision makers to modify controllable parameters to meet standard limits the proposed models may assist in predicting nh4 removal accurately while further research is required to accurately model tn and tp in the a2o mbr system future studies may include other parameters to identify the most suitable relationship that will help predict the tn and tp removal efficiency within a wwtp with a good level of accuracy and confidence to support the discussion residual plots for all selected scenarios were prepared where each nutrient was considered individually the residuals between the model predicted and actual results are illustrated and compared in the following section and are presented in fig 7 the residuals between the predictions by the m1 m4 and m7 models and the actual testing values were very similar for nh4 fluctuating at 10 in contrast the tn and tp predictions were less accurate as evidenced by the high residuals that fluctuated between 0 25 and 20 to 40 respectively therefore it is clear that the proposed mlp models m1 m4 and m7 were the most optimum models for predicting nh4 removal by the a2o mbr system however the models failed to predict the tn and tp removal efficiently these results support the discussion above based on the statistical performance of the testing dataset and scatter plots 4 3 comparative study of the proposed models the xgboost and mlp models were compared using residual plots between model predicted and actual values of all developed models fig 8 presents the violin plots of the residual error for all scenarios of the mlp and xgboost models in the violin plots the middle of each density curve is a small box plot with the rectangle showing the ends of the first and third quartiles and the central dot as the median in the violin plot the wider and skinnier sections in the distribution shape of a residual plot represent a higher and lower probability respectively the shape of the distribution extremely skinny on each end and wide in the middle indicates that the weights of the residual values are highly concentrated around the median the violin plot of residuals between the predicted and actual values showed the lowest interquartile range in the case of the m1 m4 and m7 for both the mlp and xgboost models the performance of the proposed models was found to be in the order of m7 m4 m1 however the overall performance of xgboost was comparatively better than that of mlp as the minimum residual distribution for nh4 was observed moreover the xgboost predictions by m8 and m9 for tn and tp considering the influent characteristics and operating conditions are reasonable compared to mlp predictions the predictions for nh4 removal almost matched the actual results although some variations were observed based on the evaluation of different scenarios the m1 m4 and m7 models demonstrated better performance as evidenced by the lower statistical values for other xgboost and mlp models therefore the best models were considered based on other performance statistical values to validate the proposed models for predicting nh4 removal by a2o mbr tables 2 and 3 present the comparative analysis of the proposed models xgboost and mlp compared using performance matrices including mae rmse mape and r sq the predictions for nh4 removal almost matched the actual results although some variations were observed at the beginning of the data collection based on the evaluation of different scenarios the m1 m4 and m7 models demonstrated better performance as evidenced by the lower statistical values for other xgboost and mlp models this indicates that the predictions for nh4 were more accurate than the predicted results for tn and tp the data visualization trend for nh4 removal was less noisy and more stable than tn and tp removal by a2o mbr although the best model learning occurred to predict nh4 removal by the xgboost and mlp models the overall results of the xgboost model were superior to the mlp mode therefore the model designed based on the m1 m4 and m7 models demonstrated the best results as observed by the training testing and performance measuring statistics as shown in fig 9 the regression plots of the best models m1 m4 and m7 using the xgboost and mlp models were drawn to observe how well the predictions matched the actual results in the xgboost models the plots showing the nh4 removal predictions best fit the observations while the tn and tp removal predictions were less accurate for the a2o mbr system the r2 values of the m1 m4 and m7 models developed by the xgboost technique were 0 764 0 813 and 0 877 respectively the mlp models for the same set of scenarios showed r2 values of 0 703 0 787 and 0 782 for the m1 m4 and m7 models respectively this indicates that the xgboost performs better than the mlp models for a similar set of scenarios predicting nh4 removal when using an a2o mbr system these findings align with previous research that developed the lstm model to predict nutrient removal efficiency using an a2o mbr system the proposed lstm model successfully traces the input output relationship by considering one model s nh4 tn and tp outputs 32 in this study we tested an ensemble model of machine learning xgboost and compared it with an mlp neural network by considering different scenarios of input parameters and one nutrient at a time the objective was to explore the significance of the features when the operating conditions and influent characteristics were considered separately it was observed that all features were important in modeling the a2o mbr system to predict the removal of individual nutrients the results show that the xgboost model can trace the input output relationship to predict nutrient removal efficiency in a wwtp a previous study demonstrated that xgboost is an efficient model compared to other machine learning tools to predict manganese removal from water 44 these results support the concept that machine learning modeling may be used in complex wastewater treatment applications to inform decision makers concerning plant operation and optimization to meet environmental regulations although an element of surprise is high in predictive machine learning models the use of analytics tools best algorithms selection of hyperparameters and training and validation of models with an unseen dataset can help overcome the failure of models 5 conclusion an ensemble model known as xgboost was developed and validated against mlp neural networks to predict nh4 tn and tp removal using an a2o mbr system at a wwtp to validate and compare the model predictions different scenarios were modeled using the xgboost method and a similar set of scenarios were tested for the mlp model these scenarios were defined by considering the operating conditions do orp and mlss and influent parameters toc tn tp cod nh4 n and ss separately or in combination the effects of these scenarios were tested across nine models m1 m9 which were developed using the xgboost and mlp techniques the predictive capability of the proposed xgboost model was the maximum after tuning the hps to predict nh4 removal m1 m4 and m7 the nh4 removal predictions were the most accurate because the dataset was less noisy more stable and had minimum outliers the proposed models provided the most accurate results for the unseen testing datasets in contrast the tn and tp removal predictions were comparatively inaccurate because of the high deviation in their datasets the mlp models were tested with the same scenarios to validate the xgboost models the same set of scenarios showed better results m1 m4 and m7 in both the models these results were supported by the statistical performance values such as mae rmse mape r2 and md therefore modeling the a2o mbr system at a wwtp is accurate when the datasets have minimal noise this study is an extension of a previous study in which the lstm model was used to simulate the same system to predict the removal of all nutrients as one output in comparison these models provided further insight into different modeling scenarios where it was possible to determine which model best predicted a specific scenario in future studies it may help to predict nutrient removal by an a2o mbr system and forecast the tentative concentration of nutrients in advance for wastewater treatment systems the findings of this study can be beneficial for researchers in controlling operable parameters

removal during water treatment 1 2 propranolol pro 1 naphthalen 1 yloxy 3 propan 2 ylamino propan 2 ol fig 1 is a β adrenergic blocker used for the treatment of hypertension angina pectoris and arrhythmia 3 with more than 9 million prescriptions in the u s in 2019 4 it is included in the who model list of essential medicines this drug has been repeatedly found in natural and wastewaters 5 6

tartaric etc 21 25 29 these carboxylic acids show an important chelating ability toward multivalent cations 30 in particular oxalic acid reveals quite promising as compared to similar compounds due to its acid strength good complexing characteristics and high reducing potential 31 oxalic acid h2c2o4 oaa can bind iron oxide to form fe iii oxalate complexes through chemical adsorption eq 4 where stands for the n i o surface lattice the photolysis of these complexes results in an oxidative degradation of the oxalate ligand and the reduction of the ferric center to fe ii eq 5 32 a process that may also occur in solution with solubilized iron ions eq 6 thus a series of reactive oxygen species ros such as co2 o2 and ho2 eqs 7 8 and 9 respectively are produced in the solution besides h2o2 can be obtained by dismutation of o2 ho2 eq 10 or via oxidation of fe2 eq 11 superoxide anion can also react with fe3 yielding the ferrous cation eq 12 fe ii and h2o2 may react to produce the hydroxyl radical ho fenton reaction eq 13 which acts as primary oxidant 33 35 this radical reacts readily and unselectively with organic compounds due to its very high oxidation potential 2 80 v vs nhe 36 therefore organic pollutants can be efficiently degraded or even mineralized in this photochemical system reaction 13 generates ho in a relatively slow way considering its reported k 40 80 m 1 s 1 37

complex system have not yet been described besides to the best of our knowledge this procedure has not been tested under real conditions i e employing sunlight and with pollutants dissolved in complex matrices rather than distilled water this last point is very important to assess the feasibility of this technique in fact the major objective of this study was the evaluation of the system comprised of suspended natural iron oxide n i o together with oaa to photodegrade pro as a model pollutant in water with no other chemicals added to obtain a very efficient economical sustainable technique for water decontamination the effect of oaa concentration n i o load and ph on the photodegradation was analyzed the degree of pollutant mineralization was also examined and the efficiency of the reaction was tested in different aqueous matrices and using solar radiation besides products and intermediates of the photocatalytic degradation of pro have been identified and appropriate reaction pathways

iron 50 and oxygen 38 with smaller amounts of carbon calcium silicon manganese and aluminum xrd data confirmed that it is mostly composed of hematite the alpha polymorph of fe2o3 41 particle size distribution is broad where particles with diameter ranging 0 2 100 μm comprise 99 of the total volume with a mean value of 20 6 μm median of 14 2 μm and mode is 23 8 μm these particles present different morphologies according to sem micrographs n i o mostly contains irregular micrometric particles in the form of aggregates and some small spherical particles 41 this corresponds to a bet

prepared with bidistilled organic matter free water whereas millipore milli q ultrapure water resistivity 18 2 mω cm was employed as hplc mobile phase 2 2 photodegradation experiments irradiation experiments were carried out in a stirred batch photoreactor comprising a 200 ml borosilicate glass photoreactor and an ultraviolet a plus visible uva vis light source fig 2 a heraeus medium pressure mercury vapor lamp model tq 150 z3 is cooled to 298 0 0 1 k by water circulation and irradiation bands below 350 nm were cut off with a duran 50 glass filter the photoreactor was covered with aluminum foil to reflect escaping radiation and to avoid the entrance of any other light thus photon flux at 366 nm was 2 38 10 6 einstein s 1 continuously stirred suspensions formed by adding the desired quantity of n i o powder into 200 ml of pro and oaa aqueous solution were kept in the dark for 30 min to allow for the adsorption desorption equilibrium to be established initial pro concentration was 8 ppm in all experiments far below pro solubility in water at 298 k 61 7 ppm 43 and ph was not adjusted unless stated otherwise thus resulting in the natural ph of the heterogeneous mixture photodegradation experiments were initiated by insertion of the previously warmed up lamp 15 min and then samples were collected at specific times filtered through 0 45 μm sartorius nylon filters to remove particles and analyzed it was previously checked that the nylon filters did not retain pro to a measurable level and consequently assumed the same was true for pro metabolites for solar experiments magnetically stirred borosilicate flasks were placed under sunlight with a 100 ml suspension of pro oaa and n i o and the same procedure was followed 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 hplc analysis filtered samples were analyzed with a thermo finnigan hplc instrument equipped with a diode array uv visible detector and a scharlau kromaphase 100 c18 column 5 μm 250 4 6 mm a 35 65 mixture of acetonitrile and ph 2 5 buffer 0 01 m kh2po4 h3po4 at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 was used as mobile phase and pro was detected at 289 nm 2 3 2 uhplc ms analysis the identification of obtained

to a thermo fisher scientific accela uhplc apparatus a phenomenex kinetex xb c18 column 2 6 μm 100 2 1 mm column was used analyses were carried out using full scan data dependent ms acquiring data from m z 50 to 400 2 3 3 other analytical measurements total organic carbon toc values were measured in a shimadzu toc 5000a analyzer results at different reaction times were compared to the starting value to determine the mineralization degree fe2 in solution was measured by the 1 10 phenanthroline method 44 h2o2 was measured using a colorimetric method based on its derivatization with ticl4 reagent where the molar absorption coefficient at 410 nm is ε 720 m 1 cm 1 45 2 4 recovery of the catalyst n i o was recovered after its use following a very simple procedure the nylon filter employed during the experiment was backwashed with distilled water and this effluent containing some n i o was merged with the leftover reaction solution and therefore with the remaining catalyst the particles of n i o were allowed to settle for 2 h the supernatant was decanted away and the sediment was dried in the same reaction vessel at 90 c for 12 h prior to the following degradation run no washing or any other further treatment of the used n i o was performed 3 results and discussion pro degradation in aqueous solution under different reaction conditions presence and absence of n i o and or oaa and either in the dark or under uva vis irradiation is shown in fig 3 in this and the following figures unless differently stated lines just represent tendencies and are not mathematical fits of mechanistic models pro does not decrease within 2 h in the dark the addition of n i o did not induce degradation but some weak surface interaction phenomena in the heterogeneous medium at natural ph also no effect was observed with oaa alone therefore no evidence of significant adsorption or degradation of pro has been observed in the dark pro is a weak base with pk a 9 5 46 and n i o has zeta potential 0 when 2 ph 8 47 48 the fact that both pro and n i o are positively charged at ph 9 explain the lack of pro adsorption onto n i o on the other hand approximately 65 conversion was observed with or without n i o after 2 h of lamp irradiation indicating a relatively slow photolysis process and the absence of any relevant effect of n i o light dispersion by n i o suspended particles accounts for the difference between uva vis and n i o uva vis experiments this suggests that the photoreductive dissolution of n i o does not present any noticeable effect on pro degradation 49 50 and that the photocatalytic activity of n i o particles acting as a semiconductor generation of e h pairs has a minor contribution under these conditions despite it has been previously observed in other systems 17 18 oaa uva vis system leads to a 98 degradation of pro in 2 h this is attributed to h2o2 production by the direct photolysis of oaa to yield ho 51 when 1 0 g l 1 n i o was added to the reaction medium the degradation notably accelerated by the photo fenton like system and the reaction took place in ca 15 min with 80 pro elimination degradation of pro under suitable conditions is adequately fitted by a first order kinetic model and the corresponding rate constants k are listed in table 2 as already observed for other compounds 52 pro photodegradation must take place both on the iron oxide surface heterogeneous process and in solution homogeneous reaction once n i o is added to the solution oaa is chemically adsorbed on n i o surface forming iron oxide oxalate complexes feiii c2o4 n 3 2n zeta potential becomes negative at ph ca 2 48 the n i o oxalate system under uva vis irradiation can be excited to yield radicals such as c2o4 co2 o2 ho2 and ho eqs 5 9 13 the hydroxyl radical ho is an extremely strong non selective oxidant leading to the mineralization of most organic chemicals iron iii oxalate complexes feiii c2o4 n 3 2n fe2 and h2o2 are also formed in solution the two latter react to produce ho radicals eq 13 while the photolysis of fe iii oxalate complexes in solution yields ho as well additional ros such as radical cations arise from photodegradation of oaa and though it is dependent on n i o nature k 3 5 10 2 min 1 may be accepted for the corresponding rate constant eq 14 52 53 14 oaa o 2 hν oaa o 2 finally photoinduced homolysis of h2o2 also leads to formation of ho radicals eq 15 15 h 2 o 2 hν 2 ho λ 365 nm 3 1 formation of h2o2 and fe2 fe2 and h2o2 in solution both involved in fenton reaction were monitored fig 4 h2o2 is generated via two pathways ho2 reacting with o2 ho2 eq 10 and fe ii reacting with o2 ho2 eq 11 in the described experiment i e 1 0 g l 1 n i o 1 0 mm oaa and uva vis lamp h2o2 reaches a maximum value of 3 6 10 4 m after 10 min this photochemical reaction occurs both onto the iron oxide surface and also in the bulk of the solution 49 52 in the course of photodissolution of n i o dissolved iron may be photoreduced to fe2 reaching a peak value of 2 9 10 5 m after 15 min fe ii formation profile is similar to that occurring with goethite where two stages have been identified the first one is slower and then the presence of fe ii speeds up the process 54 fe2 and h2o2 in fe iii oxalate systems show different profiles depending on the medium ph fe iii 0 and oxalate ion 0 33 48 55 but it is also conditional on the incident radiation the presence of ferrous cations is the determining step for the overall reaction rate however it has been reported that both the lack and the excess of iron cations both fe2 and fe3 are not favorable for the degradation of organic pollutants 56 thus iron leaching is crucial in the catalytic process more information below in section 3 4 3 2 effect of tert butanol t buoh is a commonly used ho scavenger 20 as the corresponding reaction rate is very fast k ho t buoh 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 36 and the resulting radical is relatively inert it has been observed that small amounts of t buoh 0 1 mm inhibited ca 60 of the photocatalytic degradation of pro in 2 h fig 5 besides pro direct photolysis was similarly affected by t buoh exhibiting kinetics that are comparable to the inhibited photo fenton like process this indicates that ho is also generated during pro photolysis which must be attributed to pro acting as a photosensitizer 57 58 the comparison between the effect of t buoh on pro direct photolysis and photocatalysis fig 5 suggests that pro removal by n i o oaa photocatalysis is mainly promoted by ho competition between oxalate and pro by ho could be discarded since k pro ho is diffusion controlled 59 whereas k ho oxalate 107 m 1 s 1 60 3 3 effect of photocatalyst concentration the catalyst load may have a positive or negative impact on the photodegradation depending on its amount an increase in photocatalyst concentration means a higher number of reactive sites thus increasing the degradation rate on the other hand the addition of an excess of catalyst increases turbidity and light dispersion reducing the amount of effective uv photons which negatively affects the reaction rate besides n i o also has some effect on the ph of the reaction medium as it increases with catalyst concentration which decreases the degradation rate see below section 3 5 we have tested all these factors together by modifying the amount of catalyst without changing the other chemicals that participate in the reaction thus to determine the optimal n i o dosage experiments were carried out in the 0 5 2 0 g l 1 n i o range while pro was kept constant and ph was not adjusted fig 6 the obtained results indicate that photodegradation efficiency increases with decreasing n i o load first order kinetic rate constants k are listed in table 2 more fe iii oxalate complexes may be formed on the surface or in solution with growing n i o load and consequently more ho should be produced and increased pro degradation would be expected 61 however a degradation decrease is observed at higher catalyst loads which is attributed to strong light dispersion by suspended particles that reduces the availability of photons and therefore the formation of ho also the increase in ph with growing n i o see section 3 5 operates against the photodegradation process 3 4 effect of oxalic acid concentration oaa 0 is an important factor to determine optimal pro removal conditions this effect was investigated from 0 5 to 2 0 mm oaa at constant 1 g l 1 n i o load fig 7 pro photodegradation has proved very sensitive to oxalate its efficiency increases with oaa 0 as it increases both adsorbed and in solution fe iii oxalate complexes also increase and consequently the amount of reactive radical species responsible of pro degradation besides a higher amount of oaa leads to a more acidic initial ph which also markedly affects the reaction rate section 3 5 ph changes along the reaction increasing with time fig 8 so that the initial acid ph of the medium is mostly neutralized by the end of the reaction this implies an important advantage for this system with respect to regular photo fenton processes using h2o2 in acidic medium as any subsequent neutralization steps may not be necessary this change can be explained by the consumption of oaa eqs 1 9 52 along with ho production eq 13 with a minor contribution of ho generation and h2o2 formation which also consumes protons eqs 10 11 iron leaching depends on the concentration of oaa and the processes undergone are strongly affected by the irradiation fig 9 an increase in oaa led to a rise in fe2 under irradiation whereas the presence of this cation in the reaction medium was negligible in the dark it has been reported that iron oxides can be quickly dissolved in oaa solution but the reduction process of fe3 hardly occurs without irradiation 35 besides the dissolution of iron oxides in organic acid solutions is promoted by ultraviolet and visible light radiation eqs 5 6 26 33 fe2 increases along the first 60 min of irradiation as fe iii oxalate complexes are easily photodissolved and reduced to fe ii oxalate complexes eq 6 62 fe2 ions can be also produced through eq 12 in the late stage of the reaction the transference of iron cations from the n i o surface to the solution slows down due to both the consumption of oaa and the corresponding ph increase under these conditions fe3 precipitates as fe oh 3 so that the concentration of fe3 declines 35 3 5 effect of initial ph ph is commonly an essential parameter for photo fenton processes in this study we have employed natural ph after the addition of the necessary oaa for avoiding the use of other chemicals still we have also checked the effect of this parameter on the kinetics of the degradation process photocatalytic degradation of pro was examined at ph values 4 2 4 8 and 10 5 by adjusting ph with naoh aq fig 10 the best results were obtained under acidic conditions ph 4 2 where dissolved fe must be present predominantly as the photoactive feiii c2o4 3 3 and feii c2o4 2 2 complexes 63 this result is in agreement with the previously reported optimal ph range around 3 4 for the photodegradation of organic pollutants in the n i o oxalate complex system 20 42 at higher ph 4 5 predominant fe iii oxalate complexes are less photoactive 49 52 thus pro photodegradation at ph 4 8 is slowed down a negligible decrease in pro concentration at ph 10 5 was observed under alkaline conditions the predominant fe iii fe ii species are the insoluble hydroxides fe oh 3 and fe oh 2 that readily precipitate therefore the generation of active species is strongly inhibited at basic ph values preventing pro photodegradation 3 6 photodegradation products and proposed reaction pathways the main transformation products formed during uva vis irradiation of pro in the n i o oxalate system were identified by hplc ms in positive ion mode and are summarized in table 3 the m z value of each peak corresponds to the molecular ion m h some of them have been also previously reported as intermediates of different oxidation processes of pro 64 68 propranolol contains two types of reactive sites the aromatic moiety and the lateral chain fig 1 under attack of ho co bond breaking takes place releasing the lateral group 64 piram et al studied the photochemical behavior of pro in environmental waters 69 they observed hydroxylation only in the aromatic moiety without hydroxylation of the lateral chain in agreement with our findings ho radicals produced from the photolysis of n i o oxalate complex are responsible for the transformation of pro by attacking this compound in the following ways ho attack takes place in the benzene ring of pro leading to naphthol p1 m z 145 with release of the lateral group yielding the corresponding 3 isopropylamino propane 1 2 diol p2 m z 134 which have been also detected by santiago et al 64 and xie et al 70 further oxidation of pro can give naphthoxy methanoic acid p3 m z 189 this can be justified by the presence of the fragment c5h13no p4 m z 104 that corresponds to a c11 c12 bond cleavage on the side chain product ions at m z 129 correspond to a cleavage in the aliphatic chain of pro leading to naphthalene p5 p6 with m z 262 was obtained by firstly the addition of ho radicals on the aromatic ring and secondly the loss of one methyl group in the isopropyl moiety followed by protonation the dihydroxylation of the aromatic ring led to non observed products m z 296 this was followed by an oxidative ring opening reaction involving decarboxylation which leads to p7 with m z 268 67 subsequent oxidation of the alcohol moiety to aldehyde results in the formation of p8 m z 266 67 the latter also led to the formation of p9 m z 224 the loss of 42 da indicates the cleavage of the isopropyl group the formation of products p7 and p8 has been previously observed in oxidation coagulation treatment with ferrate k2fe ivo4 by wilde et al 67 further p10 m z 264 was formed during the direct photolysis of propranolol in aqueous solution this fragment ion was found by qin tao et al 66 who studied the degradation of propranolol by radiation in the 295 800 nm range 3 7 mineralization h yang et al reported that pro was fully mineralized to co2 and nh4 after 4 h of irradiation in the tio2 catalyzed photodegradation 71 we have monitored total organic carbon toc along the photocatalytic degradation of 8 ppm pro with n i o 1 g l 1 and oaa 1 mm results showed that toc decreases much more slowly than pro itself and that mineralization is far for completion after 3 h irradiation fig 11 this can be explained by a multistep degradation of pro with formation of several organic intermediates in agreement with the proposed reaction pathways scheme 1 which appear to be more resistant to photodegradation the observed partial mineralization of propranolol brings attention to the remaining toxicity of the incompletely degraded mixture it has been proposed that the photodegradation products from pro should be less toxic because of their presumed higher polarity and hydrophilicity than the parent compound and this hypothesis has been tested in different studies the toxicity evaluation of pro and its degradation products by algae raphidocelis subcapitata and rotifer brachionus calyciflorus screening tests supported this postulate 72 however the toxicity to daphnia magna increased during the early stages of the photocatalytic decomposition of pro and then progressively decreased upon the elimination of this compound 73 also the product mixtures obtained from pro degradation by uv persulfate treatment showed lower toxicity to vibrio fischeri than the corresponding initial solutions 74 3 8 propranolol photodegradation by n i o oxalate system under real conditions in what has been described so far the model pollutant pro was dissolved in distilled water and the photodegradation process occurred upon uva vis irradiation with a medium pressure hg vapor lamp however the study of elimination of persistent pollutants with aops is intended for its application in water treatment where these compounds are part of a complex matrix containing a number of other substances in this context the use of uva or vis radiation shows a relevant and sustainable advantage as emitting lamps can be replaced by sunlight taking this into account in addition to distilled water the elimination of pro in sewage river water and seawater has been studied with uva vis radiation fig 12 and table 4 the experiment was performed under the most favorable conditions among those observed in distilled water see above i e 1 0 g l 1 n i o and 2 0 mm oaa the optimal conditions were obtained with for 0 5 g l 1 n i o plus 1 0 mm oaa fig 6 and 2 0 mm oaa plus 1 0 g l 1 n i o fig 7 in distilled water however complex matrices contain organic matter and inorganic ions organic matter may react with ho radicals consuming a higher amount of oaa while inorganic ions may interact with n i o being adsorbed on its surface and thus reducing the availability of oaa to produce fe iii oxalate complexes considering this and to avoid any shortage of oaa that may hinder the reaction or reduce the activity we decided to use 2 0 mm oaa and 1 0 g l 1 n i o for the experiments pro photodegradation in sewage yielded a slower kinetic constant which we attribute to the high concentration of organic matter in the matrix leading to competitive reactions that consume ho still the degradation of pro was hardly affected with respect to distilled water the process in river water was slightly faster than in distilled water presumably due to the presence of dissolved photosensitizing organic materials and some inorganic ions it has been reported that humic and fulvic acids may act as natural photosensitizers 75 76 also inorganic ions such as nitrate and nitrite anions may produce no3 and ultimately ho 77 on the other hand inorganic ions may slow down pro photodegradation as some of the most effective ho radicals are consumed in parallel processes 58 59 pro photodegradation was much slower in seawater the presence of high concentrations of cl in the matrix inhibits the reaction through two different pathways cl scavenges ho particularly at acidic ph values to yield the much less oxidant and less reactive species cl2 78 and ho production is affected by competitive cl adsorption 79 onto n i o surface and by the formation of chloro fe iii complexes which photolyze to cl2 80 a similar analysis applies to sulfate anions 80 experiments with the same aqueous matrices were also performed under sunlight fig 13 and table 4 observed degradation rates are considerably slower than with the uva vis lamp due to the lower amount of high energy photons reaching the photocatalytic system in this case again river water enhances the process with respect to distilled water while sewage slightly reduces its rate and it is strongly inhibited in seawater where the process revealed quite inefficient less than 20 degradation in 2 h the experiments were performed in december at the northern hemisphere 43 19 36 n very close to winter solstice when solar elevation angle is the lowest which explains the slow degradation observed compared to artificial uva vis experiments a relevant outcome in this case is the fact that though photodegradation with direct solar light is slower ca four times than with the lamp still more than 95 of pro degradation was achieved within 30 min in river water and sewage although such a percentage was not obtained in distilled water even after 2 h irradiation considering these particular conditions the photocatalytic system here studied revealed quite adequate for the photodegradation of organic pollutants with solar radiation in several aqueous matrices although it seems not suitable for application in seawater 3 9 reusability of n i o usnder real conditions the system studied in this work has also been verified under other slightly different real conditions again the elimination of the model pollutant pro in distilled water river water sewage and seawater was tested with sunlight at a different period of the year october table 4 october 1 employing the same initial concentration of chemicals as above fig 13 furthermore n i o was recovered after this first use and it was reused again the day after table 4 october 2 under the same conditions but the solar radiation which was quite different results obtained are shown in fig 14 while the radiation profiles during the solar experiments are collected in fig 15 results obtained in the first use of n i o in october were slower than in december table 4 the elimination of pro is very fast thus 39 of pro was degraded in just the first 5 min in distilled water december and this value increased to 58 after 10 min however the same degradation only amounted to 16 and 46 respectively in october due to the lower incident radiation on the photoreactor in the initial part of the reaction fig 15 this applies to the four matrices employed but the rates are sorted likewise river water distilled water sewage seawater conversely the second run with the same photocatalyst was much faster than the other two experiments despite the incident radiation was considerably lower this day it was cloudy it has been observed that the settling rate of n i o notably depends on the nature of the aqueous matrix this different behavior was detected when the catalyst was recovered but it also happened during kinetic runs thus the clay kept easily suspended in distilled water for a long time and similarly in seawater however it settled quickly in river water and particularly in sewage the latter has been collected from the inlet of a treatment plant that receives inflows of both domestic sewage and industrial wastewater so it is a complex mixture of organic matter with other organic and inorganic chemicals therefore any substance present in this matrix could have a flocculation effect or could promote the aggregation of particulate in any other way on the other hand river water should not promote the settling of n i o the effect of organic species with high molecular weight such as humic acids on the settling rate of red mud an industrial waste with high iron oxide content has already been examined 81 according to this study n i o a clay mostly composed of hematite should present slower settling rate in river water than in distilled water the opposite of what happened here this dissimilar settling behavior has two important effects the first of them is that n i o suspensions in river water and sewage already in the first use are less turbid thus sunlight may reach the whole reaction vessel enhancing photo fenton reaction with dissolved iron cations apart from the previous discussion above section 3 8 this could also support the high elimination rates obtained in these two aqueous matrices table 4 despite they contain much greater amounts of degradable organic matter the second outcome is related to the recovery of the catalyst following the procedure described in section 2 4 the smaller particulate still in suspension after 2 h is discarded with the supernatant thus a higher amount of fine n i o was removed in the matrices where settling was slower i e the effect is maximum with distilled water and minimum with sewage recovered catalyst samples led to suspensions with lower turbidity as the smaller particles have been removed and the remaining n i o settled easily even under vigorous stirring therefore the second use of n i o in all matrices but seawater where only slight degradation occurs revealed much faster than the first one table 4 despite the radiation received in the second run was considerably lower fig 15 furthermore degradation rate particularly increased in distilled water where settling was the slowest and only very slightly in sewage which showed much faster settling it must be taken into account that n i o is a very affordable material from an economic point of view its reuse is only acceptable if the recovery process is easy and costless n i o is a natural clay with high density and therefore it settles easily a minor presence of iron oxide particles in water does not possess toxicity risk to the environment or any adverse outcome to human health provided that they are not nanoparticles 82 which is the case here the granulometric analysis did not observe particles under 100 nm in the sample 4 conclusions propanolol pro photodegradation is speeded up in acid media in the presence of suspended natural iron oxide n i o and dissolved oxalic acid oaa pro decomposes following first order kinetics faster with higher oaa concentration and lower ph value and load of n i o the addition of t buoh inhibits the photodegradation i e this process takes place mostly via generated ho besides the fast removal of the target compound a relevant advantage with respect to standard photo fenton process was the observed neutralization of the initial acid ph along the reaction although pro disappears in nearly 10 min under optimal conditions toc decreases much more slowly and ca 40 toc remains after 3 h irradiation ten intermediates were identified in pro photodegradation using hplc ms and the corresponding reaction mechanism is proposed pro photodegradation employing this photo fenton like system n i o oaa with uva is radiation accelerated in river water relative to distilled water but it was slower in sewage and seawater almost one order of magnitude with the latter photodegradation revealed also quite effective when sunlight is used except for seawater despite this process was studied under very weak winter solar radiation therefore this technology reveals as a very promising sustainable method for the abatement of organic pollutants in fresh water and sewage using sunlight as irradiation source and n i o and oaa as abundant and cheap reagents with the first of them being also reusable credit authorship contribution statement w remache investigation formal analysis writing original

13071,we report on the degradation of aqueous propranolol pro in a heterogeneous system with natural iron oxide n i o and oxalic acid oaa under near uv vis irradiation photolysis experiments showed ca 65 degradation of pro after 2 h irradiation and a similar degradation in the presence of n i o a more efficient pro removal was obtained upon irradiation within a mixture of n i o and oaa under the best conditions considered complete degradation 95 was observed in less than 10 min and toc decreased by 60 after 3 h irradiation the observed processes were adequately fitted by pseudo first order kinetics the corresponding rate constants were determined and the effect of different variables analyzed photodegradation of pro is accelerated under acidic conditions and neutralization takes place along the reaction hydroxyl radicals play a predominant role in the photodegradation reaction as shown by the dramatic inhibition observed upon t butanol addition furthermore ho formation is strongly dependent on the ph of the medium lc ms identification of ten different intermediates leads to the proposal of a degradation mechanism this photocatalytic system has also proven effective for the first time in different real aqueous matrices river water distilled water sewage seawater revealing quite efficient in the former and also employing sunlight where pro photodegradation was slower the results obtained show that n i o oxalate complexes are a green cheap choice for removing organic pollutants in aqueous solution keywords propranolol heterogeneous photo fenton natural iron oxide oxalic acid hydroxyl radicals 1 introduction the presence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments and therefore in drinking water is of major concern due to their extensive use and incomplete removal during water treatment 1 2 propranolol pro 1 naphthalen 1 yloxy 3 propan 2 ylamino propan 2 ol fig 1 is a β adrenergic blocker used for the treatment of hypertension angina pectoris and arrhythmia 3 with more than 9 million prescriptions in the u s in 2019 4 it is included in the who model list of essential medicines this drug has been repeatedly found in natural and wastewaters 5 6 at concentrations ranged from 0 07 to 89 ng l 1 median values of different studies 7 and up to 18 ng l 1 8 respectively besides several studies have informed about the potential toxic effects of this compound so that its presence in surface water can pose a risk to both humans and aquatic ecosystems 9 10 pro toxicity to different organisms has been assessed in several studies for instance the average 48 h lc50 for daphnia magna ceriodaphnia dubia and oryzias latipes was 1 6 0 85 and 24 3 mg l 1 respectively 11 thus the development of novel technologies to efficiently remove pharmaceuticals such as β blockers is of great importance several studies have indicated that advanced oxidation processes aops are able to remove β blockers from aqueous solution 12 13 photocatalysis using iron oxides is a popular technology because they are widely available and inexpensive 14 as they comprise natural minerals abundant in the earth s crust 15 major iron oxides show semiconductor properties with a narrow band gap of 2 0 2 3 ev and thus they can be photoactive under solar radiation 16 as a result they may act as natural photocatalysts to mediate the degradation of organic pollutants in the environment 17 18 typically their induced reactions start with sunlight excitation of semiconductor particles to produce conduction band electrons e and valence band positive holes h eq 1 which may prompt photoreduction and photooxidation processes respectively 16 19 thus these excited electrons can be transferred to molecular oxygen o2 to form the superoxide anion o2 1 iron oxide hν h e 2 o 2 e o 2 hydroxyl radicals ho can be formed via oxidation of ho by h 3 ho h ho the photoinduced degradation of organic pollutants by irradiated iron oxides has been extensively investigated with different degrees of success 20 24 but it has been recently found that this mode of degradation can be accelerated by photo fenton like reactions assisted by polycarboxylic acids oxalic malic citric tartaric etc 21 25 29 these carboxylic acids show an important chelating ability toward multivalent cations 30 in particular oxalic acid reveals quite promising as compared to similar compounds due to its acid strength good complexing characteristics and high reducing potential 31 oxalic acid h2c2o4 oaa can bind iron oxide to form fe iii oxalate complexes through chemical adsorption eq 4 where stands for the n i o surface lattice the photolysis of these complexes results in an oxidative degradation of the oxalate ligand and the reduction of the ferric center to fe ii eq 5 32 a process that may also occur in solution with solubilized iron ions eq 6 thus a series of reactive oxygen species ros such as co2 o2 and ho2 eqs 7 8 and 9 respectively are produced in the solution besides h2o2 can be obtained by dismutation of o2 ho2 eq 10 or via oxidation of fe2 eq 11 superoxide anion can also react with fe3 yielding the ferrous cation eq 12 fe ii and h2o2 may react to produce the hydroxyl radical ho fenton reaction eq 13 which acts as primary oxidant 33 35 this radical reacts readily and unselectively with organic compounds due to its very high oxidation potential 2 80 v vs nhe 36 therefore organic pollutants can be efficiently degraded or even mineralized in this photochemical system reaction 13 generates ho in a relatively slow way considering its reported k 40 80 m 1 s 1 37

complex system have not yet been described besides to the best of our knowledge this procedure has not been tested under real conditions i e employing sunlight and with pollutants dissolved in complex matrices rather than distilled water this last point is very important to assess the feasibility of this technique in fact the major objective of this study was the evaluation of the system comprised of suspended natural iron oxide n i o together with oaa to photodegrade pro as a model pollutant in water with no other chemicals added to obtain a very efficient economical sustainable technique for water decontamination the effect of oaa concentration n i o load and ph on the photodegradation was analyzed the degree of pollutant mineralization was also examined and the efficiency of the reaction was tested in different aqueous matrices and using solar radiation besides products and intermediates of the photocatalytic degradation of pro have been identified and appropriate reaction pathways

prepared with bidistilled organic matter free water whereas millipore milli q ultrapure water resistivity 18 2 mω cm was employed as hplc mobile phase 2 2 photodegradation experiments irradiation experiments were carried out in a stirred batch photoreactor comprising a 200 ml borosilicate glass photoreactor and an ultraviolet a plus visible uva vis light source fig 2 a heraeus medium pressure mercury vapor lamp model tq 150 z3 is cooled to 298 0 0 1 k by water circulation and irradiation bands below 350 nm were cut off with a duran 50 glass filter the photoreactor was covered with aluminum foil to reflect escaping radiation and to avoid the entrance of any other light thus photon flux at 366 nm was 2 38 10 6 einstein s 1 continuously stirred suspensions formed by adding the desired quantity of n i o powder into 200 ml of pro and oaa aqueous solution were kept in the dark for 30 min to allow for the adsorption desorption equilibrium to be established initial pro concentration was 8 ppm in all experiments far below pro solubility in water at 298 k 61 7 ppm 43 and ph was not adjusted unless stated otherwise thus resulting in the natural ph of the heterogeneous mixture photodegradation experiments were initiated by insertion of the previously warmed up lamp 15 min and then samples were collected at specific times filtered through 0 45 μm sartorius nylon filters to remove particles and analyzed it was previously checked that the nylon filters did not retain pro to a measurable level and consequently assumed the same was true for pro metabolites for solar experiments magnetically stirred borosilicate flasks were placed under sunlight with a 100 ml suspension of pro oaa and n i o and the same procedure was followed 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 hplc

from m z 50 to 400 2 3 3 other analytical measurements total organic carbon toc values were measured in a shimadzu toc 5000a analyzer results at different reaction times were compared to the starting value to determine the mineralization degree fe2 in solution was measured by the 1 10 phenanthroline method 44 h2o2 was measured using a colorimetric method based on its derivatization with ticl4 reagent where the molar absorption coefficient at 410 nm is ε 720 m 1 cm 1 45 2 4 recovery of the catalyst n i o was recovered after its use following a very simple procedure the nylon filter employed during the experiment was backwashed with distilled water and this effluent containing some n i o was merged with the leftover reaction solution and therefore with the remaining catalyst the particles of n i o were allowed to settle for 2 h the supernatant was decanted away and the sediment was dried in the same reaction vessel at 90 c for 12 h prior to the following degradation run no washing or any other further treatment of the used n i o was performed 3 results and discussion pro degradation in aqueous solution under different reaction conditions presence and absence of n i o and or oaa and either in the dark or under uva vis irradiation is shown in fig 3 in this and the following figures unless differently stated lines just represent tendencies and are not mathematical fits of mechanistic models pro does not decrease within 2 h in the dark the addition of n i o did not induce degradation but some weak surface interaction phenomena in the heterogeneous medium at natural ph also no effect was observed with oaa alone therefore no evidence of significant adsorption or degradation of pro has been observed in the dark pro is a weak base with pk a 9 5 46 and n i o has zeta potential 0 when 2 ph 8 47 48 the fact that both pro and n i o are positively charged at ph 9 explain the lack of pro adsorption onto n i o on the other hand approximately 65 conversion was observed with or without n i o after 2 h of lamp irradiation indicating a relatively slow photolysis process and the absence of any relevant effect of n i o light dispersion by n i o suspended particles accounts for the difference between uva vis and n i o uva vis experiments this suggests that the photoreductive dissolution of n i o does not present any noticeable effect on pro degradation 49 50 and that the photocatalytic activity of n i o particles acting as a semiconductor generation of e h pairs has a minor contribution under these conditions despite it has been previously observed in other systems 17 18 oaa uva vis system leads to a 98 degradation of pro in 2 h this is attributed to h2o2 production by the direct photolysis of oaa to yield ho 51 when 1 0 g l 1 n i o was added to the reaction medium the degradation notably accelerated by the photo fenton like system and the reaction took place in ca 15 min with 80 pro elimination degradation of pro under suitable conditions is adequately fitted by a first order kinetic model and the corresponding rate constants k are listed in table 2 as already observed for other compounds 52 pro photodegradation must take place both on the iron oxide surface heterogeneous process and in solution homogeneous reaction once n i o is added to the solution oaa is chemically adsorbed on n i o surface forming iron oxide oxalate complexes feiii c2o4 n 3 2n zeta potential becomes negative at ph ca 2 48 the n i o oxalate system under uva vis irradiation can be excited to yield radicals such as c2o4 co2 o2 ho2 and ho eqs 5 9 13 the hydroxyl radical ho is an extremely strong non selective oxidant leading to the mineralization of most organic chemicals iron iii oxalate complexes feiii c2o4 n 3 2n fe2 and h2o2 are also formed in solution the two latter react to produce ho radicals eq 13 while the photolysis of fe iii oxalate complexes in solution yields ho as well additional ros such as radical cations arise from photodegradation of oaa and though it is dependent on n i o nature k 3 5 10 2 min 1 may be accepted for the corresponding rate constant eq 14 52 53 14 oaa o 2 hν oaa o 2 finally photoinduced homolysis of h2o2 also leads to formation of ho radicals eq 15 15 h 2 o 2 hν 2 ho λ 365 nm 3 1 formation of h2o2 and fe2 fe2 and h2o2 in solution both involved in fenton reaction were monitored fig 4 h2o2 is generated via two pathways ho2 reacting with o2 ho2 eq 10 and fe ii reacting with o2 ho2 eq 11 in the described experiment i e 1 0 g l 1 n i o 1 0 mm oaa and uva vis lamp h2o2 reaches a maximum value of 3 6 10 4 m after 10 min this photochemical reaction occurs both onto the iron oxide surface and also in the bulk of the solution 49 52 in the course of photodissolution of n i o dissolved iron may be photoreduced to fe2 reaching a peak value of 2 9 10 5 m after 15 min fe ii formation profile is similar to that occurring with goethite where two stages have been identified the first one is slower and then the presence of fe ii speeds up the process 54 fe2 and h2o2 in fe iii oxalate systems show different profiles depending on the medium ph fe iii 0 and oxalate ion 0 33 48 55 but it is also conditional on the incident radiation the presence of ferrous cations is the determining step for the overall reaction rate however it has been reported that both the lack and the excess of iron cations both fe2 and fe3 are not favorable for the degradation of organic pollutants 56 thus iron leaching is crucial in the catalytic process more information below in section 3 4 3 2 effect of tert butanol t buoh is a commonly used ho scavenger 20 as the corresponding reaction rate is very fast k ho t buoh 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 36 and the resulting radical is relatively inert it has been observed that small amounts of t buoh 0 1 mm inhibited ca 60 of the photocatalytic degradation of pro in 2 h fig 5 besides pro direct photolysis was similarly affected by t buoh exhibiting kinetics that are comparable to the inhibited photo fenton like process this indicates that ho is also generated during pro photolysis which must be attributed to pro acting as a photosensitizer 57 58 the comparison between the effect of t buoh on pro direct photolysis and photocatalysis fig 5 suggests that pro removal by n i o oaa photocatalysis is mainly promoted by ho competition between oxalate and pro by ho could be discarded since k pro ho is diffusion controlled 59 whereas k ho oxalate 107 m 1 s 1 60 3 3 effect of photocatalyst concentration the catalyst load may have a positive or negative impact on the photodegradation depending on its amount an increase in photocatalyst concentration means a higher number of reactive sites thus increasing the degradation rate on the other hand the addition of an excess of catalyst increases turbidity and light dispersion reducing the amount of effective uv photons which negatively affects the reaction rate besides n i o also has some effect on the ph of the reaction medium as it increases with catalyst concentration which decreases the degradation rate see below section 3 5 we have tested all these factors together by modifying the amount of catalyst without changing the other chemicals that participate in the reaction thus to determine the optimal n i o dosage experiments were carried out in the 0 5 2 0 g l 1 n i o range while pro was kept constant and ph was not adjusted fig 6 the obtained results indicate that photodegradation efficiency increases with decreasing n i o load first order kinetic rate constants k are listed in table 2 more fe iii oxalate complexes may be formed on the surface or in solution with growing n i o load and consequently more ho should be produced and increased pro degradation would be expected 61 however a degradation decrease is observed at higher catalyst loads which is attributed to strong light dispersion by suspended particles that reduces the availability of photons and therefore the formation of ho also the increase in ph with growing n i o see section 3 5 operates against the photodegradation process 3 4 effect of oxalic acid concentration oaa 0 is an important factor to determine optimal pro removal conditions this effect was investigated from 0 5 to 2 0 mm oaa at constant 1 g l 1 n i o load fig 7 pro photodegradation has proved very sensitive to oxalate its efficiency increases with oaa 0 as it increases both adsorbed and in solution fe iii oxalate complexes also increase and consequently the amount of reactive radical species responsible of pro degradation besides a higher amount of oaa leads to a more acidic initial ph which also markedly affects the reaction rate section 3 5 ph changes along the reaction increasing with time fig 8 so that the initial acid ph of the medium is mostly neutralized by the end of the reaction this implies an important advantage for this system with respect to regular photo fenton processes using h2o2 in acidic medium as any subsequent neutralization steps may not be necessary this change can be explained by the consumption of oaa eqs 1 9 52 along with ho production eq 13 with a minor contribution of ho generation and h2o2 formation which also consumes protons eqs 10 11 iron leaching depends on the concentration of oaa and the processes undergone are strongly affected by the irradiation fig 9 an increase in oaa led to a rise in fe2 under irradiation whereas the presence of this cation in the reaction medium was negligible in the dark it has been reported that iron oxides can be quickly dissolved in oaa solution but the reduction process of fe3 hardly occurs without irradiation 35 besides the dissolution of iron oxides in organic acid solutions is promoted by ultraviolet and visible light radiation eqs 5 6 26 33 fe2 increases along the first 60 min of irradiation as fe iii oxalate complexes are easily photodissolved and reduced to fe ii oxalate complexes eq 6 62 fe2 ions can be also produced through eq 12 in the late stage of the reaction the transference of iron cations from the n i o surface to the solution slows down due to both the consumption of oaa and the corresponding ph increase under these conditions fe3 precipitates as fe oh 3 so that the concentration of fe3 declines 35 3 5 effect of initial ph ph is commonly an essential parameter for photo fenton processes in this study we have employed natural ph after the addition of the necessary oaa for avoiding the use of other chemicals still we have also checked the effect of this parameter on the kinetics of the degradation process photocatalytic degradation of pro was examined at ph values 4 2 4 8 and 10 5 by adjusting ph with naoh aq fig 10 the best results were obtained under acidic conditions ph 4 2 where dissolved fe must be present predominantly as the photoactive feiii c2o4 3 3 and feii c2o4 2 2 complexes 63 this result is in agreement with the previously reported optimal ph range around 3 4 for the photodegradation of organic pollutants in the n i o oxalate complex system 20 42 at higher ph 4 5 predominant fe iii oxalate complexes are less photoactive 49 52 thus pro photodegradation at ph 4 8 is slowed down a negligible decrease in pro concentration at ph 10 5 was observed under alkaline conditions the predominant fe iii fe ii species are the insoluble hydroxides fe oh 3 and fe oh 2 that readily precipitate therefore the generation of active species is strongly inhibited at basic ph values preventing pro photodegradation 3 6 photodegradation products and proposed reaction pathways the main transformation products formed during uva vis irradiation of pro in the n i o oxalate system were identified by hplc ms in positive ion mode and are summarized in table 3 the m z value of each peak corresponds to the molecular ion m h some of them have been also previously reported as intermediates of different oxidation processes of pro 64 68 propranolol contains two types of reactive sites the aromatic moiety and the lateral chain fig 1 under attack of ho co bond breaking takes place releasing the lateral group 64 piram et al studied the photochemical behavior of pro in environmental waters 69 they observed hydroxylation only in the aromatic moiety without hydroxylation of the lateral chain in agreement with our findings ho radicals produced from the photolysis of n i o oxalate complex are responsible for the transformation of pro by attacking this compound in the following ways ho attack takes place in the benzene ring of pro leading to naphthol p1 m z 145 with release of the lateral group yielding the corresponding 3 isopropylamino propane 1 2 diol p2 m z 134 which have been also detected by santiago et al 64 and xie et al 70 further oxidation of pro can give naphthoxy methanoic acid p3 m z 189 this can be justified by the presence of the fragment c5h13no p4 m z 104 that corresponds to a c11 c12 bond cleavage on the side chain product ions at m z 129 correspond to a cleavage in the aliphatic chain of pro leading to naphthalene p5 p6 with m z 262 was obtained by firstly the addition of ho radicals on the aromatic ring and secondly the loss of one methyl group in the isopropyl moiety followed by protonation the dihydroxylation of the aromatic ring led to non observed products m z 296 this was followed by an oxidative ring opening reaction involving decarboxylation which leads to p7 with m z 268 67 subsequent oxidation of the alcohol moiety to aldehyde results in the formation of p8 m z 266 67 the latter also led to the formation of p9 m z 224 the loss of 42 da indicates the cleavage of the isopropyl group the formation of products p7 and p8 has been previously observed in oxidation coagulation treatment with ferrate k2fe ivo4 by wilde et al 67 further p10 m z 264 was formed during the direct photolysis of propranolol in aqueous solution this fragment ion was found by qin tao et al 66 who studied the degradation of propranolol by radiation in the 295 800 nm range 3 7 mineralization h yang et al reported that pro was fully mineralized to co2 and nh4 after 4 h of irradiation in the tio2 catalyzed photodegradation 71 we have monitored total organic carbon toc along the photocatalytic degradation of 8 ppm pro with n i o 1 g l 1 and oaa 1 mm results showed that toc decreases much more slowly than pro itself and that mineralization is far for completion after 3 h irradiation fig 11 this can be explained by a multistep degradation of pro with formation of several organic intermediates in agreement with the proposed reaction pathways scheme 1 which appear to be more resistant to photodegradation the observed partial mineralization of propranolol brings attention to the remaining toxicity of the incompletely degraded mixture it has been proposed that the photodegradation products from pro should be less toxic because of their presumed higher polarity and hydrophilicity than the parent compound and this hypothesis has been tested in different studies the toxicity evaluation of pro and its degradation products by algae raphidocelis subcapitata and rotifer brachionus calyciflorus screening tests supported this postulate 72 however the toxicity to daphnia magna increased during the early stages of the photocatalytic decomposition of pro and then progressively decreased upon the elimination of this compound 73 also the product mixtures obtained from pro degradation by uv persulfate treatment showed lower toxicity to vibrio fischeri than the corresponding initial solutions 74 3 8 propranolol photodegradation by n i o oxalate system under real conditions in what has been described so far the model pollutant pro was dissolved in distilled water and the photodegradation process occurred upon uva vis irradiation with a medium pressure hg vapor lamp however the study of elimination of persistent pollutants with aops is intended for its application in water treatment where these compounds are part of a complex matrix containing a number of other substances in this context the use of uva or vis radiation shows a relevant and sustainable advantage as emitting lamps can be replaced by sunlight taking this into account in addition to distilled water the elimination of pro in sewage river water and seawater has been studied with uva vis radiation fig 12 and table 4 the experiment was performed under the most favorable conditions among those observed in distilled water see above i e 1 0 g l 1 n i o and 2 0 mm oaa the optimal conditions were obtained with for 0 5 g l 1 n i o plus 1 0 mm oaa fig 6 and 2 0 mm oaa plus 1 0 g l 1 n i o fig 7 in distilled water however complex matrices contain organic matter and inorganic ions organic matter may react with ho radicals consuming a higher amount of oaa while inorganic ions may interact with n i o being adsorbed on its surface and thus reducing the availability of oaa to produce fe iii oxalate complexes considering this and to avoid any shortage of oaa that may hinder the reaction or reduce the activity we decided to use 2 0 mm oaa and 1 0 g l 1 n i o for the experiments pro photodegradation in sewage yielded a slower kinetic constant which we attribute to the high concentration of organic matter in the matrix leading to competitive reactions that consume ho still the degradation of pro was hardly affected with respect to distilled water the process in river water was slightly faster than in distilled water presumably due to the presence of dissolved photosensitizing organic materials and some inorganic ions it has been reported that humic and fulvic acids may act as natural photosensitizers 75 76 also inorganic ions such as nitrate and nitrite anions may produce no3 and ultimately ho 77 on the other hand inorganic ions may slow down pro photodegradation as some of the most effective ho radicals are consumed in parallel processes 58 59 pro photodegradation was much slower in seawater the presence of high concentrations of cl in the matrix inhibits the reaction through two different pathways cl scavenges ho particularly at acidic ph values to yield the much less oxidant and less reactive species cl2 78 and ho production is affected by competitive cl adsorption 79 onto n i o surface and by the formation of chloro fe iii complexes which photolyze to cl2 80 a similar analysis applies to sulfate anions 80 experiments with the same aqueous matrices were also performed under sunlight fig 13 and table 4 observed degradation rates are considerably slower than with the uva vis lamp due to the lower amount of high energy photons reaching the photocatalytic system in this case again river water enhances the process with respect to distilled water while sewage slightly reduces its rate and it is strongly inhibited in seawater where the process revealed quite inefficient less than 20 degradation in 2 h the experiments were performed in december at the northern hemisphere 43 19 36 n very close to winter solstice when solar elevation angle is the lowest which explains the slow degradation observed compared to artificial uva vis experiments a relevant outcome in this case is the fact that though photodegradation with direct solar light is slower ca four times than with the lamp still more than 95 of pro degradation was achieved within 30 min in river water and sewage although such a percentage was not obtained in distilled water even after 2 h irradiation considering these particular conditions the photocatalytic system here studied revealed quite adequate for the photodegradation of organic pollutants with solar radiation in several aqueous matrices although it seems not suitable for application in seawater 3 9 reusability of n i o usnder real conditions the system studied in this work has also been verified under other slightly different real conditions again the elimination of the model pollutant pro in distilled water river water sewage and seawater was tested with sunlight at a different period of the year october table 4 october 1 employing the same initial concentration of chemicals as above fig 13 furthermore n i o was recovered after this first use and it was reused again the day after table 4 october 2 under the same conditions but the solar radiation which was quite different results obtained are shown in fig 14 while the radiation profiles during the solar experiments are collected in fig 15 results obtained in the first use of n i o in october were slower than in december table 4 the elimination of pro is very fast thus 39 of pro was degraded in just the first 5 min in distilled water december and this value increased to 58 after 10 min however the same degradation only amounted to 16 and 46 respectively in october due to the lower incident radiation on the photoreactor in the initial part of the reaction fig 15 this applies to the four matrices employed but the rates are sorted likewise river water distilled water sewage seawater conversely the second run with the same photocatalyst was much faster than the other two experiments despite the incident radiation was considerably lower this day it was cloudy it has been observed that the settling rate of n i o notably depends on the nature of the aqueous matrix this different behavior was detected when the catalyst was recovered but it also happened during kinetic runs thus the clay kept easily suspended in distilled water for a long time and similarly in seawater however it settled quickly in river water and particularly in sewage the latter has been collected from the inlet of a treatment plant that receives inflows of both domestic sewage and industrial wastewater so it is a complex mixture of organic matter with other organic and inorganic chemicals therefore any substance present in this matrix could have a flocculation effect or could promote the aggregation of particulate in any other way on the other hand river water should not promote the settling of n i o the effect of organic species with high molecular weight such as humic acids on the settling rate of red mud an industrial waste with high iron oxide content has already been examined 81 according to this study n i o a clay mostly composed of hematite should present slower settling rate in river water than in distilled water the opposite of what happened here this dissimilar settling behavior has two important effects the first of them is that n i o suspensions in river water and sewage already in the first use are less turbid thus sunlight may reach the whole reaction vessel enhancing photo fenton reaction with dissolved iron cations apart from the previous discussion above section 3 8 this could also support the high elimination rates obtained in these two aqueous matrices table 4 despite they contain much greater amounts of degradable organic matter the second outcome is related to the recovery of the catalyst following the procedure described in section 2 4 the smaller particulate still in suspension after 2 h is discarded with the supernatant thus a higher amount of fine n i o was removed in the matrices where settling was slower i e the effect is maximum with distilled water and minimum with sewage recovered catalyst samples led to suspensions with lower turbidity as the smaller particles have been removed and the remaining n i o settled easily even under vigorous stirring therefore the second use of n i o in all matrices but seawater where only slight degradation occurs revealed much faster than the first one table 4 despite the radiation received in the second run was considerably lower fig 15 furthermore degradation rate particularly increased in distilled water where settling was the slowest and only very slightly in sewage which showed much faster settling it must be taken into account that n i o is a very affordable material from an economic point of view its reuse is only acceptable if the recovery process is easy and costless n i o is a natural clay with high density and therefore it settles easily a minor presence of iron oxide particles in water does not possess toxicity risk to the environment or any adverse outcome to human health provided that they are not nanoparticles 82 which is the case here the granulometric analysis did not observe particles under 100 nm in the sample 4 conclusions propanolol pro photodegradation is speeded up in acid media in the presence of suspended natural iron oxide n i o and dissolved oxalic acid oaa pro decomposes following first order kinetics faster with higher oaa concentration and lower ph value and load of n i o the addition of t buoh inhibits the photodegradation i e this process takes place mostly via generated ho besides the fast removal of the target compound a relevant advantage with respect to standard photo fenton process was the observed neutralization of the initial acid ph along the reaction although pro disappears in nearly 10 min under optimal conditions toc decreases much more slowly and ca 40 toc remains after 3 h irradiation ten intermediates were identified in pro photodegradation using hplc ms and the corresponding

13072,in low pressure membrane filtration lpmf operations clean in place cip is carried out when transmembrane pressure tmp reaches a cip criterion which can be chosen up to the maximum allowable tmp suggested by membrane manufacturers this work suggests how to select a good cip criterion to decrease the cip frequency and specific energy consumption sec during the lifetime of membrane a constant flux lpmf model was developed based on hermia s blocking model and verified by two years operation data from a pilot plant with real size membrane modules the model exactly expects the fouling mechanism in the real lpmf operation and the tmp reproduced by the model matches real tmp from the pilot plant very well the long term simulation results using the lpmf model reveal high cip criteria near the maximum allowable tmp is not necessary to increase the cip interval the cip efficiency as good as 95 could be not sufficient to operate lpmf systems for more than 3 years and a low value e g 50 kpa of the temperature corrected tmp at 25 c as variable cip criteria can decrease sec and the cip frequency during the whole operation period graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords low

ultrafiltration uf both of which are specialized to remove particulate matters i e turbidity 1 2 there are two operation modes for lpmf dead end and crossflow filtration the former has only one direction of water flow i e all of feed water penetrates through membrane while the latter has two flow directions feed and permeate flow which are crossed crossflow operation mode has an advantage for membrane fouling control over dead end operation mode because feed and concentrate flow i e crossflow tangential to membrane surface can reduce concentration polarization and sweep deposited particles from the membrane surface 3 4 however lpmf for potable water production tends to apply dead end filtration due to advantages such as reduced energy consumption and capital costs compared to crossflow filtration 5 since raw water sources for water treatment plants have low solids concentration the advantage of crossflow becomes less significant and it is not necessary to pay for the capital and operational cost of crossflow operation mode 6 in dead end filtration membrane fouling is controlled by a short 1 min backwash with permeate at the end of each filtration cycle the periodic filtration and backwash processes are fully automated in real field applications 5 irreversible fouling is generally defined as the fouling which is not cleaned by the backwash both reversible and irreversible fouling induce an increase in transmembrane pressure tmp in the constant flux operation mode which is being applied to most real scale lpmf systems 7 if tmp reaches a maximum permitted value an intensive chemical cleaning for membrane modules should be carried out which is called clean in place or cleaning in place cip 8 9 the maximum permitted tmp should be the same as or less than the maximum tmp suggested by membrane manufacturers is in range of 200 300 kpa 10 11 the objective of cip is to recover the initial performance of the membrane by removing irreversible fouling materials using chemicals 12 the acidic agents such as hcl and h2so4 are used to remove inorganic foulants such as iron aluminium manganese calcium and magnesium and the alkalic agents such as naoh and naocl are used to remove organic foulants like transparent exopolymer particles tep 13 16 combinations of chemical agents should be tested to find out the best site specific recipe to maximize the cip efficiency for successful long term lpmf system operation 17 the optimal combinations and dosages of chemical agents are dependent upon the membrane materials e g polymers ceramics and stainless steel and characteristics of specific foulants e g oil organic acid 18 20 some literatures report that adding other processes like aeration can reduce the concentrations of chemical agents for cip and increase the efficiency 21 22 assuming that a good site specific recipe of chemical agents can be found to ensure a good cip efficiency this work focuses on finding an optimal cip interval for lpmf systems for drinking water production a membrane filtration guidance manual published by united states environmental protection agency reported that the typical cip frequency is approximately once every 30 to 60 days 23 however it is recommended that the frequency of cip is minimized i e the cip interval is maximized as possible during the lifetime of membrane module 3 7 years because cip results in the loss of water production the discharge of chemical wastes and adverse effects on the membrane life 8 24 there was a case where the cip interval was longer than 60 days according to the long term operation data of a pilot lpmf plant for drinking water production fig 1 the first cip was carried out after tmp exceeded 190 kpa after 9 months of operation with 1 0 m day 41 6 l m2h of the constant flux 25 there is no absolute answer for an optimal cip interval and it should be related to site specific conditions such as the magnitude of flux the chemical resistance of membrane and the convenience of the chemical waste disposal fig 1 shows that tmp increased gradually at its lower values and rose sharply at its higher values as mentioned earlier the maximum permitted tmp is a kind of milestone to determine whether to carry out cip and thus it can be called a cip criterion what if the cip criterion is much lower than the maximum operating pressure values suggested by membrane manufacturers e g 200 kpa if that is the case the cip interval becomes shorter which may induce adverse effects of cip more than the case with a longer cip interval however there exist some positive effects of a lower cip criterion 1 to avoid the operation periods with higher tmp values which results in higher energy and 2 to decrease the dosage of chemical cleaning agents for cip because of the less foulant accumulation during a shorter operation period compared to the case of a higher cip criterion moreover the operation period with higher tmp values tends to be even shorter compared to that with lower tmp values according to an example case in fig 1 the operation period with tmp values higher than 100 kpa 23 days is less than 10 of the whole operation period 280 days before the first cip positive and negative effects appear together by setting the cip criterion lower than the maximum permitted tmp in this case it is important to find out a cip criterion with which the benefit of a lower pressure operation exceeds the risk of more frequent cip fulfilments the most ideal approach to do this is to collect and review the various long term operation data of lpmf plant with real size membrane modules however only few data including the data shown in fig 1 were available to the authors 25 27 and it was impossible to suggest an optimal cip criterion or methodology to find it out by just reviewing these limited data therefore a lpmf model was developed in this work to simulate constant flux mode dead end filtration systems with periodical backwash the model was verified by the long term 2 years operation data from a pilot plant with a commercial real size membrane module and it was used to produce long term 3 5 years operation data subject to various conditions such as the cip criterion the permeate flux and the cip efficiency by comparing the number of cip fulfilments and the average specific energy consumption sec during the operation period subject to the various simulation conditions some important tips to select an optimal cip criterion will be discussed 2 methods 2 1 the lpmf model for the constant flux operation hermia 28 established a blocking model to reflect the membrane fouling in the basic form of 1 d 2 t d v 2 k dt dv n where t s v m3 and k are the filtration time cumulative permeate volume and a model parameter with varying dimensions dependent upon the value of n respectively and n is a dimensionless number to represent the four different fouling mechanisms e g complete pore blocking n 2 standard blocking n 1 5 intermediate blocking n 1 and cake formation n 0 which will be called the fouling mechanism parameter hereafter hermia s equation was revised to describe the constant flux filtration such as 7 2 d p s d v s k v p n where p s is the ratio of transmembrane pressure tmp p n m2 to the initial tmp p 0 v s is the cumulative volume of permeate per unit membrane area v s v a m3 m2 where a is the membrane area and k v is a fouling parameter subject to the foulants concentration in the feed water the unit of k v is also dependent upon the value of n like that of k the constant flux j m s is expressed as a function of tmp p the viscosity of water μ ns m2 and the resistance r m 1 which is the sum of membrane and cake resistances r m and r c as shown in 3 j p μr p μ r m r c the initial tmp p 0 is then expressed as 4 p 0 μ r m j because the cake resistance r c becomes zero at the start of filtration the cumulative volume of permeate v is expressed with the constant flux the membrane area and the filtration time like 5 v jat combining eqs 2 4 and 5 results in a differential equation of tmp such as 6 dp dt μ r m j 2 k v p n which can be used to simulate tmp values in the filtration cycles during a constant flux operation for low pressure membrane filtration lpmf systems the viscosity of water μ in eq 6 is a function of temperature and it is calculated with a regression equation 27 7 μ a exp 1 bt ct d t 2 where a 1 26 10 5 b 5 81 10 3 c 1 13 10 3 and d 5 72 10 6 are parameters for the regression and t k is the absolute temperature in a typical lpmf system operation a filtration cycle is followed by a backwash process to remove foulants accumulated during the filtration cycle the resistance at the starting point of the i 1 th filtration cycle r i 1 0 will be higher than that of the ith filtration cycle r i 0 if the removal of fouling by the backwash process is not perfect which can be expressed with the ratio of irreversible fouling rif such as 8 r i 1 0 r i 0 r i f r i 0 rif where r i f is the resistance at the end of the ith filtration cycle 29 the rif value ranged 0 to 1 decreases at higher foulant removal efficiency by backwash processes the rif value of 0 means the complete removal of foulants accumulated during one filtration cycle by a backwash process while the rif value of 1 means there is no effect of backwash during a filtration cycle tmp at a given time is calculated by solving the differential equation eq 6 with the initial tmp of the cycle temperature dependent viscosity membrane resistance and the constant flux at the end of the ith filtration cycle r i f is calculated by eq 3 using the final tmp p i f of the cycle then the initial resistance r i 1 0 and tmp p i 1 0 of the next cycle are calculated using eqs 8 and 3 respectively through this modeling procedure we can produce tmp data as a function of filtration time during the constant flux mode filtration period before a cip fulfilment if tmp reaches the cip criterion set in the model during a filtration cycle the initial resistance r 1 0 of the first cycle after a cip fulfilment is calculated using the cip efficiency e cip such as 9 r 1 0 r 1 0 r f f r 1 0 1 e cip where r 1 0 and r f f are the initial resistance of the first cycle and the final resistance of the final cycle before cip respectively the concept of eq 9 is similar that of eq 8 the cip efficiency ranges from 0 to 1 and the cip efficiency of 1 means the complete cleaning of membrane fouled during the filtration cycles before cip 2 2 verification of the lpmf model with the long term operation data from a pilot plant the lpmf model was developed through a procedure explained in section 2 1 using google colaboratory which is a web browser based coding tool for python 30 the developed model was verified using long term operation data of a mf pilot plant operated by k water korea where a real size mf membrane module table 1 was applied 25 27 31 the k water pilot plant had two independent units each of which two mf membrane modules were installed in one unit was operated with only one constant flux condition 1 0 m day and the other was operated with three constant flux conditions 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 m day we have obtained the long term two years from 2005 to 2006 operation data from the former unit unit 1 and the short term data 50 days from the latter unit unit 2 for the model verification the operation of the k water pilot plant consisted of four consecutive cycles such as 1 supply of feed water to the module 25 s 2 dead end filtration 30 min 3 backwash with permeate water 30 s and 4 drainage of backwash effluent 30 s as shown in fig 2 these four operation cycles are simplified to the filtration cycle 30 min and the break time 85 s in the lpmf model the lpmf model data were produced with the same initial operation condition membrane resistance water temperature tmp and permeate flux as the start of the k water pilot plant operation in 2005 the produced tmp data are dependent upon the fouling mechanism parameter n the fouling parameter k v and the ratio of irreversible fouling rif in eqs 6 and 8 these three variables are regarded as fitted parameters to minimize the model prediction errors the operation data from the k water pilot plant were available once every 10 min occasionally some of data were missing which means the available data do not always include the first and last points of a filtration cycle thus it was impossible to calculate the increase in tmp during a filtration cycle as an alternative an approximation of the tmp increase of a filtration cycle was calculated by subtracting the minimum tmp from the maximum tmp of 10 consecutive data including more than three filtration cycles although this approximated value does not match the tmp increase of any filtration cycle a group of the approximated values collected for several hours could be in the range which covers the values of the tmp increase of filtration cycles in the similar time zone if the tmp increase of a filtration cycle predicted by the model falls into the range of the approximated tmp increase in the similar time zone it can be considered that the lpmf model works well to predict the increase in tmp during filtration cycles this concept of verification will be well represented by fig 4 d in section 3 1 tmp values produced by the lpmf model were compared to those from the real operation data by day as discussed earlier the experimental data from the long term operation results were taken once every 10 min and it was impossible to recover a whole data of a filtration cycle this is the reason why both experimental and predicted daily average tmp values were compared for the model verification instead of comparing real time tmp data the prediction error of the model was quantified by normalized root mean squares of errors nrmse 32 34 root mean square error rmse is obtained by 10 rmse 1 n i 1 n tmp exp i tmp mod i 2 where tmp exp i tmp mod i and n are the daily average tmp of ith day from the k water plant operation data that from the lpmf model prediction and the number of total operation days respectively nrmse is obtained by dividing rmse by the average of tmp exp i 2 3 long term operation simulation subject to various cip criteria if the lpmf model is verified to reproduce tmp values close to real operation data it can be applied to simulate a long term lpmf system operation to investigate the effect of the selection of cip criterion on the performance of the system for the simulation the three fitted parameters of the lpmf model the fouling mechanism parameter n the fouling parameter k v and the ratio of irreversible fouling rif were taken from the verification works with the k water pilot plant data before the first cip and it was assumed that these constants would not change for 5 years simulation once a cip fulfilment is carried out the initial resistance of the first cycle after cip is subject to the cip efficiency e cip in eq 9 thus it is important to assume the reasonable cip efficiency values for the simulation according to the literature related to the k water pilot plant 25 31 the cip efficiency varied from 84 to 104 and most of the results were over 95 which made us to set the cip efficiency in the range of 0 95 to 1 00 the tested cip criteria were 50 to 200 kpa while four cases for the permeate flux were set to 1 0 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 m day respectively per each simulation the number of cip fulfilments for each year was counted and the specific energy consumption sec was calculated for each year of simulation using 11 sec wh m 3 j a p q p 3600 where sec stands for the energy consumption per unit water production q m 3 h is water production rate q m 3 h j m s a m 2 3600 s h 3600ja and j a p stands for power j m s a m 2 p n m 2 j a p nm s j s w needed to operate a lpmf system with the constant flux j and the tmp p rigorously speaking sec should consider the pump and motor efficiency 35 and water production rate should consider recovery rate the ratio of water production to water supply by reflecting the amount of the permeate water used for backwash however the sec in this work was simplified like eq 11 because it was used for comparing various simulation conditions mentioned earlier with the assumption of the same pump and motor efficiency and recovery rate 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of turbidity on tmp during the long term lpmf system operation fig 3 shows temperature and turbidity of feed water used in the k water pilot plant for two years 2005 2006 the objective of the pilot test is to find critical design parameters to build the first water treatment plant using a membrane system with a larger capacity than 5000 m3 day in south korea after the pilot test the gong ju water treatment plant using mf membranes with the capacity of 30 000 m3 day was designed built and operated since 2009 31 the operation started on 01 march 2005 and the first and second cip fulfilments were done on 16 december 2005 and 31 october 2006 respectively the long term operation data used for the verification of the lpmf model were taken until the second cip was done the start day 01 march 2005 is regarded as day 0 in this work fig 3 the feed water was taken from daecheong lake korea which supplies raw water to six water treatment plants nearby in the downstream the water temperature varied from 5 to 24 c according to four seasons the turbidity was mostly smaller than 10 ntu but occasionally increased for a short period due to heavy rains the maximum daily turbidity for two years was observed at around 110 ntu the report published by k water 31 mentioned that not only turbidity but also organic matters soluble iron fe and manganese mn were important foulants for their pilot plant concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc fe and mn in the feed water for two years operation ranged 1 1 2 3 mg l 0 01 0 3 mg l and 0 01 0 09 mg l respectively using the two years operation data of the unit 1 of the k water pilot plant the modeling and experimental tmp values were compared the operation data were divided into two parts before and after the first cip and each of them was used separately for the comparison fig 4 a shows the modeling and experimental tmp as a function of time before the first cip when the fouling parameter k v is assumed to be proportional to turbidity the three fitted parameters of the lpmf model for the most appropriate fitting to real operation data were k v 6 4 105 turbidity n 1 28 and rif 4 0 10 3 where turbidity means feed water turbidity with the unit of ntu the model fits real tmp data well until the 150th day but model tmp values surpasses the real tmp data after that according to fig 3 feed water turbidity after 150 days of operation maintains a high level compared to the previous operation period the model tmp sharply increases in this period because the fouling parameter is directly proportional to turbidity although there is a sharp increase in turbidity from the 70th to 75th day before the 150th day this results in a small increase in tmp from 22 to 33 kpa because the period is rather short with a low level of tmp values dp dt p n according to eq 6 the result in fig 4 a means the effect of turbidity on the tmp increase in a lpmf operation should be less than the case that the fouling parameter k v is proportional to turbidity thus the order of turbidity in the fouling parameter equation was decreased to values less than 1 fig 4 b shows the case when the order is 0 2 the three fitted parameters to minimize nrmse 26 6 were k v 2 0 104 turbidity 0 2 n 1 79 and rif 4 7 10 3 different from the result in fig 4 a the increasing pattern of tmp predicted by the lpmf model is very similar to that from the k water pilot plant operation although there is non negligible discrepancy between the modeling and experimental tmp after the 120th day as shown in fig 4 b when the fouling parameter is assumed to be independent upon the feed water turbidity i e k v is a constant the tmp increasing pattern fig 4 c is almost the same as the case in fig 4 b the model prediction error becomes smaller after the 260th day and the nrmse is 21 3 smaller than the nrmse in the case of fig 4 b where the fitted parameters were k v 2 0 104 n 1 80 and rif 5 9 10 3 fig 4 d shows the tmp increase in a filtration cycle δp as a function of average tmp of the filtration cycle and the model prediction values are nicely in the range of δp expected from the operation data these results in fig 4 c and d imply that the feed water turbidity did not affect the membrane fouling of the k water pilot plant it seems to be surprising that the feed water turbidity does not affect the fouling behavior observed in k water pilot plant but this must be reasonable because the fouling mechanism parameter n is 1 80 the model suggests the most appropriate fouling mechanism by finding the n value reproducing tmp data closest to the real values in this case the model suggests a mixture of standard blocking and complete pore blocking as the fouling mechanism of the k water pilot plant during the operation period shown in fig 4 this is because n 1 80 means the fouling mechanism of the k water pilot plant is somewhere between standard blocking n 1 5 and complete pore blocking n 2 as discussed in section 2 1 since the nominal pore size of the membrane used in k water pilot plant is 0 05 μm both standard blocking and complete pore blocking of this membrane can only be done by foulants smaller than the pore size which are not detected by a turbidity meter the k water report 31 mentioned the effects of doc fe and mn concentrations in the feed water on the membrane fouling were considerable several literatures also referred to the fouling by these materials in lpmf systems 36 41 unfortunately the time dependent concentration data for doc fe and mn were not available otherwise it would have been possible to obtain an equation for the fouling parameter k v with these concentrations as independent variables from these results it can be said that the lpmf model can suggest an appropriate fouling mechanism from the real lpmf operation data 3 2 rif dependent upon the temperature related characteristics of an operation period the lpmf model is verified to produce tmp data whose increasing pattern is very similar to that of real long term operation data however it is still insufficient to say that the lpmf model is verified to reproduce real data because there is a noticeable discrepancy between the modeling and experimental data as shown in fig 4 c the three fitted parameters were assumed to be constants over the whole operation period before the first cip it is appropriate that the fouling mechanism parameter n and the fouling parameter k v are assumed to be constants because concentrations of the main foulants doc fe and mn for the k water pilot plant should be assumed to be constants due to lack of time dependent data thus rif remains as the only parameter which may depend on some factors according to the real operation data in fig 4 c tmp was increased very slowly for about 200 days from the start thus it was impossible for the model data to fit the real tmp values during this period with the same fitted parameters to fit the tmp values sharply increased after this period we found that the 195th day was a turning point where water temperature started to decrease according to fig 3 although it is not certain that the efficiency of backwash rif decreases at higher backwash efficiencies becomes worse during the period when water temperature is being decreased we hypothesized that the backwash efficiency could be changed due to the temperature related characteristics of the operation period in this work the whole operation period was divided into several phases which exhibits only one of two opposite characteristics 1 water temperature becomes increased or 2 decreased during the phase according to the hypothesis rif was obtained separately for each divided phase to minimize the model prediction error fig 5 shows the modeling and experimental tmp data for two years of operation which are divided into five phases by the temperature related characteristics of the phase or the first cip it is assumed that the fouling mechanism parameter n and the fouling parameter k v can be changed after a cip fulfilment because the membrane surface may be changed by chemical agents used for cip both k v and n values before and after the first cip were k v 2 0 104 n 1 80 and k v 1 9 104 n 1 76 respectively since k v and n values before and after the first cip are similar to each other it is expected that the membrane surface was not changed so much by the first cip one interesting feature of the rif value for each phase is that rif tends to be smaller in the phase during which water temperature becomes increased phases i and iv compared to that in the phase during which water temperature becomes decreased phases ii iii and v this means the backwash efficiency is dependent upon this temperature related characteristics of the operation period since this finding could not be generalized with just two years operation results of a specific pilot lpmf system it is worth figuring out the reason why this phenomenon happened unfortunately it is out of range which can be covered by this work anyhow the prediction errors of the lpmf model were decreased nrmse 12 7 for phases i and ii and nrmse 13 5 for phases iii iv and v thanks to the introduction of rif subject to the temperature related characteristics of the operation period 3 3 the effect of permeate flux on tmp during the short term lpmf operation the unit 2 of the k water pilot plant was operated with three different constant flux conditions 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 m day as mentioned in section 2 2 these data make it possible to verify if the lpmf model successfully predict the effect of permeate flux on tmp variation during the operation fig 6 shows the modeling and experimental tmp for 50 days of operation of the unit 2 from 01 march 2005 the model data match the experimental tmp very well nrmse 2 43 which means the lpmf model well reflects the effect of flux on tmp variation during the constant flux mode filtration the prediction error is much smaller than errors to predict the long term operation tmp nrmse 12 7 and 13 5 in fig 5 because relatively short term data were used the three fitted parameters to minimize the prediction errors were k v 1 9 104 n 1 71 and rif 6 0 10 3 values of these fitted constants are similar to those used for the model to predict tmp of the unit 1 for the same operation period day 0 to 50 in fig 5 this means that the fouling mechanism related to n the fouling rate related to k v and the backwash efficiency related to rif tend to show similar patterns if the feed water quality and the membrane characteristics are the same i e the same membrane module and feed water were applied to both units 1 and 2 of the k water pilot plant although the flux conditions are different 3 4 reconsidering cip criterion in terms of the number of cip fulfilments and sec figs 5 and 6 show the lpmf model developed in this work reproduces tmp in the constant flux mode filtration close to the real data from the k water pilot plant operation if it is assumed that membrane is not severely damaged by cip the fouling behavior during any operation periods between two adjacent cip fulfilments will be in a similar pattern thus it can be expected that a long term simulation using the lpmf model with the same fitted parameters over the whole operation period will reproduce tmp data likely in real operation if this assumption is satisfied as mentioned in section 2 3 the three fitted parameters for all the simulation works were taken from the phases i and ii k v 2 0 104 n 1 80 rif 4 3 10 3 for temperature increasing periods and rif 1 1 10 2 for temperature decreasing periods fig 7 shows long term simulation results using the lpmf model most of simulation conditions are the same as the operation conditions of the unit 1 of the k water pilot plant for convenience and four different cip criteria p cip of 50 100 150 and 200 kpa and the common cip efficiency e cip of 99 are added to simulate the effect of cip cip is applied to the model by renewing the initial resistance of membrane using eq 9 in section 2 1 when the model tmp value exceeds p cip the simulation period was set to 5 years because the expected ages of polymeric membrane modules are in a range of 3 to 7 years the water temperature variation during the period in fig 7 a was taken from a surface water database web page of south korea 42 the cip intervals are not consistent as shown in fig 7 b c d and e because of the temperature variation the cip intervals are shorter at lower temperature periods because tmp values in these operation periods tend to be higher due to higher water viscosity values compared to those in higher temperature periods interestingly according to fig 7 a high cip criterion like 150 or 200 kpa is not necessary to decrease the number of cip fulfilments during the lifetime of the membrane modules the operation period with tmp values higher than 100 kpa is too short to see significant differences among the cip times with the criteria of 100 150 and 200 kpa as shown in fig 7 c d and e this is because the increasing rate of tmp is proportional to p n n 1 80 and tmp sharply increases at higher tmp values thus the cip criterion of 100 kpa seems to be the best selection among 50 100 150 and 200 kpa because it needs the lowest energy among the cip criteria which require the lowest number e g 13 of the cip fulfilments for 5 years however the cip criterion of 50 kpa is also competitive because it needs lower energy than 100 kpa with a requirement of just 4 more cip fulfilments anyhow it is proved that we do not need to keep lpmf operations until tmp reaches the maximum permitted value suggested by membrane manufacturers higher cip criteria may be advantageous at higher flux conditions because the initial tmp becomes higher at these flux conditions and closer to the cip criteria fig 8 a shows the effect of the permeate flux on the number of cip fulfilments for the 5th year last year of the simulation if the maximum number of cip fulfilments per year is limited to 12 as mentioned by the membrane filtration guidance manual 23 a flux same as or higher than 1 3 m day must be avoided to achieve 5 years operation without changing membrane modules because the number of cip fulfilments for the 5th year exceeds the limitation this is the reason why the case of j 1 3 m day is omitted in the sec analysis in fig 8 b different from the expectation the cip criteria higher than 100 kpa are not advantageous at all in terms of not only sec fig 8 b but also the number of cip fulfilments fig 8 a this is because the increasing rate of tmp becomes higher at higher flux conditions dp dt j 2 according to eq 6 the cip criteria of 100 and 50 kpa are competitive for the number of cip fulfilments 100 kpa and sec 50 kpa respectively especially some higher flux conditions with lower cip criteria need less sec than some lower flux conditions with higher cip criteria as shown in fig 8 b for example sec at j 1 2 m day and p cip 100 kpa is smaller than sec at j 1 0 m day and p cip 150 kpa and sec at j 1 2 m day and p cip 50 kpa is smaller than sec at j 1 0 m day and p cip 100 kpa according to these simulation results it had better select lower cip criteria to operate a lpmf system with higher flux values if the cip efficiency is good enough to be 99 however it should not be neglected that operating with high flux requires the more frequent cip fulfilments according to the simulation results discussed above selecting lower cip criteria will be better to result in less cip fulfilments and lower sec values for operation than higher cip criteria when the cip efficiency is as high as 99 what if the cip efficiency is lower fig 9 shows five years simulation results with the common value for the cip efficiency of 95 the simulation conditions except the cip efficiency and the tested cip criteria are the same as those in fig 7 regardless of the cip criteria p cip the operation does not last until the end of the simulation period the operation is set to be finished if the period between the adjacent cip fulfilments becomes shorter than 1 day this result has important meaning even an okay cip efficiency like 95 could not be enough to maintain the lifetime of membrane modules therefore finding optimal cip method including appropriate sequence of chemical dosing concentrations of chemical agents and cleaning duration is very important the optimal cip method depends on the feed water quality and the chemical resistance of membrane materials as studied by researchers 13 15 17 21 22 since the cip efficiency of 95 is not excellent like 99 the accumulation of residual foulants which is not removed by cip visibly increases the initial tmp values after continuous cip fulfilments this is the reason why the cip interval becomes shorter as the number of cip fulfilments increases as shown in fig 9 although the operation seems to be possibly maintained for about three years as shown in fig 9 a b and c most of operators should be tired from too many cip fulfilments during the early part of the third year and they may ask for the replacement of membrane modules at that time like the case of the cip efficiency of 99 high cip criterion such as 200 kpa does not help to assure a longer lifetime of membrane modules among the cip criteria of 200 100 and 50 kpa 100 kpa not too high and not too low seems to be the best because of less frequent cip fulfilments during the operation period according to fig 9 c the cip interval seems to be acceptable once every 30 60 days for three years of operation except the early part of the third year when water temperature is low enough to make tmp values closer to the cip criterion of 50 kpa it could be possible to obtain the acceptable cip interval during that period by increasing the cip criterion as water temperature decreases thus a variable cip criterion is introduced in the simulation shown in fig 9 d where the temperature corrected tmp of 50 kpa at 25 c is selected as the cip criterion unlike from the other three cip criteria 200 100 and 50 kpa this variable cip criterion based on the temperature corrected tmp results in the acceptable cip intervals for the first three years although continuing the operation in the fourth year is meaningless due to very short cip intervals introducing the variable cip criterion based on the temperature corrected tmp is an attractive strategy compared to selecting a fixed cip criterion the performances of lpmf operations with the variable cip criterion were investigated according to various cip efficiencies from 95 to 100 and compared to those with fixed cip criteria fig 10 a shows the effect of the cip efficiency on the total number of cip fulfilments for three years simulation with various cip criteria lower cip efficiencies need more frequent cip fulfilments because of accumulated foulants which is the reason why the total number of cip fulfilments increases at lower cip efficiencies as shown in fig 10 a when comparing the two fixed cip criteria 50 vs 100 kpa selecting 50 kpa as the cip criteria requires more numbers of cip fulfilments for three years of operation because 50 kpa is too close to tmp values during the operation however the total number of cip fulfilments remarkably decreased when the temperature corrected tmp of 50 kpa at 25 c is selected as the cip criterion instead of the fixed tmp of 50 kpa this is because the difference between the cip criterion and tmp at lower temperature periods increases when a temperature corrected tmp is chosen as the cip criterion as shown in fig 9 d compared to the fixed cip criterion of 100 kpa the temperature corrected tmp of 50 kpa at 25 c results in less cip fulfilments when cip efficiencies are relatively low 95 97 as shown in fig 10 a this is because the foulants accumulation will be less in lpmf operations with lower tmp values 42 92 kpa vs 100 kpa even if cip efficiency becomes higher 98 100 the number of cip fulfilments with the cip criterion of 100 kpa is not lower than that with the temperature corrected tmp of 50 kpa at 25 c thus there is no merit of setting 100 kpa as the cip criterion because of not only higher sec values fig 10 b but also the number of cip fulfilments no less than that with the temperature corrected tmp of 50 kpa at 25 c fig 10 b shows the effect of the cip efficiency on the average sec for three years the sec tends to decrease at higher cip efficiencies and the decreasing gradient becomes gentler at lower cip criteria under lower cip criteria lpmf systems are operated with lower tmp values compared to those under higher cip criteria because the tmp build up rate will be decreased in lpmf operations with lower tmp values eq 6 operations under higher tmp values need higher sec as shown in fig 10 b from the point of view of less sec a low cip criterion like 50 kpa could be the best choice fig 10 b however it requires more numbers of cip fulfilment than higher cip criteria fig 10 a moreover the number of cip fulfilments with a low cip criterion could sharply increase at lower cip efficiencies therefore selecting a low value e g 50 kpa of the temperature corrected tmp as variable cip criteria possibly results in less frequent cip fulfilments and the operation with relatively low sec values 4 conclusions this work includes the model development for low pressure membrane filtration systems the model verification using long term operation data from a pilot plant with real size membranes and methodology to find a better cip criterion using the verified model in terms of less cip efficiency and lower energy consumption the developed model well reproduced the long term tmp data closed to the real data from the k water lpmf pilot plant operation and exactly expected the main mechanism of fouling in the pilot plant the important findings from the long term simulation results using the lpmf model are 1 high cip criteria close to the maximum tmp is not necessary to increase the cip interval because tmp sharply increases at higher tmp values 2 it is difficult to operate lpmf systems for more than 3 years even if the cip efficiency is as good as 95 thus finding optimal cip method to increase the efficiency up to 100 is very important to assure the longer lifetime of membrane modules 3 lower cip criteria 100 kpa require less sec values with reasonable cip frequencies 4 if the cip criterion is too low the cip frequency increases because operating tmp values are closer to the cip criterion in temperature decreasing periods thus a low level temperature corrected tmp is suggested as variable cip criteria which decreases sec and the cip frequency during the lifetime of membrane modules since an optimal cip criterion should be subject to the specific condition of a lpmf system it is difficult to specify a general value or tmp increase for the optimal cip criterion the four findings mentioned above could be good guidelines for membrane system designers to set an optimal cip criterion for their systems for a future work the ability of the lpmf model to reproduce the operation data close to the real plant data can be upgraded to establish a digital twin of a water treatment plant the digital twin is regarded as the next generation of water treatment technology which enables the operation diagnosis and finding remedy for the real system 43 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

13072,in low pressure membrane filtration lpmf operations clean in place cip is carried out when transmembrane pressure tmp reaches a cip criterion which can be chosen up to the maximum allowable tmp suggested by membrane manufacturers this work suggests how to select a good cip criterion to decrease the cip frequency and specific energy consumption sec during the lifetime of membrane a constant flux lpmf model was developed based on hermia s blocking model and verified by two years operation data from a pilot plant with real size membrane modules the model exactly expects the fouling mechanism in the real lpmf operation and the tmp reproduced by the model matches real tmp from the pilot plant very well the long term simulation results using the lpmf model reveal high cip criteria near the maximum allowable tmp is not necessary to increase the cip interval the cip efficiency as good as 95 could be not sufficient to operate lpmf systems for more than 3 years and a low value e g

ultrafiltration uf both of which are specialized to remove particulate matters i e turbidity 1 2 there are two operation modes for lpmf dead end and crossflow filtration the former has only one direction of water flow i e all of feed water penetrates through membrane while the latter has two flow directions feed and permeate flow which are crossed crossflow operation mode has an advantage for membrane fouling control over dead end operation mode because feed and concentrate flow i e crossflow tangential to membrane surface can reduce concentration polarization and sweep deposited particles from the membrane surface 3 4 however lpmf for potable water production tends to apply dead end filtration due to advantages such as reduced energy consumption and capital costs compared to crossflow filtration 5 since raw water sources for water treatment plants have low solids concentration the advantage of crossflow becomes less significant and it is not necessary to pay for the capital and operational cost of crossflow operation mode 6 in dead end filtration membrane fouling is controlled by a short 1 min backwash with permeate at the end of each filtration cycle the periodic filtration and backwash processes are fully automated in real field applications 5 irreversible fouling is generally defined as the fouling which is not cleaned by the backwash both reversible and irreversible fouling induce an increase in transmembrane pressure tmp in the constant flux operation mode which is being applied to most real scale lpmf systems 7 if tmp reaches a maximum permitted value an intensive chemical cleaning for membrane modules should be carried out which is called clean in place or cleaning in place cip 8 9 the maximum permitted tmp should be the same as or less than the maximum tmp suggested by membrane manufacturers is in range of 200 300 kpa 10 11 the objective of cip is to recover the initial performance of the membrane by removing irreversible fouling materials using chemicals 12 the acidic agents such as hcl and h2so4 are used to remove inorganic foulants such as iron aluminium manganese calcium and magnesium and the alkalic agents such as naoh and naocl are used to remove organic foulants like transparent exopolymer particles tep 13 16 combinations of chemical agents should be tested to find out the best site specific recipe to maximize the cip efficiency for successful long term lpmf system operation 17 the optimal combinations and dosages of chemical agents are dependent upon the membrane materials e g polymers ceramics and stainless steel and characteristics of specific foulants e g oil organic acid 18 20 some literatures report that adding other processes like aeration can reduce the concentrations of chemical agents for cip and increase the efficiency 21 22 assuming that a good site specific recipe of chemical agents can be found to ensure a good cip efficiency this work focuses on finding an optimal cip interval for lpmf systems for drinking water production a membrane filtration guidance manual published by united states environmental protection agency reported that the typical cip frequency is approximately once every 30 to 60 days 23 however it is recommended that the frequency of cip is minimized i e the cip interval is maximized as possible during the lifetime of membrane module 3 7 years because cip results in the loss of water production the discharge of chemical wastes and adverse effects on the membrane life 8 24 there was a case where the cip interval was longer than 60 days according to the long term operation data of a pilot lpmf plant for drinking water production fig 1 the first cip was carried out after tmp exceeded 190 kpa after 9 months of operation with 1 0 m day 41 6 l m2h of the constant flux 25 there is no absolute answer for an optimal cip interval and it should be related to site specific conditions such as the magnitude of flux the chemical resistance of membrane and the convenience of the chemical waste disposal fig 1 shows that tmp increased gradually at its lower values and rose sharply at its higher values as mentioned earlier the maximum permitted tmp is a kind of milestone to determine whether to carry out cip and thus it can be called a cip criterion what if the cip criterion is much lower than the maximum operating pressure values suggested by membrane manufacturers e g 200 kpa if that is the case the cip interval becomes shorter which may induce adverse effects of cip more than the case with a longer cip interval however there exist some positive effects of a lower cip criterion 1 to avoid the operation periods with higher tmp values which results in higher energy and 2 to decrease the dosage of chemical cleaning agents for cip because of the less foulant accumulation during a shorter operation period compared to the case of a higher cip criterion moreover the operation period with higher tmp values tends to be even shorter compared to that with lower tmp values according to an example case in fig 1 the operation period with tmp values higher than 100 kpa 23 days is less than 10 of the whole operation period 280 days before the first cip positive and negative effects appear together by setting the cip criterion lower than the maximum permitted tmp in this case it is important to find out a cip criterion with which the benefit of a lower pressure operation exceeds the risk of more frequent cip fulfilments the most ideal approach to do this is to collect and review the various long term operation data of lpmf plant with real size membrane modules however only few data including the data shown in fig 1 were available to the authors 25 27 and it was impossible to suggest an optimal cip criterion or methodology to find it out by just reviewing these limited data therefore a lpmf model was developed in this work to simulate constant flux mode dead end filtration systems with periodical backwash the model was verified by the long term 2 years operation data from a pilot plant with a commercial real size membrane module and it was used to produce long term 3 5 years operation data subject to various conditions such as the cip criterion the permeate flux and the cip efficiency by comparing the number of cip fulfilments and the average specific energy consumption sec during the operation period subject to the various simulation conditions some important tips to select an optimal cip criterion will be discussed 2 methods 2 1 the lpmf model for the constant flux operation hermia 28 established a blocking model to reflect the membrane fouling in the basic form of 1 d 2 t d v 2 k dt dv n where t s v m3 and k are the filtration time cumulative permeate volume and a model parameter with varying dimensions dependent upon the value of n respectively and n is a dimensionless number to represent the four different fouling mechanisms e g complete pore blocking n 2 standard blocking n 1 5 intermediate blocking n 1 and cake formation n 0 which will be called the fouling mechanism parameter hereafter hermia s equation was revised to describe the constant flux filtration such as 7 2 d p s d v s k v p n where p s is the ratio of transmembrane pressure tmp p n m2 to the initial tmp p 0 v s is the cumulative volume of permeate per unit membrane area v s v a m3 m2 where a is the membrane area and k v is a fouling parameter subject to the foulants concentration in the feed water the unit of k v is also dependent upon the value of n like that of k the constant flux j m s is expressed as a function of tmp p the viscosity of water μ ns m2 and the resistance r m 1 which is the sum of membrane and cake resistances r m and r c as shown in 3 j p μr p μ r m r c the initial tmp p 0 is then expressed as 4 p 0 μ r m j because the cake resistance r c becomes zero at the start of filtration the cumulative volume of permeate v is expressed with the constant flux the membrane area and the filtration time like 5 v jat combining eqs 2 4 and 5 results in a differential equation of tmp such as 6 dp dt μ r m j 2 k v p n which can be used to simulate tmp values in the filtration cycles during a constant flux operation for low pressure membrane filtration lpmf systems the viscosity of water μ in eq 6 is a function of temperature and it is calculated with a regression equation 27 7 μ a exp 1 bt ct d t 2 where a 1 26 10 5 b 5 81 10 3 c 1 13 10 3 and d 5 72 10 6 are parameters for the regression and t k is the absolute temperature in a typical lpmf system operation a filtration cycle is followed by a backwash process to remove foulants accumulated during the filtration cycle the resistance at the starting point of the i 1 th filtration cycle r i 1 0 will be higher than that of the ith filtration cycle r i 0 if the removal of fouling by the backwash process is not perfect which can be expressed with the ratio of irreversible fouling rif such as 8 r i 1 0 r i 0 r i f r i 0 rif where r i f is the resistance at the end of the ith filtration cycle 29 the rif value ranged 0 to 1 decreases at higher foulant removal efficiency by backwash processes the rif value of 0 means the complete removal of foulants accumulated during one filtration cycle by a backwash process while the rif value of 1 means there is no effect of backwash during a filtration cycle tmp at a given time is calculated by solving the differential equation eq 6 with the initial tmp of the cycle temperature dependent viscosity membrane resistance and the constant flux at the end of the ith filtration cycle r i f is calculated by eq 3 using the final tmp p i f of the cycle then the initial resistance r i 1 0 and tmp p i 1 0 of the next cycle are calculated using eqs 8 and 3 respectively through this modeling procedure we can produce tmp data as a function of filtration time during the constant flux mode filtration period before a cip fulfilment if tmp reaches the cip criterion set in the model during a filtration cycle the initial resistance r 1 0 of the first cycle after a cip fulfilment is calculated using the cip efficiency e cip such as 9 r 1 0 r 1 0 r f f r 1 0 1 e cip where r 1 0 and r f f are the initial resistance of the first cycle and the final resistance of the final cycle before cip respectively the concept of eq 9 is similar that of eq 8 the cip efficiency ranges from 0 to 1 and the cip efficiency of 1 means the complete cleaning of membrane fouled during the filtration cycles before cip 2 2 verification of the lpmf model with the long term operation data from a pilot plant the lpmf model was developed through a procedure explained in section 2 1 using google colaboratory which is a web browser based coding tool for python 30 the developed model was verified using long term operation data of a mf pilot plant operated by k water korea where a real size mf membrane module table 1 was applied 25 27 31 the k water pilot plant had two independent units each of which two mf membrane modules were installed in one unit was operated with only one constant flux condition 1 0 m day and the other was operated with three constant flux conditions 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 m day we have obtained the long term two years from 2005 to 2006 operation data from the former unit unit 1 and the short term data 50 days from the latter unit unit 2 for the model verification the operation of the k water pilot plant consisted of four consecutive cycles such as 1 supply of feed water to the module 25 s 2 dead end filtration 30 min 3 backwash with permeate water 30 s and 4 drainage of backwash effluent 30 s as shown in fig 2 these four operation cycles are simplified to the filtration cycle 30 min and the break time 85 s in the lpmf model the lpmf model data were produced with the same initial operation condition membrane resistance water temperature tmp and permeate flux as the start of the k water pilot plant operation in 2005 the produced tmp data are dependent upon the fouling mechanism parameter n the fouling parameter k v and the ratio of irreversible fouling rif in eqs 6 and 8 these three variables are regarded as fitted parameters to minimize the model prediction errors the operation data from the k water pilot plant were available once every 10 min occasionally some of data were missing which means the available data do not always include the first and last points of a filtration cycle thus it was impossible to calculate the increase in tmp during a filtration cycle as an alternative an approximation of the tmp increase of a filtration cycle was calculated by subtracting the minimum tmp from the maximum tmp of 10 consecutive data including more than three filtration cycles although this approximated value does not match the tmp increase of any filtration cycle a group of the approximated values collected for several hours could be in the range which covers the values of the tmp increase of filtration cycles in the similar time zone if the tmp increase of a filtration cycle predicted by the model falls into the range of the approximated tmp increase in the similar time zone it can be considered that the lpmf model works well to predict the increase in tmp during filtration cycles this concept of verification will be well represented by fig 4 d in section 3 1 tmp values produced by the lpmf model were compared to those from the real operation data by day as discussed earlier the experimental data from the long term operation results were taken once every 10 min and it was impossible to recover a whole data of a filtration cycle this is the reason why both experimental and predicted daily average tmp values were compared for the model verification instead of comparing real time tmp data the prediction error of the model was quantified by normalized root mean squares of errors nrmse 32 34 root mean square error rmse is obtained by 10 rmse 1 n i 1 n tmp exp i tmp mod i 2 where tmp exp i tmp mod i and n are the daily average tmp of ith day from the k water plant operation data that from the lpmf model prediction and the number of total operation days respectively nrmse is obtained by dividing rmse by the average of tmp exp i 2 3 long term operation simulation subject to various cip criteria if the lpmf model is verified to reproduce tmp values close to real operation data it can be applied to simulate a long term lpmf system operation to investigate the effect of the selection of cip criterion on the performance of the system for the simulation the three fitted parameters of the lpmf model the fouling mechanism parameter n the fouling parameter k v and the ratio of irreversible fouling rif were taken from the verification works with the k water pilot plant data before the first cip and it was assumed that these constants would not change for 5 years simulation once a cip fulfilment is carried out the initial resistance of the first cycle after cip is subject to the cip efficiency e cip in eq 9 thus it is important to assume the reasonable cip efficiency values for the simulation according to the literature related to the k water pilot plant 25 31 the cip efficiency varied from 84 to 104 and most of the results were over 95 which made us to set the cip efficiency in the range of 0 95 to 1 00 the tested cip criteria were 50 to 200 kpa while four cases for the permeate flux were set to 1 0 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 m day respectively per each simulation the number of cip fulfilments for each year was counted and the specific energy consumption sec was calculated for each year of simulation using 11 sec wh m 3 j a p q p 3600 where sec stands for the energy consumption per unit water production q m 3 h is water production rate q m 3 h j m s a m 2 3600 s h 3600ja and j a p stands for power j m s a m 2 p n m 2 j a p nm s j s w needed to operate a lpmf system with the constant flux j and the tmp p rigorously speaking sec should consider the pump and motor efficiency 35 and water production rate should consider recovery rate the ratio of water production to water supply by reflecting the amount of the permeate water used for backwash however the sec in this work was simplified like eq 11 because it was used for comparing various simulation conditions mentioned earlier with the assumption of the same pump and motor efficiency and recovery rate 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of turbidity on tmp during the long term lpmf system operation fig 3 shows temperature and turbidity of feed water used in the k water pilot plant for two years 2005 2006 the objective of the pilot test is to find critical design parameters to build the first water treatment plant using a membrane system with a larger capacity than 5000 m3 day in south korea after the pilot test the gong ju water treatment plant using mf membranes with the capacity of 30 000 m3 day was designed built and operated since 2009 31 the operation started on 01 march 2005 and the first and second cip fulfilments were done on 16 december 2005 and 31 october 2006 respectively the long term operation data used for the verification of the lpmf model were taken until the second cip was done the start day 01 march 2005 is regarded as day 0 in this work fig 3 the feed water was taken from daecheong lake korea which supplies raw water to six water treatment plants nearby in the downstream the water temperature varied from 5 to 24 c according to four seasons the turbidity was mostly smaller than 10 ntu but occasionally increased for a short period due to heavy rains the maximum daily turbidity for two years was observed at around 110 ntu the report published by k water 31 mentioned that not only turbidity but also organic matters soluble iron fe and manganese mn were important foulants for their pilot plant concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc fe and mn in the feed water for two years operation ranged 1 1 2 3 mg l 0 01 0 3 mg l and 0 01 0 09 mg l respectively using the two years operation data of the unit 1 of the k water pilot plant the modeling and experimental tmp values were compared the operation data were divided into two parts before and after the first cip and each of them was used separately for the comparison fig 4 a shows the modeling and experimental tmp as a function of time before the first cip when the fouling parameter k v is assumed to be proportional to turbidity the three fitted parameters of the lpmf model for the most appropriate fitting to real operation data were k v 6 4 105 turbidity n 1 28 and rif 4 0 10 3 where turbidity means feed water turbidity with the unit of ntu the model fits real tmp data well until the 150th day but model tmp values surpasses the real tmp data after that according to fig 3 feed water turbidity after 150 days of operation maintains a high level compared to the previous operation period the model tmp sharply increases in this period because the fouling parameter is directly proportional to turbidity although there is a sharp increase in turbidity from the 70th to 75th day before the 150th day this results in a small increase in tmp from 22 to 33 kpa because the period is rather short with a low level of tmp values dp dt p n according to eq 6 the result in fig 4 a means the effect of turbidity on the tmp increase in a lpmf operation should be less than the case that the fouling parameter k v is proportional to turbidity thus the order of turbidity in the fouling parameter equation was decreased to values less than 1 fig 4 b shows the case when the order is 0 2 the three fitted parameters to minimize nrmse 26 6 were k v 2 0 104 turbidity 0 2 n 1 79 and rif 4 7 10 3 different from the result in fig 4 a the increasing pattern of tmp predicted by the lpmf model is very similar to that from the k water pilot plant operation although there is non negligible discrepancy between the modeling and experimental tmp after the 120th day as shown in fig 4 b when the fouling parameter is assumed to be independent upon the feed water turbidity i e k v is a constant the tmp increasing pattern fig 4 c is almost the same as the case in fig 4 b the model prediction error becomes smaller after the 260th day and the nrmse is 21 3 smaller than the nrmse in the case of fig 4 b where the fitted parameters were k v 2 0 104 n 1 80 and rif 5 9 10 3 fig 4 d shows the tmp increase in a filtration cycle δp as a function of average tmp of the filtration cycle and the model prediction values are nicely in the range of δp expected from the operation data these results in fig 4 c and d imply that the feed water turbidity did not affect the membrane fouling of the k water pilot plant it seems to be surprising that the feed water turbidity does not affect the fouling behavior observed in k water pilot plant but this must be reasonable because the fouling mechanism parameter n is 1 80 the model suggests the most appropriate fouling mechanism by finding the n value reproducing tmp data closest to the real values in this case the model suggests a mixture of standard blocking and complete pore blocking as the fouling mechanism of the k water pilot plant during the operation period shown in fig 4 this is because n 1 80 means the fouling mechanism of the k water pilot plant is somewhere between standard blocking n 1 5 and complete pore blocking n 2 as discussed in section 2 1 since the nominal pore size of the membrane used in k water pilot plant is 0 05 μm both standard blocking and complete pore blocking of this membrane can only be done by foulants smaller than the pore size which are not detected by a turbidity meter the k water report 31 mentioned the effects of doc fe and mn concentrations in the feed water on the membrane fouling were considerable several literatures also referred to the fouling by these materials in lpmf systems 36 41 unfortunately the time dependent concentration data for doc fe and mn were not available otherwise it would have been possible to obtain an equation for the fouling parameter k v with these concentrations as independent variables from these results it can be said that the lpmf model can suggest an appropriate fouling mechanism from the real lpmf operation data 3 2 rif dependent upon the temperature related characteristics of an operation period the lpmf model is verified to produce tmp data whose increasing pattern is very similar to that of real long term operation data however it is still insufficient to say that the lpmf model is verified to reproduce real data because there is a noticeable discrepancy between the modeling and experimental data as shown in fig 4 c the three fitted parameters were assumed to be constants over the whole operation period before the first cip it is appropriate that the fouling mechanism parameter n and the fouling parameter k v are assumed to be constants because concentrations of the main foulants doc fe and mn for the k water pilot plant should be assumed to be constants due to lack of time dependent data thus rif remains as the only parameter which may depend on some factors according to the real operation data in fig 4 c tmp was increased very slowly for about 200 days from the start thus it was impossible for the model data to fit the real tmp values during this period with the same fitted parameters to fit the tmp values sharply increased after this period we found that the 195th day was a turning point where water temperature started to decrease according to fig 3 although it is not certain that the efficiency of backwash rif decreases at higher backwash efficiencies becomes worse during the period when water temperature is being decreased we hypothesized that the backwash efficiency could be changed due to the temperature related characteristics of the operation period in this work the whole operation period was divided into several phases which exhibits only one of two opposite characteristics 1 water temperature becomes increased or 2 decreased during the phase according to the hypothesis rif was obtained separately for each divided phase to minimize the model prediction error fig 5 shows the modeling and experimental tmp data for two years of operation which are divided into five phases by the temperature related characteristics of the phase or the first cip it is assumed that the fouling mechanism parameter n and the fouling parameter k v can be changed after a cip fulfilment because the membrane surface may be changed by chemical agents used for cip both k v and n values before and after the first cip were k v 2 0 104 n 1 80 and k v 1 9 104 n 1 76 respectively since k v and n values before and after the first cip are similar to each other it is expected that the membrane surface was not changed so much by the first cip one interesting feature of the rif value for each phase is that rif tends to be smaller in the phase during which water temperature becomes increased phases i and iv compared to that in the phase during which water temperature becomes decreased phases ii iii and v this means the backwash efficiency is dependent upon this temperature related characteristics of the operation period since this finding could not be generalized with just two years operation results of a specific pilot lpmf system it is worth figuring out the reason why this phenomenon happened unfortunately it is out of range which can be covered by this work anyhow the prediction errors of the lpmf model were decreased nrmse 12 7 for phases i and ii and nrmse 13 5 for phases iii iv and v thanks to the introduction of rif subject to the temperature related characteristics of the operation period 3 3 the effect of permeate flux on tmp during the short term lpmf operation the unit 2 of the k water pilot plant was operated with three different constant flux conditions 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 m day as mentioned in section 2 2 these data make it possible to verify if the lpmf model successfully predict the effect of permeate flux on tmp variation during the operation fig 6 shows the modeling and experimental tmp for 50 days of operation of the unit 2 from 01 march 2005 the model data match the experimental tmp very well nrmse 2 43 which means the lpmf model well reflects the effect of flux on tmp variation during the constant flux mode filtration the prediction error is much smaller than errors to predict the long term operation tmp nrmse 12 7 and 13 5 in fig 5 because relatively short term data were used the three fitted parameters to minimize the prediction errors were k v 1 9 104 n 1 71 and rif 6 0 10 3 values of these fitted constants are similar to those used for the model to predict tmp of the unit 1 for the same operation period day 0 to 50 in fig 5 this means that the fouling mechanism related to n the fouling rate related to k v and the backwash efficiency related to rif tend to show similar patterns if the feed water quality and the membrane characteristics are the same i e the same membrane module and feed water were applied to both units 1 and 2 of the k water pilot plant although the flux conditions are different 3 4 reconsidering cip criterion in terms of the number of cip fulfilments and sec figs 5 and 6 show the lpmf model developed in this work reproduces tmp in the constant flux mode filtration close to the real data from the k water pilot plant operation if it is assumed that membrane is not severely damaged by cip the fouling behavior during any operation periods between two adjacent cip fulfilments will be in a similar pattern thus it can be expected that a long term simulation using the lpmf model with the same fitted parameters over the whole operation period will reproduce tmp data likely in real operation if this assumption is satisfied as mentioned in section 2 3 the three fitted parameters for all the simulation works were taken from the phases i and ii k v 2 0 104 n 1 80 rif 4 3 10 3 for temperature increasing periods and rif 1 1 10 2 for temperature decreasing periods fig 7 shows long term simulation results using the lpmf model most of simulation conditions are the same as the operation conditions of the unit 1 of the k water pilot plant for convenience and four different cip criteria p cip of 50 100 150 and 200 kpa and the common cip efficiency e cip of 99 are added to simulate the effect of cip cip is applied to the model by renewing the initial resistance of membrane using eq 9 in section 2 1 when the model tmp value exceeds p cip the simulation period was set to 5 years because the expected ages of polymeric membrane modules are in a range of 3 to 7 years the water temperature variation during the period in fig 7 a was taken from a surface water database web page of south korea 42 the cip intervals are not consistent as shown in fig 7 b c d and e because of the temperature variation the cip intervals are shorter at lower temperature periods because tmp values in these operation periods tend to be higher due to higher water viscosity values compared to those in higher temperature periods interestingly according to fig 7 a high cip criterion like 150 or 200 kpa is not necessary to decrease the number of cip fulfilments during the lifetime of the membrane modules the operation period with tmp values higher than 100 kpa is too short to see significant differences among the cip times with the criteria of 100 150 and 200 kpa as shown in fig 7 c d and e this is because the increasing rate of tmp is proportional to p n n 1 80 and tmp sharply increases at higher tmp values thus the cip criterion of 100 kpa seems to be the best selection among 50 100 150 and 200 kpa because it needs the lowest energy among the cip criteria which require the lowest number e g 13 of the cip fulfilments for 5 years however the cip criterion of 50 kpa is also competitive because it needs lower energy than 100 kpa with a requirement of just 4 more cip fulfilments anyhow it is proved that we do not need to keep lpmf operations until tmp reaches the maximum permitted value suggested by membrane manufacturers higher cip criteria may be advantageous at higher flux conditions because the initial tmp becomes higher at these flux conditions and closer to the cip criteria fig 8 a shows the effect of the permeate flux on the number of cip fulfilments for the 5th year last year of the simulation if the maximum number of cip fulfilments per year is limited to 12 as mentioned by the membrane filtration guidance manual 23 a flux same as or higher than 1 3 m day must be avoided to achieve 5 years operation without changing membrane modules because the number of cip fulfilments for the 5th year exceeds the limitation this is the reason why the case of j 1 3 m day is omitted in the sec analysis in fig 8 b different from the expectation the cip criteria higher than 100 kpa are not advantageous at all in terms of not only sec fig 8 b but also the number of cip fulfilments fig 8 a this is because the increasing rate of tmp becomes higher at higher flux conditions dp dt j 2 according to eq 6 the cip criteria of 100 and 50 kpa are competitive for the number of cip fulfilments 100 kpa and sec 50 kpa respectively especially some higher flux conditions with lower cip criteria need less sec than some lower flux conditions with higher cip criteria as shown in fig 8 b for example sec at j 1 2 m day and p cip 100 kpa is smaller than sec at j 1 0 m day and p cip 150 kpa and sec at j 1 2 m day and p cip 50 kpa is smaller than sec at j 1 0 m day and p cip 100 kpa according to these simulation results it had better select lower cip criteria to operate a lpmf system with higher flux values if the cip efficiency is good enough to be 99 however it should not be neglected that operating with high flux requires the more frequent cip fulfilments according to the simulation results discussed above selecting lower cip criteria will be better to result in less cip fulfilments and lower sec values for operation than higher cip criteria when the cip efficiency is as high as 99 what if the cip efficiency is lower fig 9 shows five years simulation results with the common value for the cip efficiency of 95 the simulation conditions except the cip efficiency and the tested cip criteria are the same as those in fig 7 regardless of the cip criteria p cip the operation does not last until the end of the simulation period the operation is set to be finished if the period between the adjacent cip fulfilments becomes shorter than 1 day this result has important meaning even an okay cip efficiency like 95 could not be enough to maintain the lifetime of membrane modules therefore finding optimal cip method including appropriate sequence of chemical dosing concentrations of chemical agents and cleaning duration is very important the optimal cip method depends on the feed water quality and the chemical resistance of membrane materials as studied by researchers 13 15 17 21 22 since the cip efficiency of 95 is not excellent like 99 the accumulation of residual foulants which is not removed by cip visibly increases the initial tmp values after continuous cip fulfilments this is the reason why the cip interval becomes shorter as the number of cip fulfilments increases as shown in fig 9 although the operation seems to be possibly maintained for about three years as shown in fig 9 a b and c most of operators should be tired from too many cip fulfilments during the early part of the third year and they may ask for the replacement of membrane modules at that time like the case of the cip efficiency of 99 high cip criterion such as 200 kpa does not help to assure a longer lifetime of membrane modules among the cip criteria of 200 100 and 50 kpa 100 kpa not too high and not too low seems to be the best because of less frequent cip fulfilments during the operation period according to fig 9 c the cip interval seems to be acceptable once every 30 60 days for three years of operation except the early part of the third year when water temperature is low enough to make tmp values closer to the cip criterion of 50 kpa it could be possible to obtain the acceptable cip interval during that period by increasing the cip criterion as water temperature decreases thus a variable cip criterion is introduced in the simulation shown in fig 9 d where the temperature corrected tmp of 50 kpa at 25 c is selected as the cip criterion unlike from the other three cip criteria 200 100 and 50 kpa this variable cip criterion based on the temperature corrected tmp results in the acceptable cip intervals for the first three years although continuing the operation in the fourth year is meaningless due to very short cip intervals introducing the variable cip criterion based on the temperature corrected tmp is an attractive strategy compared to selecting a fixed cip criterion the performances of lpmf operations with the variable cip criterion were investigated according to various cip efficiencies from 95 to 100 and compared to those with fixed cip criteria fig 10 a shows the effect of the cip efficiency on the total number of cip fulfilments for three years simulation with various cip criteria lower cip efficiencies need more frequent cip fulfilments because of accumulated foulants which is the reason why the total number of cip fulfilments increases at lower cip efficiencies as shown in fig 10 a when comparing the two fixed cip criteria 50 vs 100 kpa selecting 50 kpa as the cip criteria requires more numbers of cip fulfilments for three years of operation because 50 kpa is too close to tmp values during the operation however the total number of cip fulfilments remarkably decreased when the temperature corrected tmp of 50 kpa at 25 c is selected as the cip criterion instead of the fixed tmp of 50 kpa this is because the difference between the cip criterion and tmp at lower temperature periods increases when a temperature corrected tmp is chosen as the cip criterion as shown in fig 9 d compared to the fixed cip criterion of 100 kpa the temperature corrected tmp of 50 kpa at 25 c results in less cip fulfilments when cip efficiencies are relatively low 95 97 as shown in fig 10 a this is because the foulants accumulation will be less in lpmf operations with lower tmp values 42 92 kpa vs 100 kpa even if cip efficiency becomes higher 98 100 the number of cip fulfilments with the cip criterion of 100 kpa is not lower than that with the temperature corrected tmp of 50 kpa at 25 c thus there is no merit of setting 100 kpa as the cip criterion because of not only higher sec values fig 10 b but also the number of cip fulfilments no less than that with the temperature corrected tmp of 50 kpa at 25 c fig 10 b shows the effect of the cip efficiency on the average sec for three years the sec tends to decrease at higher cip efficiencies and the decreasing gradient becomes gentler at lower cip criteria under lower cip criteria lpmf systems are operated with lower tmp values compared to those under higher cip criteria because the tmp build up rate will be decreased in lpmf operations with lower tmp values eq 6 operations under higher tmp values need higher sec as shown in fig 10 b from the point of view of less sec a low cip criterion like 50 kpa could be the best choice fig 10 b however it requires more numbers of cip fulfilment than higher cip criteria fig 10 a moreover the number of cip fulfilments with a low cip criterion could sharply increase at lower cip efficiencies therefore selecting a low value e g 50 kpa of the temperature corrected tmp as variable cip criteria possibly results in less frequent cip fulfilments and the operation with relatively low sec values 4 conclusions this work includes the model development for low pressure membrane filtration systems the model verification using long term operation data from a pilot plant with real size membranes and methodology to find a better cip criterion using the verified model in terms of less cip efficiency and lower energy consumption the developed model well reproduced the long term tmp data closed to the real data from the k water lpmf pilot plant operation and exactly expected the main mechanism of fouling in the pilot plant the important findings from the long term simulation results using the lpmf model are 1 high cip criteria close to the maximum tmp is not necessary to increase the cip interval because tmp sharply increases at higher tmp values 2 it is difficult to operate lpmf systems for more than 3 years even if the cip efficiency is as good as 95 thus finding optimal cip method to increase the efficiency up to 100 is very important to assure the longer lifetime of membrane modules 3 lower cip criteria 100 kpa require less sec values with reasonable cip frequencies 4 if the cip criterion is too low the cip frequency increases because operating tmp values are closer to the cip criterion in temperature decreasing periods thus a low level temperature corrected tmp is suggested as variable cip criteria which decreases sec and the cip frequency during the lifetime of membrane modules since an optimal cip criterion should be subject to the specific condition of a lpmf system it is difficult to specify a general value or tmp increase for the optimal cip criterion the four findings mentioned above could be good guidelines for membrane system designers to set an optimal cip criterion for their systems for a future work the ability of the lpmf model to reproduce the operation data close to the real plant data can be upgraded to establish a digital twin of a water treatment plant the digital twin is regarded as the next generation of water treatment technology which enables the operation diagnosis and finding remedy for the real system 43 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

13073,the term circular bioeconomy based clean technologies has attracted global attention in recent years and it now plays an important role in solving issues of increasing biowaste generation resource scarcity and climate change this is in line with creating a sustainable environment regarding circular bioeconomy based technologies wastewaters and solid biowastes are treated as potential and renewable feedstocks for producing value added resources and bioenergy bioelectrochemical systems bes are promising technologies for the treatment of wastewater and conversion of wastes to bioenergy and resources by microbial fuel cells mfcs and microbial electrolysis cells mecs biowastes from various sectors including organic fraction of municipal solid waste agricultural residues animal manure food wastes and sewage sludge can be converted to biochar biofuel and other valuable products via thermochemical technologies this research explains some representative circular bioeconomy based technologies for the treatment of wastewater and biowastes while focusing on the impact of these technologies and products on environmental sustainability graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords circular bioeconomy bioelectrochemical systems thermochemical technologies sustainable environment 1 introduction economic development and the world s growing population are accelerating demand for energy but all this is doing is accelerating the exhaustion and scarcity of non renewable natural resources i e fossil fuels minerals producing enormous amounts of waste and adding to climate change this scenario in turn produces serious ecological and socioeconomic challenges 1 it has been reported that global resources consumption has increased by 17 4 from 2010 reaching 85 9 billion metric tons in 2017 2 global food waste in cities will increase to 138 million tons by 2025 3 total amounts of global municipal solid waste are predicted to be 3 4 billion tons in 2050 4 in 2020 the global average temperature was 1 2 c above the pre industrial revolution baseline due to rising global greenhouse gas ghg emissions this has led to 91 3 mm of global mean sea level above the value in 1993 2 3 for this reason it is imperative to introduce sustainable development consumption and production in order to use resources energy and infrastructure in more efficient and viable ways 5 circular bioeconomy is now a promising method of sustainable development to generate value added products such as clean water nutrient biofuel biomethane biochar from renewable biological resources i e wastewater biowastes and conserve the long term value of resources through effective conversion biotechnologies this can achieve zero waste generation curtail ghg emissions reduce dependence on fossil fuels and save environmental and economic costs 6 7 bioelectrochemical systems bes have increasingly attracted much more attention as a sustainable waste to energy technology and in parts of the circular bioeconomy wastewater can be treated to produce high quality water and employed as feedstock for bioelectricity and bioenergy generation 8 microbial fuel cells mfcs are mainly used for electricity production by oxidizing organic matter i e acetate by electrogenic bacteria on the anode biotic anode and reducing oxygen at the cathode at neutral ph they are operated without external potential due to the occurrence of spontaneous bioelectricity production by the anodic biofilm microbial electrolysis cells mecs derived from modification of mfc requiring an external power source is generally adopted for storing electrical energy as a biofuel i e h2 ch4 9 10 in addition to nutrient removal recovery bes have been widely applied in the treatment of wastewater containing different types of emerging pollutants i e dye compounds aromatic hydrocarbons petroleum hydrocarbons trichloroethene etc which simultaneously generate electricity 11 biowastes including sewage sludge agricultural residues municipal solid waste food wastes and animal manure contain heating values or energy content higher heating value hhv i e 15 20 mj kj for dry sludge 10 87 mj kg for cattle manure 19 72 mj kg for palm kernel shell 17 0 mj kg for mixture of discarded vegetables and fruits 12 15 moreover sewage sludge obtained from primary and secondary treatment stages in wastewater treatment plants wwtps is rich in nitrogen and phosphorus hence biowastes can be considered as potential source of energy and a good option to replace conventional fossil fuels to accomplish waste to energy and nutrient recovery approaches 12 thermochemical conversion including pyrolysis hydrothermal carbonization torrefaction hydrothermal liquefaction and gasification converts biowastes into high value added products solid fuel liquid fuel biochar hydrochar etc and encourages greater volume reduction of biowastes solid and liquid fuel can be used as surrogate fuel 16 19 biochar or hydrochar can be applied in soil amendment organic waste composting and removals of emerging pollutants air pollutants and heavy metal 17 20 22 in recent years some review papers focused on the developments and applications of bes for removing pollutants from wastewater 1 9 bes for resource recovery and limitations for wide applications 23 and positive effects of bes on performance of anaerobic digestion 24 bes based hybrid systems have been also reviewed in these years such as bes integrated with aerobic anaerobic treatment systems specifically anaerobic digestion aerobic tanks etc for sustainable wastewater treatment 25 methane upgrade 26 and modified bes i e osmotic microbial fuel cell osmfc mfc coupled with osmotic mbr mfc ombr etc for resource recovery 27 nevertheless the applications of bes for wastewater treatment and energy recovery are still the focus of many current studies conversely thermochemical conversion of biowastes was reviewed with respect to different approaches techno economic and bibliometric analysis 16 thermochemical conversion of sewage sludge 19 28 29 30 and engineered activated biochar from microwave pyrolysis process and its applications 18 however we lack review papers about thermochemical conversion of different types of biowastes and effects of products on environmental sustainability it is imperative to provide a review on current research progress this review article aims to update studies on development and applications of bes for wastewater treatment and resource recovery and conversion of biowastes to high value added products by thermochemical technologies using the circular bioeconomy concept 2 bioelectrochemical systems bes for wastewater treatment and resource recovery 2 1 biogas upgrading from wastewater currently bes have been used for reducing co2 mainly captured into or dissolved in wastewater and biogas upgrading this is done by converting co2 to biomethane using electrons enriched with methanogens and or employing electro active microbes as biocatalysts microbial electromethanogenesis emg could occur with a biocathode containing methanogens for methane generation in which direct emg used the cathode for direct reduction of power source and indirect emg employed h2 as electrochemical mediator compared to indirect emg direct emg was more energy efficient 31 thus a membrane less medium scale emg bes prototype was developed for simultaneous wastewater treatment in the anodic chamber and reduction of co2 to ch4 in the cathodic chamber at ph 7 10 when using acetate as medium generation of electrons took place in abiotic anode eq 1 and or biotic anode eq 2 along with acetoclastic methanogenesis eq 3 in the cathodic chamber direct emg dominated the cathode to generate ch4 eq 4 when the applied voltage was low 0 1 0 2 v after increasing voltage 0 6 v voltage 1 v indirect emg would occur for ch4 generation eq 5 she standard hydrogen electrode 1 2h 2 o o 2 4h 4e voltage 0

bacteria at the anode and hydrogenotrophic methanogens at the cathode over the acetoclastic methanogens it should be noted that the applied voltage must be optimized relatively high voltage stimulates biofilm formation and enhances microbial activity however the extremely high voltages will suppress the electrochemically active bacteria 10 32 at the applied voltage of 0 7 v and 32 c ch4 production rate and organic matter removals reached 4 4 l m2 d and around 70 with current density of 0 5 a m2 respectively moreover the high ch4 content in biogas around 87 was close to biomethane standards even when decreasing temperature to 25 c ch4 content in biogas was high at around 90 with higher electro active bacteria growth than acetoclastic methanogens despite that ch4 production declined by 33 overall the emg bes could ensure the stable biological process reduction of acid regression by acetate oxidation at the anode generation of high quality biogas 87 of ch4 content close to biomethane standards and possibility of low temperature operation 10 to reduce co2 emissions from anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge membrane contactors was used for co2 capture into wastewater which was coupled with emg bes reactors for bioconversion of the dissolved co2 to ch4 naoh solution was employed in membrane contractors to increase the alkalinity of wastewater thus accelerating chemical adsorption process during the process around 0 3 3 7 of the injected co2 in wastewater was converted to ch4 and ch4 production was as high as 4 6 l m2 d at higher applied voltage of 4 0 v 32 batlle vilanova 33 also found that the bes containing biocathode enriched with some methanogens i e methanobacterium sp had potential in transforming co2 from wastewater effluent from a water scrubbing based

oxidized by anaerobic bacteria or electrochemically active bacteria eab on the anode acting as electron acceptor which generates electrons and protons partial oxidation of nh4 n at the anode also releases the electrons the electrons are moved to the anode via extracellular electron transport mechanisms and subsequently transferred to the cathode through the external electric circuit besides dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra could also occur on the anode in mfc when c n ratio in the range of 8 0 0 5 and low external resistance of 10 or 100 ω or in mec at relatively high c n ratio of 8 0 and low applied voltage of 0 5 v 34 ammonia in gas phase obtained after stripping employing aeration in cathodic chamber of mfc or nitrogen gas generated in cathodic chamber of mec can be recovered as ammonium sulfate nh3so4 by diluted sulfuric acid liquid ammonia or ammonium biocarbonate nh4hco3 by co2 35 generally nitrogen including ammonium nh4 n nitrite no2 n nitrate no3 n removal occurs via anoxic anammox process or anoxic ammonium oxidation on the bioanode and via cathodic denitrification process on the cathode biocathode in mfc fig 1 cationic exchange membrane cem as separator in mfc inhibited direct transfer of anions and promoted the direct transfer of protons h and cations nh4 this favored the increase in ph in the cathodic chamber the aeration in the cathodic chamber also increased ph in cathodic chamber 8 0 10 due to hydroxide ions generated through oxygen reduction reaction orr consequently nutrient recovery could be realized by chemical precipitation nh4 and po4 3 precipitating with mg2 and or ca ions when directly feeding the cathodic chamber by the effluent from anodic chamber both nh4 n and po4 3 p could transfer to the cathodic chamber as a result more than 90 of nitrogen and phosphorus recovery was obtained in mfc 36 in mfc nh4 n removal on the bioanode is significantly affected by cod and nh4 n concentrations and cod nh4 ratio in the feedwater microbial population and activity on bioanode increased at higher cod concentrations i e 500 10 000 mg l corresponding to cod nh4 n ratios of 3 3 66 6 which led to more nh4 n degradation when increasing nh4 n concentration from 200 to 650 mg l at fixed cod level 10 000 mg l more nh4 n was adsorbed by microbes but the subsequent biodegradation of nh4 n declined owing to the decreased cod nh4 ratios from 50 to 15 on the other hand the higher nh4 n level increased current density and power generation through improving bacterial activity in bioanode at low cod nh4 n ratio i e 15 and transfer of nh4 n through cem to the cathodic chamber at high cod nh4 n ratio i e 66 6 at cod concentration of 10 000 mg l 50 at nh4 n concentration of 200 mg l nh4 n removal reached maximum level 91 92 via biodegradation 40 in cathodic chamber a moderate aeration rate favors ammonia recovery and energy saving when compared to extremely lower and higher aeration rates the relatively low aeration rate not only maximized ammonia recovery rate average 7 1 kgn m2 d at 100 ml min vs 1 2 7 1 kgn m2 d at 30 50 and 300 ml min but also minimized the energy consumption average 4 3 kwh gn at 100 ml min vs 4 1 6 9 kwh gn at 30 50 and 300 ml min required for removal average 4 9 kwh gn at 100 ml min vs 5 7 26 2 kwh gn at 30 50 and 300 ml min for recovery higher ammonia recovery recovery rate 7 1 gn m2 d and lower energy consumption 5 7 kwh kgn could also be obtained at lower external resistance of 1 ω due to higher current generation compared with higher external resistance recovery rate of 3 2 5 0 gn m2 d and energy consumption of 6 6 7 2 kwh kgn at 10 and 100 ω 41 in mec cathodic denitrification partial denitrification anammox processes and hydrogen gas h2 generation occur in the cathodic chamber which increases cathodic ph and further phosphorus recovery via precipitation the generation of h2 in cathodic chamber encourages ammonia removal which prompts higher nh4 n removal fig 2 in single chamber membrane free mec the applied voltage 0 2 v could enhance activity of microbes on electrodes and denitrification via electric stimulation moreover anammox process and autotrophic denitrification were also improved by the current stimulation 69 4 higher nitrogen removal rate than that in the open circuit this reduced the requirement of carbon source in the feedwater 43 compared to mfc the increased current densities induced by the electric field in mec enhanced nh4 transfer and its removal 45 cod n and applied voltage values should be taken into account when operating mec the elevated cod n no3 n no2 n nh4 n ratio accelerated growth of heterotrophic denitrifying microorganisms thereby increasing total nitrogen removal rate 695 6 gn m3d at cod n of 2 vs 514 5 gn m3 d at c n of 1 43 ph value in cathodic chamber increased from 8 to 9 1 when increasing applied voltage 0 4 0 8 v however much higher voltage 1 2 v inhibited bacterial activity extended cycle duration decreased ph and phosphorus precipitation rate overall the maximum precipitation rate was obtained 95 at moderate applied voltage of 1 1 v 42 moreover the low external voltage could reduce energy consumption due to the increased current generation compared with higher external voltage i e energy consumption for ammonia recovery 4 5 kwh kg n recovery at 0 5 v vs 6 4 kwh kg n recovery at 0 8 v 41 currently a three chamber mec was constructed to recover nitrogen i e nh4 n and remove co2 from syngas by transfer and separation of different cationic and ionic species driven by the electric field 44 the mec consisted of a middle anodic chamber between two cathodic chambers with an anionic exchange membrane aem and cem as separators aem cathode and cem cathode respectively during the operational process influent containing cod and nh4 n fed the anodic chamber meanwhile gas mixture n2 co2 70 30 v v flushed through the two cathodic chambers with separators of cem and aem in sequence the overflow of liquid phase from the cathodic chamber with cem was recirculated between two cathodic chambers every day the daily overflow helped to remove nh4 n leading to nitrogen removal rates of 96 mgn d removal of 65 at anodic potential of 0 2 v vs she and 43 mgn d removal of 30 at anodic potential of 0 1 v vs she co2 was mainly removed through sorption as hco3 in the cathodic chamber by the daily overflow removal of 63 during 0 2 v vs she or transfer of hco3 from cathodic chamber with aem to the anodic chamber removal of 49 during 0 1 v vs she reduction of co2 to methane in the cathodic chambers only contributed to 16 20 of co2 removal moreover the biogas obtained would not be contaminated by ammonia since aem reduced the nh4 n concentration in the cathodic chamber human urine contains different types of components such as urea inorganic salts i e chloride potassium sodium ammonia creatinine phosphate sulfur etc thus it can also be used for nutrient recovery by bes urea is hydrolyzed in the anodic chamber 38 45 9 nh 2 co nh 2 2h 2 o nh 3 nh 4 hco 3 then the dissolved ammonia nh3 and nh4 n are oxidized into no2 n and no3 n and or anaerobically oxidized to n2 via anammox reaction along with release of electrons additionally biodegradation of organic matters in the wastewater sodium acetate creatinine and histidine also generates nh3 and electrons 38 45 10 organic matters co 2 nh 3 intermediates h e nitrogen removal can be realized in the cathodic chamber as shown in figs 4 and 5 the high ph in the cathodic chamber could induce formation of precipitates in different forms including struvite hydroxyapatite or calcite 45 11 mg 2 nh 4 po 4 3 6h 2 o mgnh 4 po 4 6h 2 o struvite 12 5ca 2 3po 4 3 oh ca 5 po 4 3 oh hydroxyapatite 13 ca 2 co 3 2 caco 3 calcite single chamber air cathode mfc could remove up to 84 of total nitrogen from urea at high total ammonia nitrogen tan concentration 2630 mg l via direct ammonia oxidation near the cathode and anammox process on the anode in series 46 to simultaneously recover nutrient sulfur and salts from urine containing wastewater a three chamber resource recovery mfc rrmfc was set up which contained an anodic chamber a middle chamber and a cathodic chamber with a cem and an aem as separators between two consecutive chambers respectively 38 the effluent from anodic chamber directly fed cathodic chamber sulfur compounds were reduced in anodic chamber 14 so 4 2 8h 8e s 2 4h 2 o reoxidization of s2 occurred in the cathodic chamber 15 s 2 2o 2 s so 4 2 8e after nutrient removal and recovery process fig 1 the self generated electric field stimulated transfer of cation ions from anodic chamber i e h nh4 k na ca2 mg2 and anions from cathodic chamber oh so4 2 po4 3 no3 no2 cl to the middle chamber as a result nh4 n could be recovered in the middle chamber rather than employing ammonia stripping and acid adsorption processes thereby reducing energy demand and saving operational cost po4 3 p recovery also took place in the middle chamber with recovery efficiency of 37 po4 3 p as substrate for microbial growth was also removed in the anodic chamber while no precipitation was detected in the cathodic chamber due to the migration of nh4 finally this system showed excellent performance in removing 97 99 of urea cod so4 2 and po4 3 and recovering 37 60 of total nitrogen po4 3 so4 2 and total salts 2 3 removal of emerging pollutants the increasing consumption and usage of different types of emerging pollutants i e antibiotics pesticides etc leads to residues of the pollutants presenting in aqueous environment i e wastewater rivers groundwater which deteriorates ecological balance and human health therefore emerging pollutants need to be eliminated from wastewater before discharging into ecosystem in mfc with bioanode some emerging pollutants could act as electron donors in the presence of other carbon sources i e glucose acetate which donate electrons to exoelectrogenic bacteria the exoelectrogenic bacteria and some functional microbes for degradation of pollutants in anodic biofilm could oxidize emerging pollutants and generate electricity the applied voltage in mec with biocathode could enhance the electron transfer from anode to the biocathode which accelerates degradation of pollutants by functional microorganisms on the biocathode 2 3 1 antibiotics removal generally there are two pathways for antibiotics removal in bes including anodic anaerobic biodegradation aab and cathodic electrochemical reduction cer antibiotics are removed in the anodic chamber via aab in bes containing a biotic anode and an abiotic cathode microbes in the anodic chamber antibiotic degrading bacteria and other microorganisms i e anaerobic microbes involve degradation and metabolization of antibiotics through reducing antibiotics potential resistance to enable biodegradation and metabolization process degrading metabolites as well as secreting degradation enzymes external electrical current in bes could induce the direct or indirect transformation of electrons to the microbial cells which stimulates microbial metabolism and enhances antibiotics degradation and mineralization antibiotics removal in mec occurred in the cathodic chamber can be explained by the cer method one is direct electrochemical reduction by which emerging pollutants accepting electrons from the cathode can be directly eliminated and another one is the associated overpotential reduction by the microbes on the cathode as biocatalysts for biodegradation of antibiotics 9 47 49 this also significantly reduces antibiotic resistance genes args production sulfamethoxazole smx degradation in mfc mainly occurred on anode there are several different pathways for smx degradation when an anode comprises anaerobic microorganisms or electroactive biofilm eabf consisting of electrochemically active microorganisms fig 3 it was discovered that the mfc could remove more than 98 of smx initial concentration of 20 mg l in the anode within 48 h of reaction 48 50 in the dual chamber mfc with anodic eabf smx affected energy metabolism and microbial activity through three mechanisms the first was increasing the abundance of electrogenes rhodopseudomonas geobacter and aquamicrobium responsible for energy generation but eliminating some competitive species alcaligenes and nitrosomonas which utilize organic carbon or nitrogen for their growth or reproduction for the second it means stimulating generation of more eps i e redox proteins as electron shuttles or electroactive enzymes to resist the toxicity of smx and enhance reduction and oxidation reaction by altering redox system with anodic eabfs for power generation it should be noted that smx as an inhibitor limits bacterial reproduction leading to less energy required for microbial growth and release of electrons for energy output consequently the mfc with anodic eabfs enhanced energy output by up to 15 times reaching 1398 6 mw m2 and theoretically harvested 417 mw h electricity for a plant treating 100 000 m3 wastewater per day 50 norfloxacin nfx could be removed by mfc 65 5 48 4 at an initial concentration of 4 128 mg l using a high degree of acclimatization and high tolerance of anodic electrogenic microbes to high nfx concentration maximum power density reached up to 800 mv m2 moreover arg generated was also reduced 105 copies ml compared to conventional wastewater treatment plants generally 106 108 copies ml nevertheless it should pay attention to the adverse effects of higher nfc concentration 128 mg l on membrane permeability of some exoelectrogenic bacteria it not only inhibits the direct electron transfer through cell membranes from microorganisms to anode but also increases internal resistance of mfcs 51 in mec smx degradation was not as high as that in mfc via different removal pathways fig 4 at the applied voltage of 0 6 v the increased smx concentration and consistent electrical stimulation accelerated bioelectrochemical reactions this led to better smx degradation at higher initial smx concentrations removal of 77 6 at initial concentration of 10 mg l vs 92 53 at 30 mg l when some smx resistant microorganisms pseudomonas comamonas acinetobacter and arthrobacter were present on anode for smx degradation the removal of smx could inhibit the production of args abundance of inti1 1 23 102 9 27 103 copies g in mec biofilms 1 6 101 9 02 102 copies ml in mec effluents compared to conventional wastewater treatment processes 1 75 109 copies g for anaerobic digestion 109 1011 copies ml for wwtps 52 erythromycin ery could be removed by 99 within 48 h in mec this was ascribed to the dominance of geobacter exoelectrogenic bacteria in anodic biofilm relative abundance of 77 for generating electricity and highly abundant acetoanaerobium in biocathode relative abundance of 11 as exoelectrogen bacteria this employs acetate as electron donor and carbon source for degrading pollutants 53 2 3 2 removing other emerging pollutants triclosan could be effectively removed in mfc removal of 94 at initial concentration of 10 mg l via adsorption onto the anode with high surface area and porosity or biodegradation under anoxic conditions by some species i e geothrix corynebacterium sulfobacillus gouta19 geobacter acidithiobacillus and acinetobacter this contributes to the degradation of benzene related chemicals and dechlorination of chlorine containing chemicals during tcs degradation process 54 55 17β estradiol e2 was removed in mec by about 99 2 in 60 h due to the dominant species bacillus lysinibacillus and aeromonas contributing to e2 degradation the removal pathways included oxidization of e2 to hydroxylation products ring opening oxidization of the products by electrochemical reaction and microbial oxidase reaction to generate oxidative products there was also oxidation of oxidative products to macromolecules and organic carboxylic acids with low molecular weight and mineralization of organic carboxylic acids to co2 and h2o 56 mfc also removed a large amount of fipronil 94 at initial fipronil concentration of 74 mg l in the presence of acetate as co substrate in anodic chamber mainly via microbial degradation in anode metabolism of acetate for generation of electrons and electricity by electrogenic bacteria it was followed by enhanced co metabolic reaction efficiency of fipronil degradation related bacteria azospirillum azoarcus chryseobacterium via accepting electrons removals of various organic compounds were also high in the anodic chamber of mfc via similar microbial catabolic pathways i e 93 for 4 chloronitrobenzene raw material or synthetic intermediate in many industries 84 for sulfanilamide antibiotic and pharmaceutical intermediate 74 for fluoroglycofen herbicide and 65 for azoxystrobin fungicide 57 mfc showed around 70 of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds removal even at a high sds concentration of 40 mg l by anodic biofilm containing some species acinetobacter pseudomonas citrobacter treponema etc able to degrade complex and refractory organics through desulfurization dehydrogenation biotransformation and degradation however sds did endanger the formation of exoelectrogenic biofilm on the anode which compromised power performance of mfc by 66 and reduced maximum power density 12 7 w m2 2 65 fold lower compared to the control mfc without sds 58 when treating azo dye wastewater sunset yellow ssy the mixed consortia in mfc after acclimation could enhance their dye tolerance and increase decolorization ability 93 removal of sunset yellow fcf 96 6 removal of allura red 91 41 removal of tartrazine at initial concentration of 100 mg l the presence of dye decoloring and exoelectrogenic bacteria klebsiella citrobacter enterococcus faecalis lactococcus garvieae proteus mirabilis lactobacillus lactis and escherichia shigella proved to be favorable for degrading intermediates after breakage of azo bonds in azo dyes 59 when using membrane free electrolysis cell mfec with biocathode for azo dye treatment the cathode fed with glucose as co substrate generated electrons via microbial respiration the charge transfer resistance significantly reduced due to no membrane being present thus electrons were directly used for azo bond cleavage breaking of the chromophoric groups to decolorize the congo red dye around 90 within 24 h at voltages of 0 3 0 9 v mfec also enabled ch4 production by firstly directly utilizing electrons provided by the cathode and secondly hydrogenophilic methanogenesis employing h2 generated from the cathode 60 as sulfate reducing bacteria srb can function as a biocatalyst involving microbial extracellular electron transfer between microbes and electrodes the enrichment of srb on electrodes bioanode in mfc biocathode in mec prompts the removal of some pollutants i e chlorophenols nitrobenzene azo dye as electron acceptor in the presence of sulfate additionally the presence of sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob on electrode bioanode in mfc biocathode in mec for oxidation of sulfide releases electrons which can be used to degrade pollutants fig 5 at initial 4 cp concentration of 100 mg l mfc removed up to 40 of 4 chlorophenol 4 cp with maximum power generation of 253 5 mw m2 current density 712 0 ma m2 after inoculating the anode with anaerobic sludge containing sodium lactate and sodium sulfate enriched with srb 61 initially acetate and propionate electron donors obtained by fermentation of lactase were oxidized to co2 in anodic biofilm where electrons transferred to the anode using srb then sulfate electron acceptor was reduced to sulfide electron donor at the top of anodic biofilm eq 16 which maintained srb growth sulfide was oxidized to sulfur via abiotic oxidation on the anode to generate electrons eq 17 16 so 4 2 8e h 2 s hs 17 h 2 s hs s 0 so 4 2 2e after that reduction of 4 cp electron acceptor to phenol occurred by accepting electrons from anode followed by reduction to acetate and again oxidation of acetate to co2 in the anodic chamber in mec the increased external voltage applied heightened 4 cp removal compared to the mfc at an applied cell voltage of 0 4 v versus ag agcl around 43 of 4 cp was removed in the anodic chamber h2o2 was also produced in mec 13 3 g l m2 after 6 h operation via two electron orr at the cathode at ph 7 18 3co 2 10 h 10 e ch 2 chohcoo 3h 2 o e 0 0 34 v vs normal hydrogen electrode nhe 19 10 h 5o 2 10 e 5h 2 o 2 e 0 0 26 v vs nhe this was made possible by higher cathode potential around 260 mv vs nhe than anode potential around 340 mv vs nhe nevertheless h2o2 may reduce to water when applying higher added voltage competing with the two electron orr 61 20 h 2 o 2 2h 2e 2h 2 o 21 h 2 o 2 h 2 o 1 2o 2 when treating wastewater containing nitrobenzene nb 50 mg l and sulfate 200 mg l by mec with autotrophic srb biocathode nb removal efficiency reached 98 initially nb was reduced to nitrosobenzene nob using electricity nob was reduced to aniline an using electrons from the cathode with wolinella sp present which released nitrite reductase and this involved the reduction of nitrite to ammonia srb desulfovibrio sp participated in the reduction of sulfate to sulfide during the process electrons were provided by oxidation from sulfide to sulfur by sob thioclava sp and halothiobacillus sp 62 during treatment of sulfide containing azo dye wastewater the removal of congo red dye initial concentration of 200 mg l could reach more than 88 by mfc with maximum power density of 24 w m2 this was accomplished in three ways firstly electrons were released through conversion of sulfide hs s2 to sulfur s0 sulfate so4 2 and s2o3 2 by sob which led to high sulfate concentration and deposition of element sulfur on the electrode surface secondly electrons and protons were generated by acetate co substrate due to the presence of electrochemically active bacteria eab and thirdly azo bonds were cleaved in azo dye by accepting electrons to generate colorless products i e aromatic amines extracellular electron transport from microorganisms to electron acceptors i e azo dyes anode could be enhanced by cell lysis through biogenic sulfide reduction by srb genus desulfovibrio which improved degradation of azo dyes 63 mec with eab can also be a promising option for the treatment of dye wastewater treatment through interaction between eab and azo dye decolorization eab growth was selectively enhanced by azo dye and extracellular decolorization of alizarin yellow r ayr realized by extracellular electron transfer with eab under electricity stimulation this increased the removal rate and limited toxicity of azo dye on eab 64 65 hou et al 65 found that high decolorization efficiency around 90 was obtained in a single chamber mec constructed with mos2 go nickel foam nf cathode at initial ayr concentration of 100 mg l with co substrate of naac and glucose meanwhile the electrons released by eab in anode which were transferred to the cathode stimulated h2 generation dual chamber mfc with electroactive biofilm carbon felt anodes could effectively remove 2 chlorophenol mfc 2 cp initial concentration of 10 mg l and 2 4 dichlorophenol mfc 2 4 dcp initial concentration of 10 mg l 66 the anodic biofilm contained high biomass protein level and many functional species consisting of exoelectrogens i e geobacter pseudomonas degrading bacteria i e comamonas metagenome shinella dechlorosoma and multifunctional electrogenic degradative bacteria i e acinetobacter azospirillum the first way of the removal was biodegradation 95 97 for 2 cp 84 5 88 7 for 2 4 cp via dichlorination hydroxylation and hydrogenation of 2 cp and 2 4 dcp into cyclohexanol with low toxicity which encouraged electricity generation by multifunctional microbial community in anodic biofilm 22 2 4 dcp or 2 cp h e cl cyclohexanol the second was mineralization 74 7 80 5 for 2 cp 58 8 78 4 for 2 4 cp via the production of long chain hydrocarbons by ring opening reactions followed by mineralizing hydrocarbons into co2 and h2o 23 cyclohexanol long chain hydrocarbon co 2 h 2 o e moreover this process realized maximum power densities of 474 5 and 472 3 w m2 for 2 cp and 2 4 cp respectively 66 as groundwater with low ion strength limited the removal of nitrate and perchlorate in bes cathodic potential regulation was adopted using an electrochemical workstation with a three electrode system to limit the overpotential and enhance electron transfer in bes to enhance removals of nitrate and perchlorate the application of negative potential shortened suppression duration for perchlorate induced by nitrate i e 55 6 of total reaction time at cathode potential of 800 mv vs she vs 64 3 of total reaction time without potential regulation and ameliorated the inhibition effect of nitrate on perchlorate removal at cathodic potential of 200 mv vs she the reduction rates of nitrate and perchlorate increased by 53 74 and 38 04 respectively compared to mfc without potential control removals of nitrate and perchlorate were attributed to both the cathode as electron donor and autotrophic bacteria i e phyla proteobacteria chloroflex ignavibacteriae classes betaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria accepting electrons for denitrifying and reducing the pollutants 67 2 4 heavy metal removal heavy metal in wastewater poses threats to the ecosystem and has adverse impacts i e cancer disease liver and kidney damage etc on different organisms hence it needs to remove heavy metal from wastewater to obtain clean water this can be achieved by bes in three mechanisms the first is direct redox reaction dro which is achieved by reducing metals to elemental deposits or lower oxidation states through accepting electrons from cathode and or cathodic biofilm table 1 the second is indirect byproduct precipitation ibp through precipitating metals with byproducts of cathodic reduction reaction i e oh h2o2 involved here is a single chamber mfc with air cathode eqs 24 27 and cathodic hydrogen generation in mec eqs 28 and 29 24 o 2 2h 2 o 4e 4oh 25 me a ah 2 o me oh a ah 26 me 4 4h 2 o me oh 4 4h 27 me b boh me oh b 28 2h 2 o 2e 2oh h 2 29 me c coh me oh c the third is biological removal through intracellular extracellular microbial respiration biological reduction bioaccumulation and biosorption by anodic or cathodic biofilm it should be noted that precipitates in ibp may deposit on electrodes ion exchange membrane or other areas of the cathode chamber removing metals through dro and ibp requires further recovery approaches in other words manual scarping or acid dissolution after metal removal via dro settling by gravity and collecting following metal removal via ibp excellent removal efficiencies above 95 were reported in more than 60 of studies meanwhile other studies confirmed the removals of greater than 50 when metal concentrations ranging from 0 01 0 1 g l as reported by above 50 in some research 38 69 71 removal of cr vi in membrane less dual chamber bes was realized through initial bioelectrochemical cr vi reduction by exoelectrogens on the cathode eq 30 and subsequent cr iii precipitation with phosphorus which generate cr phosphorus precipitates and or complexes on the cathode at neutral ph 30 cr 2 o 7 2 14 h 6e cr 2 o 3 4h 2 o 6h 2cr 3 7h 2 o e 0 1 33 v these were further removed from bulk sludge in bes apart from this mec performed better in removing cr vi and first order cr vi reduction rate constant 66 2 and 0 103 d respectively due to the external power supply compared to mfc 56 7 and less than 0 072 d respectively 72 moreover cu ii was used as electron shuttle mediators to enhance the removal of cr vi the overpotential of cathode waned and the active energy barrier declined owing to the presence of cu ii in mfc resulting in higher charge transport thus cu ii improved the electron transfer from anode to cathode which accelerated the indirect utilization of electrons generated by the anode for cr vi reduction in the cathodic chamber as shown in eqs 30 33 and cr vi reduction rate 31 cu 2 2e cu e 0 0 337 v or 32 2cu 2 h 2 o 2e cu 2 o 2h e 0 0 207 v 33 2cu 2 o 2h 2e 2cu 2h 2 o e 0 0 059 v as a result cr oh 3 and a little cu were deposited on the cathode at high levels of cu ii 50 mg l power density of 1235 53 mw m2 and cr vi reduction rate of 1 191 g m3 h were significantly higher 1 4 times and 1 17 times respectively than that without cu ii 73 electrochemical reduction in dual chamber bes could successfully recover sliver above 80 during 48 h of operation from the sliver i dithiosulfate ag s2o3 2 3 complex which was frequently detected in waster fixer solution from photographic processing waste during the operational stage catholyte ph increased over time caused by 1 cathodic reduction which decreased concentration of ag s2o3 2 3 but increased s2o3 2 and 2 limited transportation of h from anodic chamber to the cathodic chamber by other competitive cations i e na k this led to dominance of spontaneously electrochemical reaction converting ag s2o3 2 3 electron acceptor to metallic ag0 on the cathode surface 74 anodic chamber 34 ch 3 coo 4h 2 o 2hco 3 9h 8e e 0 0 289 v vs

in two chamber mfc excess caustic in the catholyte and acidification in the anolyte a loop of catholyte effluent feeding to bioanode in mfc with air cathode was developed by song et al 75 this system could in situ use caustic in the cathodes and neutralized acid generated in the anodes to recover metals when feeding synthetic wastewater simulating printed circuit boards prcbs processing wastewater at low organic loading of 200 mg l the cathodic chamber eliminated around 91 of su fe and cu along with 68 of total cod removal in the meantime approximately 8 of these metals were removed by the bioanodic chamber subsequently more metals were deposited on the cathode sn iv fe iii cu 0 and cu ii than those on the anode this reduced the adverse effects of the loop feeding design on the exoelectrogens on the anode besides microorganisms in anodic biofilm were well acclimatized to the catholyte effluent containing metals as demonstrated by the increased abundance of rhodopseudomonas and geobacter and the emergence of pseudomonas comamonas aeromonas and azospira in the microbial community on the anodes electrodes enriched with srb or eab also act as biocatalyst and can enhance metal removal in bes mec with sulfate reducer enriched biocathode was developed using two efficient srb strains enterococcus avium by7 and citrobacter freundii sr10 which simultaneously reduced sulfate and antimony sb via sulfide metal precipitation and catalyzed hydrogen generation although the metabolic activity of srb strains abated under sudden adverse conditions sb addition a specified adaptation period helped to stabilize their activity this improved sulfate reduction and conversion of sb v to sb iii as precipitation of sb2s3 conversion efficiency up to 70 1 with by7 and up to 89 2 with sr10 the maximum total removal efficiencies of sb were 88 2 with by7 and 96 3 with sr10 at sulfate reduction rates of 92 3 and 98 4 g m3 d respectively however hydrogen production rate declined after adding sb average 1 25 1 36 m3h2 m3 d vs 0 89 0 98 m3h2 m3 d this was ascribed to the adaptation to adverse conditions and bioprecipitation of sb reducing the electron transfer rate 76 in single chamber mecs with four eab citrobacter sp jy3 pseudomonas sp x3 pseudomonas delhiensis x5 ochrobactrum anthropic x7 which can use hco3 as carbon source in bes various amounts of eps with different compositions were released by these eab to strategically adapt to stressful conditions induced by the changes in initial cd ii and circuit current compared to the bioanode the biocathode was more favorable for cd ii recovery due to the creation of anaerobic conditions which enhanced eab activities and limited the consumption of electrons by o2 the high initial acetate level 5 0 g l changed the cathodic potential so that it was more negative which moderated the cd ii inhibition and enabled the removal of cd ii at a wider range of initial cd ii concentration consequently various cd ii removals 2 57 7 35 mg l h and h2 production 0 0 0011 m3 m3 h were obtained at initial cd ii concentration of 20 150 mg l and initial acetate concentration of 1 0 5 0 g l due to the robustness of eab 77 3 thermochemical conversion of biowastes and applications of the products biowastes are the wastes from animal plants and human beings for instance municipal solid waste forestry and agricultural wastes animal manures food wastes sewage sludge etc they contain certain amounts of energy i e 10 73 mj kg for mustard stalk 15 77 mj kg for olive refuse 16 2 mj kg for peach bagasse 17 97 mj kg for tobacco leaf 22 00 mj kg for olive pits etc consequently they are ideal for generating biofuels bio energy through thermochemical conversion in order to reduce dependence on conventional fossil fuel and greenhouse gas ghg emissions fig 6 summarizes thermochemcial technologies for biowastes conversion and application of value added products biowastes can be converted to various types of valuable products through pyrolysis i biochar 20 50 as the main product bio oil 20 40 syngas 10 25 and some liquids acetone methanol acetic acid via slow pyrolysis 400 900 c residence time of minutes to days ii bio oil as major products 60 75 via fast pyrolysis 450 850 c residence time of 5 30 s and iii bio oil 25 75 and syngas 50 60 as dominant products via flash pyrolysis 1000 c residence time 1 2 s 16 18 biochar obtained by pyrolysis can be applied to wastewater treatment for removing heavy metals via surface complexation ion exchange cation π electron precipitation etc or used as adsorbent to remove organic micropollutants like 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 3 4 trichlorophenol bisphenol a carbamazepine androsterone estrone 17a ethinylestradiol via pore filling hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic attraction 18 22 bio oil can be catalytically upgraded into petroleum like biodiesel surrogate fuel or used as fuel to generate electricity in anion exchange membrane fuel cells besides the syngas especially co and h2 as dominant components can be upgraded into diesel like fuel or burned as fuel gas 18 it was found that slow pyrolysis temperature and types of biowastes affected biochar properties and their effects on soil amendment for example five different feedstocks pine saw dust sd rice husk rh food waste fw poultry litter pl and paper sludge ps were used for biochar preparation at four different pyrolysis temperatures 350 450 550 and 650 c 78 some important findings were specified as follows 1 when pyrolysis temperature increased the ph of biochar also rose i e increase in ph of both pl and ps from 6 2 to 10 3 in biochar thus ps and pl biochars obtained at 550 and 650 c could be used for acid neutralization in soil due to their ph buffer capacity 2 the cation exchange value declined at higher pyrolysis temperature owing to loss of the organic functional group on biochar surface aromatic c oxidation and formation of carboxyl groups hence sd pl and ps biochars at lower temperature 350 c were better for retention of soil nutrient 3 the number of pores and pore size also increased at higher temperature especially for sd and rs biochars moreover bet surface area of all biochars increased especially sd and rh biochars which possessed higher surface area 431 91 443 79 m2 g and 248 99 280 97 m2 g thus sd and rh biochar prepared at 550 and 650 c favored water retention in the soil and the adsorption of pollutants 4 the highest fixed carbon values were detected in sd biochar average 55 31 rh biochar average 48 47 and fw biochar average 58 85 the higher pyrolysis temperature increased the degree of aromaticity decline in atomic ratio of hydrogen oxygen h c but reduced polarity decline in atomic ratio of oxygen carbon o c hence rh and sd biochars obtained at higher pyrolysis temperatures of 550 and 650 c low o c ratios 0 1 0 26 were the most stable half life 1000 years among all biochars and could be applied for carbon sequestration into soil gasification process at temperatures of 700 900 c transforms biowastes to liquid and gaseous fuels as the dominant products used for transportation and syngas employed in gas turbine torrefaction at low temperatures of 200 300 c under oxygen free condition mild pyrolysis generates high grade solid fuel from biowastes for power plant or boiler application hydrothermal liquefaction temperatures of 280 370 c pressures of 10 25 mpa as high pressure hydrolysis converts biowastes to high quality bio oil 16 18 3 1 sewage sludge sewage sludge can be converted into bio oil biochar and gas h2 co and other light gases via pyrolysis which is a favored sludge management approach slow pyrolysis is divided into carbonization and torrefaction carbonization mainly generates biochar while torrefaction increases heating value and c h ratio of biochar and eliminates nox sox and other pollutants the porosity and surface morphology of biochar were increased by slow pyrolysis ph of biochar was higher than the raw sludge through the release of alkali salts dehydration of sludge feedstock and damage of organic acids and carbonates 79 fast pyrolysis can transform sewage sludge to bio oil consisting of hydrocarbons aromatic and aliphatic ones organic acids and carbonyl compounds with high molecular weight aromatic and aliphatic compounds nitrogenous compounds sulfur compounds and other compounds i e phenols ketones etc the high initial water content in sewage sludge high humidity 95 of water and decomposition of volatile matter during fast pyrolysis reduce heating value and induce the presence of oxygenated compounds in the bio oil thus compared to petroleum derived heavy fuel oil average 40 mj kg the bio oil obtained via fast pyrolysis of sewage sludge possesses higher moisture content and lower hhv average 30 mj kg 28 there are two alternative options to enhance both the quality and quantity of products during pyrolysis one is co pyrolysis and another is catalytic pyrolysis co pyrolysis of sewage sludge with other biowastes i e saw dust rice straw etc not only can enhance deoxygenation and increase heating value of bio oil and improve quality of bio oil but also increase heating value and specific surface area of biochar catalytic pyrolysis with additives or catalysts i e al2o3 cao fe2o3 tio2 zno can upgrade bio oil with stable storage value by increasing carbon and hydrogen yield reducing oxygen and water content increasing hhv of bio oil decreasing viscosity and minimizing pollutants 28 hydrothermal carbonization htc and hydrothermal liquefaction htl have also been employed to prepare valuable products i e hydrochar bio oil from sewage sludge htc process improves energy content of hydrochar by transforming low energy density chemical bonds i e c o and c h into high energy chemical bonds aryl as the amount of aromatic carbon increases after htc treatment the aromaticity of carbon in hydrochar increases 30 htc increased the porosity and surface area of hydrochar produced compared to the sludge feedstock while decreasing h c and o c ratios that enhanced aromaticity and carbonization however ph of hydrochar decreased compared to sludge feedstock as acidic functional groups generated via hydrolysis reaction the heavy metals enriched in hydrochar that are in bioavailable fraction could be converted into stable fraction thus these metals presented minimal or no environmental risk for field application 79 since the aromatic carbon content increases in the hydrochar after the htc process hydrochar possesses high soil carbon sequestration potential moreover the hydrochar can also be used as land fertilizer due to the residual n ammonia obtained by deamination and p extractable phosphate 30 although recent works tried to improve hydrochar yield by adding some chemical catalysts during htc process the hydrochar could not be used as cleaner fuel with better heating value hv this was ascribed to that hydrochar obtained after adding nacl or employing ammonia treated fenton sewage sludge as feedstock demonstrated declined carbon composition hv and h c ratio 80 htl treatment can generate bio oil having hhv of 30 40 mj kg from sewage sludge higher temperature improves the quality of bio oil and yield of gas solvents i e methanol ethanol during htl process stimulate the generation of esters and improve the yield and quality of bio oil sludge pretreatment i e subcritical water fatty alcohol polyoxyethyleneether ultrasonic etc can improve hydrocarbons hhv energy recovery aromaticity and or polarity of bio oil obtained after htl through regulating products from htl by catalysts i e cuso4 nimo al2o3 cu no3 2 bio oil i e esters amides and gas generation can be enhanced while limiting coke formation 30 it needs to pay more attention to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah as pah in sewage sludge is the toxic and recalcitrant organic pollutants the increased reaction temperature 220 360 c and diminished solid liquid ratio sewage sludge pure water ratio 0 05 0 20 reduced the total content of pahs in biochar the total content of pahs was the lowest at relatively lower reaction temperature of 300 c solid liquid ratio of 0 1 g ml and shorter reaction time of 30 min in the range of 0 60 min when reaction temperature or time increased more pahs transferred into bio oil 89 of pah in bio oil any further treatment or utilization of bio oil was inhibited by high toxic equivalent quantity teq values 6 1 8 6 mg kg and total content of pahs in bio oil 55 0 106 6 mg kg thus the htl process needs to be improved to reduce the formation of pahs 81 3 2 agricultural wastes food waste and municipal solid waste msw the biochars generated from different feedstocks are used for wastewater treatment i e cod and polyphenol from cork wastewater fluoxetine flx common dyes i e methylene blue methyl violet and rhodamine b herbicide from agricultural surface water nutrient from human urine as well as air pollutants removal i e naphthalene c10h8 benzene table 2 agricultural wastes can be transformed to syngas via gasification and biochar via carbonization or pyrolysis syngas is mainly used to generate heat and power in the combined heat and power chp plants or via co firing of the gas produced from large scale power plants or generation of electricity by energy conversion device gas reciprocating engines gas turbines after thermochemical conversion at temperature of 300 c for 2 h polar groups i e alcohol esters ketones aldehydes carboxylic ether and phenols appeared in both orange citrus sinensis peels op and albedo oa derived biochar compared to op biochar oa biochar possessed more carbon inorganic elements slightly higher surface area 352 5 m2 g for op biochar and

derived biochar had a smooth surface therefore op derived biochar could be used for adsorbing pollutants from water and soil oa derived biochar was adopted for enhancing soil nutritional value fertilizer production and ghg emissions and carbon sequestration in soils 98 compared to biochar properties at lower pyrolysis temperatures 200 and 300 c the biochar obtained after pyrolysis of leaf waste at 400 c had higher volatile matter and fixed carbon lower h c ratio and higher ph of biochar 10 23 due to the formation of alkaline species higher bet surface area pore volume and micropore volume 99 biochar can be used for the removal of h2s 84 2 from gas generated during anaerobic digestion process by firstly formation of a water film on biochar surface owing to its lower hydrophilicity resulting from lower h c ratio secondly adsorption of h2s on biochar surface forming dissolution with water film eq 37 and thirdly dissociating the adsorbed h2s molecule in water film

metal immobilization ability when treating sediment with 10 tb cd was reduced by 67 7 in the exchangeable fraction during the meso microcosm study it was discovered that the uptake of cd in mollusk tissue and root and shoot of water hyacinth declined by 75 87 this might be attributed to excellent properties of tb favorable for cd sorption including large amounts of micro meso meso and macro pores as well as high surface area on tb surface aromatic structure on tb surface and more oxygen functional groups on tb which offered surface ligand binding site additionally negative surface charge of tb electron rich surface prompted adsorption of cd ions at low ph 8 5 through π π electron donor acceptor interactions moreover ion exchange between cd ions and cations on tb surfaces ca2 mg2 also contributed to cd removal 100 engineered tea waste biochar high surface area 576 m2 g prepared by pyrolysis at 700 c using steam activation twbc sa reached maximum caffeine adsorption capacity of 15 4 mg g at ph 3 5 caffeine could be adsorbed onto twbc sa via i chemisorption as the dominant removal mechanism involving nucleophilic reaction between nitrogen atoms of the five membered ring of caffeine molecule and the carbonyl groups on the biochar surface under acidic condition ii formation of covalent bonds and electrostatic attraction and iii physisorption on the biochar surface via π π and hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups of biochar surface and heterocyclic group of caffeine molecule 101 the biochar bentonite composite was obtained by mixing bentonite suspension with msw 1 5 ratio w w and subsequent pyrolysis the maximum adsorption capacity of the composite was higher 190 mg g 40 higher than that of the pristine biochar it was ascribed to the generation of more active sites diffusion of ciprofloxacin cpx molecules into the interlayer space of the clay mineral via hydrogen bonding between oxygen containing functional group of cpx and free hydroxyl groups on the composite also responsible was enhanced electrostatic interactions between the functional groups of the composite and cpx molecules after modification 102 it was found that relatively higher pyrolysis temperature favored the generation of biochar with better characteristics from msw containing wood based products i e molded wood pallets sawmill cut ends plywood particle boards etc compared to pyrolysis temperature of 400 c 74 3 85 3 0 10 0 14 cm3 g and 215 0 359 84 m2 g biochar produced after pyrolysis at higher temperature of 600 c possessed more fixed carbon 81 4 94 0 higher micropore volume 0 15 0 21 cm3 g and surface area 298 4 509 3 m2 g without soluble pah although some biochars contained high levels of trace metals i e mercury hg from painted wood derived biochar arsenic as from treated wood derived biochar most trace metals could be effectively eliminated by acid washing especially acetic acid favorable for dissolving minerals it also required more attention being paid to the management of some potential pollutants chlorine nitrogen and sulfur in the biochar 103 3 3 animal manure thermochemical liquefaction of pig or cattle manure generally uses ethanol as a solvent since ethanol provides active hydrogen to decompose biomass improve the stability of liquefaction intermediates and limit the formation of hardly decomposed compounds operational conditions and types of manure feedstocks affected the generation of bio oil during thermochemical liquefaction of pig manure the relatively lower liquefaction temperature of 220 c prompted maximum yield of bio oil 31 4 of liquefied products than those at higher liquefaction temperatures of 260 and 300 c this was due to the crude protein and lipid in pig manure raw material however during liquefaction of cattle manure fragmentation of polymers into liquid oil rich phase was enhanced at higher temperature 300 c with maximum bio oil ocm relative yield of around 32 and absolute yield of 23 kg kg compared to that at lower temperature 180 220 and 260 c furthermore the yield of bio oil was affected by solid liquid rate determined by the quantity of the manure sample and the volume of the liquid solvent and solvent filling rate the rate of the volume of the liquid solvent divided by the fixed volume of the reactor when using pig manure as feedstock the yield of bio oil declined at higher solid liquid rate proportions in liquefied products 35 56 at 5 vs 22 04 at 15 due to the weak interaction between solvent molecules and biomass molecules on the other hand the production rate of bio oil rapidly increased at higher solvent filling rate 10 15 the obtained bio oil had similar components from pig and cattle manures including esters long chain hydrocarbons ethanol and nitrogen compounds the heating values of bio oil derived from animal manure after thermochemical liquefaction were significantly higher than the manure feedstocks the heating value of pig manure liquefied bio oil 37 03 mj kg was close to the heating value of gasoline 46 mj kg meanwhile the higher and lower heating values of cattle manure liquefied bio oil 25 63 33 41 mj kg and 23 85 31 39 mj kg respectively vs 10 87 mj kg and 9 74 mj kg for cattle manure feedstock respectively strongly suggested their potential as alternative commercial fuels to fossil fuel energy 104 105 zhou et al 106 pointed out that compared to slow pyrolysis 400 600 c htc was a more effective way to convert animal manure to hydrochar since the htc process narrowed the weight loss temperature range for the animal manure when employing the htc process the hydrochar properties were affected by the types and nature of feedstocks the hhvs of different livestock and poultry manure increased after htc i e 15 18 mj kg of swine manure sm vs 16 14 mj kg of sm hydrochar 15 26 mj kg of dairy cattle manure dcm vs 18 43 mj kg of dcm hydrochar 13 72 mj kg of beef cattle manure bm vs 15 77 mj kg of bm hydrochar 12 77 mj kg of broiler litter bl vs 16 22 m kg of bl hydrochar and 14 27 mj kg of layer chicken litter ll to 18 05 mj kg of hydrochar at 210 c energy yields were the highest for biochars of sm bl and ll 65 5 56 9 and 64 4 respectively animal manure derived biochar can be employed for generating syngas the biocrude obtained from pyrolysis of dcm under co2 condition contained high levels of hetero hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds which were not suitable for liquid fuels in combustion engines hence dcm derived biochar was employed to transform biocrude to syngas during dcm pyrolysis with co2 serving as a gaseous medium at 600 c co formation was enhanced by gas phase homogeneous reactions between co2 and gas phase volatile compounds originating from dcm pyrolysis the gas phase reactions and chemical bond damage of biocrude induced by alkaline metal oxide s i e caco3 in biochar as catalyst 3 g l significantly enhanced h2 and co formation 5 fold compared to non catalyst pyrolysis 107 3 4 other applications of biochars during organic waste i e pig manure sawdust beer vinasse etc composting process biochar addition can increase pile porosity and improve oxygen permeability o2 supply which avoid anaerobic fermentation it can also improve organic matter degradation extend duration of thermophilic phase and increase composting temperature which enhance compositing efficiency and humidification process biochar addition encourages n mineralization and n retention which minimize the formation of large clumps it is possible to mitigate n2o emissions as the large amounts of aromatic compounds co bond ch bond in biochar contact with no3 n which encourage the formation of π π electron donor or acceptor interactions and further inhibit denitrification adding biochar can reduce ch4 emissions due to the formation of aerobic reaction survival and proliferation of methanotrophs caused by high pore volume and good pore structure of biochar biochar also can reduce odor emissions since nh4 n and nh3 are adsorbed by pores and surface acid groups of biochar and furthermore enhance enzymatic activities and degradation rate heavy metals are stabilized by surface and inner sphere precipitation and complexation as well as physical adsorption furthermore freely dissolved pahs are reduced 20 biochar can be also used for adsorption of air pollutants volatile organic compounds vocs via physical adsorption to carbonized fraction van der waals interactions π π electron donor acceptor interactions and pore filling processes and partitioning process involving partitioning into organic phase or to noncarbonized organic matter faction 89 108 109 biochar can also be used for ghg emissions co2 no2 ch4 and other gases i e so2 h2 h2s etc when adopting constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment biochar might improve nitrous oxide reductase activity adsorb nh4 n and no3 n to reduce n2o emissions from nitrification or denitrification and inhibit the activity of microorganisms responsible for nitrification and mineralization thereby reducing n2o emissions the reduction of co2 emissions after adding biochar might be induced by precipitating co2 with alkaline metals provided by biochar as carbonate adsorbing organic matter reducing some abundant carbohydrate mineralizing enzymes i e glucosidase celloboisidase and increasing plant growth for greater net exchange of co2 between environment and cws 21 biochar exerts positive effects on arid soils by 1 enhancing water retention capacity since biochar can retain water 2 improving nutrient holding potential given that biochar can keep n nutrients fertilizers 3 removing cations heavy metals from soil through carbon sorption 4 eliminating organics i e hydrocarbons pharmaceuticals through adsorption due to its high porosity large surface area and surface functional groups 5 increasing crop yields through improving irrigation conditions and soil quality increased n p k contents and solid organic carbon because biochar possesses some nutrients n p k ca and 6 stabilizing heavy metals this favors the increase in crop yield it is worth noting that soil microorganisms are positively affected by biochar addition through increasing water availability improving aeration condition removing toxic compounds by sorption neutralizing soil ph value retaining nutrient in soil and offering shelters nutrients and electron donors 17 20 as biochar possesses porous structure and large surface area it can provide electroactive sites to accumulate charges faradaic reaction which in turn realizes high capacitance i e capacitance of 344 f g and power density of 850 w kg for argy warm wood derived biochar 346 1 f g and 160 w kg for cotonier strobili fibers derived biochar 168 f g and 1500 w kg for fructose corn syrup derived biochar for these reasons biochar can be used as electrode materials in supercapacitors which are energy storage materials and employed in electronic devices automobiles air craft or locomotive systems 18 3 5 nutrient recovery sewage sludge is enriched with phosphorus total phosphorus 13 122 09 g kg in three different forms including inorganic phosphorus poly phosphate and organic phosphorus after thermochemical treatment phosphorus also exists in ash aluminum calcium phosphate ca9al po4 7 aluminum phosphate alpo4 iron phosphate fepo4 aqueous phase orthophosphate and biochar hydrochar hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3oh octacalcium phosphate ca8h2 po4 65h2o fepo4 mgpo4 mg2 po4 3 alpo4 110 besides animal manure and food waste also contain high levels of phosphorus total phosphorus up to 34 10 and 52 00 g kg respectively 111 thus phosphorus recovery from sewage sludge animal manure or food waste by thermochemical technologies is a promising way to deal with finite sources of natural phosphorus after htc process phosphorus is transformed into orthophosphate in liquid fraction insoluble precipitates in the hydrochar due to the reaction between metal elements i e ca k mg in the feedstock recovery 90 and phosphorus as well as adsorption via affinity of fe and al hydroxides with phosphorus 111 subsequently phosphorus recovery can be conducted via wet chemical extraction process from ash and hydrochar for example inorganic acids e g hydrochloric acid hcl sulfuric acid h2so4 nitric acid hno3 phosphoric acid h3po4 dissolve alkali metal oxides and induce phosphorus release on the other hand metals or metalloids and metal bound p are released in the presence of organic acids e g oxalic acid c2h6o6 citric acid c6h8o7 gluconic acid c6h12o7 formic acid ch2o2 acetic acid c2h4o2 through chelating effects alkaline extraction i e naoh can extract phosphorus from ash and hydrochar as well as inhibit the dissolution of heavy metals after coupling the wet extraction method and precipitation process with addition of precipitants i e cacl2 mgcl2 6h2o and or nh4 rich wastewater or thermochemical process water etc phosphorus can be significantly recovered close to 100 of phosphorus precipitation efficiency as alpo4 ca3 po4 2 fepo4 struvite hydroxyapatite and other products i e calcium phosphate chlorophosphate etc 112 chemical reagents i e cao acids etc can be also directly added during thermochemical conversion process to enhance nutrient recovery the direct addition of cao during hydrothermal treatment process can induce the formation of hydroxyapatite being abundant in nature p ores which is highly stable easily productive and biocompatible and has high potential in enhancing growth of plants 113 114 during the htc process the alkaline environment ph up to 8 58 induced by high htc temperature 200 c prompted the conversion of organic phosphorus op polyphosphate to inorganic phosphorus ip orthophosphate and favored the enrichment of apatite phosphorus ap in the hydrochars orthophosphate po4 3 reacted with al3 fe2 and mg2 from sludge feedstock to form fepo4 alpo4 and mg po4 2 after adding sufficient cao loading ratio of 4 some ca oh2 was formed leading to an alkaline solution then po4 3 was released from fepo4 alpo4 and mg po4 2 41 me po 4 n 3noh me oh 3n npo 4 3 me al fe mg some of the released po4 3 was used to form hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3oh 42 5ca 2 3po 4 3 oh ca 5 po 4 3 oh some organic phosphorus pyrophosphate was converted to ca2p2o7 2h2o thus non apatite inorganic phosphorus naip was almost completely transformed into ap as hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3oh and ca2p2o7 2h2o this significantly increased apatite phosphorus by 252 in hydrochars and p availability by 233 compared with that in hydrochar obtained via htc without cao addition 113 table 3 summarizes some typical thermochemical based nutrient recovery processes 4 future perspectives current studies have extended the applications of bes from nutrient removal recovery to biogas upgrade and removals of emerging pollutants and heavy metals from wastewater bes emg can convert co2 captured by or dissolved into wastewater to ch4 emerging pollutants are effectively removed either by bioanode in mfc or biocathode in mec due to the electrode enriched with special functional microbes which contribute to degradation of pollutants and enhanced electron transfer and generation the addition of some metals i e cu ii can enhance the electron transfer as electron shuttle mediators for removal of the target metals i e cr iv bes containing electrode rich in eab or srb also enhances heavy metal removal biowastes are converted to value added products including biochar hydrochar gas and bio oil through thermochemical processes furthermore these products properties are better than the feedstocks i e enhanced porosity surface area and heating value of biochar hydrochar increased bio oil yield etc subsequently products can be widely employed for environmental sustainability such as wastewater treatment soil amendment surrogate fuel and fossil energy however more studies are required to enhance the functioning of these technologies and properties of products as follows 1 in depth studies should concentrate on more possible pathways for conversion of co2 h2 and other gases to ch4 by bes 2 removal of a wider range of emerging pollutants in bes are needed to be investigated deeply comprehensively 3 more types of special functional microorganisms on electrodes should be explored and mechanisms about removing pollutants in the presence of these microbes must be clarified 4 more advanced thermochemical technologies can be devised to simplify the operational process and enhance the properties of products 5 wider range of biowastes should be employed for making high value added products 6 more studies need to explore applications of products obtained from thermochemical technologies 5 conclusions this review updated the studies published on the development and applications of bes in the treatment of wastewater containing nutrient emerging pollutants and heavy metals nitrogen is removed and recovered on anode and cathode while phosphorus recovery is mainly accomplished via chemical precipitation on the cathode the bioanode in mfc or biocathode in mec enriched with eab and or srb accelerates electron transfer and generation and further degradation of pollutants thermochemical technologies transform biowastes to value added products including biochar hydrochar gas and bio oil with better characteristics than feedstocks moreover the products can be widely applied in wastewater treatment and soil amendment as surrogate fuel and fossil energy for environmental sustainability some types of biowastes are also potential feedstocks for phosphorus recovery by thermochemical treatment future studies should concentrate on more types of special functional microbes on electrodes as well as preparation and

13073,the term circular bioeconomy based clean technologies has attracted global attention in recent years and it now plays an important role in solving issues of increasing biowaste generation resource scarcity and climate change this is in line with creating a sustainable environment regarding circular bioeconomy based technologies wastewaters and solid biowastes are treated as potential and renewable feedstocks for producing value added resources and bioenergy bioelectrochemical systems bes are promising technologies for the treatment of wastewater and conversion of wastes to bioenergy and resources by microbial fuel cells mfcs and microbial electrolysis cells mecs biowastes from various sectors including organic fraction of municipal solid waste agricultural residues animal manure food wastes and sewage sludge can be converted to biochar biofuel and other valuable products via thermochemical technologies this research explains some representative circular bioeconomy based technologies for the treatment of wastewater and biowastes while focusing on the impact of these technologies and products on environmental sustainability graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords circular bioeconomy bioelectrochemical systems thermochemical technologies sustainable environment 1 introduction economic development and the world s growing population are accelerating demand for energy but all this is doing is accelerating the exhaustion and scarcity of non renewable natural resources i e fossil fuels minerals producing enormous amounts of waste and adding to climate change this scenario in turn produces serious ecological and socioeconomic challenges 1 it has been reported that global resources consumption has increased by 17 4 from 2010 reaching 85 9 billion metric tons in 2017 2 global food waste in cities will increase to 138 million tons by 2025 3 total amounts of global municipal solid waste are predicted to be 3 4 billion tons in 2050 4 in 2020 the global average temperature was 1 2 c above the pre industrial revolution baseline due to rising global greenhouse gas ghg emissions this has led to 91 3 mm of global mean sea level above the value in 1993 2 3 for this reason it is imperative to introduce sustainable development consumption and production in order to use resources energy and infrastructure in more efficient and viable ways 5 circular bioeconomy is now a promising method of sustainable development to generate value added products such as clean water nutrient biofuel biomethane biochar from renewable biological resources i e wastewater biowastes and conserve the long term value of resources through effective conversion biotechnologies this can achieve zero waste generation curtail ghg emissions reduce dependence on fossil fuels and save environmental and economic costs 6 7 bioelectrochemical systems bes have increasingly attracted much more attention as a sustainable waste to energy technology and in parts of the circular bioeconomy wastewater can be treated to produce high quality water and employed as feedstock for bioelectricity and bioenergy generation 8 microbial fuel cells mfcs are mainly used for electricity production by oxidizing organic matter i e acetate by electrogenic bacteria on the anode biotic anode and reducing oxygen at the cathode at neutral ph they are operated without external potential due to the occurrence of spontaneous bioelectricity production by the anodic biofilm microbial electrolysis cells mecs derived from modification of mfc requiring an external power source is generally adopted for storing electrical energy as a biofuel i e h2 ch4 9 10 in addition to nutrient removal recovery bes have been widely applied in the treatment of wastewater containing different types of emerging pollutants i e dye compounds aromatic hydrocarbons petroleum hydrocarbons trichloroethene etc which simultaneously generate electricity 11 biowastes including sewage sludge agricultural residues municipal solid waste food wastes and animal manure contain heating values or energy content higher heating value hhv i e 15 20 mj kj for dry sludge 10 87 mj kg for cattle manure 19 72 mj kg for palm kernel shell 17 0 mj kg for mixture of discarded vegetables and fruits 12 15 moreover sewage sludge obtained from primary and secondary treatment stages in wastewater treatment plants wwtps is rich in nitrogen and phosphorus hence biowastes can be considered as potential source of energy and a good option to replace conventional fossil fuels to accomplish waste to energy and nutrient recovery approaches 12 thermochemical conversion including pyrolysis hydrothermal carbonization torrefaction hydrothermal liquefaction and gasification converts biowastes into high value added products solid fuel liquid fuel biochar hydrochar etc and encourages greater volume reduction of biowastes solid and liquid fuel can be used as surrogate fuel 16 19 biochar or hydrochar can be applied in soil amendment organic waste composting and removals of emerging pollutants air pollutants and heavy metal 17 20 22 in recent years some review papers focused on the developments and applications of bes for removing pollutants from wastewater 1 9 bes for resource recovery and limitations for wide applications 23 and positive effects of bes on performance of anaerobic digestion 24 bes based hybrid systems have been also reviewed in these years such as bes integrated with aerobic anaerobic treatment systems specifically anaerobic digestion aerobic tanks etc for sustainable wastewater treatment 25 methane upgrade 26 and modified bes i e osmotic microbial fuel cell osmfc mfc coupled with osmotic mbr mfc ombr etc for resource recovery 27 nevertheless the applications of bes for wastewater treatment and energy recovery are still the focus of many current studies conversely thermochemical conversion of biowastes was reviewed with respect to different approaches techno economic and bibliometric analysis 16 thermochemical conversion of sewage sludge 19 28 29 30 and engineered activated biochar from microwave pyrolysis process and its applications 18 however we lack review papers about thermochemical conversion of different types of biowastes and effects of products on environmental sustainability it is imperative to provide a review on current research progress this review article aims to update studies on development and applications of bes for wastewater treatment and resource recovery and conversion of biowastes to high value added products by thermochemical technologies using the circular bioeconomy concept 2 bioelectrochemical systems bes for wastewater treatment and resource recovery 2 1 biogas upgrading from wastewater currently bes have been used for reducing co2 mainly captured into or dissolved in wastewater and biogas upgrading this is done by converting co2 to biomethane using electrons enriched with methanogens and or employing electro active microbes as biocatalysts microbial electromethanogenesis emg could occur with a biocathode containing methanogens for methane generation in which direct emg used the cathode for direct reduction of power source and indirect emg employed h2 as electrochemical mediator compared to indirect emg direct emg was more energy efficient 31 thus a membrane less medium scale emg bes prototype was developed for simultaneous wastewater treatment in the anodic chamber and reduction of co2 to ch4 in the cathodic chamber at ph 7 10 when using acetate as medium generation of electrons took place in abiotic anode eq 1 and or biotic anode eq 2 along with acetoclastic methanogenesis eq 3 in the cathodic chamber direct emg dominated the cathode to generate ch4 eq 4 when the applied voltage was low 0 1 0 2 v after increasing voltage 0 6 v voltage 1 v indirect emg would occur for ch4 generation eq 5 she standard hydrogen electrode 1 2h 2 o o 2 4h 4e voltage 0

bacteria at the anode and hydrogenotrophic methanogens at the cathode over the acetoclastic methanogens it should be noted that the applied voltage must be optimized relatively high voltage stimulates biofilm formation and enhances microbial activity however the extremely high voltages will suppress the electrochemically active bacteria 10 32 at the applied voltage of 0 7 v and 32 c ch4 production rate and organic matter removals reached 4 4 l m2 d and around 70 with current density of 0 5 a m2 respectively moreover the high ch4 content in biogas around 87 was close to biomethane standards even when decreasing temperature to 25 c ch4 content in biogas was high at around 90 with higher electro active bacteria growth than acetoclastic methanogens despite that ch4 production declined by 33 overall the emg bes could ensure the stable biological process reduction of acid regression by acetate oxidation at the anode generation of high quality biogas 87 of ch4 content close to biomethane standards and possibility of low temperature operation 10 to reduce co2 emissions from anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge membrane contactors was used for co2 capture into wastewater which was coupled with emg bes reactors for bioconversion of the dissolved co2 to ch4 naoh solution was employed in membrane contractors to increase the alkalinity of wastewater thus accelerating chemical adsorption process during the process around 0 3 3 7 of the injected co2 in wastewater was converted to ch4 and ch4 production was as high as 4 6 l m2 d at higher applied voltage of 4 0 v 32 batlle vilanova 33 also found that the bes containing biocathode enriched with some methanogens i e methanobacterium sp had potential in transforming co2 from wastewater effluent from a water scrubbing based biogas upgrading process abad bioenergy an european patent in wwtps into ch4 eq 4 additionally chlorine could be generated in the anode when using brine as anolyte 7 2cl cl 2 2e e o 1 6 v vs she 8 2h

42 8 and produced more than 60 ppm of chlorine for disinfection of all the treated wastewater 2 2 nutrient removal and recovery in bes organic matters i e acetate glucose as electron donor are oxidized by anaerobic bacteria or electrochemically active bacteria eab on the anode acting as electron acceptor which generates electrons and protons partial oxidation of nh4 n at the anode also releases the electrons the electrons are moved to the anode via extracellular electron transport mechanisms and subsequently transferred to the cathode through the external electric circuit besides dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra could also occur on the anode in mfc when c n ratio in the range of 8 0 0 5 and low external resistance of 10 or 100 ω or in mec at relatively high c n ratio of 8 0 and low applied voltage of 0 5 v 34 ammonia in gas phase obtained after stripping employing aeration in cathodic chamber of mfc or nitrogen gas generated in cathodic chamber of mec can be recovered as ammonium sulfate nh3so4 by diluted sulfuric acid liquid ammonia or ammonium biocarbonate nh4hco3 by co2 35 generally nitrogen including ammonium nh4 n nitrite no2 n nitrate no3 n removal occurs via anoxic anammox process or anoxic ammonium oxidation on the bioanode and via cathodic denitrification process on the cathode biocathode in mfc fig 1 cationic exchange membrane cem as separator in mfc inhibited direct transfer of anions and promoted the direct transfer of protons h and cations nh4 this favored the increase in ph in the cathodic chamber the aeration in the cathodic chamber also increased ph in cathodic chamber 8 0 10 due to hydroxide ions generated through oxygen reduction reaction orr consequently nutrient recovery could be realized by chemical precipitation nh4 and po4 3 precipitating with mg2 and or ca ions when directly feeding the cathodic chamber by the effluent from anodic chamber both nh4 n and po4 3 p could transfer to the cathodic chamber as a result more than 90 of nitrogen and phosphorus recovery was obtained in mfc 36 in mfc nh4 n removal on the bioanode is significantly affected by cod and nh4 n concentrations and cod nh4 ratio in the feedwater microbial population and activity on bioanode increased at higher cod concentrations i e 500 10 000 mg l corresponding to cod nh4 n ratios of 3 3 66 6 which led to more nh4 n degradation when increasing nh4 n concentration from 200 to 650 mg l at fixed cod level 10 000 mg l more nh4 n was adsorbed by microbes but the subsequent biodegradation of nh4 n declined owing to the decreased cod nh4 ratios from 50 to 15 on the other hand the higher nh4 n level increased current density and power generation through improving bacterial activity in bioanode at low cod nh4 n ratio i e 15 and transfer of nh4 n through cem to the cathodic chamber at high cod nh4 n ratio i e 66 6 at cod concentration of 10 000 mg l 50 at nh4 n concentration of 200 mg l nh4 n removal reached maximum level 91 92 via biodegradation 40 in cathodic chamber a moderate aeration rate favors ammonia recovery and energy saving when compared to extremely lower and higher aeration rates the relatively low aeration rate not only maximized ammonia recovery rate average 7 1 kgn m2 d at 100 ml min vs 1 2 7 1 kgn m2 d at 30 50 and 300 ml min but also minimized the energy consumption average 4 3 kwh gn at 100 ml min vs 4 1 6 9 kwh gn at 30 50 and 300 ml min required for removal average 4 9 kwh gn at 100 ml min vs 5 7 26 2 kwh gn at 30 50 and 300 ml min for recovery higher ammonia recovery recovery rate 7 1 gn m2 d and lower energy consumption 5 7 kwh kgn could also be obtained at lower external resistance of 1 ω due to higher current generation compared with higher external resistance recovery rate of 3 2 5 0 gn m2 d and energy consumption of 6 6 7 2 kwh kgn at 10 and 100 ω 41 in mec cathodic denitrification partial denitrification anammox processes and hydrogen gas h2 generation occur in the cathodic chamber which increases cathodic ph and further phosphorus recovery via precipitation the generation of h2 in cathodic chamber encourages ammonia removal which prompts higher nh4 n removal fig 2 in single chamber membrane free mec the applied voltage 0 2 v could enhance activity of microbes on electrodes and denitrification via electric stimulation moreover anammox process and autotrophic denitrification were also improved by the current stimulation 69 4 higher nitrogen removal rate than that in the open circuit this reduced the requirement of carbon source in the feedwater 43 compared to mfc the increased current densities induced by the electric field in mec enhanced nh4 transfer and its removal 45 cod n and applied voltage values should be taken into account when operating mec the elevated cod n no3 n no2 n nh4 n ratio accelerated growth of heterotrophic denitrifying microorganisms thereby increasing total nitrogen removal rate 695 6 gn m3d at cod n of 2 vs 514 5 gn m3 d at c n of 1 43 ph value in cathodic chamber increased from 8 to 9 1 when increasing applied voltage 0 4 0 8 v however much higher voltage 1 2 v inhibited bacterial activity extended cycle duration decreased ph and phosphorus precipitation rate overall the maximum precipitation rate was obtained 95 at moderate applied voltage of 1 1 v 42 moreover the low external voltage could reduce energy consumption due to the increased current generation compared with higher external voltage i e energy consumption for ammonia recovery 4 5 kwh kg n recovery at 0 5 v vs 6 4 kwh kg n recovery at 0 8 v 41 currently a three chamber mec was constructed to recover nitrogen i e nh4 n and remove co2 from syngas by transfer and separation of different cationic and ionic species driven by the electric field 44 the mec consisted of a middle anodic chamber between two cathodic chambers with an anionic exchange membrane aem and cem as separators aem cathode and cem cathode respectively during the operational process influent containing cod and nh4 n fed the anodic chamber meanwhile gas mixture n2 co2 70 30 v v flushed through the two cathodic chambers with separators of cem and aem in sequence the overflow of liquid phase from the cathodic chamber with cem was recirculated between two cathodic chambers every day the daily overflow helped to remove nh4 n leading to nitrogen removal rates of 96 mgn d removal of 65 at anodic potential of 0 2 v vs she and 43 mgn d removal of 30 at anodic potential of 0 1 v vs she co2 was mainly removed through sorption as hco3 in the cathodic chamber by the daily overflow removal of 63 during 0 2 v vs she or transfer of hco3 from cathodic chamber with aem to the anodic chamber removal of 49 during 0 1 v vs she reduction of co2 to methane in the cathodic chambers only contributed to 16 20 of co2 removal moreover the biogas obtained would not be contaminated by ammonia since aem reduced the nh4 n concentration in the cathodic chamber human urine contains different types of components such as urea inorganic salts i e chloride potassium sodium ammonia creatinine phosphate sulfur etc thus it can also be used for nutrient recovery by bes urea is hydrolyzed in the anodic chamber 38 45 9 nh 2 co nh 2 2h 2 o nh 3 nh 4 hco 3 then the dissolved ammonia nh3 and nh4 n are oxidized into no2 n and no3 n and or anaerobically oxidized to n2 via anammox reaction along with release of electrons additionally biodegradation of organic matters in the wastewater sodium acetate creatinine and histidine also generates nh3 and electrons 38 45 10 organic matters co 2 nh 3 intermediates h e nitrogen removal can be realized in the cathodic chamber as shown in figs 4 and 5 the high ph in the cathodic chamber could induce formation of precipitates in different forms including struvite hydroxyapatite or calcite 45 11 mg 2 nh 4 po 4 3 6h 2 o mgnh 4 po 4 6h 2 o struvite 12 5ca 2 3po 4 3 oh ca 5 po 4 3 oh hydroxyapatite 13 ca 2 co 3 2 caco 3 calcite single chamber air cathode mfc could remove up to 84 of total nitrogen from urea at high total ammonia nitrogen tan concentration 2630 mg l via direct ammonia oxidation near the cathode and anammox process on the anode in series 46 to simultaneously recover nutrient sulfur and salts from urine containing wastewater a three chamber resource recovery mfc rrmfc was set up which contained an anodic chamber a middle chamber and a cathodic chamber with a cem and an aem as separators between two consecutive chambers respectively 38 the effluent from anodic chamber directly fed cathodic chamber sulfur compounds were reduced in anodic chamber 14 so 4 2 8h 8e s 2 4h 2 o reoxidization of s2 occurred in the cathodic chamber 15 s 2 2o 2 s so 4 2 8e after nutrient removal and recovery process fig

result nh4 n could be recovered in the middle chamber rather than employing ammonia stripping and acid adsorption processes thereby reducing energy demand and saving operational cost po4 3 p recovery also took place in the middle chamber with recovery efficiency of 37 po4 3 p as substrate for microbial growth was also removed in the anodic chamber while no precipitation was detected in the cathodic chamber due to the migration of nh4 finally this system showed excellent performance in removing 97 99 of urea cod so4 2 and po4 3 and recovering 37 60 of total nitrogen po4 3 so4 2 and total salts 2 3 removal of emerging pollutants the increasing consumption and usage of different types of emerging pollutants i e antibiotics pesticides etc leads to residues of the pollutants presenting in aqueous environment i e wastewater rivers groundwater which deteriorates ecological balance and human health therefore emerging pollutants need to be eliminated from wastewater before discharging into ecosystem in mfc with bioanode some emerging pollutants could act as electron donors in the presence of other carbon sources i e glucose acetate which donate electrons to exoelectrogenic bacteria the exoelectrogenic bacteria and some functional microbes for degradation of pollutants in anodic biofilm could oxidize emerging pollutants and generate electricity the applied voltage in mec with biocathode could enhance the electron transfer from anode to the biocathode which accelerates degradation of pollutants by functional microorganisms on the biocathode 2 3 1 antibiotics removal generally there are two pathways for antibiotics removal in bes including anodic anaerobic biodegradation aab and cathodic electrochemical reduction cer antibiotics are removed in the anodic chamber via aab in bes containing a biotic anode and an abiotic cathode microbes in the anodic chamber antibiotic degrading bacteria and other microorganisms i e anaerobic microbes involve degradation and metabolization of antibiotics through reducing antibiotics potential resistance to enable biodegradation and metabolization process degrading metabolites as well as secreting degradation enzymes external electrical current in bes could induce the direct or indirect transformation of electrons to the microbial cells which stimulates microbial metabolism and enhances antibiotics degradation and mineralization antibiotics removal in mec occurred in the cathodic chamber can be explained by the cer method one is direct electrochemical reduction by which emerging pollutants accepting electrons from the cathode can be directly eliminated and another one is the associated overpotential reduction by the microbes on the cathode as biocatalysts for biodegradation of antibiotics 9 47 49 this also significantly reduces antibiotic resistance genes args production sulfamethoxazole smx degradation in mfc mainly occurred on anode there are several different pathways for smx degradation when an anode comprises anaerobic microorganisms or electroactive biofilm eabf consisting of electrochemically active microorganisms fig 3 it was discovered that the mfc could remove more than 98 of smx initial concentration of 20 mg l in the anode within 48 h of reaction 48 50 in the dual chamber mfc with anodic eabf smx affected energy metabolism and microbial activity through three mechanisms the first was increasing the abundance of electrogenes rhodopseudomonas geobacter and aquamicrobium responsible for energy generation but eliminating some competitive species alcaligenes and nitrosomonas which utilize organic carbon or nitrogen for their growth or reproduction for the second it means stimulating generation of more eps i e redox proteins as electron shuttles or electroactive enzymes to resist the toxicity of smx and enhance reduction and oxidation reaction by altering redox system with anodic eabfs for power generation it should be noted that smx as an inhibitor limits bacterial reproduction leading to less energy required for microbial growth and release of electrons for energy output consequently the mfc with anodic eabfs enhanced energy output by up to 15 times reaching 1398 6 mw m2 and theoretically harvested 417 mw h electricity for a plant treating 100 000 m3 wastewater per day 50 norfloxacin nfx could be removed by mfc 65 5 48 4 at an initial concentration of 4 128 mg l using a high degree of acclimatization and high tolerance of anodic electrogenic microbes to high nfx concentration maximum power density reached up to 800 mv m2 moreover arg generated was also reduced 105 copies ml compared to conventional wastewater treatment plants generally 106 108 copies ml nevertheless it should pay attention to the adverse effects of higher nfc concentration 128 mg l on membrane permeability of some exoelectrogenic bacteria it not only inhibits the direct electron transfer through cell membranes from microorganisms to anode but also increases internal resistance of mfcs 51 in mec smx degradation was not as high as that in mfc via different removal pathways fig 4 at the applied voltage of 0 6 v the increased smx concentration and consistent electrical stimulation accelerated bioelectrochemical reactions this led to better smx degradation at higher initial smx concentrations removal of 77 6 at initial concentration of 10 mg l vs 92 53 at 30 mg l when some smx resistant microorganisms pseudomonas comamonas acinetobacter and arthrobacter were present on anode for smx degradation the removal of smx could inhibit the production of args abundance of inti1 1 23 102 9 27 103 copies g in mec biofilms 1 6 101 9 02 102 copies ml in mec effluents compared to conventional wastewater treatment processes 1 75 109 copies g for anaerobic digestion 109 1011 copies ml for wwtps 52 erythromycin ery could be removed by 99 within 48 h in mec this was ascribed to the dominance of geobacter exoelectrogenic bacteria in anodic biofilm relative abundance of 77 for generating electricity and highly abundant acetoanaerobium in biocathode relative abundance of 11 as exoelectrogen bacteria this employs acetate as electron donor and carbon source for degrading pollutants 53 2 3 2 removing other emerging pollutants triclosan could be effectively removed in mfc removal of 94 at initial concentration of 10 mg l via adsorption onto the anode with high surface area and porosity or biodegradation under anoxic conditions by some species i e geothrix corynebacterium sulfobacillus gouta19 geobacter acidithiobacillus and acinetobacter this contributes to the degradation of benzene related chemicals and dechlorination of chlorine containing chemicals during tcs degradation process 54 55 17β estradiol e2 was removed in mec by about 99 2 in 60 h due to the dominant species bacillus lysinibacillus and aeromonas contributing to e2 degradation the removal pathways included oxidization of e2 to hydroxylation products ring opening oxidization of the products by electrochemical reaction and microbial oxidase reaction to generate oxidative products there was also oxidation of oxidative products to macromolecules and organic carboxylic acids with low molecular weight and mineralization of organic carboxylic acids to co2 and h2o 56 mfc also removed a large amount of fipronil 94 at initial fipronil concentration of 74 mg l in the presence of acetate as co substrate in anodic chamber mainly via microbial degradation in anode metabolism of acetate for generation of electrons and electricity by electrogenic bacteria it was followed by enhanced co metabolic reaction efficiency of fipronil degradation related bacteria azospirillum azoarcus chryseobacterium via accepting electrons removals of various organic compounds were also high in the anodic chamber of mfc via similar microbial catabolic pathways i e 93 for 4 chloronitrobenzene raw material or synthetic intermediate in many industries 84 for sulfanilamide antibiotic and pharmaceutical intermediate 74 for fluoroglycofen herbicide and 65 for azoxystrobin fungicide 57 mfc showed around 70 of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds removal even at a high sds concentration of 40 mg l by anodic biofilm containing some species acinetobacter pseudomonas citrobacter treponema etc able to degrade complex and refractory organics through desulfurization dehydrogenation biotransformation and degradation however sds did endanger the formation of exoelectrogenic biofilm on the anode which compromised power performance of mfc by 66 and reduced maximum power density 12 7 w m2 2 65 fold lower compared to the control mfc without sds 58 when treating azo dye wastewater sunset yellow ssy the mixed consortia in mfc after acclimation could enhance their dye tolerance and increase decolorization ability 93 removal of sunset yellow fcf 96 6 removal of allura red 91 41 removal of tartrazine at initial concentration of 100 mg l the presence of dye decoloring and exoelectrogenic bacteria klebsiella citrobacter enterococcus faecalis lactococcus garvieae proteus mirabilis lactobacillus lactis and escherichia shigella proved to be favorable for degrading intermediates after breakage of azo bonds in azo dyes 59 when using membrane free electrolysis cell mfec with biocathode for azo dye treatment the cathode fed with glucose as co substrate generated electrons via microbial respiration the charge transfer resistance significantly reduced due to no membrane being present thus electrons were directly used for azo bond cleavage breaking of the chromophoric groups to decolorize the congo red dye around 90 within 24 h at voltages of 0 3 0 9 v mfec also enabled ch4 production by firstly directly utilizing electrons provided by the cathode and secondly hydrogenophilic methanogenesis employing h2 generated from the cathode 60 as sulfate reducing bacteria srb can function as a biocatalyst involving microbial extracellular electron transfer between microbes and electrodes the enrichment of srb on electrodes bioanode in mfc biocathode in mec prompts the removal of some pollutants i e chlorophenols nitrobenzene azo dye as electron acceptor in the presence of sulfate additionally the presence of sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob on electrode bioanode in mfc biocathode in mec for oxidation of sulfide releases electrons which can be used to degrade pollutants fig 5 at initial 4 cp concentration of 100 mg l mfc removed up to 40 of 4 chlorophenol 4 cp with maximum power generation of 253 5 mw m2 current density 712 0 ma m2 after inoculating the anode with anaerobic sludge containing sodium lactate and sodium sulfate enriched with srb 61 initially acetate and propionate electron donors obtained by fermentation of lactase were oxidized to co2 in anodic biofilm where electrons transferred to the anode using srb then sulfate electron acceptor was reduced to sulfide electron donor at the top of anodic biofilm eq 16 which maintained srb growth sulfide was oxidized to sulfur via abiotic oxidation on the anode to generate electrons eq 17 16 so 4 2 8e h 2 s hs 17 h 2 s hs s 0 so 4 2 2e after that reduction of 4 cp electron acceptor to phenol occurred by accepting electrons from anode followed by reduction to acetate and again oxidation of acetate to co2 in the anodic chamber in mec the increased external voltage applied heightened 4 cp removal compared to the mfc at an applied cell voltage of 0 4 v versus ag agcl around 43 of 4 cp was removed in the anodic chamber h2o2 was also produced in mec 13 3 g l m2 after 6 h operation via two electron orr at the cathode at ph 7 18 3co 2 10 h 10 e ch 2 chohcoo 3h 2 o e 0 0 34 v vs normal hydrogen electrode nhe 19 10 h 5o 2 10 e 5h 2 o 2 e 0 0 26 v vs nhe this was made possible by higher cathode potential around 260 mv vs nhe than anode potential around 340 mv vs nhe nevertheless h2o2 may reduce to water when applying higher added voltage competing with the two electron orr 61 20 h 2 o 2 2h 2e 2h 2 o 21 h 2 o 2 h 2 o 1 2o 2 when treating wastewater containing nitrobenzene nb 50 mg l and sulfate 200 mg l by mec with autotrophic srb biocathode nb removal efficiency reached 98 initially nb was reduced to nitrosobenzene nob using electricity nob was reduced to aniline an using electrons from the cathode with wolinella sp present which released nitrite reductase and this involved the reduction of nitrite to ammonia srb desulfovibrio sp participated in the reduction of sulfate to sulfide during the process electrons were provided by oxidation from sulfide to sulfur by sob thioclava sp and halothiobacillus sp 62 during treatment of sulfide containing azo dye wastewater the removal of congo red dye initial concentration of 200 mg l could reach more than 88 by mfc with maximum power density of 24 w m2 this was accomplished in three ways firstly electrons were released through conversion of sulfide hs s2 to sulfur s0 sulfate so4 2 and s2o3 2 by sob which led to high sulfate concentration and deposition of element sulfur on the electrode surface secondly electrons and protons were generated by acetate co substrate due to the presence of electrochemically active bacteria eab and thirdly azo bonds were cleaved in azo dye by accepting electrons to generate colorless products i e aromatic amines extracellular electron transport from microorganisms to electron acceptors i e azo dyes anode could be enhanced by cell lysis through biogenic sulfide reduction by srb genus desulfovibrio which improved degradation of azo dyes 63 mec with eab can also be a promising option for the treatment of dye wastewater treatment through interaction between eab and azo dye decolorization eab growth was selectively enhanced by azo dye and extracellular decolorization of alizarin yellow r ayr realized by extracellular electron transfer with eab under electricity stimulation this increased the removal rate and limited toxicity of azo dye on eab 64 65 hou et al 65 found that high decolorization efficiency around 90 was obtained in a single chamber mec constructed with mos2 go nickel foam nf cathode at initial ayr concentration of 100 mg l with co substrate of naac and glucose meanwhile the electrons released by eab in anode which were transferred to the cathode stimulated h2 generation dual chamber mfc with electroactive biofilm carbon felt anodes could effectively remove 2 chlorophenol mfc 2 cp initial concentration of 10 mg l and 2 4 dichlorophenol mfc 2 4 dcp initial concentration of 10 mg l 66 the anodic biofilm contained high biomass protein level and many functional species consisting of exoelectrogens i e geobacter pseudomonas degrading bacteria i e comamonas metagenome shinella dechlorosoma and multifunctional electrogenic degradative bacteria i e acinetobacter azospirillum the first way of the removal was biodegradation 95 97 for 2 cp 84 5 88 7 for 2 4 cp via dichlorination hydroxylation and hydrogenation of 2 cp and 2 4 dcp into cyclohexanol with low toxicity which encouraged electricity generation by multifunctional microbial community in anodic biofilm 22 2 4 dcp or 2 cp h e cl cyclohexanol the second was mineralization 74 7 80 5 for 2 cp 58 8 78 4 for 2 4 cp via the production of long chain hydrocarbons by ring opening reactions followed by mineralizing hydrocarbons into co2 and h2o 23 cyclohexanol long chain hydrocarbon co 2 h 2 o e moreover this process realized maximum power densities of 474 5 and 472 3 w m2 for 2 cp and 2 4 cp respectively 66 as groundwater with low ion strength limited the removal of nitrate and perchlorate in bes cathodic potential regulation was adopted using an electrochemical workstation with a three electrode system to limit the overpotential and enhance electron transfer in bes to enhance removals of nitrate and perchlorate the application of negative potential shortened suppression duration for perchlorate induced by nitrate i e 55 6 of total reaction time at cathode potential of 800 mv vs she vs 64 3 of total reaction time without potential regulation and ameliorated the inhibition effect of nitrate on perchlorate removal at cathodic potential of 200 mv vs she the reduction rates of nitrate and perchlorate increased by 53 74 and 38 04 respectively compared to mfc without potential control removals of nitrate and perchlorate were attributed to both the cathode as electron donor and autotrophic bacteria i e phyla proteobacteria chloroflex ignavibacteriae classes betaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria accepting electrons for denitrifying and reducing the pollutants 67 2 4 heavy metal removal heavy metal in wastewater poses threats to the ecosystem and has adverse impacts i e cancer disease liver and kidney damage etc on different organisms hence it needs to remove heavy metal from wastewater to obtain clean water this can be achieved by bes in three mechanisms the first is direct redox reaction dro which is achieved by reducing metals to elemental deposits or lower oxidation states through accepting electrons from cathode and or cathodic biofilm table 1 the second is indirect byproduct precipitation ibp through precipitating metals with byproducts of cathodic reduction reaction i e oh h2o2 involved here is a single chamber mfc with air cathode eqs 24 27 and cathodic hydrogen generation in mec eqs 28 and 29 24 o 2 2h 2 o 4e 4oh 25 me a ah 2 o me oh a ah 26 me 4 4h 2 o me oh 4 4h 27 me b boh me oh b 28 2h 2 o 2e 2oh h 2 29 me c coh me oh c the third is biological removal through intracellular extracellular microbial respiration biological reduction bioaccumulation and biosorption by anodic or cathodic biofilm it should be noted that precipitates in ibp may deposit on electrodes ion exchange membrane or other areas of the cathode chamber removing metals through dro and ibp requires further recovery approaches in other words manual scarping or acid dissolution after metal removal via dro settling by gravity and collecting following metal removal via ibp excellent removal efficiencies above 95 were reported in more than 60 of studies meanwhile other studies confirmed the removals of greater than 50 when metal concentrations ranging from 0 01 0 1 g l as reported by above 50 in some research 38 69 71 removal of cr vi in membrane less dual chamber bes was realized through initial bioelectrochemical cr vi reduction by exoelectrogens on the cathode eq 30 and subsequent cr iii precipitation with phosphorus which generate cr phosphorus precipitates and or complexes on the cathode at neutral ph 30 cr 2 o 7 2 14 h 6e cr 2 o 3 4h 2 o 6h 2cr 3 7h 2 o e 0 1 33 v these were further removed from bulk sludge in bes apart from this mec performed better in removing cr vi and first order cr vi reduction rate constant 66 2 and 0 103 d respectively due to the external power supply compared to mfc 56 7 and less than 0 072 d respectively 72 moreover cu ii was used as electron shuttle mediators to enhance the removal of cr vi the overpotential of cathode waned and the active energy barrier declined owing to the presence of cu ii in mfc resulting in higher charge transport thus cu ii improved the electron transfer from anode to cathode which accelerated the indirect utilization of electrons generated by the anode for cr vi reduction in the cathodic chamber as shown in eqs 30 33 and cr vi reduction rate 31 cu 2 2e cu e 0 0 337 v or 32 2cu 2 h 2 o 2e cu 2 o 2h e 0 0 207 v 33 2cu 2 o 2h 2e 2cu 2h 2 o e 0 0 059 v as a result cr oh 3 and a little cu were deposited on the cathode at high levels of cu ii 50 mg l power density of 1235 53 mw m2 and cr vi reduction rate of 1 191 g m3 h were significantly higher 1 4 times and 1 17 times respectively than that without cu ii 73 electrochemical reduction in dual chamber bes could successfully recover sliver above 80 during 48 h of operation from the sliver i dithiosulfate ag s2o3 2 3 complex which was frequently detected in waster fixer solution from photographic processing waste during the operational stage catholyte ph increased over time caused by 1 cathodic reduction which decreased concentration of ag s2o3 2 3 but increased s2o3 2 and 2 limited transportation of h from anodic chamber to the cathodic chamber by other competitive cations i e na k this led to dominance of spontaneously electrochemical reaction converting ag s2o3 2 3 electron acceptor to metallic ag0 on the cathode surface 74 anodic chamber 34 ch 3 coo 4h 2 o 2hco 3 9h 8e e 0 0 289 v vs

in two chamber mfc excess caustic in the catholyte and acidification in the anolyte a loop of catholyte effluent feeding to bioanode in mfc with air cathode was developed by song et al 75 this system could in situ use caustic in the cathodes and neutralized acid generated in the anodes to recover metals when feeding synthetic wastewater simulating printed circuit boards prcbs processing wastewater at low organic loading of 200 mg l the cathodic chamber eliminated around 91 of su fe and cu along with 68 of total cod removal in the meantime approximately 8 of these metals were removed by the bioanodic chamber subsequently more metals were deposited on the cathode sn iv fe iii cu 0 and cu ii than those on the anode this reduced the adverse effects of the loop feeding design on the exoelectrogens on the anode besides microorganisms in anodic biofilm were well acclimatized to the catholyte effluent containing metals as demonstrated by the increased abundance of rhodopseudomonas and geobacter and the emergence of pseudomonas comamonas aeromonas and azospira in the microbial community on the anodes electrodes enriched with srb or eab also act as biocatalyst and can enhance metal removal in bes mec with sulfate reducer enriched biocathode was developed using two efficient srb strains enterococcus avium by7 and citrobacter freundii sr10 which simultaneously reduced sulfate and antimony sb via sulfide metal precipitation and catalyzed hydrogen generation although the metabolic activity of srb strains abated under sudden adverse conditions sb addition a specified adaptation period helped to stabilize their activity this improved sulfate reduction and conversion of sb v to sb iii as precipitation of sb2s3 conversion efficiency up to 70 1 with by7 and up to 89 2 with sr10 the maximum total removal efficiencies of sb were 88 2 with by7 and 96 3 with sr10 at sulfate reduction rates of 92 3 and 98 4 g m3 d respectively however hydrogen production rate declined after adding sb average 1 25 1 36 m3h2 m3 d vs 0 89 0 98 m3h2 m3 d this was ascribed to the adaptation to adverse conditions and bioprecipitation of sb reducing the electron transfer rate 76 in single chamber mecs with four eab citrobacter sp jy3 pseudomonas sp x3 pseudomonas delhiensis x5 ochrobactrum anthropic x7 which can use hco3 as carbon source in bes various amounts of eps with different compositions were released by these eab to strategically adapt to stressful conditions induced by the changes in initial cd ii and circuit current compared to the bioanode the biocathode was more favorable for cd ii recovery due to the creation of anaerobic conditions which enhanced eab activities and limited the consumption of electrons by o2 the high initial acetate level 5 0 g l changed the cathodic potential so that it was more negative which moderated the cd ii inhibition and enabled the removal of cd ii at a wider range of initial cd ii concentration consequently various cd ii removals 2 57 7 35 mg l h and h2 production 0 0 0011 m3 m3 h were obtained at initial cd ii concentration of 20 150 mg l and initial acetate concentration of 1 0 5 0 g l due to the robustness of eab 77 3 thermochemical conversion of biowastes and applications of the products biowastes are the wastes from animal plants and human beings for instance municipal solid waste forestry and agricultural wastes animal manures food wastes sewage sludge etc they contain certain amounts of energy i e 10 73 mj kg for mustard stalk 15 77 mj kg for olive refuse 16 2 mj kg for peach bagasse 17 97 mj kg for tobacco leaf 22 00 mj kg for olive pits etc consequently they are ideal for generating biofuels bio energy through thermochemical conversion in order to reduce dependence on conventional fossil fuel and greenhouse gas ghg emissions fig 6 summarizes thermochemcial technologies for biowastes conversion and application of value added products biowastes can be converted to various types of valuable products through pyrolysis i biochar 20 50 as the main product bio oil 20 40 syngas 10 25 and some liquids acetone methanol acetic acid via slow pyrolysis 400 900 c residence time of minutes to days ii bio oil as major products 60 75 via fast pyrolysis 450 850 c residence time of 5 30 s and iii bio oil 25 75 and syngas 50 60 as dominant products via flash pyrolysis 1000 c residence time 1 2 s 16 18 biochar obtained by pyrolysis can be applied to wastewater treatment for removing heavy metals via surface complexation ion exchange cation π electron precipitation etc or used as adsorbent to remove organic micropollutants like 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 3 4 trichlorophenol bisphenol a carbamazepine androsterone estrone 17a ethinylestradiol via pore filling hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic attraction 18 22 bio oil can be catalytically upgraded into petroleum like biodiesel surrogate fuel or used as fuel to generate electricity in anion exchange membrane fuel cells besides the syngas especially co and h2 as dominant components can be upgraded into diesel like fuel or burned as fuel gas 18 it was found that slow pyrolysis temperature and types of biowastes affected biochar properties and their effects on soil amendment for example five different feedstocks pine saw dust sd rice husk rh food waste fw poultry litter pl and paper sludge ps were used for biochar preparation at four different pyrolysis temperatures 350 450 550 and 650 c 78 some important findings were specified as follows 1 when pyrolysis temperature increased the ph of biochar also rose i e increase in ph of both pl and ps from 6 2 to 10 3 in biochar thus ps and pl biochars obtained at 550 and 650 c could be used for acid neutralization in soil due to their ph buffer capacity 2 the cation exchange value declined at higher pyrolysis temperature owing to loss of the organic functional group on biochar surface aromatic c oxidation and formation of carboxyl groups hence sd pl and ps biochars at lower temperature 350 c were better for retention of soil nutrient 3 the number of pores and pore size also increased at higher temperature especially for sd and rs biochars moreover bet surface area of all biochars increased especially sd and rh biochars which possessed higher surface area 431 91 443 79 m2 g and 248 99 280 97 m2 g thus sd and rh biochar prepared at 550 and 650 c favored water retention in the soil and the adsorption of pollutants 4 the highest fixed carbon values were detected in sd biochar average 55 31 rh biochar average 48 47 and fw biochar average 58 85 the higher pyrolysis temperature increased the degree of aromaticity decline in atomic ratio of hydrogen oxygen h c but reduced polarity decline in atomic ratio of oxygen carbon o c hence rh and sd biochars obtained at higher pyrolysis temperatures of 550 and 650 c low o c ratios 0 1 0 26 were the most stable half life 1000 years among all biochars and could be applied for carbon sequestration into soil gasification process at temperatures of 700 900 c transforms biowastes to liquid and gaseous fuels as the dominant products used for transportation and syngas employed in gas turbine torrefaction at low temperatures of 200 300 c under oxygen free condition mild pyrolysis generates high grade solid fuel from biowastes for power plant or boiler application hydrothermal liquefaction temperatures of 280 370 c pressures of 10 25 mpa as high pressure hydrolysis converts biowastes to high quality bio oil 16 18 3 1 sewage sludge sewage sludge can be converted into bio oil biochar and gas h2 co and other light gases via pyrolysis which is a favored sludge management approach slow pyrolysis is divided into carbonization and torrefaction carbonization mainly generates biochar while torrefaction increases heating value and c h ratio of biochar and eliminates nox sox and other pollutants the porosity and surface morphology of biochar were increased by slow pyrolysis ph of biochar was higher than the raw sludge through the release of alkali salts dehydration of sludge feedstock and damage of organic acids and carbonates 79 fast pyrolysis can transform sewage sludge to bio oil consisting of hydrocarbons aromatic and aliphatic ones organic acids and carbonyl compounds with high molecular weight aromatic and aliphatic compounds nitrogenous compounds sulfur compounds and other compounds i e phenols ketones etc the high initial water content in sewage sludge high humidity 95 of water and decomposition of volatile matter during fast pyrolysis reduce heating value and induce the presence of oxygenated compounds in the bio oil thus compared to petroleum derived heavy fuel oil average 40 mj kg the bio oil obtained via fast pyrolysis of sewage sludge possesses higher moisture content and lower hhv average 30 mj kg 28 there are two alternative options to enhance both the quality and quantity of products during pyrolysis one is co pyrolysis and another is catalytic pyrolysis co pyrolysis of sewage sludge with other biowastes i e saw dust rice straw etc not only can enhance deoxygenation and increase heating value of bio oil and improve quality of bio oil but also increase heating value and specific surface area of biochar catalytic pyrolysis with additives or catalysts i e al2o3 cao fe2o3 tio2 zno can upgrade bio oil with stable storage value by increasing carbon and hydrogen yield reducing oxygen and water content increasing hhv of bio oil decreasing viscosity and minimizing pollutants 28 hydrothermal carbonization htc and hydrothermal liquefaction htl have also been employed to prepare valuable products i e hydrochar bio oil from sewage sludge htc process improves energy content of hydrochar by transforming low energy density chemical bonds i e c o and c h into high energy chemical bonds aryl as the amount of aromatic carbon increases after htc treatment the aromaticity of carbon in hydrochar increases 30 htc increased the porosity and surface area of hydrochar produced compared to the sludge feedstock while decreasing h c and o c ratios that enhanced aromaticity and carbonization however ph of hydrochar decreased compared to sludge feedstock as acidic functional groups generated via hydrolysis reaction the heavy metals enriched in hydrochar that are in bioavailable fraction could be converted into stable fraction thus these metals presented minimal or no environmental risk for field application 79 since the aromatic carbon content increases in the hydrochar after the htc process hydrochar possesses high soil carbon sequestration potential moreover the hydrochar can also be used as land fertilizer due to the residual n ammonia obtained by deamination and p extractable phosphate 30 although recent works tried to improve hydrochar yield by adding some chemical catalysts during htc process the hydrochar could not be used as cleaner fuel with better heating value hv this was ascribed to that hydrochar obtained after adding nacl or employing ammonia treated fenton sewage sludge as feedstock demonstrated declined carbon composition hv and h c ratio 80 htl treatment can generate bio oil having hhv of 30 40 mj kg from sewage sludge higher temperature improves the quality of bio oil and yield of gas solvents i e methanol ethanol during htl process stimulate the generation of esters and improve the yield and quality of bio oil sludge pretreatment i e subcritical water fatty alcohol polyoxyethyleneether ultrasonic etc can improve hydrocarbons hhv energy recovery aromaticity and or polarity of bio oil obtained after htl through regulating products from htl by catalysts i e cuso4 nimo al2o3 cu no3 2 bio oil i e esters amides and gas generation can be enhanced while limiting coke formation 30 it needs to pay more attention to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah as pah in sewage sludge is the toxic and recalcitrant organic pollutants the increased reaction temperature 220 360

temperature of 300 c solid liquid ratio of 0 1 g ml and shorter reaction time of 30 min in the range of 0 60 min when reaction temperature or time increased more pahs transferred into bio oil 89 of pah in bio oil any further treatment or utilization of bio oil was inhibited by high toxic equivalent quantity teq values 6 1 8 6 mg kg and total content of pahs in bio oil 55 0 106 6 mg kg thus the htl process needs to be improved to reduce the formation of pahs 81 3 2 agricultural wastes food waste and municipal solid waste msw the biochars generated from different feedstocks are used for

fertilizer production and ghg emissions and carbon sequestration in soils 98 compared to biochar properties at lower pyrolysis temperatures 200 and 300 c the biochar obtained after pyrolysis of leaf waste at 400 c had higher volatile matter and fixed carbon lower h c ratio and higher ph of biochar 10 23 due to the formation of alkaline species higher bet surface area pore volume and micropore volume 99 biochar can be used for the removal of h2s 84 2 from gas generated during anaerobic digestion process by firstly formation of a water film on biochar surface owing to its lower hydrophilicity resulting from lower h c ratio secondly adsorption of h2s on biochar surface forming dissolution with water film eq 37 and thirdly dissociating the adsorbed h2s molecule in water film

metal immobilization ability when treating sediment with 10 tb cd was reduced by 67 7 in the exchangeable fraction during the meso microcosm study it was discovered that the uptake of cd in mollusk tissue and root and shoot of water hyacinth declined by 75 87 this might be attributed to excellent properties of tb favorable for cd sorption including large amounts of micro meso meso and macro pores as well as high surface area on tb surface aromatic structure on tb surface and more oxygen functional groups on tb which offered surface ligand binding site additionally negative surface charge of tb electron rich surface prompted adsorption of cd ions at low ph 8 5 through π π electron donor acceptor interactions moreover ion exchange between cd ions and cations on tb surfaces ca2 mg2 also contributed to cd removal 100 engineered tea waste biochar high surface area 576 m2 g prepared by pyrolysis at 700 c using steam activation twbc sa reached maximum caffeine adsorption capacity of 15 4 mg g at ph 3 5 caffeine could be adsorbed onto twbc sa via i chemisorption as the dominant removal mechanism involving nucleophilic reaction between nitrogen atoms of the five membered ring of caffeine molecule and the carbonyl groups on the biochar surface under acidic condition ii formation of covalent bonds and electrostatic attraction and iii physisorption on the biochar surface via π π and hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups of biochar surface and heterocyclic group of caffeine molecule 101 the biochar bentonite composite was obtained by mixing bentonite suspension with msw 1 5 ratio w w and subsequent pyrolysis the maximum adsorption capacity of the composite was higher 190 mg g 40 higher than that of the pristine biochar it was ascribed to the generation of more active sites diffusion of ciprofloxacin cpx molecules into the interlayer space of the clay mineral via hydrogen bonding between oxygen containing functional group of cpx and free hydroxyl groups on the composite also responsible was enhanced electrostatic interactions between the functional groups of the composite and cpx molecules after modification 102 it was found that relatively higher pyrolysis temperature favored the generation of biochar with better characteristics from msw containing wood based products i e molded wood pallets sawmill cut ends plywood particle boards etc compared to pyrolysis temperature of 400 c 74 3 85 3 0 10 0 14 cm3 g and 215 0 359 84 m2 g biochar produced after pyrolysis at higher temperature of 600 c possessed more fixed carbon 81 4 94 0 higher micropore

from treated wood derived biochar most trace metals could be effectively eliminated by acid washing especially acetic acid favorable for dissolving minerals it also required more attention being paid to the management of some potential pollutants chlorine nitrogen and sulfur in the biochar 103 3 3 animal manure thermochemical liquefaction of pig or cattle manure generally uses ethanol as a solvent since ethanol provides active hydrogen to decompose biomass improve the stability of liquefaction intermediates and limit the formation of hardly decomposed compounds operational conditions and types of manure feedstocks affected the generation of bio oil during thermochemical liquefaction of pig manure the relatively lower liquefaction temperature of 220 c prompted maximum yield of bio oil 31 4 of liquefied products than those at higher liquefaction temperatures of 260 and 300 c this was due to the crude protein and lipid in pig manure raw material however during liquefaction of cattle manure fragmentation of polymers into liquid oil rich phase was enhanced at higher temperature 300 c with maximum bio oil ocm relative yield of around 32 and absolute yield of 23 kg kg compared to that at lower temperature 180 220 and 260 c furthermore the yield of bio oil was affected by solid liquid rate determined by the quantity of the manure sample and the volume of the liquid solvent and solvent filling rate the rate of the volume of the liquid solvent divided by the fixed volume of the reactor when using pig manure as feedstock the yield of bio oil declined at higher solid liquid rate proportions in liquefied products 35 56 at 5 vs 22 04 at 15 due to the weak interaction between solvent molecules and biomass molecules on the other hand the production rate of bio oil rapidly increased at higher solvent filling rate 10 15 the obtained bio oil had similar components from pig and cattle manures including esters long chain hydrocarbons ethanol and nitrogen compounds the heating values of bio oil derived from animal manure after thermochemical liquefaction were significantly higher than the manure feedstocks the heating value of pig manure liquefied bio oil 37 03 mj kg was close to the heating value of gasoline 46 mj kg meanwhile the higher and lower heating values of cattle manure liquefied bio oil 25 63 33 41 mj kg and 23 85 31 39 mj kg respectively vs 10 87 mj kg and 9 74 mj kg for cattle manure feedstock respectively strongly suggested their potential as alternative commercial fuels to fossil fuel energy 104 105 zhou et al 106 pointed out that compared to slow pyrolysis 400 600 c htc was a more effective way to convert animal manure to hydrochar since the htc process narrowed the weight loss temperature range for the animal manure when employing the htc process the hydrochar properties were affected by the types and nature of feedstocks the hhvs of different livestock and poultry manure increased after htc i e 15 18 mj kg of swine manure sm vs 16 14 mj kg of sm hydrochar 15 26 mj kg of dairy cattle manure dcm vs 18 43 mj kg of dcm hydrochar 13 72 mj kg of beef cattle manure bm vs 15 77 mj kg of bm hydrochar 12 77 mj kg of broiler litter bl vs 16 22 m kg of bl hydrochar and 14 27 mj kg of layer chicken litter ll to 18 05 mj kg of hydrochar at 210 c energy yields were the highest for biochars of sm bl and ll 65 5 56 9 and 64 4 respectively animal manure derived biochar can be employed for generating syngas the biocrude obtained from pyrolysis of dcm under co2 condition contained high levels of hetero hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds which were not suitable for liquid fuels in combustion engines hence dcm derived biochar was employed to transform biocrude to syngas during dcm pyrolysis with co2 serving as a gaseous medium at 600 c co formation was enhanced by gas phase homogeneous reactions between co2 and gas phase volatile compounds originating from dcm pyrolysis the gas phase reactions and chemical bond damage of biocrude induced by alkaline metal oxide s i e caco3 in biochar as catalyst 3 g l significantly enhanced h2 and co formation 5 fold compared to non catalyst pyrolysis 107 3 4 other applications of biochars during organic waste i e pig manure sawdust beer vinasse etc composting process biochar addition can increase pile porosity and improve oxygen permeability o2 supply which avoid anaerobic fermentation it can also improve organic matter degradation extend duration of thermophilic phase and increase composting temperature which enhance compositing efficiency and humidification process biochar addition encourages n mineralization and n retention which minimize the formation of large clumps it is possible to mitigate n2o emissions as the large amounts of aromatic compounds co bond ch bond in biochar contact with no3 n which encourage the formation of π π electron donor or acceptor interactions and further inhibit denitrification adding biochar can reduce ch4 emissions due to the formation of aerobic reaction survival and proliferation of methanotrophs caused by high pore volume and good pore structure of biochar biochar also can reduce odor emissions since nh4 n and nh3 are adsorbed by pores and surface acid groups of biochar and furthermore enhance enzymatic activities and degradation rate heavy metals are stabilized by surface and inner sphere precipitation and complexation as well as physical adsorption furthermore freely dissolved pahs are reduced 20 biochar can be also used for adsorption of air pollutants volatile organic compounds vocs via physical adsorption to carbonized fraction van der waals interactions π π electron donor acceptor interactions and pore filling processes and partitioning process involving partitioning into organic phase or to noncarbonized organic matter faction 89 108 109 biochar can also be used for ghg emissions co2 no2 ch4 and other gases i e so2 h2 h2s etc when adopting constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment biochar might improve nitrous oxide reductase activity adsorb nh4 n and no3 n to reduce n2o emissions from nitrification or denitrification and inhibit the activity of microorganisms responsible for nitrification and mineralization thereby reducing n2o emissions the reduction of co2 emissions after adding biochar might be induced by precipitating co2 with alkaline metals provided by biochar as carbonate adsorbing organic matter reducing some abundant carbohydrate mineralizing enzymes i e glucosidase celloboisidase and increasing plant growth for greater net exchange of co2 between environment and cws 21 biochar exerts positive effects on arid soils by 1 enhancing water retention capacity since biochar can retain water 2 improving nutrient holding potential given that biochar can keep n nutrients fertilizers 3 removing cations heavy metals from soil through carbon sorption 4 eliminating organics i e hydrocarbons pharmaceuticals through adsorption due to its high porosity large surface area and surface functional groups 5 increasing crop yields through improving irrigation conditions and soil quality increased n p k contents and solid organic carbon because biochar possesses some nutrients n p k ca and 6 stabilizing heavy metals this favors the increase in crop yield it is worth noting that soil microorganisms are positively affected by biochar addition through increasing water availability improving aeration condition removing toxic compounds by sorption neutralizing soil ph value retaining nutrient in soil and offering shelters nutrients and electron donors 17 20 as biochar possesses porous structure and large surface area it can provide electroactive sites to accumulate charges faradaic reaction which in turn realizes high capacitance i e capacitance of 344 f g and power density of 850 w kg for argy warm wood derived biochar 346 1 f g and 160 w kg for cotonier strobili fibers derived biochar 168 f g and 1500 w kg for fructose corn syrup derived biochar for these reasons biochar can be used as electrode materials in supercapacitors which are energy storage materials and employed in electronic devices automobiles air craft or locomotive systems 18 3 5 nutrient recovery sewage sludge is enriched with phosphorus total phosphorus 13 122 09 g kg in three different forms including inorganic phosphorus poly phosphate and organic phosphorus after thermochemical treatment phosphorus also exists in ash aluminum calcium phosphate ca9al po4 7 aluminum phosphate alpo4 iron phosphate fepo4 aqueous phase orthophosphate and biochar hydrochar hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3oh octacalcium phosphate ca8h2 po4 65h2o fepo4 mgpo4 mg2 po4 3 alpo4 110 besides animal manure and food waste also contain high levels of phosphorus total phosphorus up to 34 10 and 52 00 g kg respectively 111 thus phosphorus recovery from sewage sludge animal manure or food waste by thermochemical technologies is a promising way to deal with finite sources of natural phosphorus after htc process phosphorus is transformed into orthophosphate in liquid fraction insoluble precipitates in the hydrochar due to the reaction between metal elements i e ca k mg in the feedstock recovery 90 and phosphorus as well as adsorption via affinity of fe and al hydroxides with phosphorus 111 subsequently phosphorus recovery can be conducted via wet chemical extraction process from ash and hydrochar for example inorganic acids e g hydrochloric acid hcl sulfuric acid h2so4 nitric acid hno3 phosphoric acid h3po4 dissolve alkali metal oxides and induce phosphorus release on the other hand metals or metalloids and metal bound p are released in the presence of organic acids e g oxalic acid c2h6o6 citric acid c6h8o7 gluconic acid c6h12o7 formic acid ch2o2 acetic acid c2h4o2 through chelating effects alkaline extraction i e naoh can extract phosphorus from ash and hydrochar as well as inhibit the dissolution of heavy metals after coupling the wet extraction method and precipitation process with addition of precipitants i e cacl2 mgcl2 6h2o and or nh4 rich wastewater or thermochemical process water etc phosphorus can be significantly recovered close to 100 of phosphorus precipitation efficiency as alpo4 ca3 po4 2 fepo4 struvite hydroxyapatite and other products i e calcium phosphate chlorophosphate etc 112 chemical reagents i e cao acids etc can be also directly added during thermochemical conversion process to enhance nutrient recovery the direct addition of cao during hydrothermal treatment process can induce the formation of hydroxyapatite being abundant in nature p ores which is highly stable easily productive and biocompatible and has high potential in enhancing growth of plants 113 114 during the htc process the alkaline environment ph up to 8 58 induced by high htc temperature 200 c prompted the conversion of organic phosphorus op polyphosphate to inorganic phosphorus ip orthophosphate and favored the enrichment of apatite phosphorus ap in the hydrochars orthophosphate po4 3 reacted with al3 fe2 and mg2 from sludge feedstock to form fepo4 alpo4 and mg po4 2 after adding sufficient cao loading ratio of 4 some ca oh2 was formed leading to an alkaline solution then po4 3 was released from fepo4 alpo4 and mg po4 2 41 me po 4 n 3noh me oh 3n npo 4 3 me al fe mg some of the released po4 3 was used to form hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3oh 42 5ca 2 3po 4 3 oh ca 5 po 4 3 oh some organic phosphorus pyrophosphate was converted to ca2p2o7 2h2o thus non apatite inorganic phosphorus naip was almost completely transformed into ap as hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3oh and ca2p2o7 2h2o this significantly increased apatite phosphorus by 252 in hydrochars and p availability by 233 compared with that in hydrochar obtained via htc without cao addition 113 table 3 summarizes some typical thermochemical based nutrient recovery processes 4 future perspectives current studies have extended the applications of bes from nutrient removal recovery to biogas upgrade and removals of emerging pollutants and heavy metals from wastewater bes emg can convert co2 captured by or dissolved into wastewater to ch4 emerging pollutants are effectively removed either by bioanode in mfc or biocathode in mec due to the electrode enriched with special functional microbes which contribute to degradation of pollutants and enhanced electron transfer and generation the addition of some metals i e cu ii can enhance the electron transfer as electron shuttle mediators for removal of the target metals i e cr iv bes containing electrode rich in eab or srb also enhances heavy metal removal biowastes are converted to value added products including biochar hydrochar gas and bio oil through thermochemical processes furthermore these products properties are better than the feedstocks i e enhanced porosity surface area and heating value of biochar hydrochar increased bio oil yield etc subsequently products can be widely employed for environmental sustainability such as wastewater treatment soil amendment surrogate fuel and fossil energy however more studies are required to enhance the functioning of these technologies and properties of products as follows 1 in depth studies should concentrate on more possible pathways for conversion of co2 h2 and other gases to ch4 by bes 2 removal of a wider range of emerging pollutants in bes are needed to be investigated deeply comprehensively 3 more types of special functional microorganisms on electrodes should be explored and mechanisms about removing pollutants in the presence of these microbes must be clarified 4 more advanced thermochemical technologies can be devised to simplify the operational process and enhance the properties of products 5 wider range of biowastes should be employed for making high value added products 6 more studies need to explore applications of products obtained from thermochemical technologies 5 conclusions this review updated the studies published on the development and applications of bes in the treatment of wastewater containing nutrient emerging pollutants and heavy metals nitrogen is removed and recovered on anode and cathode while phosphorus recovery is mainly accomplished via chemical precipitation on the cathode the bioanode in mfc or biocathode in mec enriched with eab and or srb accelerates electron transfer and generation and further degradation of pollutants thermochemical technologies transform biowastes to value added products including biochar hydrochar gas and bio oil with better characteristics than feedstocks moreover the products can be widely applied in wastewater treatment and soil amendment as surrogate fuel and fossil energy for environmental sustainability some types of biowastes are also potential feedstocks for phosphorus recovery by thermochemical treatment future studies should concentrate on more types of special functional microbes on electrodes as well as preparation and

13074,the photochemical fate of various organic components of reclaimed water dom was comprehensively investigated using diverse spectroscopic characterization coupled with mathematical analysis methods findings show reclaimed water dom to be susceptible to solar irradiation induced photodegradation causing notable reduction of uv254 absorbance fluorescence intensity and average molecular weight of dom in reclaimed water a multiple exponential kinetic model for dom photodegradation demonstrates humic like constituents were more susceptive to solar irradiation whereas the protein like constituents showed tolerance fri analysis show photodegradation rate constants of dom factions under sunlight irradiation fall in the sequence of humic like fulvic like soluble microbial byproduct like tryptophan like tyrosine like fractions upon solar irradiation the photodegradation kinetics of three parafac extracted fluorophores varied in the order of microbial humic like terrestrial humic like tryptophan like components this order of fraction decrease is further evidenced by synchronous fluorescence spectra sfs integrated with 2dcos analysis different photoreactivities and photosensitivity to visible vis vis uva vis uva uvb by parafac derived components demonstrated that uv irradiation but not visible light drive dom photodegradation uvb and uva played predominant roles in the photodegradation of tryptophan like and terrestrial humic like constituents respectively the photodegradation of microbial humic like constituents was attributed to the combined actions of uvb and uva irradiation furthermore varied ros quenching enhancing experiments revealed that the photodegradation of tryptophan like components might be ascribed to indirect photolysis involving 3dom the photodegradation of terrestrial microbial humic like dom constituents was associated with direct photolysis the comprehensive illustration of sunlight irradiation induced photochemical transformation of dom in reclaimed water during storage contributes to understanding the fate of dom and associated environmental processes impacted by solar irradiation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords dissolved organic matter reclaimed water phototransformation solar irradiation 1 introduction increasing water scarcity has considerably stimulated the utilization of reclaimed municipal wastewater water reclamation is a practical strategy to mitigate water scarcity since wastewater is always a stable resource everywhere 1 however reclaimed water from wastewater treatment plants wwtps might not be adequately safe for most reuse purposes due to residual toxic pollutants 2 3 ecological storage e g lakes wetlands and ponds is a strategy broadly utilized for managing the demand for reclaimed municipal wastewater during its utilization 4 5 this approach is viewed as a favorable semi natural intermediary storage of reclaimed water prior to its reuse for residual pollutants decay 6 7 during storage the quality and standard of reclaimed water might be strongly influenced by microbial respiration and photochemical degradation processes occurring in aquatic ecosystems receiving the reclaimed water 8 12 therefore a comprehensive investigation into the variations in diverse organic materials components in reclaimed water during ecological storage is vital for its final utilization however currently relevant knowledge on the transformation of organic constituents in reclaimed water is lacking dissolved organic matter dom as a primary constituent of reclaimed municipal wastewater greatly influences the quality of reclaimed water 13 reclaimed water dom is reported to bring potential risks to human and ecological health associated with various trace organic micropollutants including pharmaceutically active compounds personal care products and endocrine disrupting compounds among others 14 16 moreover dom plays a crucial role in the mobility turnover and toxicity of various chemicals such as in organic micropollutants nanomaterials 17 18 consequently there is an urgent need to elucidate the transformation processes and associated mechanism of dom during the ecological storage of reclaimed water during storage photochemical transformation and microbial degradation could dominate the transformation of reclaimed water dom nonetheless photodegradation may exert a more significant effect on dom degradation than microbial degradation because of the relatively strong irradiation intensity at higher elevations also these compounds especially micropollutants are highly resistant to microbial degradation 19 20 therefore photolysis could alter its abundance and structure 21 which might eventually affect the transformations of key elements and water quality of reclaimed water 22 23 therefore it is urgently necessary to elucidate the dom photodegradation process and associated mechanisms during the storage of reclaimed water although previous studies have focused on photochemical processes of naturally occurring dom e g river water lake water soil macrophytes and seawater rather than reclaimed water dom 9 24 29 they still provide significant knowledge that is useful for this study in comparison to naturally occurring dom reclaimed water dom has different physicochemical properties and molecular composition 30 several studies have documented that naturally occurring dom and reclaimed water dom were derived from different origins 30 31 different origins cause significant differences in optical properties and chemical composition between naturally occurring dom and reclaimed water dom 32 consequently the differences in sources physicochemical properties and composition might alter their photoreactivity and photodegradation behaviors current methods used to characterize the dom properties and its turnover mainly include ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy 33 fluorescence spectroscopy 34 36 synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy sfs and fourier infrared spectrometer ftir 17 37 fluorescence techniques consist of excitation spectra emission spectra synchronous fluorescence spectra and fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem sfs immobilize wavelengths δλ between the excitation and the emission wavelengths thus avoiding the interference of rayleigh scattering in eem maps both excitation and emission signatures can be revealed enabling for fluorescence features of dom to be recorded by scanning across multiple wavelengths 37 eem and sfs have been widely used to identify the sources of dom and its biogeochemical processes due to their ease of use remarkable sensitivity and selectivity 22 35 38 however the acquired spectroscopic data on dom is frequently overlapped due to its complex nature and heterogeneity therefore it is usually difficult to obtain valuable information about the structural characteristics of dom from spectroscopic data 31 39 this condition suggests a great need for data analytic tools with which information can be extracted and datasets can be further explored in response to the above challenge chemometric methods have been gradually introduced into data processing including parallel factor parafac analysis which can be useful for interpreting raw eem data 10 13 17 32 35 40 41 also recent work has established that two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos could be applied to elucidate a battery of spectroscopic information on dom and reveal the specific order of any spectral signals under specific external perturbation via asynchronous spectra 31 34 39 it has been extensively utilized to decompose overlapping peaks by distributing spectral intensity along the second dimension 42 43 moreover considering the complex and heterogeneous nature of dom its photochemical transformation processes are likely intricate as a result the transformation of reclaimed water dom under solar irradiation and associated mechanisms has not been systematically and thoroughly understood in this case it is critical to understand the solar irradiation induced photochemical transformation of dom in reclaimed water during storage however to the best of our knowledge there have been limited investigations on the fate and transformation of dom in reclaimed water using spectroscopic characterization integrated with various mathematic analyses in this work the complementary application of spectroscopic analysis integrated with mathematical analysis i e eem fri parafac and 2dcos was employed to trace the fate or transformation of different organic constituents of reclaimed water dom under solar irradiation an enhanced and thorough insight into the photochemical behaviors of dom in reclaimed water is presented the study aims to 1 evaluate the transformation behavior and photolabilities of various organic dom components of reclaimed water under solar irradiation 2 distinguish the patterns of changes in various constituents of dom upon solar irradiation 3 elucidate the functions of intermediary reactive oxygen species ros and 3dom together with irradiation bands in the photodegradation of reclaimed water dom the findings will provide new spectroscopic insights into the sunlight induced photochemical processing of reclaimed water dom in response to solar irradiation during storage 2 materials and methods 2 1 reclaimed

wastewater treatment process and a membrane bioreactor mbr the reclaimed water samples were immediately filtered using a 0 45 μm filter for storage at 4 c prior to analyses the mbr effluents were discharged into a landscaping lake the reclaimed water stored in the lake was pumped to various locations for outdoor gardening and indoor toilet flushing a detailed system design of the wastewater treatment and reclamation plant and reclaimed water quality could be found in our previous publications 1 44 2 2 irradiation experiments to reveal the changes of dom in real world conditions quartz tubes containing 50 ml reclaimed water were put on the rooftop of the laboratory building for 12 h for natural solar irradiation exposure 7 30 a m to 7 30 p m at ambient temperatures 16 35 c on sunny days 4 49 table 1 presents the solar irradiation intensity at varying times during the whole natural sunlight exposure the natural solar irradiation experiments were conducted in duplicate water sample analyses for doc uv vis absorbance and fluorescent spectra were performed within 24 h when irradiation experiments were finished to further explore the photoreactivity and transformation characteristics of each fluorescent component in dom simulated solar irradiation experiments were performed using an xpa 7 photochemical reactor xujiang electromechanical plant china 2 31 a quartz tube was used as a water sample container cooled at 20 1 0 c using recirculating cooling water during the whole irradiation experiments 12 quartz tubes containing 50 ml of reclaimed water were exposed to 72 h of simulated sunlight irradiation provided by a 500 w xenon lamp equipped with a 290 nm cut off filter this lamp source was employed for all irradiation experiments unless otherwise indicated for uniform solar light irradiation the tubes were all placed in a merry go round holder rotating at 12 rpm at the same distance 9 5 mm and stirred by a magnetic agitator at 500 rpm at regular time intervals 2 ml water samples were collected from each tube for spectral analysis to elucidate the functions of intermediary ros and 3dom in the photodegradation of reclaimed water dom the variations in fluorescence intensities of fluorescent peaks extracted by parafac under various ros quenching enhancing conditions upon simulated solar irradiation was investigated according to previous studies 31 45 46 the role of ros and 3dom in dom photodegradation was explored using their corresponding quenchers isopropanol ipa 0 1 for oh nan3 10 mm for 1o2 and oh also the functions of 1o2 and 3dom were investigated via analysing the change of fluorescence intensities in deoxygenated solutions and oxygen saturated solutions furthermore the reclaimed water samples were exposed to the following irradiation treatments 1 visible vis uva uvb λ 290 nm simulated solar light 2 vis uva λ 320 nm excluding uvb 3 vis λ 420 nm excluding uva and uvb the three different irradiation treatments were accomplished by utilizing custom cutoff filters that could block specific wavelengths to determine which irradiation band contributed to the photodegradation of reclaimed water dom 2 3 spectral analysis the uv vis spectra of reclaimed water samples were analyzed at wavelengths ranging from 200 to 700 nm and intervals of 1 nm using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer tu1901 pgeneral china with a 0 01 m path length quartz cuvette 25 c 53 the reclaimed water fluorescence excitation and emission matrix eem spectra were obtained with a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer the scanning emission em spectra ranged from 220 to 550 nm at 1 nm increments that of the excitation ex wavelength ranged from 200 to 500 nm at 5 nm increments 25 also the synchronous fluorescence spectra sfs were scanned using the same f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer the excitation wavelengths varied from 200 to 550 nm at δλ 60 nm with a scan speed of 240 nm min 25 64 the water samples were freeze dried to obtain powder samples correspondingly subsequently a mixture of dom sample powder and potassium bromide kbr with a mass ratio of 1 100 was compressed under high pressure 4 t using steel dye to form a pellet the obtained pellet was used for ft ir measurements by nicolet is5 thermo company usa the scanning wavenumber ranged from 400 to 4000 cm 1 and the average scan was 32 at room temperature 31 2 4 mathematical analysis 2 4 1 fri analysis eems data were allocated to five independent regions i e i ii iii iv and v as per the classification as follows aromatic protein like fluorophores regions i and ii i e tyrosine and tryptophan fulvic acid like fluorophores region iii soluble microbial product like fluorophores region iv and humic acid like fluorophores region iv 47 2 4 2 parallel factor modelling the eem dataset obtained from all illuminated reclaimed water samples were modelled using parafac to statistically decompose eem spectra 35 data preprocessing before parafac modelling comprised 1 inner filter effect corrections 2 subtraction of blanks using milli q water 3 raman normalization using the raman peak of milli q water ex 350 nm em 371 428 nm 19 48 all data processing and calculations were carried out using matlab 2018a mathworks usa with the domflour toolbox 2 4 3 two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos was applied to explore phototransformation processes of dom during solar irradiation simulated solar irradiation time was set as an external perturbation based on the work of noda and ozaki 50 a series of time dependent sfs and ftir spectra were applied as original data for the 2dcos analysis using 2dcs professional software 51 52 2 5 kinetic model for dom photodegradation given the heterogeneous nature of dom multiple exponential decays rather than simple single first order decays were applied to evaluate the photodegradation kinetics for dom according to the previous reports 45 53 54 which can be expressed using the following equation 1 c t c 0 f 1 e k 1 t f 2 e k 2 t f 3 where ct is the fluorescence intensity of reclaimed water dom at time t a1 a2 and a3 represent the photolabile photodegradable and photoresistant constituents in dom respectively and k1 and k2 represented the kinetic rates of the fast photolabile p f1 and photodegradable f2 parts respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 photodegradation of chromophoric dom upon solar light irradiation the gradual decrease in doc concentration for illuminated dom samples from 6 71 to 6 36 mg c l during the natural solar irradiation fig s1 indicated sunlight induced photomineralization of dom in reclaimed water i e complete conversion to carbon dioxide or monoxide 55 dom photomineralization was regarded as one significant process governing the turnover of aquatic dom which could produce inorganic carbon e g co2 and co and nitrogen e g nh4 and no2 56 although no significant variation in the doc contents was observed high variability in the uv vis absorbance e 2 e 3 and s 275 295 was observed as illustrated in fig 1 the absorbance intensity for dom samples showed a continuous decline during the 72 h simulated light irradiation this decline indicated solar irradiation to be able to weaken the light absorption ability of dom in reclaimed water also photoirradiation of the reclaimed water caused the degradation of chromophoric dom cdom the differential absorbance spectra das were further applied to reveal significant details in the changes of cdom under sunlight irradiation considering the minimal changes in absorbance the results showed that the das significantly increased with the increasing illumination time interestingly the absorbance at uv240 nm recorded maximal losses in response to simulated solar irradiation nonetheless the attenuation behavior of uv240 nm fitted well to a multiple exponential decay model with offset four representative parameters uv254 suva254 e 2 e 3 and s 275 295 were also determined to indicate the impact of solar irradiation on the photophysical characteristics of dom in reclaimed water generally uv254 and suva254 show strong correlations with the aromaticity of dom 57 58 conversely e 2 e 3 and s 275 295 show negative correlations with the average molecular weight of dom 58 59 as illustrated in fig 1 both the aromaticity of dom and its molecular weight decreased during simulated solar irradiation specifically the uv254 and suva254 of dom showed a continuous reduction under 72 h simulated solar irradiation this reduction indicated the favorable photodegradation of aromatic chromophores and the production of nonultraviolet absorbing dom photoproducts meanwhile simulated solar irradiation led to the increase of e 2 e 3 and s 275 295 values at longer irradiation times which suggested reductions in the average molecular weight of dom as illustrated in fig s4 under natural solar irradiation the profiles of cdom uv absorbance uv254 e 2 e 3 and s 275 295 also exhibited similar trends this similarity further suggested that solar irradiation caused the attenuation of reclaimed water absorbance photodegradation of aromatic fractions in dom and a decrease in average molecular weight 32 33 57 3 2 characterization of fdom transformation using eem fri analysis eems for the reclaimed water samples were separated into five independent regions namely regions i v using fri analysis 3deem spectra for the original reclaimed water samples are shown in fig s6a as shown in fig s6b the fri analysis estimated that 27 2 of fdom were fulvic acid like materials 29 0 were soluble microbial byproduct like materials and 27 3 were humic acid like materials these findings indicate that fulvic like humic like and soluble microbial by product like materials were predominant reclaimed water constituents by contrast only 2 5 of fdom were composed of tyrosine like proteins and 14 1 were of tryptophan like proteins fig s7 shows variations in the 3deem fluorescence spectra for reclaimed water with simulated solar irradiation time in the present work the multiple exponential decays model was utilized to assess the photodegradation processes of fluorescent components although a battery of first order kinetics dom degradation models has been previously reported 25 49 as illustrated in figs 2 and 4 variations in the fluorescence intensity of fdom did not follow a simple single first order decay model corroborating the heterogeneous nature of dom 49 54 after 72 h simulated solar irradiation 60 82 4 78 of total fluorescence intensities decayed correspondingly 52 70 1 16 of ri 55 71 1 39 of rii 62 78 2 70 of riii 55 94 8 6817 of riv 67 94 4 31 of rv were decomposed in the reclaimed water dom moreover the photo degradable fraction of humic acid like materials was larger than those of protein like fulvic like and microbial by product like materials p 0 05 multiple exponential kinetic modelling of the photodegradation behavior of five fluorescent components identified by fri analysis is illustrated in fig 2 and table 2 photodegradation rates of the five fluorophores showed a good fitting to the multiple exponential decay model r2 0 97 as shown in table 2 under natural simulated solar light irradiation photodegradation rates for all five fluorescence components followed the same ranking order humic like materials fulvic like materials soluble microbial by products tryptophan like materials tyrosine like materials also the photodegradation rates showed positive correlations with the kinetic constants of each fluorescent component this finding was consistent with previous results that showed humic like materials to be highly photolabile 44 as shown in table 2 the degradation rate constants of the five fluorescent materials under natural solar irradiation were obtained from regression results the double exponential function model could separate the photodegradable dom and its fractions e g ri rii riii riv rv into photolabile f1 photodegradable f2 and photoresistant f3 fractions the fitting results confirmed that f1 and f2 were their dominant fractions 65 46 97 48 and the photodegradation rates constant of rv k1 and k2 0 404 was higher than those of ri rii riii riv these differences in the photodegradable portions and their rates for different dom components are likely due to its heterogeneous composition and complex source 3 3 photodegradation kinetics of parafac extracted fluorophores fri analysis could semi quantitatively characterize the composition and fate of dom however this analysis approach cannot adequately illustrate multi dimensional eem datasets because of overlapping and the multipeak response of diverse fluorophores 62 thus parafac modelling was carried out to enhance the discrimination of eem fluorophores by deconvoluting fluorescence eem spectra into several independent fluorophores 35 45 parafac modelling of the eem datasets of 126 dom samples was carried out and a three component model was successfully decomposed fig 3 shows the excitation and emission loadings of the three parafac derived components c1 was ascribed to tryptophan like components c2 was ascribed to microbial humic like components and c3 was ascribed to terrestrial humic like components by comparing their maximal wavelength positions with previous studies 22 34 45 49 63 as shown in fig 4 and table 3 the photodegradation profile of the three parafac derived fluorophores fitted well to the decay model the fluorescence intensities of the three fluorophores all continuously decreased in response to natural simulated solar irradiation specifically decreases in the fluorescence intensities of c2 was the most rapid followed by c3 and c1 suggesting the high photoreactivity of susceptible fluorophores might derive from microbial humic like compounds the proportion of photodegradable constituents i e f1 and f2 under natural solar irradiation were c1 76 78 c2 77 97 and c3 71 30 though the percent content of the photodegradable part f1 and f2 in c3 was much less than that in c1 table 3 the photodegradation rates of f1 and f2 in c3 were found to be faster relative to that in c1 as shown in table 3 under natural and simulated solar irradiation the photodegradation rate constant of the f2 proportion of the three fluorophores varied in the sequence k2 c2 k2 c3 k2 c1 however under natural solar irradiation the photodegradation rate constants of the f1 proportion k1 c2 k1 c3 k2 c1 presented a different ranking order k1 c2 k1 c1 k1 c3 with that under simulated solar irradiation although the photodegradation rate constants of the f1 proportion increased in the order of k1 c2 k1 c1 k1 c3 under simulated solar irradiation the percent content of the photodegradable part f1 and f2 79 39 in c3 was much higher than that in c1 f1 and f2 59 28 table 3 thus the three fluorescent components also followed the same photodegradation ranking sequence of k c2 k c3 k c1 these findings demonstrated the photodegradation kinetic rate constants of dom to be significantly influenced by its composition and structure 10 overall the photodegradation kinetic rate of a specific component was not only dependent on the photodegradation rate constants of the photodegradable portion i e f1 and f2 but also depended on its percent contents 3 4 sequential order of structural variation under simulated solar irradiation investigated by 2dcos 3 4 1 sfs 2dcos as shown in fig s10 sfs exhibited peaks at 200 250 250 300 300 350 and 350 nm these peaks were associated with tyrosine like tryptophan like and microbial humic like and terrestrial humic like materials respectively 25 31 42 64 as shown in fig s11 under simulated solar irradiation dom showed substantial photobleaching across the whole spectra the 72 h simulated solar irradiation decreased the intensity to 78 20 for terrestrial humic like and 81 83 for microbial humic like fluorophores table 4 by contrast at the same solar irradiation intensity fluorescence intensity decreases of 65 54 and 16 82 for tryptophan like and tyrosine like fluorophore respectively were recorded these findings further demonstrated the humic like constituents to be more photosensitive than protein like substances in response to solar irradiation the asynchronous map revealed sequential interrelationships among various spectral origins during solar irradiation 34 42 as illustrated in fig 5b one positive 330 370 and two negative 282 330 and 235 330 crosspeaks occurred on the asynchronous map indicating that the photodegradation followed the order 330 370 282 235 nm this finding demonstrated the photodegradation of fluorophores varied in the following ranking order microbial humic like terrestrial humic like tryptophan like tyrosine like fluorophores the order of fraction decrease corroborated the results of fri parafac and sfs and that of a previous study 31 3 4 2 ftir 2dcos variations in the functional groups of illuminated dom samples were explored using ftir integrated with 2dcos analysis fig 6 three autopeaks occurred on the synchronous map which were positioned at 1640 1390 and 1140 cm 1 the band at 1390 cm 1 changed most significantly whereas only small changes were identified at 1640 and 1140 cm 1 the band at 1640 cm 1 was related to the co of amide in proteins 31 that at 1390 cm 1 could be ascribed to oh deformation of phenolic hydroxyl groups whereas 1140 cm 1 could relate to either po in nucleic acids or coc in polysaccharides 31 42 the positive cross peaks all indicated that protein phenol and nucleic acids polysaccharides decreased simultaneously under solar irradiation and that there was no transformation of functional groups observed the asynchronous map for dom exhibited five negative cross peaks at 1690 1390 1690 1140 1455 1390 1455 1140 1348 1140 cm 1 and four positive cross peaks at 1640 1348 1390 1348 1390 1140 1390 870 cm 1 table 5 shows characteristic features of the bands and cross peaks according to the noda rule the functional groups photodegraded preferentially under simulated solar irradiation in the following order 1390 cm 1 1140 cm 1 1455 cm 1 870 cm 1 1640 cm 1 1690 cm 1 1348 cm 1 therefore the ordering of functional groups during the photochemical processing of reclaimed water dom under sunlight irradiation could be confirmed as follows coo unsymmetrical stretching or co stretching of phenolic oh po or coc in polysaccharides ch2 slashing or ch3 distortion in aliphatic substances ch bonding in aromatic structures co stretching of amide in proteins co stretching of cooh or ketones oh in plane bending of polysaccharide groups the aromatic groups govern the light absorbing ability of reclaimed water dom the continuous reduction of suva254 with increasing irradiation time suggested the decrease of dom aromaticity and photodegradation of conjugated benzene rings fig 1 the photodegradation of aromatic rings were mainly associated with the photodegradation of humic like substances since the aromatic rings mainly derived from humic like compounds the abundant carboxylic groups in dom were sensitive to solar irradiation generally the photomineralization of carboxylic groups could produce inorganic carbon or they could be transformed to less reactive groups including ester as illustrated in fig s3 there was no significant variation in the doc contents during the irradiation experiments suggesting that the carboxylic groups were not continuously photomineralized to inorganic carbon the phenols and quinones could be regarded as the main groups responsible for the absorption of dom above 350 nm which were mainly presented in humic like compounds consequently the photodegradation of phenols and quinones in humic compounds could result in the loss of the dom absorption above 350 nm the preferential photodegradation of microbial and terrestrial humic like components and their associated groups such as aromatic carboxylic phenolic and quinonoid groups will be expected to weaken the influence of dom on the mobility and fates of diverse pollutants in reclaimed waters during storage 3 5 insights into the photodegradation mechanisms the phototransformation kinetics of dom under different irradiation treatments including simulated sunlight i e vis uva uvb and specific light bands i e vis vis uva were investigated to determine the effects of specific irradiation wavelengths on the photodegradation of three parafc extracted fluorophores as illustrated in fig 7a visible light 420 nm irradiation scarcely affected the phototransformation rate of tryptophan like components in dom indicating that visible light is trivial for tryptophan like fluorescence loss in addition uva vis light 320 nm irradiation merely made a limited contribution to tryptophan like fluorescence attenuation causing tryptophan like fluorescence to decrease by circa 5 for 72 h irradiation by contrast under 72 h vis uva uvb light 290 nm irradiation nearly 50 of tryptophan like compounds were degraded in conclusion uvb irradiation was likely to play the predominant role in the degradation of tryptophan like compounds as shown in fig 3a the tryptophan like component had an excitation bank at 240 nm and a wide excitation peak centered at 280 nm thus the tryptophan like component was likely more susceptible to photodegradation under uvb light irradiation since the peak excitation band for tryptophan like fluorophore occurred at 240 320 nm 22 upon visible light irradiation the fluorescence of the microbial humic like compounds remained unchanged similar to tryptophan like peaks however microbial humic like compounds were reduced by 48 7 after 72 h vis uva light irradiation meanwhile vis uva uvb light irradiation yielded a total contribution of 75 3 to microbial humic like compounds degradation under 72 h vis uva uvb light irradiation therefore the photodegradation rates of the microbial humic like compound were markedly enhanced under vis light uva uvb irradiation because uvb light was present based on this result it is postulated that both uva and uvb light irradiation play important roles in microbial humic like compounds degradation the peak and spectral loadings for microbial humic like compounds are shown in fig 3 the excitation peaks for microbial humic like compounds occurred at 330 nm and 245 nm the wavelength positions of these two excitation peaks suggested that the microbial humic like component could absorb light from the uvc uvb and uva regions 22 nonetheless uvc is unlikely to lead to its photodegradation because of the absence of uvc in xenon lamps with filters therefore the microbial humic like compound was susceptible to uvb and uva irradiation induced photodegradation as shown in fig 7c after 30 h visible light irradiation the removal efficiency of terrestrial humic like compounds in the reclaimed water samples reached 11 8 and then remained unchanged from 30 h to 72 h this confirms the limited role of visible light irradiation in terrestrial humic like compounds degradation however the terrestrial humic like compound exhibited more obvious degradation than tryptophan like and microbial humic like compounds under visible light irradiation interestingly under the action of vis uva and vis uva uvb light irradiation the terrestrial humic like components were reduced by 58 1 and 66 9 respectively the photodegradation behavior of terrestrial humic like fluorophores under vis uva irradiation presented a considerable similarity with that under vis uva uvb light irradiation this similarity indicated that uva light irradiation played a crucial role in the degradation of terrestrial humic like components while uvb light irradiation was helpful to degrade the terrestrial humic like component to a certain extent the terrestrial humic like component had two excitation peaks at 260 nm and 360 nm which were characterized by considerable uvc and uva light absorption however its absorption band extended only slightly into the uvb light region in this case terrestrial humic like fluorophore was most easily photolyzed under uva light irradiation however uvb light could promote its photodegradation to a certain extent since the peak absorption wavelength for terrestrial humic like fluorophores is mainly found in the uva region and the secondary excitation band extended only slightly into the uvb region the photosensitivity of the three parafac derived components to simulated and specific light bands might also be associated with observed changes in the optical indices derived from uv vis and fluorescence spectra as illustrated in fig 7 under simulated solar irradiation the uv254 continuously decreased with increasing illumination time however visible light irradiation treatment scarcely affected the uv254 during the irradiation processes suggesting that the degradation of aromatic fractions of dom was likely due to uva and uvb irradiation rather than visible light meanwhile vis uva uvb irradiation significantly increased the e 2 e 3 and s 275 295 p 0 05 while vis and vis uva irradiation only had limited influence on the increase of e 2 e 3 and s 275 295 therefore uvb irradiation might play a predominant role in converting high molecular weight dom into that of relatively low molecular weight the fi gradually decreased with increasing illumination time but increased under irradiation treatments with vis uva and vis uva uvb indicating enrichment of terrestrial dom 65 interestingly hix exhibited a similar trend with fi which was a proxy of humic contents of dom irradiation treatments with vis uva and vis uva uvb decreased the hix in a similar pattern to that of uv254 providing additional confirmation of the decrease of dom aromaticity under sunlight irradiation 65 the photodegradation behavior of the three parafac derived components was also explored under various ros quenching enhancing conditions to assess the role of produced ros and 3dom in dom degradation 31 45 66 as illustrated in fig 8a adding nan3 and isopropanol scarcely affected the photodegradation kinetics of the tryptophan like component calculated from the k1 and k2 values indicating a trivial role of 1o2 and oh nitrogen purging experimentations were carried out to explore the role of 3dom in the degradation of the parafac derived fluorophore further n2 saturation markedly promoted the photodegradation rate of the tryptophan like component by approximately 1 5 fold or 4 fold calculated from the k1 and k2 values respectively it is well known that oxygen is a triplet excited state quencher which could suppress 3dom formation 66 removal of the o2 elevated the 3dom concentration but decreased concentrations of 1o2 66 n2 saturation accelerated the degradation of the tryptophan like peak indicating 3dom might play a dominant role in the photodegradation processes of tryptophan like fluorophores according to previous studies electron transfer or hydrogen atom abstraction between 3dom and tryptophan like components caused the tryptophan photodegradation 67 the photodegradation of microbial and terrestrial humic like fluorophores under diverse ros quenching enhancing environments fitted well to the multiple exponential decay model with offset presenting similar photodegradation profiles with the tryptophan like fluorophore moreover as illustrated in fig 8b and c the photodegradation characteristics of microbial humic like fluorophores significantly resemble that for the terrestrial humic like fluorophores p 0 05 meanwhile various ros quenching enhancing conditions caused no observable enhancement inhibition of photodegradation rate constants this indicated the minimal role of ros and 3dom in the photodegradation of the humic like component this phenomenon suggested that the humic like component was likely photodegraded via direct photolysis rather than the involvement of ros 3dom in indirect photolysis this finding corroborates previous results of the direct photolysis of humic like components under simulated solar irradiation 31 45 4 conclusions a comprehensive evaluation of the photochemical processing of reclaimed water dom under natural and simulated solar irradiation is presented based on diverse spectroscopic characterization strategies integrated with various mathematical analysis methods the findings indicate varying photoabilities of different dom components in the following ranking order microbial humic like terrestrial humic like tryptophan like components furthermore 3dom demonstrated a major contribution to the photodegradation of tryptophan like components whereas the photodegradation of microbial and terrestrial humic like components was likely related to direct photolysis moreover the uv bands rather than visible light predominantly drive the sunlight induced dom transformation with visible light irradiation contributing marginally to the dom photodegradation overall the tryptophan like component was likely more susceptible to uvb irradiation induced photodegradation while the terrestrial humic like fluorophore was most easily photolyzed under uva light irradiation by contrast the microbial humic like compound was susceptible to both uvb and uva irradiation induced photodegradation these findings elucidate the photochemical reaction characteristics and mechanisms of dom in reclaimed water under solar irradiation the comprehensive and in depth insight into the degradation profiles of various components of dom under solar irradiation significantly improves understanding of the photochemical fate and transformation of dom in reclaimed water during storage also the findings could be useful when assessing the impact of dom photodegradation on the environmental implications of dom declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

13074,the photochemical fate of various organic components of reclaimed water dom was comprehensively investigated using diverse spectroscopic characterization coupled with mathematical analysis methods findings show reclaimed water dom to be susceptible to solar irradiation induced photodegradation causing notable reduction of uv254 absorbance fluorescence intensity and average molecular weight of dom in reclaimed water a multiple exponential kinetic model for dom photodegradation demonstrates humic like constituents were more susceptive to solar irradiation whereas the protein like constituents showed tolerance fri analysis show photodegradation rate constants of dom factions under sunlight irradiation fall in the sequence of humic like fulvic like soluble microbial byproduct like tryptophan like tyrosine like fractions upon solar irradiation the photodegradation kinetics of three parafac extracted fluorophores varied in the order of microbial humic like terrestrial humic like tryptophan like components this order of fraction decrease is further evidenced by synchronous fluorescence spectra sfs integrated with 2dcos analysis different photoreactivities and photosensitivity to visible vis vis uva vis uva uvb by parafac derived components demonstrated that uv irradiation but not visible light drive dom photodegradation uvb and uva played predominant roles in the photodegradation of tryptophan like and terrestrial humic like constituents respectively the photodegradation of microbial humic like constituents was attributed to the combined actions of uvb and uva irradiation furthermore varied ros quenching enhancing experiments revealed that the photodegradation of tryptophan like components might be ascribed to indirect photolysis involving 3dom the photodegradation of terrestrial microbial humic like dom constituents was associated with direct photolysis the comprehensive illustration of sunlight irradiation induced photochemical transformation of dom in reclaimed water during storage contributes to understanding the fate of dom and associated environmental processes impacted by solar irradiation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords dissolved organic matter reclaimed water phototransformation solar irradiation 1 introduction increasing water scarcity has considerably stimulated the utilization of reclaimed municipal wastewater water reclamation is a practical strategy to mitigate water scarcity since wastewater is always a stable resource everywhere 1 however reclaimed water from wastewater treatment plants wwtps might not be adequately safe for most reuse purposes due to residual toxic pollutants 2 3 ecological storage e g lakes wetlands and ponds is a strategy broadly utilized for managing the demand for reclaimed municipal wastewater during its utilization 4 5 this approach is viewed as a favorable semi natural intermediary storage of reclaimed water prior to its reuse for residual pollutants decay 6 7 during storage the quality and standard of reclaimed water might be strongly influenced by microbial respiration and photochemical degradation processes occurring in aquatic ecosystems receiving the reclaimed water 8 12 therefore a comprehensive investigation into the variations in diverse organic materials components in reclaimed water during ecological storage is vital for its final utilization however currently relevant knowledge on the transformation of organic constituents in reclaimed water is lacking dissolved organic matter dom as a primary constituent of reclaimed municipal wastewater greatly influences the quality of reclaimed water 13 reclaimed water dom is reported to bring potential risks to human and ecological health associated with various trace organic micropollutants including pharmaceutically active compounds personal care products and endocrine disrupting compounds among others 14 16 moreover dom plays a crucial role in the mobility turnover and toxicity of various chemicals such as in organic micropollutants nanomaterials 17 18 consequently there is an urgent need to elucidate the transformation processes and associated mechanism of dom during the ecological storage of reclaimed water during storage photochemical transformation and microbial degradation could dominate the transformation of reclaimed water dom nonetheless photodegradation may exert a more significant effect on dom degradation than microbial degradation because of the relatively strong irradiation intensity at higher elevations also these compounds especially micropollutants are highly resistant to microbial degradation 19 20 therefore photolysis could alter its abundance and structure 21 which might eventually affect the transformations of key elements and water quality of reclaimed water 22 23 therefore it is urgently necessary to elucidate the dom photodegradation process and associated mechanisms during the storage of reclaimed water although previous studies have focused on photochemical processes of naturally occurring dom e g river water lake water soil macrophytes and seawater rather than reclaimed water dom 9 24 29 they still provide significant knowledge that is useful for this study in comparison to naturally occurring dom reclaimed water dom has different physicochemical properties and molecular composition 30 several studies have documented that naturally occurring dom and reclaimed water dom were derived from different origins 30 31 different origins cause significant differences in optical properties and chemical composition between naturally occurring dom and reclaimed water dom 32 consequently the differences in sources physicochemical properties and composition might alter their photoreactivity and photodegradation behaviors current methods used to characterize the dom properties and its turnover mainly include ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy 33 fluorescence spectroscopy 34 36 synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy sfs and fourier infrared spectrometer ftir 17 37 fluorescence techniques consist of excitation spectra emission spectra synchronous fluorescence spectra and fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem sfs immobilize wavelengths δλ between the excitation and the emission wavelengths thus avoiding the interference of rayleigh scattering in eem maps both excitation and emission signatures can be revealed enabling for fluorescence features of dom to be recorded by scanning across multiple wavelengths 37 eem and sfs have been widely used to identify the sources of dom and its biogeochemical processes due to their ease of use remarkable sensitivity and selectivity 22 35 38 however the acquired spectroscopic data on dom is frequently overlapped due to its complex nature and heterogeneity therefore it is usually difficult to obtain valuable information about the structural characteristics of dom from spectroscopic data 31 39 this condition suggests a great need for data analytic tools with which information can be extracted and datasets can be further explored in response to the above challenge chemometric methods have been gradually introduced into data processing including parallel factor parafac analysis which can be useful for interpreting raw eem data 10 13 17 32 35 40 41 also recent work has established that two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos could be applied to elucidate a battery of spectroscopic information on dom and reveal the specific order of any spectral signals under specific external perturbation via asynchronous spectra 31 34 39 it has been extensively utilized to decompose overlapping peaks by distributing spectral intensity along the second dimension 42 43 moreover considering the complex and heterogeneous nature of dom its photochemical transformation processes are likely intricate as a result the transformation of reclaimed water dom under solar irradiation and associated mechanisms has not been systematically and thoroughly understood in this case it is critical to understand the solar irradiation induced photochemical transformation of dom in reclaimed water during storage however to the best of our knowledge there have been limited investigations on the fate and transformation of dom in reclaimed water using spectroscopic characterization integrated with various mathematic analyses in this work the complementary application of spectroscopic analysis integrated with mathematical analysis i e eem fri parafac and 2dcos was employed to trace the fate or transformation of different organic constituents of reclaimed water dom under solar irradiation an enhanced and thorough insight into the photochemical behaviors of dom in reclaimed water is presented the study aims to 1 evaluate the transformation behavior and photolabilities of various organic dom components of reclaimed water under solar irradiation 2 distinguish the patterns of changes in various constituents of dom upon solar irradiation 3 elucidate the functions of intermediary reactive oxygen species ros and 3dom together with irradiation bands in the photodegradation of reclaimed water dom the findings will provide new spectroscopic insights into the sunlight induced photochemical processing of reclaimed water dom in response to solar irradiation during storage 2 materials and methods 2 1 reclaimed water sampling and processing reclaimed water rw was sampled from a wastewater reclamation plant in xi an china 34 14 03 n 109 04 09 e the reclamation plant is composed of an anaerobic anoxic oxic wastewater treatment process and a membrane bioreactor mbr the reclaimed water samples were immediately filtered using a 0 45 μm filter for storage at 4 c prior to analyses the mbr effluents were discharged into a landscaping lake the reclaimed water stored in the lake was pumped to various locations for outdoor gardening and indoor toilet flushing a detailed system design of the wastewater treatment and reclamation plant and reclaimed water quality could be found in our previous publications 1 44 2 2 irradiation experiments to reveal the changes of dom in real world conditions quartz tubes containing 50 ml reclaimed water were put on the rooftop of the laboratory building for 12 h for natural solar irradiation exposure 7 30 a m to 7 30 p m at ambient temperatures 16 35 c on sunny days 4 49 table 1 presents the solar irradiation intensity at varying times during the whole natural sunlight exposure the natural solar irradiation experiments were conducted in duplicate water sample analyses for doc uv vis absorbance and fluorescent spectra were performed within 24 h when irradiation experiments were finished to further explore the photoreactivity and transformation characteristics of each fluorescent component in dom simulated solar irradiation experiments were performed using an xpa 7 photochemical reactor xujiang electromechanical plant china 2 31 a quartz tube was used as a water sample container cooled at 20 1 0 c using recirculating cooling water during the whole irradiation experiments 12 quartz tubes containing 50 ml of reclaimed water were exposed to 72 h of simulated sunlight irradiation provided by a 500 w xenon lamp equipped with a 290 nm cut off filter this lamp source was employed for all irradiation experiments unless otherwise indicated for uniform solar light irradiation the tubes were all placed in a merry go round holder rotating at 12 rpm at the same distance 9 5 mm and stirred by a magnetic agitator at 500 rpm at regular time intervals 2 ml water samples were collected from each tube for spectral analysis to elucidate the functions of intermediary ros and 3dom in the photodegradation of reclaimed water dom the variations in fluorescence intensities of fluorescent peaks extracted by parafac under various ros quenching enhancing conditions upon simulated solar irradiation was investigated according to previous studies 31 45 46 the role of ros and 3dom in dom photodegradation was explored using their corresponding quenchers isopropanol ipa 0 1 for oh nan3 10 mm for 1o2 and oh also the functions of 1o2 and 3dom were investigated via analysing the change of fluorescence intensities in deoxygenated solutions and oxygen saturated solutions furthermore the reclaimed water samples were exposed to the following irradiation treatments 1 visible vis uva uvb λ 290 nm simulated solar light 2 vis uva λ 320 nm excluding uvb 3 vis λ 420 nm excluding uva and uvb the three different irradiation treatments were accomplished by utilizing custom cutoff filters that could block specific wavelengths to determine which irradiation band contributed to the photodegradation of reclaimed water dom 2 3 spectral analysis the uv vis spectra of reclaimed water samples were analyzed at wavelengths ranging from 200 to 700 nm and intervals of 1 nm using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer tu1901 pgeneral china with a 0 01 m path length quartz cuvette 25 c 53 the reclaimed water fluorescence excitation and emission matrix eem spectra were obtained with a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer the scanning emission em spectra ranged from 220 to 550 nm at 1 nm increments that of the excitation ex wavelength ranged from 200 to 500 nm at 5 nm increments 25 also the synchronous fluorescence spectra sfs were scanned using the same f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer the excitation wavelengths varied from 200 to 550 nm at δλ 60 nm with a scan speed of 240 nm min 25 64 the water samples were freeze dried to obtain powder samples correspondingly subsequently a mixture of dom sample powder and potassium bromide kbr with a mass ratio of 1 100 was compressed under high pressure 4 t using steel dye to form a pellet the obtained pellet was used for ft ir measurements by nicolet is5 thermo company usa the scanning wavenumber ranged from 400 to 4000 cm 1 and the average scan was 32 at room temperature 31 2 4 mathematical analysis 2 4 1 fri analysis eems data were allocated to five independent regions i e i ii iii iv and v as per the classification as follows aromatic protein like fluorophores regions i and ii i e tyrosine and tryptophan fulvic acid like fluorophores region iii soluble microbial product like fluorophores region iv and humic acid like fluorophores region iv 47 2 4 2 parallel factor modelling the eem dataset obtained from all illuminated reclaimed water samples were modelled using parafac to statistically decompose eem spectra 35 data preprocessing before parafac modelling comprised 1 inner filter effect corrections 2 subtraction of blanks using milli q water 3 raman normalization using the raman peak of milli q water ex 350 nm em 371 428 nm 19 48 all data processing and calculations were carried out using matlab 2018a mathworks usa with the domflour toolbox 2 4 3 two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos was applied to explore phototransformation processes of dom during solar irradiation simulated solar irradiation time was set as an external perturbation based on the work of noda and ozaki 50 a series of time dependent sfs and ftir spectra were applied as original data for the 2dcos analysis using 2dcs professional software 51 52 2 5 kinetic model for dom photodegradation given the heterogeneous nature of dom multiple exponential decays rather than simple single first order decays were applied to evaluate the photodegradation kinetics for dom according to the previous reports 45 53 54 which can be expressed using the following equation 1 c t c 0 f 1 e k 1 t f 2 e k 2 t f 3 where ct is the fluorescence intensity of reclaimed water dom at time t a1 a2 and a3 represent the photolabile photodegradable and photoresistant constituents in dom respectively and k1 and k2 represented the kinetic rates of the fast photolabile p f1 and photodegradable f2 parts respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 photodegradation of chromophoric dom upon solar light irradiation the gradual decrease in doc concentration for illuminated dom samples from 6 71 to 6 36 mg c l during the natural solar irradiation fig s1 indicated sunlight induced photomineralization of dom in reclaimed water i e complete conversion to carbon dioxide or monoxide 55 dom photomineralization was regarded as one significant process governing the turnover of aquatic dom which could produce inorganic carbon e g co2 and co and nitrogen e g nh4 and no2 56 although no significant variation in the doc contents was observed high variability in the uv vis absorbance e 2 e 3 and s 275 295 was observed as illustrated in fig 1 the absorbance intensity for dom samples showed a continuous decline during the 72 h simulated light irradiation this decline indicated solar irradiation to be able to weaken the light absorption ability of dom in reclaimed water also photoirradiation of the reclaimed water caused the degradation of chromophoric dom cdom the differential absorbance spectra das were further applied to reveal significant details in the changes of cdom under sunlight irradiation considering the minimal changes in absorbance the results showed that the das significantly increased with the increasing illumination time interestingly the absorbance at uv240 nm recorded maximal losses in response to simulated solar irradiation nonetheless the attenuation behavior of uv240 nm fitted well to a multiple exponential decay model with offset four representative parameters uv254 suva254 e 2 e 3 and s 275 295 were also determined to indicate the impact of solar irradiation on the photophysical characteristics of dom in reclaimed water generally uv254 and suva254 show strong correlations with the aromaticity of dom 57 58 conversely e 2 e 3 and s 275 295 show negative correlations with the average molecular weight of dom 58 59 as illustrated in fig 1 both the aromaticity of dom and its molecular weight decreased during simulated solar irradiation specifically the uv254 and suva254 of dom showed a continuous reduction under 72 h simulated solar irradiation this reduction indicated the favorable photodegradation of aromatic chromophores and the production of nonultraviolet absorbing dom photoproducts meanwhile simulated solar irradiation led to the increase of e 2 e 3 and s 275 295 values at longer irradiation times which suggested reductions in the average molecular weight of dom as illustrated in fig s4 under natural solar irradiation the profiles of cdom uv absorbance uv254 e 2 e 3 and s 275 295 also exhibited similar trends this similarity further suggested that solar irradiation caused the attenuation of reclaimed water absorbance photodegradation of aromatic fractions in dom and a decrease in average molecular weight 32 33 57 3 2 characterization of fdom transformation using eem fri analysis eems for the reclaimed water samples were separated into five independent regions namely regions i v using fri analysis 3deem spectra for the original reclaimed water samples are shown in fig s6a as shown in fig s6b the fri analysis estimated that 27 2 of fdom were fulvic acid like materials 29 0 were soluble microbial byproduct like materials and 27 3 were humic acid like materials these findings indicate that fulvic like humic like and soluble microbial by product like materials were predominant reclaimed water constituents by contrast only 2 5 of fdom were composed of tyrosine like proteins and 14 1 were of tryptophan like proteins fig s7 shows variations in the 3deem fluorescence spectra for reclaimed water with simulated solar irradiation time in the present work the multiple exponential decays model was utilized to assess the photodegradation processes of fluorescent components although a battery of first order kinetics dom degradation models has been previously reported 25 49 as illustrated in figs 2 and 4 variations in the fluorescence intensity of fdom did not follow a simple single first order decay model corroborating the heterogeneous nature of dom 49 54 after 72 h simulated solar irradiation 60 82 4 78 of total fluorescence intensities decayed correspondingly 52 70 1 16 of ri 55 71 1 39 of rii 62 78 2 70 of riii 55 94 8 6817 of riv 67 94 4 31 of rv were decomposed in the reclaimed water dom moreover the photo degradable fraction of humic acid like materials was larger than those of protein like fulvic like and microbial by product like materials p 0 05 multiple exponential kinetic modelling of the photodegradation behavior of five fluorescent components identified by fri analysis is illustrated in fig 2 and table 2 photodegradation rates of the five fluorophores showed a good fitting to the multiple exponential decay model r2 0 97 as shown in table 2 under natural simulated solar light irradiation photodegradation rates for all five fluorescence components followed the same ranking order humic like materials fulvic like materials soluble microbial by products tryptophan like materials tyrosine like materials also the photodegradation rates showed positive correlations with the kinetic constants of each fluorescent component this finding was consistent with previous results that showed humic like materials to be highly photolabile 44 as shown in table 2 the degradation rate constants of the five fluorescent materials under natural solar irradiation were obtained from regression results the double exponential function model could separate the photodegradable dom and its fractions e g ri rii riii riv rv into photolabile f1 photodegradable f2 and photoresistant f3 fractions the fitting results confirmed that f1 and f2 were their dominant fractions 65 46 97 48 and the photodegradation rates constant of rv k1 and k2 0 404 was higher than those of ri rii riii riv these differences in the photodegradable portions and their rates for different dom components are likely due to its heterogeneous composition and complex source 3 3 photodegradation kinetics of parafac extracted fluorophores fri analysis could semi quantitatively characterize the composition and fate of dom however this analysis approach cannot adequately illustrate multi dimensional eem datasets because of overlapping and the multipeak response of diverse fluorophores 62 thus parafac modelling was carried out to enhance the discrimination of eem fluorophores by deconvoluting fluorescence eem spectra into several independent fluorophores 35 45 parafac modelling of the eem datasets of 126 dom samples was carried out and a three component model was successfully decomposed fig 3 shows the excitation and emission loadings of the three parafac derived components c1 was ascribed to tryptophan like components c2 was ascribed to microbial humic like components and c3 was ascribed to terrestrial humic like components by comparing their maximal wavelength positions with previous studies 22 34 45 49 63 as shown in fig 4 and table 3 the photodegradation profile of the three parafac derived fluorophores fitted well to the decay model the fluorescence intensities of the three fluorophores all continuously decreased in response to natural simulated solar irradiation specifically decreases in the fluorescence intensities of c2 was the most rapid followed by c3 and c1 suggesting the high photoreactivity of susceptible fluorophores might derive from microbial humic like compounds the proportion of photodegradable constituents i e f1 and f2 under natural solar irradiation were c1 76 78 c2 77 97 and c3 71 30 though the percent content of the photodegradable part f1 and f2 in c3 was much less than that in c1 table 3 the photodegradation rates of f1 and f2 in c3 were found to be faster relative to that in c1 as shown in table 3 under natural and simulated solar irradiation the photodegradation rate constant of the f2 proportion of the three fluorophores varied in the sequence k2 c2 k2 c3 k2 c1 however under natural solar irradiation the photodegradation rate constants of the f1 proportion k1 c2 k1 c3 k2 c1 presented a different ranking order k1 c2 k1 c1 k1 c3 with that under simulated solar irradiation although the photodegradation rate constants of the f1 proportion increased in the order of k1 c2 k1 c1 k1 c3 under simulated solar irradiation the percent content of the photodegradable part f1 and f2 79 39 in c3 was much higher than that in c1 f1 and f2 59 28 table 3 thus the three fluorescent components also followed the same photodegradation ranking sequence of k c2 k c3 k c1 these findings demonstrated the photodegradation kinetic rate constants of dom to be significantly influenced by its composition and structure 10 overall the photodegradation kinetic rate of a specific component was not only dependent on the photodegradation rate constants of the photodegradable portion i e f1 and f2 but also depended on its percent contents 3 4 sequential order of structural variation under simulated solar irradiation investigated by 2dcos 3 4 1 sfs 2dcos as shown in fig s10 sfs exhibited peaks at 200 250 250 300 300 350 and 350 nm these peaks were associated with tyrosine like tryptophan like and microbial humic like and terrestrial humic like materials respectively 25 31 42 64 as shown in fig s11 under simulated solar irradiation dom showed substantial photobleaching across the whole spectra the 72 h simulated solar irradiation decreased the intensity to 78 20 for terrestrial humic like and 81 83 for microbial humic like fluorophores table 4 by contrast at the same solar irradiation intensity fluorescence intensity decreases of 65 54 and 16 82 for tryptophan like and tyrosine like fluorophore respectively were recorded these findings further demonstrated the humic like constituents to be more photosensitive than protein like substances in response to solar irradiation the asynchronous map revealed sequential interrelationships among various spectral origins during solar irradiation 34 42 as illustrated in fig 5b one positive 330 370 and two negative 282 330 and 235 330 crosspeaks occurred on the asynchronous map indicating that the photodegradation followed the order 330 370 282 235 nm this finding demonstrated the photodegradation of fluorophores varied in the following ranking order microbial humic like terrestrial humic like tryptophan like tyrosine like fluorophores the order of fraction decrease corroborated the results of fri parafac and sfs and that of a previous study 31 3 4 2 ftir 2dcos variations in the functional groups of illuminated dom samples were explored using ftir integrated with 2dcos analysis fig 6 three autopeaks occurred on the synchronous map which were positioned at 1640 1390 and 1140 cm 1 the band at 1390 cm 1 changed most significantly whereas only small changes were identified at 1640 and 1140 cm 1 the band at 1640 cm 1 was related to the co of amide in proteins 31 that at 1390 cm 1 could be ascribed to oh deformation of phenolic hydroxyl groups whereas 1140 cm 1 could relate to either po in nucleic acids or coc in polysaccharides 31 42 the positive cross peaks all indicated that protein phenol and nucleic acids polysaccharides decreased simultaneously under solar irradiation and that there was no transformation of functional groups observed the asynchronous map for dom exhibited five negative cross peaks at 1690 1390 1690 1140 1455 1390 1455 1140 1348 1140 cm 1 and four positive cross peaks at 1640 1348 1390 1348 1390 1140 1390 870 cm 1 table 5 shows characteristic features of the bands and cross peaks according to the noda rule the functional groups photodegraded preferentially under simulated solar irradiation in the following order 1390 cm 1 1140 cm 1 1455 cm 1 870 cm 1 1640 cm 1 1690 cm 1 1348 cm 1 therefore the ordering of functional groups during the photochemical processing of reclaimed water dom under sunlight irradiation could be confirmed as follows coo unsymmetrical stretching or co stretching of phenolic oh po or coc in polysaccharides ch2 slashing or ch3 distortion in aliphatic substances ch bonding in aromatic structures co stretching of amide in proteins co stretching of cooh or ketones oh in plane bending of polysaccharide groups the aromatic groups govern the light absorbing ability of reclaimed water dom the continuous reduction of suva254 with increasing irradiation time suggested the decrease of dom aromaticity and photodegradation of conjugated benzene rings fig 1 the photodegradation of aromatic rings were mainly associated with the photodegradation of humic like substances since the aromatic rings mainly derived from humic like compounds the abundant carboxylic groups in dom were sensitive to solar irradiation generally the photomineralization of carboxylic groups could produce inorganic carbon or they could be transformed to less reactive groups including ester as illustrated in fig s3 there was no significant variation in the doc contents during the irradiation experiments suggesting that the carboxylic groups were not continuously photomineralized to inorganic carbon the phenols and quinones could be regarded as the main groups responsible for the absorption of dom above 350 nm which were mainly presented in humic like compounds consequently the photodegradation of phenols and quinones in humic compounds could result in the loss of the dom absorption above 350 nm the preferential photodegradation of microbial and terrestrial humic like components and their associated groups such as aromatic carboxylic phenolic and quinonoid groups will be expected to weaken the influence of dom on the mobility and fates of diverse pollutants in reclaimed waters during storage 3 5 insights into the photodegradation mechanisms the phototransformation kinetics of dom under different irradiation treatments including simulated sunlight i e vis uva uvb and specific light bands i e vis vis uva were investigated to determine the effects of specific irradiation wavelengths on the photodegradation of three parafc extracted fluorophores as illustrated in fig 7a visible light 420 nm irradiation scarcely affected the phototransformation rate of tryptophan like components in dom indicating that visible light is trivial for tryptophan like fluorescence loss in addition uva vis light 320 nm irradiation merely made a limited contribution to tryptophan like fluorescence attenuation causing tryptophan like fluorescence to decrease by circa 5 for 72 h irradiation by contrast under 72 h vis uva uvb light 290 nm irradiation nearly 50 of tryptophan like compounds were degraded in conclusion uvb irradiation was likely to play the predominant role in the degradation of tryptophan like compounds as shown in fig 3a the tryptophan like component had an excitation bank at 240 nm and a wide excitation peak centered at 280 nm thus the tryptophan like component was likely more susceptible to photodegradation under uvb light irradiation since the peak excitation band for tryptophan like fluorophore occurred at 240 320 nm 22 upon visible light irradiation the fluorescence of the microbial humic like compounds remained unchanged similar to tryptophan like peaks however microbial humic like compounds were reduced by 48 7 after 72 h vis uva light irradiation meanwhile vis uva uvb light irradiation yielded a total contribution of 75 3 to microbial humic like compounds degradation under 72 h vis uva uvb light irradiation therefore the photodegradation rates of the microbial humic like compound were markedly enhanced under vis light uva uvb irradiation because uvb light was present based on this result it is postulated that both uva and uvb light irradiation play important roles in microbial humic like compounds degradation the peak and spectral loadings for microbial humic like compounds are shown in fig 3 the excitation peaks for microbial humic like compounds occurred at 330 nm and 245 nm the wavelength positions of these two excitation peaks suggested that the microbial humic like component could absorb light from the uvc uvb and uva regions 22 nonetheless uvc is unlikely to lead to its photodegradation because of the absence of uvc in xenon lamps with filters therefore the microbial humic like compound was susceptible to uvb and uva irradiation induced photodegradation as shown in fig 7c after 30 h visible light irradiation the removal efficiency of terrestrial humic like compounds in the reclaimed water samples reached 11 8 and then remained unchanged from 30 h to 72 h this confirms the limited role of visible light irradiation in terrestrial humic like compounds degradation however the terrestrial humic like compound exhibited more obvious degradation than tryptophan like and microbial humic like compounds under visible light irradiation interestingly under the action of vis uva and vis uva uvb light irradiation the terrestrial humic like components were reduced by 58 1 and 66 9 respectively the photodegradation behavior of terrestrial humic like fluorophores under vis uva irradiation presented a considerable similarity with that under vis uva uvb light irradiation this similarity indicated that uva light irradiation played a crucial role in the degradation of terrestrial humic like components while uvb light irradiation was helpful to degrade the terrestrial humic like component to a certain extent the terrestrial humic like component had two excitation peaks at 260 nm and 360 nm which were characterized by considerable uvc and uva light absorption however its absorption band extended only slightly into the uvb light region in this case terrestrial humic like fluorophore was most easily photolyzed under uva light irradiation however uvb light could promote its photodegradation to a certain extent since the peak absorption wavelength for terrestrial humic like fluorophores is mainly found in the uva region and the secondary excitation band extended only slightly into the uvb region the photosensitivity of the three parafac derived components to simulated and specific light bands might also be associated with observed changes in the optical indices derived from uv vis and fluorescence spectra as illustrated in fig 7 under simulated solar irradiation the uv254 continuously decreased with increasing illumination time however visible light irradiation treatment scarcely affected the uv254 during the irradiation processes suggesting that the degradation of aromatic fractions of dom was likely due to uva and uvb irradiation rather than visible light meanwhile vis uva uvb irradiation significantly increased the e 2 e 3 and s 275 295 p 0 05 while vis and vis uva irradiation only had limited influence on the increase of e 2 e 3 and s 275 295 therefore uvb irradiation might play a predominant role in converting high molecular weight dom into that of relatively low molecular weight the fi gradually decreased with increasing illumination time but increased under irradiation treatments with vis uva and vis uva uvb indicating enrichment of terrestrial dom 65 interestingly hix exhibited a similar trend with fi which was a proxy of humic contents of dom irradiation treatments with vis uva and vis uva uvb decreased the hix in a similar pattern to that of uv254 providing additional confirmation of the decrease of dom aromaticity under sunlight irradiation 65 the photodegradation behavior of the three parafac derived components was also explored under various ros quenching enhancing conditions to assess the role of produced ros and 3dom in dom degradation 31 45 66 as illustrated in fig 8a adding nan3 and isopropanol scarcely affected the photodegradation kinetics of the tryptophan like component calculated from the k1 and k2 values indicating a trivial role of 1o2 and oh nitrogen purging experimentations were carried out to explore the role of 3dom in the degradation of the parafac derived fluorophore further n2 saturation markedly promoted the photodegradation rate of the tryptophan like component by approximately 1 5 fold or 4 fold calculated from the k1 and k2 values respectively it is well known that oxygen is a triplet excited state quencher which could suppress 3dom formation 66 removal of the o2 elevated the 3dom concentration but decreased concentrations of 1o2 66 n2 saturation accelerated the degradation of the tryptophan like peak indicating 3dom might play a dominant role in the photodegradation processes of tryptophan like fluorophores according to previous studies electron transfer or hydrogen atom abstraction between 3dom and tryptophan like components caused the tryptophan photodegradation 67 the photodegradation of microbial and terrestrial humic like fluorophores under diverse ros quenching enhancing environments fitted well to the multiple exponential decay model with offset presenting similar photodegradation profiles with the tryptophan like fluorophore moreover as illustrated in fig 8b and c the photodegradation characteristics of microbial humic like fluorophores significantly resemble that for the terrestrial humic like fluorophores p 0 05 meanwhile various ros quenching enhancing conditions caused no observable enhancement inhibition of photodegradation rate constants this indicated the minimal role of ros and 3dom in the photodegradation of the humic like component this phenomenon suggested that the humic like component was likely photodegraded via direct photolysis rather than the involvement of ros 3dom in indirect photolysis this finding corroborates previous results of the direct photolysis of humic like components under simulated solar irradiation 31 45 4 conclusions a comprehensive evaluation of the photochemical processing of reclaimed water dom under natural and simulated solar irradiation is presented based on diverse spectroscopic characterization strategies integrated with various mathematical analysis methods the findings indicate varying photoabilities of different dom components in the following ranking order microbial humic like terrestrial humic like tryptophan like components furthermore 3dom demonstrated a major contribution to the photodegradation of tryptophan like components whereas the photodegradation of microbial and terrestrial humic like components was likely related to direct photolysis moreover the uv bands rather than visible light predominantly drive the sunlight induced dom transformation with visible light irradiation contributing marginally to the dom photodegradation overall the tryptophan like component was likely more susceptible to uvb irradiation induced photodegradation while the terrestrial humic like fluorophore was most easily photolyzed under uva light irradiation by contrast the microbial humic like compound was susceptible to both uvb and uva irradiation induced photodegradation these findings elucidate the photochemical reaction characteristics and mechanisms of dom in reclaimed water under solar irradiation the comprehensive and in depth insight into the degradation profiles of various components of dom under solar irradiation significantly improves understanding of the photochemical fate and transformation of dom in reclaimed water during storage also the findings could be useful when assessing the impact of dom photodegradation on the environmental implications of dom declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
