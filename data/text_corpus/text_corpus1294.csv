6470,coal remains the largest contributor to china s energy structure however coal production has frequently been threatened by groundwater inrush incidents induced by fault zones the variations in the hydraulic properties of fault zones under high water pressure in relation to groundwater inrush risk are poorly understood this paper presents high pressure fluid injection tests used to investigate the variations in hydraulic properties of a fault zone at depth the analysis of experimental results shows that the injection rate and hydraulic conductivity increase as nonlinear functions of injection pressure the evolution process induced by high water pressure can be divided into three flow phases including a darcy flow phase a flow transition phase and an unstable flow phase two thresholds of injection pressure for the onset of nonlinear flow and the onset of substantial fracture dilation and hydraulic fracturing were identified the hydraulic conductivity of the fault zone is closely related to the water pressure with an evident increase in permeability resulting from fracture extension and enhancement of fracture connectivity which were attributed to water injection finally a conceptual model was developed to demonstrate the textural and hydraulic evolution of the fault zone keywords groundwater inrush fault zone high pressure injection test hydraulic properties flow regime 1 introduction currently fossil fuels remain the primary energy source worldwide among which coal is the most abundant su et al 2017 china is rich in coal but scarce in oil and gas therefore coal accounts for a great proportion of the energy consumption of the country ding et al 2017 as shown in fig 1 the economy of china is still and will remain highly dependent on coal extraction and production for the foreseeable future although china has restricted its coal output in recent years ma et al 2017 china continues to rely on coal for more than 50 of its energy zhang 2005 china s total coal consumption is expected to grow during the period of the 13th five year plan 2016 2020 shang et al 2018 fourteen large scale coal production bases will be built during this period including xinjiang shendong middle hebei henan and western shandong amongst others shang et al 2017 however coal production is frequently threatened by groundwater inrush accidents which constitute the greatest challenge in the extraction of this important resource bukowski 2011 meng et al 2012 huang et al 2014a ma et al 2017 about 47 5 of china s key coal mines are affected by water inrushes threatening the production of over 25 billion tons of coal zhang 2005 meng et al 2012 statistics for the past 20 years in china show that water inrush accidents have occurred in more than 250 coal mines and have resulted in over three thousand casualties in addition to threatening the safety of mining operations groundwater inrushes also cause water shortages groundwater pollution vegetation death and pose high human health risks li and zhou 2006 wu and zhou 2008 kotyrba and kortas 2016 polak et al 2016 ma et al 2017 liu et al 2018 fig 2 a shows that water inrush events and associated deaths have been declining since 2005 but the immense danger posed by inrushes cannot be neglected because they cause serious loss of human life and are financially detrimental huang et al 2014a according to recent statistics concerning coal mine accidents in china from 2005 to 2014 fig 2b and 2c water inrush is after gas the most frequent type of disaster and has resulted in many casualties nevertheless water inrushes cause greater economic loss than gas state administration of coal mine safety of china 2009 wu et al 2016 in addition groundwater pressure increases and the risk of water inrush rises with increasing mining depth meng et al 2012 an investigation of coal resources in china shows that around 4 5 trillion tons of coal resources exist at depths 2000 m 73 3 of which exist at depths 600 m yuang 2008 as shown in fig 3 as such the extraction of deep coal resources is needed to power the engine of china s economic growth shang et al 2017 in the coming decades consequently appropriate methods to assess and control water inrushes during coal mining are a major concern in china and have drawn much attention various theories and models of groundwater inrush from aquifers both overlying and underlying coal seams have been proposed bai et al 2013 such as the method of water inrush coefficient li 1999 wu and zhou 2008 meng et al 2012 theory of key strata qian et al 2003 miao et al 2011 theory of instability of seepage flow in the rock strata sun et al 2005 and catastrophic model wang and song 2002 moreover zhang 2005 provided theoretical and empirical methods to predict water inrushes and presented technical measures for improving mine design and safety for coal extraction over aquifers wu and zhou 2008 presented an approach in which water inrush risk was represented by the vulnerability index wang et al 2012 used a secondary fuzzy comprehensive evaluation system to assess the risk of floor water invasion in coal mines meng et al 2012 put forward a coal floor water inrush risk assessment method that considered the lithology and structural features in recent years different numerical simulation methods have been performed extensively by some researchers wang and park 2002 yang et al 2007 zhang et al 2009a b guo et al 2009 zhu and wei 2011 lu and wang 2015 to investigate water inrush mechanisms and processes the characteristics of confined aquifers the natural rocks between underground openings and aquifers and permeable channels such as fractured zones faults natural fractures karst collapse pillars and mining induced fractures are among the main factors that trigger water inrush accidents meng et al 2012 ma et al 2017 fractures which consist of cracks joints and fractured zones faults may provide fluid pathways at depths where fracture permeability is high enough berkowitz 2002 stober and bucher 2007 derode et al 2013 roques et al 2014 specifically fault zones can greatly influence fluid flow at the regional scale forster and evans 1991 rojstaczer et al 1995 evans et al 1997 bense and person 2006 gleeson and novakowski 2009 bense et al 2013 roques et al 2014 thus fault zones represent one of the main channels for groundwater leaking onto working faces or into underground excavations according to the latest statistics from mine water inrush accidents in china over the last 50 years almost 80 of these incidents were related to fault zones zhu et al 2014 huang et al 2014b fault zones are characterised by an internal structural complexity caine et al 1996 bense et al 2013 roques et al 2014 which controls their hydraulic properties and results in the highly complex nature of flow behaviour roques et al 2014 consequently understanding the evolution of the hydraulic properties of fault zones derode et al 2013 and the links with induced water inrushes is of great importance for many underground applications and for assessing the inrush risk studies on the hydraulic properties of fault zones or fractured zones have been attracting a lot of interest in recent years laboratory tests e g zhang et al 2014 ma et al 2015 2017 chen et al 2018 and numerical simulation methods e g wu et al 2004 zhang et al 2009a b 2011 li et al 2011 have been carried out extensively these investigations have shown that the hydraulic properties of fault zones vary considerably and may depend on field geological features rutter et al 2013 groundwater conditions booth 2006 fillings granular rocks within the fault zones zhang et al 2014 ma et al 2017 rock mineralogy roques et al 2014 and other influential aspects however these studies using laboratory tests and numerical simulations have either been simplified studies or have not considered the variations of hydraulic properties in addition the configurations used in these studies were far from reality and therefore do not reflect in situ conditions in situ hydraulic tests are considered to be more effective and useful than the former methods due to the fact that in situ tests represent in situ conditions over a larger scale hamm et al 2007 huang et al 2014a 2016a 2016b chen et al 2015 accordingly there has been an increasing emergence of in situ tests as alternatives to laboratory tests and numerical simulations for characterizing the hydraulic properties of natural geomaterials bo et al 2014 huang et al 2016a however studies have mainly focused on fractured rocks rather than fault zones in particular there is a lack of in situ investigations of the evolution of the hydraulic properties of fault zones kitagawa et al 2007 mukai and fujimori 2007 derode et al 2013 huang et al 2014a 2016a guglielmi et al 2015 and most hydraulic tests currently in use are conventional hydraulic tests neuman 2005 audouin and bodin 2007 hamm et al 2007 angulo et al 2011 quinn et al 2011a 2011b 2013 which typically perform adequately at low injection pressures or injection rates huang et al 2018 the hydraulic properties of fractured zones or fault zones under high water pressures and in deeply buried environments are much more complicated than those under shallow conditions and low water pressures zhou et al 2018 huang et al 2018 involving complex and heterogeneous mechanical properties and hydraulic diffusivity derode et al 2013 to date few studies have investigated the hydraulic properties of fault zones under high groundwater pressure in the present study we present mine water inrush accidents induced by fault zones and analyse a representative water inrush accident from a fault zone where the strata between coal seams and confined aquifers are relatively thin we then present high pressure fluid injection tests that examine the variations of hydraulic properties of a fault zone located at around 430 m depth at a coal mine in western shandong china given the structural heterogeneity variable permeability properties and the uncertainty in fluid flow paths we drilled observation boreholes near the injection boreholes to test two intervals of the fault zone and to investigate fluid transfer properties in different sections of the fault zone furthermore repeated injections were conducted to study the properties and the temporal changes of the fault zone kitagawa et al 2007 the structural heterogeneity of the fault zone determines the hydraulic properties and results in the highly complex nature of flow behaviour roques et al 2014 as the anisotropic properties of deep fault zones are challenging to characterise using field studies this study aims to characterise the simplified and general hydraulic properties of a fault zone using in situ tests 2 experimental setting the most serious threat of potential water disasters that may affect coal production comes from groundwater inrushes from ordovician and lower permian limestone underlying the permo carboniferous coal seams in northern and southern china zhang and shen 2004 zhang 2005 meng et al 2012 the ordovician limestone is a confined karst aquifer containing an abundant supply of water and with a very high water pressure in excess of 10 mpa in addition the strata between the coal seams and this aquifer are relatively thin in the north china coalfields zhang 2005 meng et al 2012 accordingly high pressure groundwater can break through coal seam floors and inrush onto working faces and into underground galleries most water inrushes are found to be directly associated with faults and groundwater inrushes from aquifers underlying mining coal seams are usually induced by intersecting faults which are a type of geological structure that is extensively distributed in the north china coalfields zhang 2005 bai et al 2013 huang et al 2016a b as shown in fig 4 table 1 lists some of the main water inrush accidents caused by faults in coal mines in china it can be seen from table 1 that 1 water inrushes caused by fault zones frequently occur in china especially in western shandong henan and northern anhui 2 one of the main water sources for these inrushes is the ordovician aquifer and 3 the maximum inrush volumetric flow rate into a coal mine during these incidents has reached as much as 16 540 m3 h and the maximum observed water pressure was 7 5 mpa table 1 shows that except for the water inrush accidents at hongcai and zhenxing coal mines the water inrushes occurred in the north china coalfields particularly in the coal base of western shandong western shandong which is threatened by the ordovician aquifer is an important coal base in china and the issue of safe mining over the confined aquifer is critical for instance a water inrush accident occurred at tianzhuang coal mine a mining site in western shandong on august 17 2010 fig 5 this mine was mining the no 16 and 17 coal seams of the permo carboniferous unit four faults named fz1 fz2 fz3 and fz4 cut through the coal seams and the underlying strata groundwater burst into the excavation gallery of the no 8 mining district when the fz4 fault was intersected and the water inflow rate increased to 1296 m3 h during the subsequent 40 h causing shaft submergence as shown in fig 5a and 5b this accident also caused groundwater pollution and waste clearly this accident was related to the fault fig 5c presents the changes of water head in an observation borehole in the ordovician aquifer the changes in the water inflow rate in fig 5b are compared with the water head variation in fig 5c showing that the water head in the ordovician aquifer dropped with increasing water inflow rate in addition the chemical compositions of the inrush water and the ordovician aquifer were similar as shown in table 2 these observations and results clearly indicate that groundwater from the underlying ordovician aquifer leaked into the gallery along the fz4 fault 2 1 experimental site the in situ test site at the xinglongzhuang coal mine is located in jining city in western shandong fig 6 a the xinglongzhuang coal mine is a large modern coal mine with a coal production of 3 million tons per year the main coal bearing strata are permo carboniferous sedimentary rocks composed of an alternating series of mudstones argillites siltites sandstones and limestones limestone is a typical reservoir for groundwater resources this mine began to exploit deep coal seams immediately including no 16 and 17 the underlying ordovician limestone is the most important aquifer affecting the safe mining of these coal seams the thickness of which varies from 450 to 750 m the thickness of strata between the aquifer and the no 16 coal seam varies from 34 04 to 79 01 m with a mean value of 56 61 m thinner strata between the no 17 coal seam and the ordovician aquifer vary in thickness from 25 59 to 67 60 m with an average of 47 28 m both thicknesses generally decrease from south to north in the study area however the water pressure within the ordovician aquifer is comparatively high up to 12 0 mpa the spatial variation of the water pressure in the ordovician aquifer in the study area is shown in fig 6b and shows that the water pressure ranges from 3 0 to 7 0 mpa and generally increases from the northwest to the southeast within the study area the study area is affected by well developed fold structures and fractures which mainly consist of n s and n w trending normal faults see fig 6b and table 3 fractured zones not only control groundwater storage and fluid transport berkowitz 2002 stober and bucher 2007 derode et al 2013 roques et al 2014 but also provide groundwater pathways that connect different aquifers however fault zones are usually structurally heterogeneous implying highly complex flow behaviour roques et al 2014 the hydraulic characteristics of different regions of the same fault can vary considerably furthermore fault zones initially acting as barriers to groundwater flow are susceptible to reactivation induced by mining severe mine water inrush accidents that have occurred in the western shandong coalfields such as the accident in the tianzhuang coal mine were caused by faults and the ordovician aquifer for example the water inrush accidents that occurred at the yangzhuang and danjiacun coal mines in 1992 and 1994 respectively with maximum inflow rates of 5890 and 2200 m3 h were related to fault zones transmitting groundwater from the ordovician aquifer water inrush accidents caused by fractured zones which are generally characterised by a sudden onset high water speed and high pressure become more serious with increasing depth and groundwater pressure huang et al 2014b odintsev and miletenko 2015 polak et al 2016 consequently the flow behaviour of fault zones under high pressure groundwater flow should be investigated for the optimization of mining design and the safety assessment of coal mining activities our study is focused on a deep fault zone over the ordovician aquifer the test site was located in the connection gallery of xinglongzhuang coal mine between the shallow and deep mining districts where a fault named f2 cuts through the tunnel and the lower strata see fig 6c the fault is at least 6 0 km long and trends n s with a mean dip of 75 80 fault f2 cuts through nine tunnels in the coal mine incidences of water inrush with an inflow of 60 m3 h have previously occurred when fault f2 has been intersected in a tunnel of the xinglongzhuang coal mine three boreholes b1 b2 and b3 were drilled to investigate the variations in hydraulic properties of the fault zone under high water pressure all boreholes were drilled in the direction perpendicular to the fault and b3 was entirely cored see figs 6c and 7 a the distance between b1 and b2 and b2 and b3 was 6 5 m b1 b2 and b3 were drilled to lengths of 15 6 20 8 and 27 0 m respectively with a plunge of 20 thus two intervals with a length of 3 7 m were isolated as shown in fig 6c the borehole characteristics are detailed in table 4 the examination of the cores showed that the rocks were highly deformed and fractured especially in the vicinity of the fault zone 2 2 high pressure injection test method in situ hydraulic tests are commonly used to investigate the hydraulic parameters of fractured rocks in field conditions hamm et al 2007 huang et al 2014a 2014b 2016a 2016b 2018 chen et al 2015 the widely used method termed packer tests which uses straddle packers to isolate specific zones quinn et al 2015 has been successfully applied in different underground environments e g hamm et al 2007 kitagawa et al 2007 mukai and fujimori 2007 derode et al 2013 bo et al 2014 chen et al 2015 guglielmi et al 2015 huang et al 2014a 2016a b this method commonly consists of upper and lower inflatable packers in order to seal the test intervals or segments in the fractured rock boreholes guglielmi et al 2014 lo et al 2014 quinn et al 2015 however packer tests may not generally be useful for determining properties in fractured zones as the breakout zones and or uneven boreholes caused by highly fractured walls may not allow the packers to seal quinn et al 2015 and leakage often occurs thus the test interval must be modified to accommodate these features quinn et al 2015 this problem can be addressed by a more efficient alternative to conventional hydraulic testing of the fractured zone to improve the determination of the hydraulic properties this approach is modified from the conventional packer tests and the cross borehole hydraulic tests and consists of injection and observation boreholes as shown in fig 7b the experimental system for the hydraulic characterization of fractured zones is composed of above ground components and downhole equipment an important component of this approach is the use of casing pipes to seal the borehole test interval from the other parts of a borehole huang et al 2014a 2016a b casing pipes were first installed soon after the borehole was drilled in the vicinity of the fractured zone open holes were drilled cutting through the fractured zone fig 7b thus water was permitted to flow through the potential flow path in the open hole an observation borehole was drilled around the injection borehole and pressure sensors with a measuring range up to 10 mpa and an accuracy of 0 001 mpa were installed to independently monitor the pressure variations in the test interval via the observation borehole guglielmi et al 2014 the sensors were linked to a data collection device and computer using cables the outlets of the boreholes were confined by closing them with self designed flange plates huang et al 2018 as shown in fig 7b a water pump was used to generate water pressure up to 22 mpa for the injections with a maximum flow rate of 100 l min a high accuracy flowmeter was used to monitor the injection rate from the pump with a measuring range up to 100 l min and a 0 01 l min accuracy the injection pressure and flow rate were controlled by adjusting the regulating switch of the pump and the relief valve all measurements were digitally recorded using the computer huang et al 2018 a complete high pressure fluid injection test typically consisted of an ascending stage and a descending stage and the test duration depended on the injectivity of the specific zone chen et al 2015 guglielmi et al 2014 generally each injection test was conducted according to the following steps huang et al 2016b 1 injection and observation boreholes were drilled to the designated depth casing pipes were inflated at the chosen depth and the open hole was drilled to the designated depth the pressure sensors were then installed on the upper apes of the interval 2 injection rate was increased stepwise the test was initiated at a relatively low rate and the injection rate was then increased and held guglielmi et al 2014 until the injection pressure was no longer increasing the test was then terminated by a stepwise release of the injection rate in at least three decreasing rate steps at each step all measurements were digitally recorded 3 the injection pressure was released from the boreholes and repeat tests were conducted 24 h later 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental results a total of six injection tests were conducted on the two intervals using three boreholes while monitoring injection rate injection pressure and observation pressure the first interval i e interval 1 was tested twice with b2 used to inject water and b1 to monitor data the second interval i e interval 2 was tested four times with b3 used to inject water and b2 to monitor data injection rate injection pressure and observation pressure from the six tests for interval 1 and interval 2 as a function of time are presented in figs 8 and 9 respectively of the six tests the first five tests used a step rate injection method which consisted of an ascending stage and a descending stage whereas the injection rate was maintained at 25 7 l min during the last test the data in figs 8 and 9 show that no apparent pressure variation was detected during the initial and the repeated tests on interval 1 see fig 8 and during the initial test on interval 2 fig 9a during the repeated tests on interval 2 a change in the observation pressure was detected with changing injection pressure see fig 9b d indicating that water flowed across the fault zone from the injection borehole to the observation borehole two important parameters the hydraulic gradient and the hydraulic conductivity can be estimated from the results of the hydraulic tests and used to characterise the hydraulic properties and fracture connectivity of the rocks huang et al 2018 the hydraulic gradient was calculated using the recorded data from the injection and observation boreholes hydraulic conductivity is typically calculated by assuming steady state laminar flow in homogeneous and isotropic media surrounding a test borehole or a well using the hvorslev equation hvorslev 1951 hamm et al 2007 angulo et al 2011 chen et al 2015 huang et al 2016b 2018 1 k q 2 π l h 0 ln l 2 r w 1 l 2 r w 2 where k is the hydraulic conductivity q is the flow rate r w is the radius of the borehole l is the length of the test section and h 0 is the increase in head compared with that at rest the hydraulic conductivity can be calculated using the data recorded from the injection and observation boreholes the equation can be deduced from darcy s law and dupuit s equation as follows dupuit 1863 le borgne et al 2006 huang et al 2014a 2016a 2018 2 k q ln r ln r 2 π l h in h ob where k is the hydraulic conductivity q is the flow rate r is the radius of the injection borehole l is the length of the test section r is the distance from the injection borehole to the observation borehole and h in and h ob are the water heads of the injection borehole and observation borehole respectively we note that the above equations based on darcy s law may not be well suited for the interpretation of data from high pressure injection tests due to the non darcy nature of fluid flow in fault zones at high flow rates or hydraulic gradients chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 although some methods not based on darcy s law have been proposed in recent years only a few of these targeted or are suited to high pressure injection tests chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 given the complex conditions and the limited data matching the test data of the injection and observation boreholes with an accurate model that incorporates flow path geometry and hydraulic properties is unlikely to have either a simple or a unique solution huang et al 2014a thus we used the equation based on darcy s law i e eq 2 to estimate the hydraulic conductivity in this study for its ease of implementation and computational efficiency angulo et al 2011 huang et al 2014a chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 the calculated hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient as a function of time during these six injection tests are presented in figs 8 and 9 the data in figs 8 and 9 reveal that the hydraulic gradient in all tests shows an initially increasing trend followed by a decreasing trend the trend of decreasing hydraulic gradient demonstrates that the flow paths expanded the fracture networks were enhanced and connections were induced by water injections chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 huang et al 2018 moreover combining the recorded data and the temporal evolution curves of the hydraulic gradient and the hydraulic conductivity can provide evidence of flow phases which can be divided into a darcy flow phase i a flow transition phase ii and an unstable flow phase iii we further discuss the characteristics of these phases in the following section 3 2 flow characteristics of the fault zone characteristics of the relationships of p q curves and p k curves obtained from the injection tests are meaningful for understanding the flow behaviours in the test intervals chen et al 2015 zhou et al 208 huang et al 2018 for darcy flow the injection rate q versus injection pressure p has been commonly considered to be apparently linear and may be extrapolated through the origin quinn et al 2011a 2011b 2013 nasvi et al 2013 huang et al 2018 when this relationship deviates from linearity non darcy flow conditions also referred to as nonlinear flow may occur quinn et al 2011b jasinge et al 2011 nasvi et al 2013 previous studies have noted that most of the data obtained from in situ hydraulic tests showed deviation from linear flow especially for high pressure fluid injection tests quinn et al 2011b huang et al 2014a 2014b 2016a 2016b 2018 chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 the variations of injection rate q with injection pressure p for the six tests are shown in figs 10 and 11 it is apparent that the injection rate q increases as a nonlinear function of the injection pressure p which was caused by leakage fracture dilation or hydraulic fracturing quinn et al 2011b chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 huang et al 2018 a review of the literature on the flow regimes under the conditions of water injection and water flow shows that the p q curves are divided into two or three flow phases as detailed in table 5 huang et al 2016a b investigated the hydraulic properties of fractured zones in coal mines and considered three phases i e an initial flow phase a flow mutation phase and a stable flow phase chen et al 2015 divided the p q curves into a laminar flow phase a non darcian flow phase and a hydraulic fracturing phase in addition it should be noted that the reynolds number re is widely used to provide an indication of flow regimes ranjith and viete 2011 the critical reynolds number rec has been commonly employed to characterise the termination of laminar flow and the onset of nonlinear flow chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 however according to previous studies the critical reynolds number rec ranges widely from 0 001 to 2300 making it inconvenient for practical applications zhou et al 2015 in addition using the reynolds number to describe flow in field tests is further complicated by the fact that re is not uniquely defined over the flow field in a hydraulic test quinn et al 2011a 2011b the critical reynolds number rec estimated from field test data is therefore rarely reported chen et al 2015 and may be inappropriate for predicting nonlinear flow in order to further characterise the flow conditions and the nonlinear flow behaviours in the fault zone the characteristics of the pressure and flow rate data the hydraulic gradient and the relationship between injection pressure p and injection rate q and between injection pressure p and hydraulic conductivity k are comprehensively examined the comparison of the p q and p k curves in the initial tests on intervals 1 and 2 presented in figs 10a and 11a shows identical phase characteristics during the initial injections in both test intervals figs 10a and 11a the injection pressure increased approximately linearly with the injection rate in the early regime of the tests with correlation coefficient r 0 999 0 988 when the flow rate was lower than 0 4 l min consistent with some prior investigations that have identified nonlinear flow during field hydraulic tests with an onset of nonlinearity at injection rates of 0 03 0 5 l min quinn et al 2011a this indicates that water flow in the zone follows darcy s law accordingly this phase is a darcy flow phase phase i in which the injection pressure is comparatively low and the permeability can be approximated with a constant see figs 10a and 11a this can be considered as the initial original hydraulic conductivity of the fault zone huang et al 2014a 2016a 2016b 2018 chen et al 2015 thus the initial hydraulic conductivities of test intervals 1 and 2 are 5 0 10 6 cm s and 6 4 10 6 cm s respectively the nonlinearity in the p q and p k curves occurred soon after the increase of the injection pressure at approximately 1 5 mpa for both intervals indicating the onset of a transition to nonlinear flow as shown in figs 10a and 11a consequently darcy s law breaks down in this phase which is defined as a flow transition phase phase ii the transition pressure in the p q and p k curves that separates the darcy flow and the flow transition phase is defined as the flow transition pressure p t additional confirmation of nonlinear flow initiation is obtained from the analysis of hydraulic gradients plotted in figs 8 and 9 no obvious increase of the hydraulic gradient was detected until the injection pressure p reached the flow transition pressure p t point s t in figs 8a and 9a observations in both intervals of the fault zone illustrate that nonlinear flow initiated at an injection pressure of approximately 1 5 mpa i e p t 1 5 mpa following this as the injection rate injection pressure increased and reached a critical pressure or threshold pressure p c the flow regime entered phase iii defined as an unstable flow phase we note that the fluid flow in both phases ii and iii is a non darcy flow in phase iii the injection rate and hydraulic conductivity increased rapidly but the injection pressure did not change significantly and even decreased quinn et al 2011a b considered that p q will increase if the flow begins to deviate from linearity due to excessive frictional losses and p q will decrease if the fracture dilates due to excessive injection pressure shibata et al 1981 and ewert 1985 proposed that hydraulic conductivity variations with changing water injection pressure could be explained by three processes 1 fracture widening caused by the washout of existing infill in the test section 2 sealing of the fractures by an obstruction of the infill and 3 hydraulic fracturing caused by excessive injection pressure that causes an abrupt and irreversible opening of the fractures as a consequence substantial fracture dilation and hydraulic fracturing may occur in the unstable flow phase due to high injection rate and pressure however it should be noted that leakage and short circuiting to the open borehole above or below the test interval may also result in behaviours similar to dilation effects quinn et al 2011a the distinction between fracture dilation and leakage during the injection tests remains to be studied in more detail and was not collected as part of this study moreover it can be seen from the variation of the hydraulic gradient plotted in figs 8a and 9a that the hydraulic gradient decreased rapidly after the initial increase i e point s u in figs 8a and 9a and the turning point s u could indicate that flow paths had expanded and fracture networks were enhanced and connected due to water injection chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 huang et al 2018 in particular it is worth noting that point s u does not correspond to the onset of the unstable flow phase because fracture dilation and hydraulic fracturing happened significantly earlier than the fracture network connection huang et al 2018 the critical water pressure p c that separates the flow transition and the unstable flow phases can be considered as an important index to reflect the fracture properties and the magnitude of in situ stresses in the rock layers hossain et al 2000 adachi et al 2007 zhou et al 2008 chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 huang et al 2018 according to fig 10a and fig 11a the critical water pressure p c was around 5 2 and 4 3 mpa for the initial injections in the two intervals in addition to the initial water injections repeated injections i e re injection were performed to measure the flow characteristics of the fault zones under periodical water pressure increases and to detect the temporal changes figs 10b and 11b c present the variations of injection rate q and hydraulic conductivity k with injection pressure p for the two intervals comparing the results of the initial and repeated tests shows that their differences were significant the most obvious differences to emerge from the analysis is that 1 for the second injection tests nonlinear flow occurred earlier and only two phases i e the flow transition and unstable flow phases appeared during the second tests in both intervals figs 10b and 11b and 2 for the third and fourth injections in interval 2 only the unstable flow phase occurred figs 9d and 11c the absence of an initial stable period of the hydraulic gradient verifies this figs 8b and 9b d this result may be explained by the fact that not only do the pre existing fractures within the fault zone undergo dilation and propagation but the initiation of new fractures may also occur when the injection pressure reaches the critical pressure p c during the initial injections chen et al 2015 huang et al 2018 this also indicates that the fault zone became more permeable after the initial injections furthermore it can be seen from figs 10 and 11 that the descending curves normally fall below the ascending curves to form a hysteresis loop for both intervals which is caused by the irreversible dilation and relative displacement of fractures or enhancement of fracture connectivity zhou et al 2018 3 3 temporal change of the permeability of the fault zone as shown in figs 10 and 11 no obvious increase of hydraulic conductivity was detected until the injection pressure exceeded the flow transition pressure p t and a rapid increase in hydraulic conductivity with water injection was observed when the injection pressure exceeded the critical water pressure p c the observation of the evolution of hydraulic conductivity during the injections implies that permeability varied in close relation to the water injection which is consistent with some previous studies e g huang et al 2016b 2018 guglielmi et al 2015 the results of the estimation of hydraulic conductivity from the six tests are summarised in fig 12 a it is apparent from fig 12a that there is a clearly increasing trend of hydraulic conductivity in both intervals of the fault zone during the repeated injections indicating that the fault zone becomes more permeable as a result of the high pressure flow of water the results presented in figs 10 and 11 show an increase of several orders of magnitude a minimum 5 7 fold increase in hydraulic conductivity between the initial and repeated tests this permeability increase probably results from the extension and washing out of original and new fractures and from the irreversible deformation of fractures during injections resulting in the enhancement of fracture networks and permeability angulo et al 2011 guglielmi et al 2015 chen et al 2015 huang et al 2016b 2018 zhou et al 2018 in addition the fault zone became increasingly permeable during the re injections due to the increasing hydraulic conductivities of both intervals following previous injections as show in fig 12b this result corresponds closely to the result presented in huang et al 2018 it is interesting to note that the value of hydraulic conductivity of intervals 1 and 2 is different k 0 5 0 10 6 and 6 4 10 6 cm s respectively this discrepancy could be attributed to the internal structural complexity and heterogeneity of the fault zone another possible explanation for this is that interval 2 was tested after interval l and its permeability may have been enhanced by the injections in interval l however in these observational studies there is a potential for bias from unknown error therefore this result needs to be interpreted with caution as another hydraulic parameter and the indication of unstable flow initiation the critical water pressure p c could reflect the fracture properties and the flow resistance hossain et al 2000 adachi et al 2007 zhou et al 2008 chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 huang et al 2018 fig 13 presents the critical pressure p c obtained from the injection tests for the third and fourth tests in interval 2 only the unstable flow phase was observed and consequently p c could be considered to be zero another interesting finding from fig 13 is that the differences in critical pressure p c between the initial and second injections are nevertheless small indicating that new fractures within the fault zone induced by the initial water injections healed and sealed rather than always opening growing and propagating huang et al 2018 however the flow resistance decreased after the repeated injections due to the irreversible dilation and relative displacement of fractures 3 4 discussion of the textural and hydraulic evolution of the fault zone induced by fluid pressure based on these observations and previous studies a conceptual model of the textural and hydraulic evolution of the fault zone was developed fig 14 it is well known that fault zones may provide leakage pathways at depth when fracture permeability is large enough berkowitz 2002 stober and bucher 2007 derode et al 2013 roques et al 2014 as listed in table 5 ma et al 2017 and zhang et al 2014 concluded that potential flow channels for water inrush were generated within the damaged zones of faults and considered three flow phases i e pore flow fissure flow and pipe flow under high water pressure chen et al 2015 considered a laminar flow phase and a non darcy flow phase in perfectly intact rocks or in highly fractured rocks caine et al 1996 developed a conceptual scheme that relates the architecture of a fault zone to its fluid flow as one of three classifications the damage zone is composed of abundant subsidiary slip surfaces and fractures has a high permeability and acts as a conduit for fluid flow caine et al 1996 kitagawa et al 2007 haines et al 2016 combining the observations from the water injection experiments in this study with the conclusions of previous studies could give further insight into the leakage processes and variations of hydraulic properties of fault zones according to the results of the estimation of hydraulic conductivity from the experimental data the initial hydraulic conductivity of the fault zone was around 5 0 6 4 10 6 cm s indicating that the fault zone had a low permeability and hence was likely to have acted as a barrier to fluid flow in the natural and initial state however the fault zone became more permeable under high water pressure resulting from the extension and washing out of original and hydraulic fracturing fractures and from the irreversible deformation of fractures angulo et al 2011 guglielmi et al 2015 chen et al 2015 huang et al 2016b 2018 zhou et al 2018 the fracture networks and the permeability were enhanced by the fluid pressure leading to textural changes and the development of a conduit for fluid flow in the fault zone which is likely to permit groundwater flow across the fault zone and in turn potentially result in inrush incidents haines et al 2016 as shown in fig 14 in addition there is a lack of data regarding the pressure induced permeability variations of fault zones cappa and rutqvist 2011 a fluid pressure permeability model of fault zones may therefore be developed based on our in situ observations such a model could be applied as part of a coupled multiphase fluid flow simulation of a coal mining site to assess the water inrush risk 4 conclusions fault zones consist of abundant fractures and act as a fluid flow conduit at depth for groundwater leaking into underground excavations to investigate the variations of the hydraulic properties of a fault zone high pressure fluid injection tests were conducted on a fault located at around 430 m depth observation boreholes were used to understand the fluid transfer properties in two intervals of the fault zone and repeated injections were conducted to detect any temporal changes the characteristics of the obtained data the hydraulic gradient and the hydraulic conductivity k were comprehensively analysed we conclude that the flow in fault zones induced by high water pressure can be broadly classified into a darcy flow phase a flow transition phase and an unstable flow phase the onset of nonlinearity in the p q and p k curves is an indication of nonlinear flow the corresponding injection pressure that separates the darcy flow and flow transition phases is defined as the flow transition pressure p t and is around 1 5 mpa for both intervals the flow changes to an unstable flow phase when the injection pressure increases to a critical pressure p c at which substantial fracture dilation and hydraulic fracturing may occur the hydraulic gradients were shown to decrease rapidly after the initial increase which is an indication of fracture expansion and connection the initial hydraulic conductivity of the fault zone was around 5 0 6 4 10 6 cm s the hydraulic conductivity of the fault zone was observed to closely correlate with the water pressure and the fault zone became more permeable under high water pressure water injections induced fracture dilation and hydraulic fracturing within the fault zone associated with an increase of several orders of magnitude in the hydraulic conductivity repeated injections may result in rapid fluid flow transitions and penetration lower critical pressures and loss of flow resistance a conduit for fluid flow could therefore be generated by high water pressure within a fault zone which is likely to permit groundwater flow across the fault zone and in turn result in a potential water inrush incident

6470,coal remains the largest contributor to china s energy structure however coal production has frequently been threatened by groundwater inrush incidents induced by fault zones the variations in the hydraulic properties of fault zones under high water pressure in relation to groundwater inrush risk are poorly understood this paper presents high pressure fluid injection tests used to investigate the variations in hydraulic properties of a fault zone at depth the analysis of experimental results shows that the injection rate and hydraulic conductivity increase as nonlinear functions of injection pressure the evolution process induced by high water pressure can be divided into three flow phases including a darcy flow phase a flow transition phase and an unstable flow phase two thresholds of injection pressure for the onset of nonlinear flow and the onset of substantial fracture dilation and hydraulic fracturing were identified the hydraulic conductivity of the fault zone is closely related to the water pressure with an evident increase in permeability resulting from fracture extension and enhancement of fracture connectivity which were attributed to water injection finally a conceptual model was developed to demonstrate the textural and hydraulic evolution of the fault zone keywords groundwater inrush fault zone high pressure injection test hydraulic properties flow regime 1 introduction currently fossil fuels remain the primary energy source worldwide among which coal is the most abundant su et al 2017 china is rich in coal but scarce in oil and gas therefore coal accounts for a great proportion of the energy consumption of the country ding et al 2017 as shown in fig 1 the economy of china is still and will remain highly dependent on coal extraction and production for the foreseeable future although china has restricted its coal output in recent years ma et al 2017 china continues to rely on coal for more than 50 of its energy zhang 2005 china s total coal consumption is expected to grow during the period of the 13th five year plan 2016 2020 shang et al 2018 fourteen large scale coal production bases will be built during this period including xinjiang shendong middle hebei henan and western shandong amongst others shang et al 2017 however coal production is frequently threatened by groundwater inrush accidents which constitute the greatest challenge in the extraction of this important resource bukowski 2011 meng et al 2012 huang et al 2014a ma et al 2017 about 47 5 of china s key coal mines are affected by water inrushes threatening the production of over 25 billion tons of coal zhang 2005 meng et al 2012 statistics for the past 20 years in china show that water inrush accidents have occurred in more than 250 coal mines and have resulted in over three thousand casualties in addition to threatening the safety of mining operations groundwater inrushes also cause water shortages groundwater pollution vegetation death and pose high human health risks li and zhou 2006 wu and zhou 2008 kotyrba and kortas 2016 polak et al 2016 ma et al 2017 liu et al 2018 fig 2 a shows that water inrush events and associated deaths have been declining since 2005 but the immense danger posed by inrushes cannot be neglected because they cause serious loss of human life and are financially detrimental huang et al 2014a according to recent statistics concerning coal mine accidents in china from 2005 to 2014 fig 2b and 2c water inrush is after gas the most frequent type of disaster and has resulted in many casualties nevertheless water inrushes cause greater economic loss than gas state administration of coal mine safety of china 2009 wu et al 2016 in addition groundwater pressure increases and the risk of water inrush rises with increasing mining depth meng et al 2012 an investigation of coal resources in china shows that around 4 5 trillion tons of coal resources exist at depths 2000 m 73 3 of which exist at depths 600 m yuang 2008 as shown in fig 3 as such the extraction of deep coal resources is needed to power the engine of china s economic growth shang et al 2017 in the coming decades consequently appropriate methods to assess and control water inrushes during coal mining are a major concern in china and have drawn much attention various theories and models of groundwater inrush from aquifers both overlying and underlying coal seams have been proposed bai et al 2013 such as the method of water inrush coefficient li 1999 wu and zhou 2008 meng et al 2012 theory of key strata qian et al 2003 miao et al 2011 theory of instability of seepage flow in the rock strata sun et al 2005 and catastrophic model wang and song 2002 moreover zhang 2005 provided theoretical and empirical methods to predict water inrushes and presented technical measures for improving mine design and safety for coal extraction over aquifers wu and zhou 2008 presented an approach in which water inrush risk was represented by the vulnerability index wang et al 2012 used a secondary fuzzy comprehensive evaluation system to assess the risk of floor water invasion in coal mines meng et al 2012 put forward a coal floor water inrush risk assessment method that considered the lithology and structural features in recent years different numerical simulation methods have been performed extensively by some researchers wang and park 2002 yang et al 2007 zhang et al 2009a b guo et al 2009 zhu and wei 2011 lu and wang 2015 to investigate water inrush mechanisms and processes the characteristics of confined aquifers the natural rocks between underground openings and aquifers and permeable channels such as fractured zones faults natural fractures karst collapse pillars and mining induced fractures are among the main factors that trigger water inrush accidents meng et al 2012 ma et al 2017 fractures which consist of cracks joints and fractured zones faults may provide fluid pathways at depths where fracture permeability is high enough berkowitz 2002 stober and bucher 2007 derode et al 2013 roques et al 2014 specifically fault zones can greatly influence fluid flow at the regional scale forster and evans 1991 rojstaczer et al 1995 evans et al 1997 bense and person 2006 gleeson and novakowski 2009 bense et al 2013 roques et al 2014 thus fault zones represent one of the main channels for groundwater leaking onto working faces or into underground excavations according to the latest statistics from mine water inrush accidents in china over the last 50 years almost 80 of these incidents were related to fault zones zhu et al 2014 huang et al 2014b fault zones are characterised by an internal structural complexity caine et al 1996 bense et al 2013 roques et al 2014 which controls their hydraulic properties and results in the highly complex nature of flow behaviour roques et al 2014 consequently understanding the evolution of the hydraulic properties of fault zones derode et al 2013 and the links with induced water inrushes is of great importance for many underground applications and for assessing the inrush risk studies on the hydraulic properties of fault zones or fractured zones have been attracting a lot of interest in recent years laboratory tests e g zhang et al 2014 ma et al 2015 2017 chen et al 2018 and numerical simulation methods e g wu et al 2004 zhang et al 2009a b 2011 li et al 2011 have been carried out extensively these investigations have shown that the hydraulic properties of fault zones vary considerably and may depend on field geological features rutter et al 2013 groundwater conditions booth 2006 fillings granular rocks within the fault zones zhang et al 2014 ma et al 2017 rock mineralogy roques et al 2014 and other influential aspects however these studies using laboratory tests and numerical simulations have either been simplified studies or have not considered the variations of hydraulic properties in addition the configurations used in these studies were far from reality and therefore do not reflect in situ conditions in situ hydraulic tests are considered to be more effective and useful than the former methods due to the fact that in situ tests represent in situ conditions over a larger scale hamm et al 2007 huang et al 2014a 2016a 2016b chen et al 2015 accordingly there has been an increasing emergence of in situ tests as alternatives to laboratory tests and numerical simulations for characterizing the hydraulic properties of natural geomaterials bo et al 2014 huang et al 2016a however studies have mainly focused on fractured rocks rather than fault zones in particular there is a lack of in situ investigations of the evolution of the hydraulic properties of fault zones kitagawa et al 2007 mukai and fujimori 2007 derode et al 2013 huang et al 2014a 2016a guglielmi et al 2015 and most hydraulic tests currently in use are conventional hydraulic tests neuman 2005 audouin and bodin 2007 hamm et al 2007 angulo et al 2011 quinn et al 2011a 2011b 2013 which typically perform adequately at low injection pressures or injection rates huang et al 2018 the hydraulic properties of fractured zones or fault zones under high water pressures and in deeply buried environments are much more complicated than those under shallow conditions and low water pressures zhou et al 2018 huang et al 2018 involving complex and heterogeneous mechanical properties and hydraulic diffusivity derode et al 2013 to date few studies have investigated the hydraulic properties of fault zones under high groundwater pressure in the present study we present mine water inrush accidents induced by fault zones and analyse a representative water inrush accident from a fault zone where the strata between coal seams and confined aquifers are relatively thin we then present high pressure fluid injection tests that examine the variations of hydraulic properties of a fault zone located at around 430 m depth at a coal mine in western shandong china given the structural heterogeneity variable permeability properties and the uncertainty in fluid flow paths we drilled observation boreholes near the injection boreholes to test two intervals of the fault zone and to investigate fluid transfer properties in different sections of the fault zone furthermore repeated injections were conducted to study the properties and the temporal changes of the fault zone kitagawa et al 2007 the structural heterogeneity of the fault zone determines the hydraulic properties and results in the highly complex nature of flow behaviour roques et al 2014 as the anisotropic properties of deep fault zones are challenging to characterise using field studies this study aims to characterise the simplified and general hydraulic properties of a fault zone using in situ tests 2 experimental setting the most serious threat of potential water disasters that may affect coal production comes from groundwater inrushes from ordovician and lower permian limestone underlying the permo carboniferous coal seams in northern and southern china zhang and shen 2004 zhang 2005 meng et al 2012 the ordovician limestone is a confined karst aquifer containing an abundant supply of water and with a very high water pressure in excess of 10 mpa in addition the strata between the coal seams and this aquifer are relatively thin in the north china coalfields zhang 2005 meng et al 2012 accordingly high pressure groundwater can break through coal seam floors and inrush onto working faces and into underground galleries most water inrushes are found to be directly associated with faults and groundwater inrushes from aquifers underlying mining coal seams are usually induced by intersecting faults which are a type of geological structure that is extensively distributed in the north china coalfields zhang 2005 bai et al 2013 huang et al 2016a b as shown in fig 4 table 1 lists some of the main water inrush accidents caused by faults in coal mines in china it can be seen from table 1 that 1 water inrushes caused by fault zones frequently occur in china especially in western shandong henan and northern anhui 2 one of the main water sources for these inrushes is the ordovician aquifer and 3 the maximum inrush volumetric flow rate into a coal mine during these incidents has reached as much as 16 540 m3 h and the maximum observed water pressure was 7 5 mpa table 1 shows that except for the water inrush accidents at hongcai and zhenxing coal mines the water inrushes occurred in the north china coalfields particularly in the coal base of western shandong western shandong which is threatened by the ordovician aquifer is an important coal base in china and the issue of safe mining over the confined aquifer is critical for instance a water inrush accident occurred at tianzhuang coal mine a mining site in western shandong on august 17 2010 fig 5 this mine was mining the no 16 and 17 coal seams of the permo carboniferous unit four faults named fz1 fz2 fz3 and fz4 cut through the coal seams and the underlying strata groundwater burst into the excavation gallery of the no 8 mining district when the fz4 fault was intersected and the water inflow rate increased to 1296 m3 h during the subsequent 40 h causing shaft submergence as shown in fig 5a and 5b this accident also caused groundwater pollution and waste clearly this accident was related to the fault fig 5c presents the changes of water head in an observation borehole in the ordovician aquifer the changes in the water inflow rate in fig 5b are compared with the water head variation in fig 5c showing that the water head in the ordovician aquifer dropped with increasing water inflow rate in addition the chemical compositions of the inrush water and the ordovician aquifer were similar as shown in table 2 these observations and results clearly indicate that groundwater from the underlying ordovician aquifer leaked into the gallery along the fz4 fault 2 1 experimental site the in situ test site at the xinglongzhuang coal mine is located in jining city in western shandong fig 6 a the xinglongzhuang coal mine is a large modern coal mine with a coal production of 3 million tons per year the main coal bearing strata are permo carboniferous sedimentary rocks composed of an alternating series of mudstones argillites siltites sandstones and limestones limestone is a typical reservoir for groundwater resources this mine began to exploit deep coal seams immediately including no 16 and 17 the underlying ordovician limestone is the most important aquifer affecting the safe mining of these coal seams the thickness of which varies from 450 to 750 m the thickness of strata between the aquifer and the no 16 coal seam varies from 34 04 to 79 01 m with a mean value of 56 61 m thinner strata between the no 17 coal seam and the ordovician aquifer vary in thickness from 25 59 to 67 60 m with an average of 47 28 m both thicknesses generally decrease from south to north in the study area however the water pressure within the ordovician aquifer is comparatively high up to 12 0 mpa the spatial variation of the water pressure in the ordovician aquifer in the study area is shown in fig 6b and shows that the water pressure ranges from 3 0 to 7 0 mpa and generally increases from the northwest to the southeast within the study area the study area is affected by well developed fold structures and fractures which mainly consist of n s and n w trending normal faults see fig 6b and table 3 fractured zones not only control groundwater storage and fluid transport berkowitz 2002 stober and bucher 2007 derode et al 2013 roques et al 2014 but also provide groundwater pathways that connect different aquifers however fault zones are usually structurally heterogeneous implying highly complex flow behaviour roques et al 2014 the hydraulic characteristics of different regions of the same fault can vary considerably furthermore fault zones initially acting as barriers to groundwater flow are susceptible to reactivation induced by mining severe mine water inrush accidents that have occurred in the western shandong coalfields such as the accident in the tianzhuang coal mine were caused by faults and the ordovician aquifer for example the water inrush accidents that occurred at the yangzhuang and danjiacun coal mines in 1992 and 1994 respectively with maximum inflow rates of 5890 and 2200 m3 h were related to fault zones transmitting groundwater from the ordovician aquifer water inrush accidents caused by fractured zones which are generally characterised by a sudden onset high water speed and high pressure become more serious with increasing depth and groundwater pressure huang et al 2014b odintsev and miletenko 2015 polak et al 2016 consequently the flow behaviour of fault zones under high pressure groundwater flow should be investigated for the optimization of mining design and the safety assessment of coal mining activities our study is focused on a deep fault zone over the ordovician aquifer the test site was located in the connection gallery of xinglongzhuang coal mine between the shallow and deep mining districts where a fault named f2 cuts through the tunnel and the lower strata see fig 6c the fault is at least 6 0 km long and trends n s with a mean dip of 75 80 fault f2 cuts through nine tunnels in the coal mine incidences of water inrush with an inflow of 60 m3 h have previously occurred when fault f2 has been intersected in a tunnel of the xinglongzhuang coal mine three boreholes b1 b2 and b3 were drilled to investigate the variations in hydraulic properties of the fault zone under high water pressure all boreholes were drilled in the direction perpendicular to the fault and b3 was entirely cored see figs 6c and 7 a the distance between b1 and b2 and b2 and b3 was 6 5 m b1 b2 and b3 were drilled to lengths of 15 6 20 8 and 27 0 m respectively with a plunge of 20 thus two intervals with a length of 3 7 m were isolated as shown in fig 6c the borehole characteristics are detailed in table 4 the examination of the cores showed that the rocks were highly deformed and fractured especially in the vicinity of the fault zone 2 2 high pressure injection test method in situ hydraulic tests are commonly used to investigate the hydraulic parameters of fractured rocks in field conditions hamm et al 2007 huang et al 2014a 2014b 2016a 2016b 2018 chen et al 2015 the widely used method termed packer tests which uses straddle packers to isolate specific zones quinn et al 2015 has been successfully applied in different underground environments e g hamm et al 2007 kitagawa et al 2007 mukai and fujimori 2007 derode et al 2013 bo et al 2014 chen et al 2015 guglielmi et al 2015 huang et al 2014a 2016a b this method commonly consists of upper and lower inflatable packers in order to seal the test intervals or segments in the fractured rock boreholes guglielmi et al 2014 lo et al 2014 quinn et al 2015 however packer tests may not generally be useful for determining properties in fractured zones as the breakout zones and or uneven boreholes caused by highly fractured walls may not allow the packers to seal quinn et al 2015 and leakage often occurs thus the test interval must be modified to accommodate these features quinn et al 2015 this problem can be addressed by a more efficient alternative to conventional hydraulic testing of the fractured zone to improve the determination of the hydraulic properties this approach is modified from the conventional packer tests and the cross borehole hydraulic tests and consists of injection and observation boreholes as shown in fig 7b the experimental system for the hydraulic characterization of fractured zones is composed of above ground components and downhole equipment an important component of this approach is the use of casing pipes to seal the borehole test interval from the other parts of a borehole huang et al 2014a 2016a b casing pipes were first installed soon after the borehole was drilled in the vicinity of the fractured zone open holes were drilled cutting through the fractured zone fig 7b thus water was permitted to flow through the potential flow path in the open hole an observation borehole was drilled around the injection borehole and pressure sensors with a measuring range up to 10 mpa and an accuracy of 0 001 mpa were installed to independently monitor the pressure variations in the test interval via the observation borehole guglielmi et al 2014 the sensors were linked to a data collection device and computer using cables the outlets of the boreholes were confined by closing them with self designed flange plates huang et al 2018 as shown in fig 7b a water pump was used to generate water pressure up to 22 mpa for the injections with a maximum flow rate of 100 l min a high accuracy flowmeter was used to monitor the injection rate from the pump with a measuring range up to 100 l min and a 0 01 l min accuracy the injection pressure and flow rate were controlled by adjusting the regulating switch of the pump and the relief valve all measurements were digitally recorded using the computer huang et al 2018 a complete high pressure fluid injection test typically consisted of an ascending stage and a descending stage and the test duration depended on the injectivity of the specific zone chen et al 2015 guglielmi et al 2014 generally each injection test was conducted according to the following steps huang et al 2016b 1 injection and observation boreholes were drilled to the designated depth casing pipes were inflated at the chosen depth and the open hole was drilled to the designated depth the pressure sensors were then installed on the upper apes of the interval 2 injection rate was increased stepwise the test was initiated at a relatively low rate and the injection rate was then increased and held guglielmi et al 2014 until the injection pressure was no longer increasing the test was then terminated by a stepwise release of the injection rate in at least three decreasing rate steps at each step all measurements were digitally recorded 3 the injection pressure was released from the boreholes and repeat tests were conducted 24 h later 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental results a total of six injection tests were conducted on the two intervals using three boreholes while monitoring injection rate injection pressure and observation pressure the first interval i e interval 1 was tested twice with b2 used to inject water and b1 to monitor data the second interval i e interval 2 was tested four times with b3 used to inject water and b2 to monitor data injection rate injection pressure and observation pressure from the six tests for interval 1 and interval 2 as a function of time are presented in figs 8 and 9 respectively of the six tests the first five tests used a step rate injection method which consisted of an ascending stage and a descending stage whereas the injection rate was maintained at 25 7 l min during the last test the data in figs 8 and 9 show that no apparent pressure variation was detected during the initial and the repeated tests on interval 1 see fig 8 and during the initial test on interval 2 fig 9a during the repeated tests on interval 2 a change in the observation pressure was detected with changing injection pressure see fig 9b d indicating that water flowed across the fault zone from the injection borehole to the observation borehole two important parameters the hydraulic gradient and the hydraulic conductivity can be estimated from the results of the hydraulic tests and used to characterise the hydraulic properties and fracture connectivity of the rocks huang et al 2018 the hydraulic gradient was calculated using the recorded data from the injection and observation boreholes hydraulic conductivity is typically calculated by assuming steady state laminar flow in homogeneous and isotropic media surrounding a test borehole or a well using the hvorslev equation hvorslev 1951 hamm et al 2007 angulo et al 2011 chen et al 2015 huang et al 2016b 2018 1 k q 2 π l h 0 ln l 2 r w 1 l 2 r w 2 where k is the hydraulic conductivity q is the flow rate r w is the radius of the borehole l is the length of the test section and h 0 is the increase in head compared with that at rest the hydraulic conductivity can be calculated using the data recorded from the injection and observation boreholes the equation can be deduced from darcy s law and dupuit s equation as follows dupuit 1863 le borgne et al 2006 huang et al 2014a 2016a 2018 2 k q ln r ln r 2 π l h in h ob where k is the hydraulic conductivity q is the flow rate r is the radius of the injection borehole l is the length of the test section r is the distance from the injection borehole to the observation borehole and h in and h ob are the water heads of the injection borehole and observation borehole respectively we note that the above equations based on darcy s law may not be well suited for the interpretation of data from high pressure injection tests due to the non darcy nature of fluid flow in fault zones at high flow rates or hydraulic gradients chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 although some methods not based on darcy s law have been proposed in recent years only a few of these targeted or are suited to high pressure injection tests chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 given the complex conditions and the limited data matching the test data of the injection and observation boreholes with an accurate model that incorporates flow path geometry and hydraulic properties is unlikely to have either a simple or a unique solution huang et al 2014a thus we used the equation based on darcy s law i e eq 2 to estimate the hydraulic conductivity in this study for its ease of implementation and computational efficiency angulo et al 2011 huang et al 2014a chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 the calculated hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient as a function of time during these six injection tests are presented in figs 8 and 9 the data in figs 8 and 9 reveal that the hydraulic gradient in all tests shows an initially increasing trend followed by a decreasing trend the trend of decreasing hydraulic gradient demonstrates that the flow paths expanded the fracture networks were enhanced and connections were induced by water injections chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 huang et al 2018 moreover combining the recorded data and the temporal evolution curves of the hydraulic gradient and the hydraulic conductivity can provide evidence of flow phases which can be divided into a darcy flow phase i a flow transition phase ii and an unstable flow phase iii we further discuss the characteristics of these phases in the following section 3 2 flow characteristics of the fault zone characteristics of the relationships of p q curves and p k curves obtained from the injection tests are meaningful for understanding the flow behaviours in the test intervals chen et al 2015 zhou et al 208 huang et al 2018 for darcy flow the injection rate q versus injection pressure p has been commonly considered to be apparently linear and may be extrapolated through the origin quinn et al 2011a 2011b 2013 nasvi et al 2013 huang et al 2018 when this relationship deviates from linearity non darcy flow conditions also referred to as nonlinear flow may occur quinn et al 2011b jasinge et al 2011 nasvi et al 2013 previous studies have noted that most of the data obtained from in situ hydraulic tests showed deviation from linear flow especially for high pressure fluid injection tests quinn et al 2011b huang et al 2014a 2014b 2016a 2016b 2018 chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 the variations of injection rate q with injection pressure p for the six tests are shown in figs 10 and 11 it is apparent that the injection rate q increases as a nonlinear function of the injection pressure p which was caused by leakage fracture dilation or hydraulic fracturing quinn et al 2011b chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 huang et al 2018 a review of the literature on the flow regimes under the conditions of water injection and water flow shows that the p q curves are divided into two or three flow phases as detailed in table 5 huang et al 2016a b investigated the hydraulic properties of fractured zones in coal mines and considered three phases i e an initial flow phase a flow mutation phase and a stable flow phase chen et al 2015 divided the p q curves into a laminar flow phase a non darcian flow phase and a hydraulic fracturing phase in addition it should be noted that the reynolds number re is widely used to provide an indication of flow regimes ranjith and viete 2011 the critical reynolds number rec has been commonly employed to characterise the termination of laminar flow and the onset of nonlinear flow chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 however according to previous studies the critical reynolds number rec ranges widely from 0 001 to 2300 making it inconvenient for practical applications zhou et al 2015 in addition using the reynolds number to describe flow in field tests is further complicated by the fact that re is not uniquely defined over the flow field in a hydraulic test quinn et al 2011a 2011b the critical reynolds number rec estimated from field test data is therefore rarely reported chen et al 2015 and may be inappropriate for predicting nonlinear flow in order to further characterise the flow conditions and the nonlinear flow behaviours in the fault zone the characteristics of the pressure and flow rate data the hydraulic gradient and the relationship between injection pressure p and injection rate q and between injection pressure p and hydraulic conductivity k are comprehensively examined the comparison of the p q and p k curves in the initial tests on intervals 1 and 2 presented in figs 10a and 11a shows identical phase characteristics during the initial injections in both test intervals figs 10a and 11a the injection pressure increased approximately linearly with the injection rate in the early regime of the tests with correlation coefficient r 0 999 0 988 when the flow rate was lower than 0 4 l min consistent with some prior investigations that have identified nonlinear flow during field hydraulic tests with an onset of nonlinearity at injection rates of 0 03 0 5 l min quinn et al 2011a this indicates that water flow in the zone follows darcy s law accordingly this phase is a darcy flow phase phase i in which the injection pressure is comparatively low and the permeability can be approximated with a constant see figs 10a and 11a this can be considered as the initial original hydraulic conductivity of the fault zone huang et al 2014a 2016a 2016b 2018 chen et al 2015 thus the initial hydraulic conductivities of test intervals 1 and 2 are 5 0 10 6 cm s and 6 4 10 6 cm s respectively the nonlinearity in the p q and p k curves occurred soon after the increase of the injection pressure at approximately 1 5 mpa for both intervals indicating the onset of a transition to nonlinear flow as shown in figs 10a and 11a consequently darcy s law breaks down in this phase which is defined as a flow transition phase phase ii the transition pressure in the p q and p k curves that separates the darcy flow and the flow transition phase is defined as the flow transition pressure p t additional confirmation of nonlinear flow initiation is obtained from the analysis of hydraulic gradients plotted in figs 8 and 9 no obvious increase of the hydraulic gradient was detected until the injection pressure p reached the flow transition pressure p t point s t in figs 8a and 9a observations in both intervals of the fault zone illustrate that nonlinear flow initiated at an injection pressure of approximately 1 5 mpa i e p t 1 5 mpa following this as the injection rate injection pressure increased and reached a critical pressure or threshold pressure p c the flow regime entered phase iii defined as an unstable flow phase we note that the fluid flow in both phases ii and iii is a non darcy flow in phase iii the injection rate and hydraulic conductivity increased rapidly but the injection pressure did not change significantly and even decreased quinn et al 2011a b considered that p q will increase if the flow begins to deviate from linearity due to excessive frictional losses and p q will decrease if the fracture dilates due to excessive injection pressure shibata et al 1981 and ewert 1985 proposed that hydraulic conductivity variations with changing water injection pressure could be explained by three processes 1 fracture widening caused by the washout of existing infill in the test section 2 sealing of the fractures by an obstruction of the infill and 3 hydraulic fracturing caused by excessive injection pressure that causes an abrupt and irreversible opening of the fractures as a consequence substantial fracture dilation and hydraulic fracturing may occur in the unstable flow phase due to high injection rate and pressure however it should be noted that leakage and short circuiting to the open borehole above or below the test interval may also result in behaviours similar to dilation effects quinn et al 2011a the distinction between fracture dilation and leakage during the injection tests remains to be studied in more detail and was not collected as part of this study moreover it can be seen from the variation of the hydraulic gradient plotted in figs 8a and 9a that the hydraulic gradient decreased rapidly after the initial increase i e point s u in figs 8a and 9a and the turning point s u could indicate that flow paths had expanded and fracture networks were enhanced and connected due to water injection chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 huang et al 2018 in particular it is worth noting that point s u does not correspond to the onset of the unstable flow phase because fracture dilation and hydraulic fracturing happened significantly earlier than the fracture network connection huang et al 2018 the critical water pressure p c that separates the flow transition and the unstable flow phases can be considered as an important index to reflect the fracture properties and the magnitude of in situ stresses in the rock layers hossain et al 2000 adachi et al 2007 zhou et al 2008 chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 huang et al 2018 according to fig 10a and fig 11a the critical water pressure p c was around 5 2 and 4 3 mpa for the initial injections in the two intervals in addition to the initial water injections repeated injections i e re injection were performed to measure the flow characteristics of the fault zones under periodical water pressure increases and to detect the temporal changes figs 10b and 11b c present the variations of injection rate q and hydraulic conductivity k with injection pressure p for the two intervals comparing the results of the initial and repeated tests shows that their differences were significant the most obvious differences to emerge from the analysis is that 1 for the second injection tests nonlinear flow occurred earlier and only two phases i e the flow transition and unstable flow phases appeared during the second tests in both intervals figs 10b and 11b and 2 for the third and fourth injections in interval 2 only the unstable flow phase occurred figs 9d and 11c the absence of an initial stable period of the hydraulic gradient verifies this figs 8b and 9b d this result may be explained by the fact that not only do the pre existing fractures within the fault zone undergo dilation and propagation but the initiation of new fractures may also occur when the injection pressure reaches the critical pressure p c during the initial injections chen et al 2015 huang et al 2018 this also indicates that the fault zone became more permeable after the initial injections furthermore it can be seen from figs 10 and 11 that the descending curves normally fall below the ascending curves to form a hysteresis loop for both intervals which is caused by the irreversible dilation and relative displacement of fractures or enhancement of fracture connectivity zhou et al 2018 3 3 temporal change of the permeability of the fault zone as shown in figs 10 and 11 no obvious increase of hydraulic conductivity was detected until the injection pressure exceeded the flow transition pressure p t and a rapid increase in hydraulic conductivity with water injection was observed when the injection pressure exceeded the critical water pressure p c the observation of the evolution of hydraulic conductivity during the injections implies that permeability varied in close relation to the water injection which is consistent with some previous studies e g huang et al 2016b 2018 guglielmi et al 2015 the results of the estimation of hydraulic conductivity from the six tests are summarised in fig 12 a it is apparent from fig 12a that there is a clearly increasing trend of hydraulic conductivity in both intervals of the fault zone during the repeated injections indicating that the fault zone becomes more permeable as a result of the high pressure flow of water the results presented in figs 10 and 11 show an increase of several orders of magnitude a minimum 5 7 fold increase in hydraulic conductivity between the initial and repeated tests this permeability increase probably results from the extension and washing out of original and new fractures and from the irreversible deformation of fractures during injections resulting in the enhancement of fracture networks and permeability angulo et al 2011 guglielmi et al 2015 chen et al 2015 huang et al 2016b 2018 zhou et al 2018 in addition the fault zone became increasingly permeable during the re injections due to the increasing hydraulic conductivities of both intervals following previous injections as show in fig 12b this result corresponds closely to the result presented in huang et al 2018 it is interesting to note that the value of hydraulic conductivity of intervals 1 and 2 is different k 0 5 0 10 6 and 6 4 10 6 cm s respectively this discrepancy could be attributed to the internal structural complexity and heterogeneity of the fault zone another possible explanation for this is that interval 2 was tested after interval l and its permeability may have been enhanced by the injections in interval l however in these observational studies there is a potential for bias from unknown error therefore this result needs to be interpreted with caution as another hydraulic parameter and the indication of unstable flow initiation the critical water pressure p c could reflect the fracture properties and the flow resistance hossain et al 2000 adachi et al 2007 zhou et al 2008 chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 huang et al 2018 fig 13 presents the critical pressure p c obtained from the injection tests for the third and fourth tests in interval 2 only the unstable flow phase was observed and consequently p c could be considered to be zero another interesting finding from fig 13 is that the differences in critical pressure p c between the initial and second injections are nevertheless small indicating that new fractures within the fault zone induced by the initial water injections healed and sealed rather than always opening growing and propagating huang et al 2018 however the flow resistance decreased after the repeated injections due to the irreversible dilation and relative displacement of fractures 3 4 discussion of the textural and hydraulic evolution of the fault zone induced by fluid pressure based on these observations and previous studies a conceptual model of the textural and hydraulic evolution of the fault zone was developed fig 14 it is well known that fault zones may provide leakage pathways at depth when fracture permeability is large enough berkowitz 2002 stober and bucher 2007 derode et al 2013 roques et al 2014 as listed in table 5 ma et al 2017 and zhang et al 2014 concluded that potential flow channels for water inrush were generated within the damaged zones of faults and considered three flow phases i e pore flow fissure flow and pipe flow under high water pressure chen et al 2015 considered a laminar flow phase and a non darcy flow phase in perfectly intact rocks or in highly fractured rocks caine et al 1996 developed a conceptual scheme that relates the architecture of a fault zone to its fluid flow as one of three classifications the damage zone is composed of abundant subsidiary slip surfaces and fractures has a high permeability and acts as a conduit for fluid flow caine et al 1996 kitagawa et al 2007 haines et al 2016 combining the observations from the water injection experiments in this study with the conclusions of previous studies could give further insight into the leakage processes and variations of hydraulic properties of fault zones according to the results of the estimation of hydraulic conductivity from the experimental data the initial hydraulic conductivity of the fault zone was around 5 0 6 4 10 6 cm s indicating that the fault zone had a low permeability and hence was likely to have acted as a barrier to fluid flow in the natural and initial state however the fault zone became more permeable under high water pressure resulting from the extension and washing out of original and hydraulic fracturing fractures and from the irreversible deformation of fractures angulo et al 2011 guglielmi et al 2015 chen et al 2015 huang et al 2016b 2018 zhou et al 2018 the fracture networks and the permeability were enhanced by the fluid pressure leading to textural changes and the development of a conduit for fluid flow in the fault zone which is likely to permit groundwater flow across the fault zone and in turn potentially result in inrush incidents haines et al 2016 as shown in fig 14 in addition there is a lack of data regarding the pressure induced permeability variations of fault zones cappa and rutqvist 2011 a fluid pressure permeability model of fault zones may therefore be developed based on our in situ observations such a model could be applied as part of a coupled multiphase fluid flow simulation of a coal mining site to assess the water inrush risk 4 conclusions fault zones consist of abundant fractures and act as a fluid flow conduit at depth for groundwater leaking into underground excavations to investigate the variations of the hydraulic properties of a fault zone high pressure fluid injection tests were conducted on a fault located at around 430 m depth observation boreholes were used to understand the fluid transfer properties in two intervals of the fault zone and repeated injections were conducted to detect any temporal changes the characteristics of the obtained data the hydraulic gradient and the hydraulic conductivity k were comprehensively analysed we conclude that the flow in fault zones induced by high water pressure can be broadly classified into a darcy flow phase a flow transition phase and an unstable flow phase the onset of nonlinearity in the p q and p k curves is an indication of nonlinear flow the corresponding injection pressure that separates the darcy flow and flow transition phases is defined as the flow transition pressure p t and is around 1 5 mpa for both intervals the flow changes to an unstable flow phase when the injection pressure increases to a critical pressure p c at which substantial fracture dilation and hydraulic fracturing may occur the hydraulic gradients were shown to decrease rapidly after the initial increase which is an indication of fracture expansion and connection the initial hydraulic conductivity of the fault zone was around 5 0 6 4 10 6 cm s the hydraulic conductivity of the fault zone was observed to closely correlate with the water pressure and the fault zone became more permeable under high water pressure water injections induced fracture dilation and hydraulic fracturing within the fault zone associated with an increase of several orders of magnitude in the hydraulic conductivity repeated injections may result in rapid fluid flow transitions and penetration lower critical pressures and loss of flow resistance a conduit for fluid flow could therefore be generated by high water pressure within a fault zone which is likely to permit groundwater flow across the fault zone and in turn result in a potential water inrush incident

6471,changes in terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa are not only influenced by local climate conditions but also by teleconnection factors to date how teleconnection factors including sunspot activities could affect twsa has been under examined in this study we investigate the twsa dynamics in the yunnan province yp china and assess their relationships with teleconnection factors at multiple timescales results show that 1 grace data is able to reflect twsa dynamics in the study region as demonstrated by its high correlations with soil moisture precipitation and groundwater anomalies 2 grace based twsa shows a downward trend of varying degrees at the monthly seasonal annual and multi year scales with obvious periodic changes of 11 and around 60 months 3 precipitation magnitude and its distribution characteristics in humid areas are the main driving factors of twsa and teleconnection factors have stronger association with precipitation concentration degree pcd than precipitation magnitude 4 the 2009 extreme drought has caused a sharp decrease in twsa and the correlations between twsa with arctic oscillation ao and el niño southern oscillation enso were 0 88 a 0 01 and 0 58 a 0 01 this study sheds new insights into how teleconnection factors could twsa dynamics in a changing environment keywords grace terrestrial water storage dynamics multi time scale teleconnection factors 1 introduction climate variability is a driving factor in land surface water and energy fluxes němec et al 1982 changes in precipitation evaporation snow melting and runoff further contribute to twsa chang and bonnette 2016 which have important implications for assessment of climate change food security water and energy use drought flood risk and etc wang et al 2015 tao et al 2015 guo et al 2019 ming et al 2018 fang et al 2017 2019a therefore the investigation of twsa change is of important significance not only in academia but also in politics and economy traditionally predicting the variation in twsa of a given region is a demanding process as it requires large observational data and sophisticated models now this has been made possible with satellite techniques which allow for observation of various terrestrial hydrological variables seyoum 2018 to observe spatial and temporal changes of earth s gravity field the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the german aerospace center dlr jointly developed the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission in march 2002 ramillien et al 2005 and produced continuous records of twsa globally to date grace based records of twsa have been widely used in the fields of hydrology and climate change for example deng and chen 2017 quantified the impacts of precipitation and air temperature on twsa in central asia over the past decade xu and zhang 2013 studied the seasonal and annual changes of land water storage in the qinghai tibet plateau and the yarlung zangbo river basin and found that with significant seasonal fluctuations annual water storage had a significant downward trend david et al 2011 investigated the annual and interannual terrestrial water storage in australia and explored the linkages with the leading modes of pacific and indian ocean variability recently wang et al 2018 showed that grace based twsa in the global endorheic has decreased at a rate of about 100 billion cubic meter per year between 2002 and 2016 since the accuracy of grace satellite s twsa inversion increases with the increase of regional area many scholars used grace satellite records in large scale region li and rodell 2015 long et al 2017 rodell et al 2018 panda and wahr 2015 however most of previous studies examined twsa dynamics at a specific time scale thus ignoring the dynamics at multiple time scales in this study we first assess the reliability of relatively small scale regional twsa and then investigate its changing characteristics at monthly seasonal annual and multi year scales previous studies have shown that climate change has led to more frequent and severe extreme natural events peterson and hirsch 2013 huang et al 2014 2016 2019 fang et al 2019b especially since the 21st century global extreme events have occurred frequently such as the 2005 hurricane katrina in the united states the 2008 severe floods in southern china the 2018 droughts in australia and recent california forest fires etc since droughts and floods are related to twsa many studies have investigated the effects of global climate teleconnection factors on regional twsa zhang et al 2015 found that el niño la niña event is significantly correlated with high low twsa in the yangtze river basin with a phase lead of 7 8 months in west africa christopher ndehedehe et al 2017 observed that the presence of enso and atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo are responsible for twsa in tropical areas trans niño index showed strong association with stream flow during the warm phase of pdo in the upper klamath lake in the us kennedy et al 2009 previous studies neff et al 2001 ma et al 2007 concerning the influence of teleconnection factors on the twsa mostly focused on the relationship between single factor e g ao zhong et al 2018 enso ni et al 2018 and twsa more teleconnection factors e g sunspot ao enos and pdo need to be further considered to fully reveal the impacts of teleconnection factors on the twsa which could be helpful for predicting twsa in advance additionally the role of sunspot activities in affecting the twsa has been not clarified clearly mörner 2003 and jia et al 2011 have shown that sunspot activities can change the temperature and pressure gradient of the earth s surface by affecting the solar radiation obtained by the earth which is accompanied by the change of the atmospheric circulation thus directly affecting the weather and causing abnormal precipitation besides sunspot activities may also affect the teleconnection factors by changing the water vapor transport via sea surface temperature thus indirectly influencing the water vapor cycle processes such as precipitation and evaporation kopp et al 2016 maitra et al 2014 huang et al 2017b therefore sunspot activities may directly and indirectly impact the twsa which deserves to be further investigated furthermore when considering the relationship between teleconnection factors and twsa direct correlation comparison among them is often used however it is still unrevealed clearly how these teleconnection factors can further affect the twsa dynamic through influencing precipitation including its magnitude and seasonal distribution which is a prospective scientific guidance for future global water resources prediction and utilization to fill this research gap this present study aims to address the issues mentioned above by systematically examining the influence of teleconnection factors on twsa via considering multiple teleconnection factors such as sunspot ao enos and pdo and determine possible dominant factors along with further clarifying the role of sunspot activities in impacting twsa variations in direct and indirect way in addition the precipitation magnitude and precipitation concentration degree pcd of the yp were employed as the medium to further examine linkages between the teleconnection factors and twsa the study area the yp is one of the most humid areas in china yp with forest coverage is as high as 50 hu 2017 the yp lies in the vast asian continent to the north and the vast bay of bengal and south china sea to the south it is in the intersection area of east asian monsoon and south asian monsoon the northwest is also affected by the qinghai tibet plateau forming a complex and diverse climate type in addition the research on twsa in the yp by grace was based on the research on the changes of groundwater storage huang et al 2019 and the monitoring of drought and flood long et al 2014 long et al 2015a b in southwest china and the karst plateau but rarely focuses on the yp especially at the end of 2009 the yp experienced a once in a century drought which covered huge losses to local production and life therefore we can capture the drought event signal so as to better support this study this paper is divided into three parts firstly the twsa dynamics were compared with soil moisture simulated by variability infiltration capacity vic model nijssen et al 1997 the reliability of twsa is also verified by comparing with observed monthly precipitation and annual groundwater data of yp secondly the changing characteristics and their influencing factors of twsa in yp were analyzed at the monthly seasonal annual and multi year timescales finally the cross wavelet analysis is adopted to explore the correlation between twsa and climatic indices which can be used to analyze the driving forces affecting twsa dynamics and thus provide scientific basis for water resources planning and management in yp 2 study area and data 2 1 study area yp 97 31 106 11 e 21 8 29 15 n show in fig 1 covers an area of 394 100 km2 of which 84 is mountainous 10 is plateau and 6 is basin

smaller than that of tws there exhibit similar periodic and trend changes in summer sms and tws reach peak value and there is no obvious lag phenomenon this is because the twsa data is produced at the monthly scale and the high forest coverage rate in yp allows for a sufficient time for surface water infiltration tang and tatemasa 1991 to remove the interannual variation cycle we carried out a 13 month moving average and found that the change trend of sms and tws have similar periodicity and amplitude at a multi year scale r 0 83 p 0 01 overall variation of soil moisture in the yp contributes considerably to twsa at the multi year and interannual time scales however discrepancies are observed at the peak of 2005 and 2007 which may be caused by the error of model bias at the same time both tws and sms show a decreasing trend in winter followed by an upward trend in the spring consistent with the seasonal change pattern of precipitation in the study region decrease of runoff in winter will enhance soil moisture infiltration into groundwater and thus supplying runoff in the direction of horizontal slope while the increase of runoff in the upstream could reduce soil moisture supply leading to a slight upward trend as shown in fig 2b there is a significant positive correlation between sms and tws it should be noted that the vic model simulations by zhang et al 2014 are driven with a high density of meteorological observations from the cma and have been successfully applied in the yangtze river basin zhang et al 2018a b tibet plateau tong et al 2014 and other regions therefore the accuracy of soil moisture in the yp simulated by vic model can be guaranteed in humid areas with abundant precipitation the change trend of soil moisture and twsa tend to show similar characteristics such as in northwest india long et al 2016 illinois state yeh et al 2006 meanwhile being linked with surface water and groundwater soil moisture contains the signal of surface water and groundwater changes to a certain extent another strong evidence shows that soil moisture at 0 40 cm contributes about 42 of twsa in the yp during the drought period of 2009 2010 decrease of soil moisture in the yp directly led to the loss of twsa ma et al 2017 based on five years of in situ observations wang et al 2016 found that soil moisture was relatively larger in the northwest and southeast of the yp and the overall soil moisture increased with the depth therefore the change of soil moisture plays a major role in the change of total water reserves in the study area in general the change trend of sms in the yp is similar to tws which further verifies the reliability of grace in reflecting twsa variations 4 1 2 comparison of twsa with precipitation and groundwater expect for soil moisture the comparison of twsa with precipitation and groundwater also conducted fig 3 shows the monthly time series of twsa precipitation and annual variation of groundwater its exhibition a clear monthly signal with minima occurring in the 2010 distinct maxima in the middle of each year reflects the anomalously strong monsoon seasons comparison of twsa with precipitation shows that fluctuations of twsa in the yp are generally consistent with that of precipitation despite the slight peak lag cao and zhao 2017 the trend of twsa in yp is not obvious during the study period based on records from well levels many scholars have investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of regional groundwater yeh et al 2006 döll et al 2015 bhanja et al 2016 since monthly groundwater level records are not available in the study area we use annual groundwater data released by yunnan provincial hydrological bureau we found a significant positive correlation between them the higher the peak value the greater the groundwater storage r 0 59 p 0 05 in addition the irrigation water in the yp originates from precipitation and runoff which is different from the central valley of america scanlon et al 2015 the annual variation trend of groundwater storage is consistent with twsa here it was demonstrated that the grace based records are reliable for monitoring twsa 4 2 changing characteristics of twsa in the yp analysis of twsa at the monthly seasonal and annual scales shows that twsa in the yp has exhibited distinct seasonal characteristics fig 4 large positive values of twsa are found in summer and autumn while negative twsa values are observed in winter and spring during the study period twsa in showed distinct seasonal variations fig 4a at the monthly scale twsa exhibited a downward trend except for may especially in september fig 4b at the twsa of the yp showed a significant downward trend with the most negative value observed in 2006 and the most positive value in 2008 after 2008 the twsa in the yp tends to decrease progressively fig 4a leading to the severe drought in late 2009 overall since the beginning of the 21st century the twsa in the yp has shown a significant downward trend at multiple scales under global warming to better show the change patterns of twsa at the multi year scale we calculated the accumulated anomaly of twsa it is shown that twsa has a cycle change of about one year which is consistent with that of annual precipitation notably twsa showed a significant overall downward trend at the end of 2009 despite evident seasonal variations during this period a severe once in a century drought occurred in southwest china including the yp droughts have occurred in the yp in 2003 2005 2006 2009 2012 with various intensities and durations however fig 5 only reflects the severe drought disaster in 2009 2012 as small scale drought signals may be canceled out with aggregation of anomalies after 2009 groundwater resources in the yp showed a significant downward trend fig 3 consistent with the drought events experienced in the yp as shown in fig 2a tws exhibits a non stationary change pattern in the rising period of 2003 2004 and 2010 in addition the large scale amplitude phenomena in 2002 2007 and 2012 fig 5 indicate that besides the significant one year periodic changes there may exist other periodic signals in the twsa of yp here we used the wavelet images of twsa in 2002 2015 fig 6 for further illustrations a period of about 12 and 60 months in the yp twsa is observed with four distinct alternations of abundance and decline in 14 years at the end of 2009 the duration and intensity of negative twsa values were obviously higher than those in other periods which coincided with the severe drought experienced by the yp the signal is also weak and insignificant in the period change of about 20 months however the alternation of abundance and decline in 2003 2004 and 2010 explains the anomaly in fig 2a very well it is recognized that twsa include surface water groundwater and soil moisture which are all originated from precipitation changes in climate factors dominates precipitation change patterns ma and xie 2013 meng et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to investigate the relations between climate factors and precipitation to explore the driving forces of twsa in the yp 4 3 the driving force of twsa in the yp 4 3 1 correlation between twsa and teleconnection factors in yp it is important to examine the correlations between climate indices and twsa to better understand the cause of twsa change in yp from a perspective of climate change here the cross wavelet analysis was utilized to investigate the correlations between monthly twsa and monthly ao enso pdo sunspot and precipitation as shown in fig 7 a ao has a statistically significant correlation with twsa at the period of 9 14 months with negative correlation observed in 2002 2003 2007 2009 and 2013 2015 and positive correlations found in 2009 2012 the significance region phase during the period from 2002 to 2003 is about 120 implying that the ao controls twsa for nearly 4 months notably in 2007 2012 the phase of their transitions was approximately about 180 and the sign of correlation changed from negative to positive especially in the concentrated high energy region crimson region around 2010 it is also shown that enso governs twsa with a period of 9 14 month in 2008 and 2011 which is consistent with enso 2 7 years dash et al 2013 except for the negative correlation in 2010 positive correlations are observed in other periods with a significance region phase of about 90 implying that enso exerts a strong influence on twsa for nearly 3 months fig 7c indicates that pdo has a prominently positive correlation with twsa at a 9 14 months scale during 2004 2014 the significance region phase during the period from 2008 to 2011 is about 40 implying that the pdo controls twsa for nearly 1 3 months it s worth noting that sunspot has a positive correlation with twsa at a 9 15 months scale during 2002 2006 the typical sunspot with an 11 yr period lu and zhou 2018 is also reflected in the high and low energy regions of the 9 15 monthly scale signals fig 7d moreover the analyzed of cross wavelet between twsa and precipitation fig 7e showed that precipitation is positively correlated with twsa at a 9 14 months scale during 2002 2015 the mean phase of the significant regions is about 45 implying that precipitation modulates twsa for nearly 1 5 months consistent with the results from fig 3 fig 8 a shows that twsa peaks in the middle and the end of each year while the amplitude of ao is larger in winter and smaller in summer otomi et al 2013 positive twsa in the yp are found during the negative phase of ao with the decrease of ao amplitude and the increase of precipitation in spring and summer twsa reaches its maximum in the middle of the year and shows a negative correlation is observed between ao and twsa however there was a significant positive correlation in 2008 2010 p 0 86 a 0 01 the extreme drought event that occurred at the end of 2009 also caused a sharp decline in twsa and drought events were related to the phase changes of ao r 0 88 p 0 01 and pdo r 0 47 p 0 01 relevant studies jin 2018 kang et al 2015 show that there was a significant positive correlation between ao and twsa in the sub basins of the yangtze river basin r 0 5 p 0 01 especially in the southwest of china in 2009 the severe drought has a significant correlation with enso and ao similar to ao twsa in the yp are mostly in deficit period during the positive phase of pdo fig 8c with decrease of twsa in 2008 2010 a significant negative correlation is found between pdo and twsa r 0 5 p 0 01 enso has an important influence on the subtropical high in the western pacific the southeast monsoon and the southwest monsoon thus affecting local precipitation and temperature in china wang et al 2014 positive twsa in the yp is found during the positive phase of enso and vice versa but a significant negative correlation is observed in 2009 2010 r 0 58 p 0 01 fig 8b it is worth noting that enso has the same significant impact on twsa in the indus river basin soni and syed 2015 and yangtze river basin zhang et al 2015 adjacent to yp in 2011 global climate was severely affected by one of the strongest la niña events during the past 60 years causing severe droughts in east africa the central equatorial pacific islands and the southern united states as well as southern africa and australia as well as floods in eastern italy and southern asia are closely related wmo 2011 moreover ao has a strong impact on the climate of the whole mid high latitudes it not only plays an important role in the season but also in the interannual climate changes kong et al 2012 the dramatic changes of enso and ao in the same period led to serious loss of twsa in the yp overall results show that twsa is not only affected by a single climate factor 4 3 2 correlation between precipitation and teleconnection factors in yp analysis of the changing characteristics of twsa analysis of the changing characteristics of twsa at found that twsa is significantly affected by precipitation despite no evident change trend in annual precipitation between 2002 and 2015 here the concepts of pcd was employed as an important index to evaluate regional precipitation heterogeneity zhang et al 2003 fig 9 shows the change trend of pcd and precipitation in the yp it is observed that pcd ranges from 0 47 to 0 62 in 2003 2015 and exhibited an upward trend indicating that the more uneven the annual distribution of precipitation especially after 2009 as shown in fig 4a twsa in summer and autumn exhibited a rising trend implying that precipitation is more concentrated in summer and autumn notably precipitation decreased sharply in 2009 compared with 2008 279 mm less leading to the severe drought in 2009 this suggests that besides precipitation magnitude the distribution characteristics of precipitation is another important influencing factor for twsa to better analyze the influence of teleconnection factors on precipitation the cross wavelet analysis was adopted to analyze the correlation between pcd and teleconnection factors during the past 50 years fig 10 a shows that there was a significant negative correlation between pcd and ao in yp between 1960 and 1970 and between 1975 and 1995 at a period of about 6 9 years and 16 years respectively a significant negative correlation between pcd and enso is observed in 1975 1987 and 1987 2005 with a period of 5 years and 13 years respectively fig 10b while a significant positive correlation between precipitation and pdo is found in 1997 1992 fig 10c there was a significant correlation between precipitation and sunspots fig 10d while there was a 5 13 years negative correlation between sunspots and pcd from 1967 to 2007 the cross wavelet analysis is also used to analyze the correlation between precipitation magnitude and teleconnection factors during the past 50 years fig 11 a shows that there is a significant negative correlation between precipitation and ao in yp between 1960 and 1970 and between 2005 and 2010 while a negative correlation is observed between precipitation magnitude and ao for about 3 5 years in 1968 1973 and 1985 1994 a significant negative correlation is revealed between precipitation magnitude and enso with a period of 2 years and 5 years respectively fig 11b compared with pcd the correlation between precipitation magnitude and pdo is weak fig 11c however compared with other factors the correlation between sunspots and precipitation magnitude is more significant and a positive correlation between sunspots and precipitation is found from 1972 to 2007 fig 11d in general there are resonance periods between precipitation and sunspots enso ao and pdo in yp but with different time domains specifically sunspots enso and ao have significant effects on precipitation process while pdo has relatively weak effects some studies li et al 2010 sun et al 2008 reported that correlations between enso precipitation may be caused by atmospheric teleconnection as pacific asian teleconnection can transmit enso information to asia thus influencing asian monsoon and precipitation anomalies transportation of water vapor from the northwest pacific ocean and bay of bengal to the central and eastern parts of china is enhanced when ao is strong affecting winter precipitation shuai et al 2010 changes in teleconnection factors have different effects on precipitation in the yp the more severe the climate change is the more likely it is to observe distinct distribution characteristics of precipitation which would subsequently affect twsa especially in humid areas with abundant precipitation 5 discussion 5 1 the role of sunspot activities in influencing twsa directly and indirectly as an open system the earth is constantly exchanging materials and energy with its surroundings when discussing the factors affecting climate change it is one sided to consider only the excitation and induction factors within the earth friis christensen and lassen 1991 zhang et al 2008 compared with teleconnection factors the influence of sunspot activities on hydrological process is more complex therefore it is necessary for us to discuss the direct and indirect influences of sunspot activities on twsa in the yp previous studies hancock and yarger 1979 huang et al 2017a have shown that sunspot and atmospheric anomalous circulation factors have strong impacts on precipitation via changing in temperature pressure gradient and solar radiation absorbed by the earth which could directly affect weather system mörner 2003 jia et al 2011 the fig 7d reveals that sunspot activities have a significant positive correlation with twsa during 2002 2005 and 2010 2015 which further indicates that sunspots have direct impacts on twsa in the yp besides sunspot activities may also affect the teleconnection factors through changing the water vapor transport via sst thus indirectly influencing water vapor cycle processes such as precipitation and evaporation kopp et al 2016 maitra et al 2014 therefore we use cross wavelet to analyze the between sunspot and ao fig 12 a and enso fig 12b respectively it is found that there is a significant correlation between sunspots and ao and enso in the 11 years cycle the latest research showed that sunspot activities can affect east asian climate by modulating enso during the 11 years cycle zhou et al 2013 meanwhile based on the magnetic index of solar magnetic field qu et al 2014 shows that the positive and negative phases of ao corresponding to the periods of abnormal warming and partial cooling in the arctic region are driven by solar activity in addition the cycles of precipitation magnitude with ao and enso in yp are 1 4 years and 16 years fig 11a 2 7 years fig 11b respectively there are periods of 1 4 years and 6 9 years fig 10a 2 3 years 6 years and 13 years fig 10b for pcd in the yp respectively moreover the yp has a significant twsa cycle of 12 months and 60 months fig 6 therefore ao and enso may have acted as the media for transmitting sunspot signal to the yp and thus influence local precipitation through atmospheric circulation in general sunspot activities have significant impacts on ao and enso water vapor transport precipitation and twsa the effects are exerted directly and indirectly which ultimately affect twsa in the yp 5 2 physical processes underlying the influence of teleconnection factors on twsa the enso event is accompanied by the equatorial pacific sea surface temperature sst anomaly the sst anomaly affects the western pacific subtropical high and the east asian circulation thus affecting the precipitation anomaly in the tropical ocean zhou et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 during 2007 2010 enso events changed from negative phase la niña to positive phase el niño of fig 8b while the precipitation fig 9 and twsa fig 7b in the yp changed from surplus to deficit and increase of pcd resulted in abnormal precipitation distribution in the yp during the la nia period the northerly wind in the north of china carried the northerly cold water vapor to the southwest of china which pushed the cold air in the northern atmosphere to move to the south of china at this time the southwest region became the convergence area of warm and wet air flow which provided favorable conditions for precipitation in the southwest region zong 2007 hu et al 2013 investigated el niño induced august warm sst anomalies in the eastern tropical and north indian ocean during 1988 2008 as a response to the north indian ocean warming the south asia high extends eastward causing cold horizontal temperature advection to descend this in turn leads to hot days in the southern in late summer through adiabatic warming and reduced rainfall besides gong and wang 1999 analyzed the impact of enso on global land and china s precipitation over the past 100 years and found that the total land precipitation decreased in el niño year and increased in la niña year especially in the equatorial pacific region these connections outline possible physical mechanisms of enso affecting twsa in yp from 2006 to 2010 as shown in fig 8b compared with enso ao is a seesaw structure of sea level barometric changes in high and middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere and its strength directly leads to the reverse fluctuation of barometric pressure and atmospheric mass between the middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere and the arctic chen and kang 2006 in addition the cross wavelet analysis found that in 2009 2010 ao anomaly was weak fig 8a resulting in pcd increase and precipitation decrease fig 9 which further led to a sharp decline in twsa in the yp the water vapor of winter precipitation in the southwest of the yp mainly comes from the warm and wet air flow in the bay of bengal conveyed by the southwest airflow in front of the south branch trough kong et al 2012 showed that during the strong years of ao there were significantly anomalous cyclonic circulations in the bay of bengal with water vapor transported from the bay of bengal to the southwest at the same time the 500 hpa upper troposphere over southwest china is controlled by abnormal upward motion which results in more precipitation in southwest region on the contrary the ao weak year is a significant anomalous anticyclone circulation in the bay of bengal and air flow in the northeastern part of the anomalous circulation controls the southwestern region resulting in less water vapor moreover east asian winter monsoon track is eastward and the cold air reaching the southwest is weak which is not conducive to the convergence of cold and warm air in the southwestern region these factors are not conducive to precipitation in southwest china in general sunspot activities ao and enso all have significant influences on precipitation and twsa in the yp via the process of ao and enso anomalous cyclone western pacific subtropical high southwest airflow east asian circulation precipitation magnitude and pcd twsa 6 conclusions in this study a positive correlation of 0 898 between sms simulated by the vic model and tws is found which provides a new pathway for future inversion of twsa in humid areas by comparing the monthly precipitation and annual groundwater in the yp from 2002 to 2015 the reliability of grace based twsa in the yp is verified it is found that twsa in the yp has distinct seasonal characteristics with a downward trend observed at the monthly seasonal annual and multi year scales at a multi year scale twsa in the yp showed a secular downward trend at the end of 2009 which was consistent with the occurrence of the 2009 severe drought wavelet analysis shows that twsa in the yp has significant periodic signals of about 10 months and 60 months the signal of 10 months is stable while the signal of 60 months is found in four alternating periods during 2002 2015 sunspot ao and enso have strong influence on precipitation magnitude and pcd in yp while pdo is relatively weak when enso is in positive negative phase twsa is often in deficit abundant phase the 2009 extreme drought caused a sharp decrease in twsa which is significantly correlated with ao and enso in general this present study sheds new insight into how teleconnection factors influence the twsa variations thereby effectively guiding

6471,changes in terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa are not only influenced by local climate conditions but also by teleconnection factors to date how teleconnection factors including sunspot activities could affect twsa has been under examined in this study we investigate the twsa dynamics in the yunnan province yp china and assess their relationships with teleconnection factors at multiple timescales results show that 1 grace data is able to reflect twsa dynamics in the study region as demonstrated by its high correlations with soil moisture precipitation and groundwater anomalies 2 grace based twsa shows a downward trend of varying degrees at the monthly seasonal annual and multi year scales with obvious periodic changes of 11 and around 60 months 3 precipitation magnitude and its distribution characteristics in humid areas are the main driving factors of twsa and teleconnection factors have stronger association with precipitation concentration degree pcd than precipitation magnitude 4 the 2009 extreme drought has caused a sharp decrease in twsa and the correlations between twsa with arctic oscillation ao and el niño southern oscillation enso were 0 88 a 0 01 and 0 58 a 0 01 this study sheds new insights into how teleconnection factors could twsa dynamics in a changing environment keywords grace terrestrial water storage dynamics multi time scale teleconnection factors 1 introduction climate variability is a driving factor in land surface water and energy fluxes němec et al 1982 changes in precipitation evaporation snow melting and runoff further contribute to twsa chang and bonnette 2016 which have important implications for assessment of climate change food security water and energy use drought flood risk and etc wang et al 2015 tao et al 2015 guo et al 2019 ming et al 2018 fang et al 2017 2019a therefore the investigation of twsa change is of important significance not only in academia but also in politics and economy traditionally predicting the variation in twsa of a given region is a demanding process as it requires large observational data and sophisticated models now this has been made possible with satellite techniques which allow for observation of various terrestrial hydrological variables seyoum 2018 to observe spatial and temporal changes of earth s gravity field the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the german aerospace center dlr jointly developed the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission in march 2002 ramillien et al 2005 and produced continuous records of twsa globally to date grace based records of twsa have been widely used in the fields of hydrology and climate change for example deng and chen 2017 quantified the impacts of precipitation and air temperature on twsa in central asia over the past decade xu and zhang 2013 studied the seasonal and annual changes of land water storage in the qinghai tibet plateau and the yarlung zangbo river basin and found that with significant seasonal fluctuations annual water storage had a significant downward trend david et al 2011 investigated the annual and interannual terrestrial water storage in australia and explored the linkages with the leading modes of pacific and indian ocean variability recently wang et al 2018 showed that grace based twsa in the global endorheic has decreased at a rate of about 100 billion cubic meter per year between 2002 and 2016 since the accuracy of grace satellite s twsa inversion increases with the increase of regional area many scholars used grace satellite records in large scale region li and rodell 2015 long et al 2017 rodell et al 2018 panda and wahr 2015 however most of previous studies examined twsa dynamics at a specific time scale thus ignoring the dynamics at multiple time scales in this study we first assess the reliability of relatively small scale regional twsa and then investigate its changing characteristics at monthly seasonal annual and multi year scales previous studies have shown that climate change has led to more frequent and severe extreme natural events peterson and hirsch 2013 huang et al 2014 2016 2019 fang et al 2019b especially since the 21st century global extreme events have occurred frequently such as the 2005 hurricane katrina in the united states the 2008 severe floods in southern china the 2018 droughts in australia and recent california forest fires etc since droughts and floods are related to twsa many studies have investigated the effects of global climate teleconnection factors on regional twsa zhang et al 2015 found that el niño la niña event is significantly correlated with high low twsa in the yangtze river basin with a phase lead of 7 8 months in west africa christopher ndehedehe et al 2017 observed that the presence of enso and atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo are responsible for twsa in tropical areas trans niño index showed strong association with stream flow during the warm phase of pdo in the upper klamath lake in the us kennedy et al 2009 previous studies neff et al 2001 ma et al 2007 concerning the influence of teleconnection factors on the twsa mostly focused on the relationship between single factor e g ao zhong et al 2018 enso ni et al 2018 and twsa more teleconnection factors e g sunspot ao enos and pdo need to be further considered to fully reveal the impacts of teleconnection factors on the twsa which could be helpful for predicting twsa in advance additionally the role of sunspot activities in affecting the twsa has been not clarified clearly mörner 2003 and jia et al 2011 have shown that sunspot activities can change the temperature and pressure gradient of the earth s surface by affecting the solar radiation obtained by the earth which is accompanied by the change of the atmospheric circulation thus directly affecting the weather and causing abnormal precipitation besides sunspot activities may also affect the teleconnection factors by changing the water vapor transport via sea surface temperature thus indirectly influencing the water vapor cycle processes such as precipitation and evaporation kopp et al 2016 maitra et al 2014 huang et al 2017b therefore sunspot activities may directly and indirectly impact the twsa which deserves to be further investigated furthermore when considering the relationship between teleconnection factors and twsa direct correlation comparison among them is often used however it is still unrevealed clearly how these teleconnection factors can further affect the twsa dynamic through influencing precipitation including its magnitude and seasonal distribution which is a prospective scientific guidance for future global water resources prediction and utilization to fill this research gap this present study aims to address the issues mentioned above by systematically examining the influence of teleconnection factors on twsa via considering multiple teleconnection factors such as sunspot ao enos and pdo and determine possible dominant factors along with further clarifying the role of sunspot activities in impacting twsa variations in direct and indirect way in addition the precipitation magnitude and precipitation concentration degree pcd of the yp were employed as the medium to further examine linkages between the teleconnection factors and twsa the study area the yp is one of the most humid areas in china yp with forest coverage is as high as 50 hu 2017 the yp lies in the vast asian continent to the north and the vast bay of bengal and south china sea to the south it is in the intersection area of east asian monsoon and south asian monsoon the northwest is also affected by the qinghai tibet plateau forming a complex and diverse climate type in addition the research on twsa in the yp by grace was based on the research on the changes of groundwater storage huang et al 2019 and the monitoring of drought and flood long et al 2014 long et al 2015a b in southwest china and the karst plateau but rarely focuses on the yp especially at the end of 2009 the yp experienced a once in a century drought which covered huge losses to local production and life therefore we can capture the drought event signal so as to better support this study this paper is divided into three parts firstly the twsa dynamics were compared with soil moisture simulated by variability infiltration capacity vic model nijssen et al 1997 the reliability of twsa is also verified by comparing with observed monthly precipitation and annual groundwater data of yp secondly the changing characteristics and their influencing factors of twsa in yp were analyzed at the monthly seasonal annual and multi year timescales finally the cross wavelet analysis is adopted to explore the correlation between twsa and climatic indices which can be used to analyze the driving forces affecting twsa dynamics and thus provide scientific basis for water resources planning and management in yp 2 study area and data 2 1 study area yp 97 31 106 11 e 21 8 29 15 n show in fig 1 covers an area of 394 100 km2 of which 84 is mountainous 10 is plateau and 6 is basin the terrain of this province slopes from the northwest to the southeast is ladder like distribution from north to south the climate in yunnan belongs to the subtropical plateau monsoon subtropical plateau monsoon type the dry and wet seasons are distinct and the vertical variation of temperature with the topography is abnormal there are 16 soil types of which red and yellow acidic soils are dominant the acidic soil has loose texture strong air and water permeability which is conducive to surface water infiltration chen et al 2012 the distribution of rainfall in the whole province is very uneven in seasons and regions the annual precipitation in most places can reach 2200 2700 mm while the minimum is only 584 mm and the annual precipitation in most areas is above 1000 mm there are six major rivers in the province jinsha river nanpan river the yuanjiang river mekong river salween river and irrawaddy river except for the jinsha river and nanpan river they are transnational rivers flowing into the south china sea and indian ocean the favorable climate and environment have made yp the top of the country in terms of animal and plant species known as the kingdom of animals and plants 2 2 grace data in this study the average monthly gravity field between january 2004 and december 2009 was taken as the baseline of the monthly gravity field time series from april 2002 to

the vic model represents the difference of soil moisture conservation ability within a grid cell through the form of spatial probability it also takes into account the two mechanisms of stored full

and other basins abdulla et al 1996 lohmann et al 1998 3 methods 3 1 wavelet transformation wavelet analysis can give information about the time evolution of the spectral properties of a quantity its use is now becoming increasingly more common in climatology oh et al 2003 wavelet transform can be described as labat 2008 3 c a τ 1 a f t ψ t τ a d t where c a τ is the wavelet coefficient as a function of time scale a and time shift τ f t is the original function of time t ψ is the complex conjugate of the wavelet function ψ which roles as the convolution kernel wavelet is a group of functions that can be real or complex wavelet selection depends on the characteristics of the original time series c a τ represents the conditional correlation between the wavelet function ψ and time signal series f t 3 2 cross wavelet transformation the cross wavelet transformation cwt is able to present the correlation between two time series in both time and frequency domains combined with the wavelet transformation and cross spectrum analysis hudgins and huang 1996 the cwt is often used to explore the correlations between two annual hydrological and climatic time series huang et al 2017a b liu et al 2019a b in this study the cwt was mainly employed to investigate resonant periods between the monthly twsa and the monthly teleconnection factors enso ao pdo and sunspot the cwt of two time series xn and yn can be expressed as w xy w x w y where denotes their complex conjugation the cross wavelet power is expressed as w xy the complex argument arg w xy is regarded as the local relative phase between xn and yn in time frequency field the theoretical distribution of the cross wavelet power of the two times series with their background power spectra p k x and p k y torrence and compo 1998 is expressed as follows 4 d w n x s w n y s σ x σ y p z v p v p k x p k y where z v p is the confidence level corresponding to the probability p for a probability distribution function defined by the square root of the two χ 2 distributions grinsted et al 2004 4 results and discussion 4 1 reliability verification of grace based twsa records 4 1 1 comparison of grace twsa with soil moisture simulated by the vic model grace data provide vertically integrated estimates of twsa including changes in snow water equivalent storage swes surface water reservoir storage ress soil moisture storage sms and groundwater storage gws the equation is expressed as tws gws swes ress sms scanlon et al 2015 fig 2 a shows the monthly time series of sms and the tws from april 2002 to december 2010 significant correlations are found between the two times series with the pearson correlation coefficient of 0 898 r 0 898 at a signification level of 0 01 p 0 01 although the amplitude of sms is smaller than that of tws there exhibit similar periodic and trend changes in summer sms and tws reach peak value and there is no obvious lag phenomenon this is because the twsa data is produced at the monthly scale and the high forest coverage rate in yp allows for a sufficient time for surface water infiltration tang and tatemasa 1991 to remove the interannual variation cycle we carried out a 13 month moving average and found that the change trend of sms and tws have similar periodicity and amplitude at a multi year scale r 0 83 p 0 01 overall variation of soil moisture in the yp contributes considerably to twsa at the multi year and interannual time scales however discrepancies are observed at the peak of 2005 and 2007 which may be caused by the error of model bias at the same time both tws and sms show a decreasing trend in winter followed by an upward trend in the spring consistent with the seasonal change pattern of precipitation in the study region decrease of runoff in winter will enhance soil moisture infiltration into groundwater and thus supplying runoff in the direction of horizontal slope while the increase of runoff in the upstream could reduce soil moisture supply leading to a slight upward trend as shown in fig 2b there is a significant positive correlation between sms and tws it should be noted that the vic model simulations by zhang et al 2014 are driven with a high density of meteorological observations from the cma and have been successfully applied in the yangtze river basin zhang et al 2018a b tibet plateau tong et al 2014 and other regions therefore the accuracy of soil moisture in the yp simulated by vic model can be guaranteed in humid areas with abundant precipitation the change trend of soil moisture and twsa tend to show similar characteristics such as in northwest india long et al 2016 illinois state yeh et al 2006 meanwhile being linked with surface water and groundwater soil moisture contains the signal of surface water and groundwater changes to a certain extent another strong evidence shows that soil moisture at 0 40 cm contributes about 42 of twsa in the yp during the drought period of 2009 2010 decrease of soil moisture in the yp directly led to the loss of twsa ma et al 2017 based on five years of in situ observations wang et al 2016 found that soil moisture was relatively larger in the northwest and southeast of the yp and the overall soil moisture increased with the depth therefore the change of soil moisture plays a major role in the change of total water reserves in the study area in general the change trend of sms in the yp is similar to tws which further verifies the reliability of grace in reflecting twsa variations 4 1 2 comparison of twsa with precipitation and groundwater expect for soil moisture the comparison of twsa with precipitation and groundwater also conducted fig 3 shows the monthly time series of twsa precipitation and annual variation of groundwater its exhibition a clear monthly signal with minima occurring in the 2010 distinct maxima in the middle of each year reflects the anomalously strong monsoon seasons comparison of twsa with precipitation shows that fluctuations of twsa in the yp are generally consistent with that of precipitation despite the slight peak lag cao and zhao 2017 the trend of twsa in yp is not obvious during the study period based on records from well levels many scholars have investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of regional groundwater yeh et al 2006 döll et al 2015 bhanja et al 2016 since monthly groundwater level records are not available in the study area we use annual groundwater data released by yunnan provincial hydrological bureau we found a significant positive correlation between them the higher the peak value the greater the groundwater storage r 0 59 p 0 05 in addition the irrigation water in the yp originates from precipitation and runoff which is different from the central valley of america scanlon et al 2015 the annual variation trend of groundwater storage is consistent with twsa here it was demonstrated that the grace based records are reliable for monitoring twsa 4 2 changing characteristics of twsa in the yp analysis of twsa at the monthly seasonal and annual scales shows that twsa in the yp has exhibited distinct seasonal characteristics fig 4 large positive values of twsa are found in summer and autumn while negative twsa values are observed in winter and spring during the study period twsa in showed distinct seasonal variations fig 4a at the monthly scale twsa exhibited a downward trend except for may especially in september fig 4b at the twsa of the yp showed a significant downward trend with the most negative value observed in 2006 and the most positive value in 2008 after 2008 the twsa in the yp tends to decrease progressively fig 4a leading to the severe drought in late 2009 overall since the beginning of the 21st century the twsa in the yp has shown a significant downward trend at multiple scales under global warming to better show the change patterns of twsa at the multi year scale we calculated the accumulated anomaly of twsa it is shown that twsa has a cycle change of about one year which is consistent with that of annual precipitation notably twsa showed a significant overall downward trend at the end of 2009 despite evident seasonal variations during this period a severe once in a century drought occurred in southwest china including the yp droughts have occurred in the yp in 2003 2005 2006 2009 2012 with various intensities and durations however fig 5 only reflects the severe drought disaster in 2009 2012 as small scale drought signals may be canceled out with aggregation of anomalies after 2009 groundwater resources in the yp showed a significant downward trend fig 3 consistent with the drought events experienced in the yp as shown in fig 2a tws exhibits a non stationary change pattern in the rising period of 2003 2004 and 2010 in addition the large scale amplitude phenomena in 2002 2007 and 2012 fig 5 indicate that besides the significant one year periodic changes there may exist other periodic signals in the twsa of yp here we used the wavelet images of twsa in 2002 2015 fig 6 for further illustrations a period of about 12 and 60 months in the yp twsa is observed with four distinct alternations of abundance and decline in 14 years at the end of 2009 the duration and intensity of negative twsa values were obviously higher than those in other periods which coincided with the severe drought experienced by the yp the signal is also weak and insignificant in the period change of about 20 months however the alternation of abundance and decline in 2003 2004 and 2010 explains the anomaly in fig 2a very well it is recognized that twsa include surface water groundwater and soil moisture which are all originated from precipitation changes in climate factors dominates precipitation change patterns ma and xie 2013 meng et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to investigate the relations between climate factors and precipitation to explore the driving forces of twsa in the yp 4 3 the driving force of twsa in the yp 4 3 1 correlation between twsa and teleconnection factors in yp it is important to examine the correlations between climate indices and twsa to better understand the cause of twsa change in yp from a perspective of climate change here the cross wavelet analysis was utilized to investigate the correlations between monthly twsa and monthly ao enso pdo sunspot and precipitation as shown in fig 7 a ao has a statistically significant correlation with twsa at the period of 9 14 months with negative correlation observed in 2002 2003 2007 2009 and 2013 2015 and positive correlations found in 2009 2012 the significance region phase during the period from 2002 to 2003 is about 120 implying that the ao controls twsa for nearly 4 months notably in 2007 2012 the phase of their transitions was approximately about 180 and the sign of correlation changed from negative to positive especially in the concentrated high energy region crimson region around 2010 it is also shown that enso governs twsa with a period of 9 14 month in 2008 and 2011 which is consistent with enso 2 7 years dash et al 2013 except for the negative correlation in 2010 positive correlations are observed in other periods with a significance region phase of about 90 implying that enso exerts a strong influence on twsa for nearly 3 months fig 7c indicates that pdo has a prominently positive correlation with twsa at a 9 14 months scale during 2004 2014 the significance region phase during the period from 2008 to 2011 is about 40 implying that the pdo controls twsa for nearly 1 3 months it s worth noting that sunspot has a positive correlation with twsa at a 9 15 months scale during 2002 2006 the typical sunspot with an 11 yr period lu and zhou 2018 is also reflected in the high and low energy regions of the 9 15 monthly scale signals fig 7d moreover the analyzed of cross wavelet between twsa and precipitation fig 7e showed that precipitation is positively correlated with twsa at a 9 14 months scale during 2002 2015 the mean phase of the significant regions is about 45 implying that precipitation modulates twsa for nearly 1 5 months consistent with the results from fig 3 fig 8 a shows that twsa peaks in the middle and the end of each year while the amplitude of ao is larger in winter and smaller in summer otomi et al 2013 positive twsa in the yp are found during the negative phase of ao with the decrease of ao amplitude and the increase of precipitation in spring and summer twsa reaches its maximum in the middle of the year and shows a negative correlation is observed between ao and twsa however there was a significant positive correlation in 2008 2010 p 0 86 a 0 01 the extreme drought event that occurred at the end of 2009 also caused a sharp decline in twsa and drought events were related to the phase changes of ao r 0 88 p 0 01 and pdo r 0 47 p 0 01 relevant studies jin 2018 kang et al 2015 show that there was a significant positive correlation between ao and twsa in the sub basins of the yangtze river basin r 0 5 p 0 01 especially in the southwest of china in 2009 the severe drought has a significant correlation with enso and ao similar to ao twsa in the yp are mostly in deficit period during the positive phase of pdo fig 8c with decrease of twsa in 2008 2010 a significant negative correlation is found between pdo and twsa r 0 5 p 0 01 enso has an important influence on the subtropical high in the western pacific the southeast monsoon and the southwest monsoon thus affecting local precipitation and temperature in china wang et al 2014 positive twsa in the yp is found during the positive phase of enso and vice versa but a significant negative correlation is observed in 2009 2010 r 0 58 p 0 01 fig 8b it is worth noting that enso has the same significant impact on twsa in the indus river basin soni and syed 2015 and yangtze river basin zhang et al 2015 adjacent to yp in 2011 global climate was severely affected by one of the strongest la niña events during the past 60 years causing severe droughts in east africa the central equatorial pacific islands and the southern united states as well as southern africa and australia as well as floods in eastern italy and southern asia are closely related wmo 2011 moreover ao has a strong impact on the climate of the whole mid high latitudes it not only plays an important role in the season but also in the interannual climate changes kong et al 2012 the dramatic changes of enso and ao in the same period led to serious loss of twsa in the yp overall results show that twsa is not only affected by a single climate factor 4 3 2 correlation between precipitation and teleconnection factors in yp analysis of the changing characteristics of twsa analysis of the changing characteristics of twsa at found that twsa is significantly affected by precipitation despite no evident change trend in annual precipitation between 2002 and 2015 here the concepts of pcd was employed as an important index to evaluate regional precipitation heterogeneity zhang et al 2003 fig 9 shows the change trend of pcd and precipitation in the yp it is observed that pcd ranges from 0 47 to 0 62 in 2003 2015 and exhibited an upward trend indicating that the more uneven the annual distribution of precipitation especially after 2009 as shown in fig 4a twsa in summer and autumn exhibited a rising trend implying that precipitation is more concentrated in summer and autumn notably precipitation decreased sharply in 2009 compared with 2008 279 mm less leading to the severe drought in 2009 this suggests that besides precipitation magnitude the distribution characteristics of precipitation is another important influencing factor for twsa to better analyze the influence of teleconnection factors on precipitation the cross wavelet analysis was adopted to analyze the correlation between pcd and teleconnection factors during the past 50 years fig 10 a shows that there was a significant negative correlation between pcd and ao in yp between 1960 and 1970 and between 1975 and 1995 at a period of about 6 9 years and 16 years respectively a significant negative correlation between pcd and enso is observed in 1975 1987 and 1987 2005 with a period of 5 years and 13 years respectively fig 10b while a significant positive correlation between precipitation and pdo is found in 1997 1992 fig 10c there was a significant correlation between precipitation and sunspots fig 10d while there was a 5 13 years negative correlation between sunspots and pcd from 1967 to 2007 the cross wavelet analysis is also used to analyze the correlation between precipitation magnitude and teleconnection factors during the past 50 years fig 11 a shows that there is a significant negative correlation between precipitation and ao in yp between 1960 and 1970 and between 2005 and 2010 while a negative correlation is observed between precipitation magnitude and ao for about 3 5 years in 1968 1973 and 1985 1994 a significant negative correlation is revealed between precipitation magnitude and enso with a period of 2 years and 5 years respectively fig 11b compared with pcd the correlation between precipitation magnitude and pdo is weak fig 11c however compared with other factors the correlation between sunspots and precipitation magnitude is more significant and a positive correlation between sunspots and precipitation is found from 1972 to 2007 fig 11d in general there are resonance periods between precipitation and sunspots enso ao and pdo in yp but with different time domains specifically sunspots enso and ao have significant effects on precipitation process while pdo has relatively weak effects some studies li et al 2010 sun et al 2008 reported that correlations between enso precipitation may be caused by atmospheric teleconnection as pacific asian teleconnection can transmit enso information to asia thus influencing asian monsoon and precipitation anomalies transportation of water vapor from the northwest pacific ocean and bay of bengal to the central and eastern parts of china is enhanced when ao is strong affecting winter precipitation shuai et al 2010 changes in teleconnection factors have different effects on precipitation in the yp the more severe the climate change is the more likely it is to observe distinct distribution characteristics of precipitation which would subsequently affect twsa especially in humid areas with abundant precipitation 5 discussion 5 1 the role of sunspot activities in influencing twsa directly and indirectly as an open system the earth is constantly exchanging materials and energy with its surroundings when discussing the factors affecting climate change it is one sided to consider only the excitation and induction factors within the earth friis christensen and lassen 1991 zhang et al 2008 compared with teleconnection factors the influence of sunspot activities on hydrological process is more complex therefore it is necessary for us to discuss the direct and indirect influences of sunspot activities on twsa in the yp previous studies hancock and yarger 1979 huang et al 2017a have shown that sunspot and atmospheric anomalous circulation factors have strong impacts on precipitation via changing in temperature pressure gradient and solar radiation absorbed by the earth which could directly affect weather system mörner 2003 jia et al 2011 the fig 7d reveals that sunspot activities have a significant positive correlation with twsa during 2002 2005 and 2010 2015 which further indicates that sunspots have direct impacts on twsa in the yp besides sunspot activities may also affect the teleconnection factors through changing the water vapor transport via sst thus indirectly influencing water vapor cycle processes such as precipitation and evaporation kopp et al 2016 maitra et al 2014 therefore we use cross wavelet to analyze the between sunspot and ao fig 12 a and enso fig 12b respectively it is found that there is a significant correlation between sunspots and ao and enso in the 11 years cycle the latest research showed that sunspot activities can affect east asian climate by modulating enso during the 11 years cycle zhou et al 2013 meanwhile based on the magnetic index of solar magnetic field qu et al 2014 shows that the positive and negative phases of ao corresponding to the periods of abnormal warming and partial cooling in the arctic region are driven by solar activity in addition the cycles of precipitation magnitude with ao and enso in yp are 1 4 years and 16 years fig 11a 2 7 years fig 11b respectively there are periods of 1 4 years and 6 9 years fig 10a 2 3 years 6 years and 13 years fig 10b for pcd in the yp respectively moreover the yp has a significant twsa cycle of 12 months and 60 months fig 6 therefore ao and enso may have acted as the media for transmitting sunspot signal to the yp and thus influence local precipitation through atmospheric circulation in general sunspot activities have significant impacts on ao and enso water vapor transport precipitation and twsa the effects are exerted directly and indirectly which ultimately affect twsa in the yp 5 2 physical processes underlying the influence of teleconnection factors on twsa the enso event is accompanied by the equatorial pacific sea surface temperature sst anomaly the sst anomaly affects the western pacific subtropical high and the east asian circulation thus affecting the precipitation anomaly in the tropical ocean zhou et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 during 2007 2010 enso events changed from negative phase la niña to positive phase el niño of fig 8b while the precipitation fig 9 and twsa fig 7b in the yp changed from surplus to deficit and increase of pcd resulted in abnormal precipitation distribution in the yp during the la nia period the northerly wind in the north of china carried the northerly cold water vapor to the southwest of china which pushed the cold air in the northern atmosphere to move to the south of china at this time the southwest region became the convergence area of warm and wet air flow which provided favorable conditions for precipitation in the southwest region zong 2007 hu et al 2013 investigated el niño induced august warm sst anomalies in the eastern tropical and north indian ocean during 1988 2008 as a response to the north indian ocean warming the south asia high extends eastward causing cold horizontal temperature advection to descend this in turn leads to hot days in the southern in late summer through adiabatic warming and reduced rainfall besides gong and wang 1999 analyzed the impact of enso on global land and china s precipitation over the past 100 years and found that the total land precipitation decreased in el niño year and increased in la niña year especially in the equatorial pacific region these connections outline possible physical mechanisms of enso affecting twsa in yp from 2006 to 2010 as shown in fig 8b compared with enso ao is a seesaw structure of sea level barometric changes in high and middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere and its strength directly leads to the reverse fluctuation of barometric pressure and atmospheric mass between the middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere and the arctic chen and kang 2006 in addition the cross wavelet analysis found that in 2009 2010 ao anomaly was weak fig 8a resulting in pcd increase and precipitation decrease fig 9 which further led to a sharp decline in twsa in the yp the water vapor of winter precipitation in the southwest of the yp mainly comes from the warm and wet air flow in the bay of bengal conveyed by the southwest airflow in front of the south branch trough kong et al 2012 showed that during the strong years of ao there were significantly anomalous cyclonic circulations in the bay of bengal with water vapor transported from the bay of bengal to the southwest at the same time the 500 hpa upper troposphere over southwest china is controlled by abnormal upward motion which results in more precipitation in southwest region on the contrary the ao weak year is a significant anomalous anticyclone circulation in the bay of bengal and air flow in the northeastern part of the anomalous circulation controls the southwestern region resulting in less water vapor moreover east asian winter monsoon track is eastward and the cold air reaching the southwest is weak which is not conducive to the convergence of cold and warm air in the southwestern region these factors are not conducive to precipitation in southwest china in general sunspot activities ao and enso all have significant influences on precipitation and twsa in the yp via the process of ao and enso anomalous cyclone western pacific subtropical high southwest airflow east asian circulation precipitation magnitude and pcd twsa 6 conclusions in this study a positive correlation of 0 898 between sms simulated by the vic model and tws is found which provides a new pathway for future inversion of twsa in humid areas by comparing the monthly precipitation and annual groundwater in the yp from 2002 to 2015 the reliability of grace based twsa in the yp is verified it is found that twsa in the yp has distinct seasonal characteristics with a downward trend observed at the monthly seasonal annual and multi year scales at a multi year scale twsa in the yp showed a secular downward trend at the end of 2009 which was consistent with the occurrence of the 2009 severe drought wavelet analysis shows that twsa in the yp has significant periodic signals of about 10 months and 60 months the signal of 10 months is stable while the signal of 60 months is found in four alternating periods during 2002 2015 sunspot ao and enso have strong influence on precipitation magnitude and pcd in yp while pdo is relatively weak when enso is in positive negative phase twsa is often in deficit abundant phase the 2009 extreme drought caused a sharp decrease in twsa which is significantly correlated with ao and enso in general this present study sheds new insight into how teleconnection factors influence the twsa variations thereby effectively guiding

6472,litter and vegetation under forest canopy i e understory vegetation are known to reduce soil erosion and contribute substantially to evapotranspiration however previous studies rarely examined understory water interception we conducted a comprehensive study of rainfall partitioning using a water balance equation that included both overstory and understory components in a chinese fir cunninghamia lanceolata plantation and a nearby naturally regenerated castanopsis c carlesii forest of similar age in southeastern china understory interception was measured by submerging understory components vegetation and litter in water for 24 h which gave an estimate of the amount of water retained i e water holding capacity the total interception loss of rainfall events 9 8 mm that generated surface runoff converged between the two forests a result of a smaller overstory interception loss 20 coupled with a greater understory interception loss 14 in the chinese fir plantation relative to the castanopsis forest overstory 25 and understory 11 the convergence of the total interception contributed to the convergence of the surface runoff 1 of the rainfall in both forests furthermore the throughfall partition 78 was greater whereas the stemflow partition 2 was smaller in the chinese fir plantation relative to the castanopsis forest throufhfall 70 and stemflow 5 these patterns in rainfall partitioning could be explained by the greater development of the understory vegetation hence greater understory interception loss in the chinese fir plantation lower canopy leaf area index hence smaller overstory interception loss and greater throughfall and rougher barks hence smaller stemflow of chinese fir trees compared to that of castanopsis trees our study illustrated that a comprehensive evaluation of interception loss must take into account understory components keywords chinese fir plantation forest conversion hydrological cycle rainfall partitioning understory interception 1 introduction rainfall intercepted by forest canopies is typically partitioned into interception loss i throughfall and stemflow cuartas et al 2007 park and cameron 2008 barbier et al 2009 rainfall partitioning affects the amount of water available for evaporation soil infiltration and groundwater recharge savenije 2004 fan et al 2014a therefore it is of great ecological importance rainfall partitioning is strongly influenced by the biotic characteristics of a forest such as plant density layers of tree canopies species composition leaf area index lai and hydrophobicity of foliage zhang et al 2006 park and cameron 2008 geißler et al 2012 fan et al 2014b livesley et al 2014 sun et al 2017 yang et al 2019 and abiotic factors such as climatic conditions e g rainfall intensity and quantity water temperature land use history e g forest type and age and management practices crockford and richardson 2000 staelens et al 2008 kaushal et al 2017 del campo et al 2018 klamerus iwan and błońska 2018 both throughfall and stemflow as proportions of gross rainfall vary tremendously depending on factors such as forest type forest age tree density and season i e foliated versus senescence seasons levia and frost 2003 dietz et al 2006 llorens and domingo 2007 barbier et al 2009 moreover stemflow and throughfall except free throughfall or rainfall that falls through canopy gaps are observable only after interception capacity is reached rainfall that is not intercepted by the forest canopy and evaporated back to the atmosphere moves downward as throughfall or stemflow which is then redistributed by understory vegetation and litter before eventually reaching the soil the interception loss by these understory components contributes to total interception loss and thereby reduces surface runoff as well as soil water and groundwater recharge putuhena and cordery 1996 li et al 2014 using simulated rainfall it has been shown that on an individual tree basis water storage capacity of litter is several times greater than that of the crown li et al 2017 therefore a complete account of interception loss is indispensable for a thorough understanding of rainfall partitioning and surface runoff most studies of interception loss have focused on overstory components whereas the role of understory vegetation and litter is rarely examined helvey and patric 1965 guevara escobar et al 2007 understory vegetation has been shown to effectively reduce soil erosion especially during heavy storms ghahramani et al 2011 a study in the hilly southern china indicates that effective control of soil and water loss is closely related to both overstory and understory plants zheng et al 2008 examining evapotranspiration from understory vegetation iida et al 2009 concluded that the understory vegetation was one of the most important components of the hydrologic cycle in an eastern siberian boreal larch forest using isotopic composition of water vapor yepez et al 2003 estimated that understory vegetation accounted for 30 of the total evapotranspiration in a semiarid savanna woodland in addition to understory vegetation litter layer also plays an important role in reducing soil erosion by absorbing impact energy of raindrops geddes and dunkerley 1999 miura 2000 litter layer may also help limit water loss through evaporation and enhance water infiltration studies have shown that litter layer is an important component in forest hydrological cycle helvey and patric 1965 sato et al 2004 guevara escobar et al 2007 especially in regulating runoff and reducing soil erosion miyata et al 2009 liu et al 2017 thus the negligence of interception by understory components could be an important caveat of forest hydrology studies soil infiltration is often derived from water balance equations by computing the difference between precipitation and the total of interception loss and surface runoff thus the amount of water infiltrating into the soil can be overestimated if understory interception is not taken into consideration understory interception could be particularly important in forest plantations forest plantations are typically thinned to improve stem quality and reduce the time needed for trees to reach valuable sawlog size resulting in predictable structural changes with a sparser overstory canopy compared to natural forests the sparse overstory canopy allows greater light penetration and increases understory light availability which could trigger vigorous growth of understory vegetation leading to a large quantity of water interception yet the effects of understory interception on reducing surface runoff in forest plantations are rarely examined chinese fir cunninghamia lanceolata is the most dominant tree species of forest plantations by acreage comprising 24 or 17 million hectares of the forest plantations in china and 6 3 in the world fao 2006 with many of the plantations converted from natural forests the effects of natural forest conservation to plantations on hydrological processes have long been a major concern calder et al 1993 van dijk and keenan 2007 studies have shown that the establishment of forest plantations could change patterns of canopy interception iroumé and huber 2002 and increases fast runoff malmer 1992 and streamflow yields rowe and pearce 1994 furthermore rainfall partitioning in forest plantations is also known to vary considerably depending on the tree species being planted sadeghi et al 2016 a large number of studies have evaluated the effect of such forest conversion on biogeochemical processes fan et al 1999 wang et al 2004 guo et al 2005 few studies however have compared hydrological processes between chinese fir plantations and natural forests but see yang et al 2018 despite that the hydrological consequences associated with such large scaled conversion of natural forests to chinese fir plantations are likely substantial in this study we compared rainfall partitioning between a chinese fir cunninghamia lanceolata plantation converted from a natural castanopsis forest and a natural castanopsis c carlesii forest in southeastern china the chinese fir plantation has a lower canopy lai as a result of artificial thinning consequently the chinese fir plantation has a more developed understory vegetation associated with more open canopy compared to the castanopsis forest fang et al 1998 xu et al 2014 by comparing the differences in rainfall partitioning between the chinese fir plantation and natural castanopsis forest we aimed to address the following questions first what are the potential consequences in rainfall partitioning from converting natural forests to chinese fir plantations second what are the relative contribution of understory interception versus overstory interception to total interception third are understory components significant players in regulating surface runoff we expect that compared to the natural forest the chinese fir plantation should have a smaller overstory canopy interception loss and hence a greater throughfall which in combination with their denser understory vegetation could lead to an increased understory interception loss the increase in understory interception loss in the chinese fir plantation could be sufficiently large to compensate for its smaller overstory canopy interception loss leading to a convergence in total interception loss and surface runoff between the chinese fir plantation and the natural forest despite their large differences in vegetation structure and species composition 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted at chenda town 26 19 n 117 36 e sanming city of fujian in southeastern china fig 1 the elevation ranges from 310 m to 420 m and the slope varies from 25 to 45 the region has a subtropical monsoonal climate with annual mean temperature of 20 1 c and mean annual precipitation of 1670 mm 80 of which occurs between march and august the soils exceed 1 m in thickness for most of the study area which were developed from granite and can be classified as a sandy clay ferric acrisol according to the fao unesco classification system the chinese fir plantation and the castanopsis forest study sites are 600 m apart in each of the two forests three 20 20 m plots with similar elevations ca 300 m 330 m and slope steepness ca 33 36 were established the chinese fir plantation was converted from a natural castanopsis forest following clear cutting and burning in 1976 the understory of the chinese fir plantation was dominated by a species of fern dicranopteris pedata and saplings of millettia dielsiana adinandra millettii and eurya nitida the castanopsis forest is a secondary forest regenerated from a natural castanopsis forest which was selectively cut at a high intensity 85 in 1976 the dominant canopy species of the castanopsis forest is c carlesii approximately 80 with other common canopy species including c fissa schima superba and camellia oleifera the understory species of the castanopsis forest was dominated by a species of sedge gahnia tristis and saplings of ormosia xylocarpa rapanea neriifolia and syzygium buxifolium the understory layer was generally lower than 1 5 m in both forests the slope aspect and steepness of our selected forests are representative of secondary forests in the region which are gradually replaced by chinese fir plantations thus we considered a comprehensive monitoring of the two forests would provide more reliable results for the characteristics of forest rainfall partitioning in the region than a study using smaller plots scattered across several forests canopy lai was measured with a plant canopy analyzer model lai 2000 li cor inc lincolin nebraska usa and canopy gap fraction was estimated from hemispherical photographs using gla version 2 0 lyu et al 2014 tree height diameter at breath height dbh and gap fraction were greater in the chinese fir plantation than the castanopsis forest whereas tree density and canopy lai were lower in the plantation than the castanopsis forest lyu et al 2014 understory vegetation cover of the chinese fir plantation was greater than that of the castanopsis forest table 1 litter depth is similar between the two forests ca 2 cm but was spatially more variable in the chinese fir plantation soils of the chinese fir plantation have a higher bulk density higher ph lower organic matter content and lower total nitrogen compared to that of the castanopsis forest table 1 li et al 2016 2 2 sample collection 2 2 1 rainfall rainfall and other meteorological variables such as temperature and humidity were measured with a micro weather station rr 1008 rain root company peking china installed at a forest clearing on a middle slope near the castanopsis forest fig 1 rainfall quantity was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge with 314 cm2 orifice and 0 20 mm per tipping because the two forests are only 600 m apart and the differences in daily rainfall were extremely small between our weather station and another weather station that is 1 km northeast to our study site r2 0 9984 fig s1 we assumed that the differences in gross rainfall between the two forests are minimal 2 2 2 throughfall and stemflow between january 2013 and december 2014 throughfall stemflow and runoff were measured for each rainfall event defined as rainfall greater than 5 mm occurring after a dry period of at least 6 h rainfall smaller than 5 mm typically did not generate throughfall or surface runoff throughfall was collected using cylindrical buckets connected to a funnel with a diameter of 65 cm 3317 cm2 at 1 5 m above ground the funnel was made of stainless steel with a vertical rim and a slope angle of 45 the cylindrical buckets were made of polyvinyl chloride pvc with a diameter of 30 cm and a height of 100 cm a polyethylene screen 3 3 mm was placed above each funnel to prevent debris from entering the bucket initially twelve throughfall collectors were placed at random in each plot with a total of 36 collectors in each forest because we aimed to compare the differences in rainfall partitioning between the two forests rather than to quantify the spatial variability in rainfall partitioning at each forest of the 12 collectors in each plot only the three with the throughfall quantities closest to the plot mean were retained after a two month monitoring period i e nine collectors for each forest spatial variability of throughfall can be high in forests with heterogeneous tree canopies and a large number of collectors might be necessary to obtain reliable estimates levia and frost 2006 zimmermann et al 2010 zimmermann and zimmermann 2014 fang et al 1998 however a study on spatial variability of throughfall in a subtropical natural forest indicated that although 5 17 collectors each with a collection area of 314 cm2 were required to obtain the throughfall volume that is within 10 of the population mean at 95 confidence level for individual rainfall events seven collectors were sufficient on a long term basis when multiple storms were combined lin et al 1997 we had nine throughfall collectors each with a collection area of 3317 cm2 with a total collection area 3 0 m2 for each forest we compared the means of the three collectors and the 12 collectors in each plot and the r2s were all greater than 0 95 thus we believe that the three collectors selected for each plot should be representative of the plot and the throughfall quantities obtained should be sufficient to reflect the overall differences between the two forests stemflow was collected using a vinyl tube with an inner diameter of 2 5 cm that was cut and wrapped spirally around the stem of a tree at a height of 1 3 m and the tube was connected to a pvc cylindrical bucket with a cover on the ground the trees were divided into five dbh categories 8 12 cm 12 16 cm 16 20 cm 20 24 cm and 24 cm initially stemflow was monitored on three trees of each dbh category in each plot with a total of 45 trees in each forest but only one of the three trees with the stemflow quantity closest to the category mean was retained after a two month monitoring period i e 15 trees for each forest we added 1 2 pvc buckets to those trees with a dbh greater than 20 cm to avoid overflow 2 2 3 biomass and water storage capacity of understory vegetation and litter three subplots within each plot i e nine samples for each forest were used to estimate the biomass of understory vegetation in august 2015 while the subplots in the chinese fir plantation were 1 1 m as often used in the sampling of understory vegetation fang et al 1998 the subplots in the castanopsis forest were larger 2 2 m due to the lower understory vegetation cover in this forest type see 3 3 rainfall interception loss by understory vegetation and litter in each subplot aboveground parts of all living plants 1 5 m in height above the litter layer were removed dried for 48 h at 60 c and weighed again to estimate the biomass another three subplots 1 1 m were used to estimate litter biomass i e nine samples for each forest in each subplot all litter was removed oven dried for 48 h at 60 c and weighed again to estimate the biomass water storage capacities of the understory vegetation and litter were measured in june 2015 fresh understory vegetation and litter were collected from each site and four replicates of approximately 50 g of understory vegetation and 30 g of litter were each placed in a nylon mesh bag with minimal disturbance mesh size 2 2 mm bag size 20 20 cm the thickness of litter in the bag was 2 1 cm which was similar to what we observed in the field these samples were submerged in water and weighed at 10 min 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 4 h 8 h 16 h and 24 h at each time interval bags were taken out of the water and weighed after the water stopped dripping out of the bags the same submerging procedure was applied to three empty nylon mesh bags to measure water storage by the bags the mean of which was subtracted from the sample weighs at each time intervals to obtain water storage by the understory components after the last measurement the understory vegetation and litter in each mesh bag were oven dried for 48 h at 60 c and weighed again to get the dry mass following lei 1984 hao and wang 1998 and sato et al 2004 we determined the water storage capacity of the understory components by soaking in water for 24 h and then weighed w24 interception loss of understory components was calculated by subtracting their fresh mass from w24 see eq 5 a study using simulated rainfall to estimate litter water retention in a cryptomeria japonica plantation and a lithocarpus edulis plantation showed that the litter was saturated when rainfall events lasted more than 5 h sato et al 2004 an early field study by helvey 1964 also indicated that when storms were large enough litter was saturated with water putuhena and cordery 1996 by watering litter showed that the amount of water retained by litter can be reliably estimated at the time when the amount of water drained was constant which is in principle the same as our method of estimating the wet weight of the litter at the point when the water stopped dripping out of the bags because small rainfall events without measurable surface runoff are less likely to saturate understory components we assumed that only rainfall events that have measurable surface runoff 9 8 mm are large enough to saturate understory vegetation and litter in this study therefore we used only such rainfall events a total of 78 to calculate understory interception capacity to test the validity of this approach we conducted a field experiment in july 2016 following a 33 6 mm rainfall event and the results supported this assumption supplemental information we chose this event because the rainfall amount was very close to the mean 35 mm of the 78 rainfall events that resulted in measurable runoff the result from the field experiment was in agreement with the result from the soaking drying method supplementary information supporting the validity of our estimates of understory interception capacity 2 2 4 surface runoff and soil infiltration rate for each forest site three bounded runoff plots of 20 m 5 m 100 m2 were established on the slope to collect the surface runoff the plots were hydrologically isolated by pvc dividers height 60 cm thickness 0 7 cm that were driven 30 cm into the ground a collecting trapezoidal flume was placed at the bottom outlet of each plot and angled to direct the runoff to a covered stainless steel tank of 1 1 1 m 1 m3 adjusted to a horizontal position after each rainfall event the runoff collected in the tanks was measured and the tanks were thoroughly cleaned for the next rainfall event the soil infiltration rate was measured in the laboratory using the constant head falling method sfb 1999 based on the application of darcy s law darcy 1856 to a saturated soil column a ring cutter with a volume of 100 cm3 diameter 50 46 mm height 50 mm was used to take intact soil samples the soil samples were saturated with water for 24 h and then measured with the constant head falling of 5 cm over 2 h taking temperature into consideration hazen 1892 and for the purpose of cross site comparisons the soil infiltration rate at 10 k10 was calculated as k 10 mm min k t 0 7 0 03 t where t is the water temperature and kt mm min is soil infiltration rate at t k 10 mm min is soil infiltration rate at 10 2 3 data calculation a throughfall tf mm for a plot was calculated as 1 tf v tf a where vtf is the total collected throughfall volume l a is the total collection area m2 of the funnels in a plot b stemflow sf mm for a plot was calculated as 2 sf σ i 1 n d i s i s where n is the number of tree dbh categories di is the average stemflow depth mm stemflow depth of each

calculated as 4 sr v sr s where vsr is the volume of surface runoff l s is the area of the plot 100 m2 e interception loss of understory vegetation iv mm and litter il mm for a plot was calculated as

understory vegetation or litter upon collection m is the total biomass of understory vegetation or litter t ha 1 of the plot 400 m2 in our study wn is 169 and 175 for understory vegetation 13 and 41 for litter in the chinese fir planation and the catanopsis forest respectively these values are very close to the annual means of 136 and 152 for understory vegetation 12 and 41 for litter in the chinese fir plantation and the catanopsis forest respectively yang unpublished data from the above calculations we developed a comprehensive water balance equation that included the understory components p ic iv il sr si si soil infiltration tf sf iv il sr si because small rainfall events without surface runoff may not saturate understory components understory interception loss could not be estimated with confidence thus the water balance equation was applied to the 78 rainfall events that had measurable surface runoff for modeling rainfall partitioning in the two forests the 78 events represented 85 of the total rainfall at the study site during the study period 2 4 statistical analyses each rainfall event was treated as an independent sample throughfall stemflow canopy interception loss and surface runoff data were not normally distributed shapiro wilk test all p 0 05 thus we compared the differences between the two forests using wilcoxon rank sum tests given that the medians and means are similar for these variables we presented means standard error in the results section additionally the relationships between rainfall partitioning tf sf ic sr and rainfall amount p were examined using linear regression models all statistics were performed using r r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria 3 results 3 1 rainfall characteristics the rainfall patterns at the study site during the study period were typical of the region which is characterized by wet spring summer and dry autumn winter wang and lin 2002 one hundred and two rainfall events were recorded at the study site between january 2013 and december 2014 with a total precipitation of 3260 mm fig 2 seventy seven percent of the rainfall events occurred in the spring and summer contributing to 82 of the total precipitation fig 2 the mean rainless interval between two consecutive rainfall events was seven days with 33 events separated by less than three days 3 2 throughfall

3 4 soil infiltration rate the soil infiltration rate was smaller in the chinese fir plantation than in the castanopsis forest and the difference was most pronounced in the first hour fig 5 initially the infiltration rate in the chinese fir plantation was less than 10 mm min 1 while that in the castanopsis forest was more than 20 mm min 1 fig 5 3 5 rainfall partitioning fig 6 summarizes rainfall partitioning in the two forests for all rainfall events having measurable surface runoff n 78 which comprised 85 of the total rainfall during the study period for the overstory layer the chinese fir plantation had greater throughfall smaller canopy interception loss and smaller stemflow than the castanopsis forest for the understory layer the chinese fir plantation had smaller litter interception loss but greater understory vegetation interception loss litter 6 3 understory vegetation 8 5 than the castanopsis forest litter 8 4 understory vegetation 3 2 based on our water balance equation p ic iv il sr si the rainfall that infiltrated into the soils was 65 13 in the chinese fir plantation and 63 12 in the castanopsis forest 4 discussion 4 1 forest structural dynamics can promote convergence of interception loss the structures of overstory and understory layers in a forest are dynamically linked a more open canopy typically lets in more light leading to a denser understory layer such dynamics could promote convergence in total interception loss across structurally different forests previous studies of forest hydrology rarely included understory interception possibly due to the difficulty in accurately measuring understory interception but see li et al 2017 however our findings strongly suggest that the structural dynamics of overstory and understory layers can be an important mechanism underlying the observed convergence of surface runoff between natural forests and forest plantations despite the large differences in tree density lai and understory vegetation cover we showed that total interception loss converged between the chinese fir plantation 34 and the natural forest 36 therefore we urge future studies to not only consider understory components in forest hydrological processes but also evaluate quantitative relationships between interception loss and specific properties of understory components e g percent cover biomass water storage capacity 4 2 overstory rainfall partitioning overstory interception is affected by many factors such as canopy structure e g a diverse tree composition increases interception huber and iroumé 2001 and foliar arrangement e g needle leaves retain more water than foliage of hardwood trees keim et al 2006 barbier et al 2009 however the most important factor is likely the area of intercepting chinese fir plantations are typically managed at low stand densities e g 1791 stems ha 1 in our studied forest in order to obtain greater wood production per tree and consequently they tend to have a lower canopy lai compared to natural forests in this study the lower lai of the chinese fir plantation 3 1 compared to that of the castanopsis forest 4 0 could explain the 5 smaller canopy interception loss in the chinese fir plantation than in the castanopsis forest therefore the difference in canopy interception between the two forests was likely due to their difference in the area of intercepting i e lai smaller canopy interception loss can subsequently lead to larger throughfall and stemflow therefore it is not surprising to find a greater throughfall in the chinese fir plantation than the castanopsis forest fig 6 interestingly stemflow was actually smaller in the chinese fir plantation possibly due to their higher bark water storage capacity than c carlesii yang unpublished data indeed previous studies suggest that bark storage capacity is an important factor determining stemflow quantity smooth bark generates more stemflow than rough bark aboal et al 1999 levia and herwitz 2005 our study adds to the increasing body of evidence that forest management practices can have major effects on overstory rainfall partitioning a careful selection of tree species with respect to their bark storage capacity and a thinning regime designed to balance wood production and canopy lai can help increase overstory interception loss in forest plantations 4 3 understory rainfall partitioning both throughfall and stemflow are sources of under canopy precipitation in this study the chinese fir plantation had 8 greater throughfall and 3 smaller stemflow than the castanopsis forest giving a net 5 greater under canopy precipitation after taking into account of the 3 greater understory interception loss the chinese fir plantation should still have an excess of 2 greater rainwater for either soil infiltration or surface runoff since the surface runoff was similar between the two forests our rainfall partitioning equation dictates that soil infiltration must be 2 greater in the chinese fir plantation greater soil infiltration can be a result of greater soil infiltration rate greater stemflow and or greater throughfall since soil infiltration rate was lower and the stemflow smaller in the chinese fir plantation than the castanopsis forest the most likely explanation for the greater soil infiltration in the chinese fir plantation is the greater throughfall understory vegetation and litter can facilitate throughfall entering the soil rather than becoming surface runoff it has been reported that it takes longer for rainwater to saturate litter than the overstory canopy li et al 2017 although not tested it is likely that the saturation of understory plant surface also takes longer than that overstory canopy as a result of time lag and the reduction in water quantity due to overstory interception thus the damping of the litter layer and understory plants may also help extend the retention of water within the forest by slowing down water movement and allowing more time for rainwater to enter the soil the denser understory vegetation and litter in the chinese fir plantation could be responsible for its 2 greater soil infiltration than the castanopsis forest in this case study the denser understory vegetation and litter in the chinese fir plantation than the castanopsis forest were sufficient to prevent an excess of surface runoff in the chinese fir plantation through two mechanisms the first one is an increase in understory interception loss and the second is an increase in soil infiltration our estimates although not without uncertainties suggest that these two mechanisms driven by the same understory components are likely of similar importance in terms of the amounts of rainwater diverted away from surface runoff 3 increase in interception loss and 2 increase in soil infiltration 4 4 uncertainties and limitations in the estimates of understory interception there are several uncertainties and limitations in our estimates of understory interception first the natural water content of understory vegetation and litter wn was measured on the third day after a rainfall event therefore the difference between w24 and wn i e w24 wn is likely an underestimate for understory interception if rainfall events were separated by more than three days while an overestimate if rainfall events were separated by less than three days to evaluate the robustness of this approach we also calculated il from the litter drying curve which were 1 55 mm and 1 70 mm for the chinese fir plantation and the catanopsis forest respectively these il were close to that measured on the third day after the rainfall event 1 30 mm and 1 80 mm for the chinese fir plantation and the catanopsis forest respectively a second potential source of uncertainty is our use of fixed location for throughfall and stemflow collection previous studies have shown that relocating the collectors could provide estimates with low variability high precision and accuracy ritter and regalado 2014 fan et al 2015 a third source of uncertainty is that we did one time measurement which would not capture seasonal variation in water storage capacities of understory vegetation and litter based on our field observation however we believe that seasonal variation in these two evergreen forests are small and should not affect the robustness of our estimates a fourth source of uncertainty is that the evaporation loss from understory vegetation and litter during rainfall was not measured the lack of consideration of during rainfall evaporation would lead to underestimation of understory interception loss despite this underestimation our estimates still suggest that understory interception is an important component to consider for a complete understating of rainfall partitioning therefore our study clearly highlights the importance of including understory components into the rainfall partitioning especially when comparing between forests with different understory vegetation cover and litter production the small 3 difference in understory interception between the two forests could result from uncertainties instead of a true difference however we believe that the 3 difference is likely a conservative estimate if understory interception is not taken into consideration the 5 greater throughfall stemflow in the chinese fir plantation than in the catanopsis forest should lead to a 5 greater surface runoff in the chinese fir plantation as well the inclusion of the understory interception helped explain the similar 1 surface runoff observed in both forests moreover based on our measurements the infiltration rate k10 is smaller in the chinese fir plantation than in the catanopsis forest so that without understory interception the difference in surface runoff between the two forests should be greater than 5 supporting that the 3 difference in understory interception is likely a conservative estimate simulated rainfall on understory vegetation and litter may provide more precise estimates of understory interception loss however we cautioned that understory interception loss is likely to vary with rainfall intensities durations and or quantities making it difficult to produce reliable estimates of overall interception on an annual basis even with rainfall simulation 5 conclusion this study highlights the importance of understory components vegetation litter in forest hydrological processes specifically we demonstrated that dense understory components such as those typically found in managed forests with more open canopy can increase interception loss and soil infiltration thereby reduce surface runoff these findings are particularly relevant in regions where large areas of natural forests have been converted to forest plantations a careful evaluation of the amounts of interception loss and soil infiltration that can be attributed to understory components should help inform management practices where understory components play a pivotal role in hydrological processes such as the case in this study increased surface runoff from forest conversion could be mitigated through maintaining dense understory components e g weed control regimes that do not remove understory vegetation and litter for firewood cao et al 2009 6 contribution of the co authors miao hua jiang designed the study

6472,litter and vegetation under forest canopy i e understory vegetation are known to reduce soil erosion and contribute substantially to evapotranspiration however previous studies rarely examined understory water interception we conducted a comprehensive study of rainfall partitioning using a water balance equation that included both overstory and understory components in a chinese fir cunninghamia lanceolata plantation and a nearby naturally regenerated castanopsis c carlesii forest of similar age in southeastern china understory interception was measured by submerging understory components vegetation and litter in water for 24 h which gave an estimate of the amount of water retained i e water holding capacity the total interception loss of rainfall events 9 8 mm that generated surface runoff converged between the two forests a result of a smaller overstory interception loss 20 coupled with a greater understory interception loss 14 in the chinese fir plantation relative to the castanopsis forest overstory 25 and understory 11 the convergence of the total interception contributed to the convergence of the surface runoff 1 of the rainfall in both forests furthermore the throughfall partition 78 was greater whereas the stemflow partition 2 was smaller in the chinese fir plantation relative to the castanopsis forest throufhfall 70 and stemflow 5 these patterns in rainfall partitioning could be explained by the greater development of the understory vegetation hence greater understory interception loss in the chinese fir plantation lower canopy leaf area index hence smaller overstory interception loss and greater throughfall and rougher barks hence smaller stemflow of chinese fir trees compared to that of castanopsis trees our study illustrated

2009 rainfall partitioning affects the amount of water available for evaporation soil infiltration and groundwater recharge savenije 2004 fan et al 2014a therefore it is of great ecological importance rainfall partitioning is strongly influenced by the biotic characteristics of a forest such as plant density layers of tree canopies species composition leaf area index lai and hydrophobicity of foliage zhang et al 2006 park and cameron 2008 geißler et al 2012 fan et al 2014b livesley et al 2014 sun et al 2017 yang et al 2019 and abiotic factors such as climatic conditions e g rainfall intensity and quantity water temperature land use history e g forest type and age and management practices crockford and richardson 2000 staelens et al 2008 kaushal et al 2017 del campo et al 2018 klamerus iwan and błońska 2018 both throughfall and stemflow as proportions of gross rainfall vary tremendously depending on factors such as forest type forest age tree density and season i e foliated versus senescence seasons levia and frost 2003 dietz et al 2006 llorens and domingo 2007 barbier et al 2009 moreover stemflow and throughfall except free throughfall or rainfall that falls through canopy gaps are observable only after interception capacity is reached rainfall that is not intercepted by the forest canopy and evaporated back to the atmosphere moves downward as throughfall or stemflow which is then redistributed by understory vegetation and litter before eventually reaching the soil the interception loss by these understory components contributes to total interception loss and thereby reduces surface runoff as well as soil water and groundwater recharge putuhena and cordery 1996 li et al 2014 using simulated rainfall it has been shown that on an individual tree basis water storage capacity of litter is several times greater than that of the crown li et al 2017 therefore a complete account of interception loss is indispensable for a thorough understanding of rainfall partitioning and surface runoff most studies of interception loss have focused on overstory components whereas the role of understory vegetation and litter is rarely examined helvey and patric 1965 guevara escobar et al 2007 understory vegetation has been shown to effectively reduce soil erosion especially during heavy storms ghahramani et al 2011 a study in the hilly southern china indicates that effective control of soil and water loss is closely related to both overstory and understory plants zheng et al 2008 examining evapotranspiration from understory vegetation iida et al 2009 concluded that the understory vegetation was one of the most important components of the hydrologic cycle in an eastern siberian boreal larch forest using isotopic composition of water vapor yepez et al 2003 estimated that understory vegetation accounted for 30 of the total evapotranspiration in a semiarid savanna woodland in addition to understory vegetation litter layer also plays an important role in reducing soil erosion by absorbing impact energy of raindrops geddes and dunkerley 1999 miura 2000 litter layer may also help limit water loss through evaporation and enhance water infiltration studies have shown that litter layer is an important component in forest hydrological cycle helvey and patric 1965 sato et al 2004 guevara escobar et al 2007 especially in regulating runoff and reducing soil erosion miyata et al 2009 liu et al 2017 thus the negligence of interception by understory components could be an important caveat of forest hydrology studies soil infiltration is often derived from water balance equations by computing the difference between precipitation and the total of interception loss and surface runoff thus the amount of water infiltrating into the soil can be overestimated if understory interception is not taken into consideration understory interception could be particularly important in forest plantations forest plantations are typically thinned to improve stem quality and reduce the time needed for trees to reach valuable sawlog size resulting in predictable structural changes with a sparser overstory canopy compared to natural forests the sparse overstory canopy allows greater light penetration and increases understory light availability which could trigger vigorous growth of understory vegetation leading to a large quantity of water interception yet the effects of understory interception on reducing surface runoff in forest plantations are rarely examined chinese fir cunninghamia lanceolata is the most dominant tree species of forest plantations by acreage comprising 24 or 17 million hectares of the forest plantations in china and 6 3 in the world fao 2006 with many of the plantations converted from natural forests the effects of natural forest conservation to plantations on hydrological processes have long been a major concern calder et al 1993 van dijk and keenan 2007 studies have shown that the establishment of forest plantations could change patterns of canopy interception iroumé and huber 2002 and increases fast runoff malmer 1992 and streamflow yields rowe and pearce 1994 furthermore rainfall partitioning in forest plantations is also known to vary considerably depending on the tree species being planted sadeghi et al 2016 a large number of studies have evaluated the effect of such forest conversion on biogeochemical processes fan et al 1999 wang et al 2004 guo et al 2005 few studies however have compared hydrological processes between chinese fir plantations and natural forests but see yang et al 2018 despite that the hydrological consequences associated with such large scaled conversion of natural forests to chinese fir plantations are likely substantial in this study we compared rainfall partitioning between a chinese fir cunninghamia lanceolata plantation converted from a natural castanopsis forest and a natural castanopsis c carlesii forest in southeastern china the chinese fir plantation has a lower canopy lai as a result of artificial thinning consequently the chinese fir plantation has a more developed understory vegetation associated with more open canopy compared to the castanopsis forest fang et al 1998 xu et al 2014 by comparing the differences in rainfall partitioning between the chinese fir plantation and natural castanopsis forest we aimed to address the following questions first what are the potential consequences in rainfall partitioning from converting natural forests to chinese fir plantations second what are the relative contribution of understory interception versus overstory interception to total interception third are understory components significant players in regulating surface runoff we expect that compared to the natural forest the chinese fir plantation should have a smaller overstory canopy interception loss and hence a greater throughfall which in combination with their denser understory vegetation could lead to an increased understory interception loss the increase in understory interception loss in the chinese fir plantation could be sufficiently large to compensate for its smaller overstory canopy interception loss leading to a convergence in total interception loss and surface runoff between the chinese fir plantation and the natural forest despite their large differences in vegetation structure and species composition 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted at chenda town 26 19 n 117 36 e sanming city of fujian in southeastern china fig 1 the elevation ranges from 310 m to 420 m and the slope varies from 25 to 45 the region has a subtropical monsoonal climate with annual mean temperature of 20 1 c and mean annual precipitation of 1670 mm 80 of which occurs between march and august the soils exceed 1 m in thickness for most of the study area which were developed from granite and can be classified as a sandy clay ferric acrisol according to the fao unesco classification system the chinese fir plantation and the castanopsis forest study sites are 600 m apart in each of the two forests three 20 20 m plots with similar elevations ca 300 m 330 m and slope steepness ca 33 36 were established the chinese fir plantation was converted from a natural castanopsis forest following clear cutting and burning in 1976 the understory of the chinese fir plantation was dominated by a species of fern dicranopteris pedata and saplings of millettia dielsiana adinandra millettii and eurya nitida the castanopsis forest is a secondary forest regenerated from a natural castanopsis forest which was selectively cut at a high intensity 85 in 1976 the dominant canopy species of the castanopsis forest is c carlesii approximately 80 with other common canopy species including c fissa schima superba and camellia oleifera the understory species of the castanopsis forest was dominated by a species of sedge gahnia tristis and saplings of ormosia xylocarpa rapanea neriifolia and syzygium buxifolium the understory layer was generally lower than 1 5 m in both forests the slope aspect and steepness of our selected forests are representative of secondary forests in the region which are gradually replaced by chinese fir plantations thus we considered a comprehensive monitoring of the two forests would provide more reliable results for the characteristics of forest rainfall partitioning in the region than a study using smaller plots scattered across several forests canopy lai was measured with a plant canopy analyzer model lai 2000 li cor inc lincolin nebraska usa and canopy gap fraction was estimated from hemispherical photographs using gla version 2 0 lyu et al 2014 tree height diameter at breath height dbh and gap fraction were greater in the chinese fir plantation than the castanopsis forest whereas tree density and canopy lai were lower in the plantation than the castanopsis forest lyu et al 2014 understory vegetation cover of the chinese fir plantation was greater than that of the castanopsis forest table 1 litter depth is similar between the two forests ca 2 cm but was spatially more variable in the chinese fir plantation soils of the chinese fir plantation have a higher bulk density higher ph lower organic matter content and lower total nitrogen compared to that of the castanopsis forest table 1 li et al 2016 2 2 sample collection 2 2 1 rainfall rainfall and other meteorological variables such as temperature and humidity were measured with a micro weather station rr 1008 rain root company peking china installed at a forest clearing on a middle slope near the castanopsis forest fig 1 rainfall quantity was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge with 314 cm2 orifice and 0 20 mm per tipping because the two forests are only 600 m apart and the differences in daily rainfall were extremely small between our weather station and another weather station that is 1 km northeast to our study site r2 0 9984 fig s1 we assumed that the differences in gross rainfall between the two forests are minimal 2 2 2 throughfall and stemflow between january 2013 and december 2014 throughfall stemflow and runoff were measured for each rainfall event defined as rainfall greater than 5 mm occurring after a dry period of at least 6 h rainfall smaller than 5 mm typically did not generate throughfall or surface runoff throughfall was collected using cylindrical buckets connected to a funnel with a diameter of 65 cm 3317 cm2 at 1 5 m above ground the funnel was made of stainless steel with a vertical rim and a slope angle of 45 the cylindrical buckets were made of polyvinyl chloride pvc with a diameter of 30 cm and a height of 100 cm a polyethylene screen 3 3 mm was placed above each funnel to prevent debris from entering the bucket initially twelve throughfall collectors were placed at random in each plot with a total of 36 collectors in each forest because we aimed to compare the differences in rainfall partitioning between the two forests rather than to quantify the spatial variability in rainfall partitioning at each forest of the 12 collectors in each plot only the three with the throughfall quantities closest to the plot mean were retained after a two month monitoring period i e nine collectors for each forest spatial variability of throughfall can be high in forests with heterogeneous tree canopies and a large number of collectors might be necessary to obtain reliable estimates levia and frost 2006 zimmermann et al 2010 zimmermann and zimmermann 2014 fang et al 1998 however a study on spatial variability of throughfall in a subtropical natural forest indicated that although 5 17 collectors each with a collection area of 314 cm2 were required to obtain the throughfall volume that is within 10 of the population mean at 95 confidence level for individual rainfall events seven collectors were sufficient on a long term basis when multiple storms were combined lin et al 1997 we had nine throughfall collectors each with a collection area of 3317 cm2 with a total collection area 3 0 m2 for each forest we compared the means of the three collectors and the 12 collectors in each plot and the r2s were all greater than 0 95 thus we believe that the three collectors selected for each plot should be representative of the plot and the throughfall quantities obtained should be sufficient to reflect the overall differences between the two forests stemflow was collected using a vinyl tube with an inner diameter of 2 5 cm that was cut and wrapped spirally around the stem of a tree at a height of 1 3 m and the tube was connected to a pvc cylindrical bucket with a cover on the ground the trees were divided into five dbh categories 8 12 cm 12 16 cm 16 20 cm 20 24 cm and 24 cm initially stemflow was monitored on three trees of each dbh category in each plot with a total of 45 trees in each forest but only one of the three trees with the stemflow quantity closest to the category mean was retained after a two month monitoring period i e 15 trees for each forest we added 1 2 pvc buckets to those trees with a dbh greater than 20 cm to avoid overflow 2 2 3 biomass and water storage capacity of understory vegetation and litter three subplots within each plot i e nine samples for each forest were used to estimate the biomass of understory vegetation in august 2015 while the subplots in the chinese fir plantation were 1 1 m as often used in the sampling of understory vegetation fang et al 1998 the subplots in the castanopsis forest were larger 2 2 m due to the lower understory vegetation cover in this forest type see 3 3 rainfall interception loss by understory vegetation and litter in each subplot aboveground parts of all living plants 1 5 m in height above the litter layer were removed dried for 48 h at 60 c and weighed again to estimate the biomass another three subplots 1 1 m were used to estimate litter biomass i e nine samples for each forest in each subplot all litter was removed oven dried for 48 h at 60 c and weighed again to estimate the biomass water storage capacities of the understory vegetation and litter were measured in june 2015 fresh understory vegetation and litter were collected from each site and four replicates of approximately 50 g of understory vegetation and 30 g of litter were each placed in a nylon mesh bag with minimal disturbance mesh size 2 2 mm bag size 20 20 cm the thickness of litter in the bag was 2 1 cm which was similar to what we observed in the field these samples were submerged in water and weighed at 10 min 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 4 h 8 h 16 h and 24 h at each time interval bags were taken out of the water and weighed after the water stopped dripping out of the bags the same submerging procedure was applied to three empty nylon mesh bags to measure water storage by the bags the mean of which was subtracted from the sample weighs at each time intervals to obtain water storage by the understory components after the last measurement the understory vegetation and litter in each mesh bag were oven dried for 48 h at 60 c and weighed again to get the dry mass following lei 1984 hao and wang 1998 and sato et al 2004 we determined the water storage capacity of the understory components by soaking in water for 24 h and then weighed w24 interception loss of understory components was calculated by subtracting their fresh mass from w24 see eq 5 a study using simulated rainfall to estimate litter water retention in a cryptomeria japonica plantation and a lithocarpus edulis plantation showed that the litter was saturated when rainfall events lasted more than 5 h sato et al 2004 an early field study by helvey 1964 also indicated that when storms were large enough litter was saturated with water putuhena and cordery 1996 by watering litter showed that the amount of water retained by litter can be reliably estimated at the time when the amount of water drained was constant which is in principle the same as our method of estimating the wet weight of the litter at the point when the water stopped dripping out of the bags because small rainfall events without measurable surface runoff are less likely to saturate understory components we assumed that only rainfall events that have measurable surface runoff 9 8 mm are large enough to saturate understory vegetation and litter in this study therefore we used only such rainfall events a total of 78 to calculate understory interception capacity to test the validity of this approach we conducted a field experiment in july 2016 following a 33 6 mm rainfall event and the results supported this assumption supplemental information we chose this event because the rainfall amount was very close to the mean 35 mm of the 78 rainfall events that resulted in measurable runoff the result from the field experiment was in agreement with the result from the soaking drying method supplementary information supporting the validity of our estimates of understory interception capacity 2 2 4 surface runoff and soil infiltration rate for each forest site three bounded runoff plots of 20 m 5 m 100 m2 were established on the slope to collect the surface runoff the plots were hydrologically isolated by pvc dividers height 60 cm thickness 0 7 cm that were driven 30 cm into the ground a collecting trapezoidal flume was placed at the bottom outlet of each plot and angled to direct the runoff to a covered stainless steel tank of 1 1 1 m 1 m3 adjusted to a horizontal position after each rainfall event the runoff collected in the tanks was measured and the tanks were thoroughly cleaned for the next rainfall event the soil infiltration rate was measured in the laboratory using the constant head falling method sfb 1999 based on the application of darcy s law darcy 1856 to a saturated soil column a ring cutter with a volume of 100 cm3 diameter 50 46 mm height 50 mm was used to take intact soil samples the soil samples were saturated with water for 24 h and then measured with the constant head falling of 5 cm over 2 h taking temperature into consideration hazen 1892 and for the purpose of cross site comparisons the soil infiltration rate at 10 k10 was calculated as k 10 mm min k t 0 7 0 03 t where t is the water temperature and kt mm min is soil infiltration rate at t k 10 mm min is soil infiltration rate at 10 2 3 data calculation a throughfall tf mm for a plot was calculated as 1 tf v tf a where vtf is the total collected throughfall volume l a is the total collection area m2 of the funnels in a plot b stemflow sf mm for a plot was calculated as 2 sf σ i 1 n d i s i s where n is the number of tree dbh categories di is the average stemflow depth mm stemflow depth of each tree was the quotient of dividing stemflow volume l by basal area m2 of the tree si is the sum of basal area m2 for dbh category i s is the area of the plot 400 m2 c overstory interception loss ic mm for a rainfall event was calculated as 3 i c p tf sf where p is the precipitation mm in the open area tf is the throughfall mm and sf is the stemflow mm d surface runoff sr mm for a plot was calculated as 4 sr v sr s where vsr is the volume of surface runoff l s is the area of the plot 100 m2 e interception loss of understory vegetation iv mm and litter il mm for a plot was calculated as 5 i v or i l w 24 w n m 10 where w24 is the water content of understory vegetation or litter relative to dry weight after being submerged in water for 24 h wn is the natural water content of understory vegetation or litter upon collection m is the total biomass of understory vegetation or litter t ha 1 of the plot 400 m2 in our study wn is 169 and 175 for understory vegetation 13 and 41 for litter in the chinese fir planation and the catanopsis forest respectively these values are very close to the annual means of 136 and 152 for understory vegetation 12 and 41 for litter in the chinese fir plantation and the catanopsis forest respectively yang unpublished data from the above calculations we developed a comprehensive water balance equation that included the understory components p ic iv il sr si si soil infiltration tf sf iv il sr si because small rainfall events without surface runoff may not saturate understory components understory interception loss could not be estimated with confidence thus the water balance equation was applied to the 78 rainfall events that had measurable surface runoff for modeling rainfall partitioning in the two forests the 78 events represented 85 of the total rainfall at the study site during the study period 2 4 statistical analyses each rainfall event was treated as an independent sample throughfall stemflow canopy interception loss and surface runoff data were not normally distributed shapiro wilk test all p 0 05 thus we compared the differences between the two forests using wilcoxon rank sum tests given that the medians and means are similar for these variables we presented means standard error in the results section additionally the relationships between rainfall partitioning tf sf ic sr and rainfall amount p were examined using linear regression models all statistics were performed using r r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria 3 results 3 1 rainfall characteristics the rainfall patterns at the study site during the study period were typical of the region which is characterized by wet spring summer and dry autumn winter wang and lin 2002 one hundred and two rainfall events were recorded at the study site between january 2013 and december 2014 with a total precipitation of 3260 mm fig 2 seventy seven percent of the rainfall events occurred in the spring and summer contributing to 82 of the total precipitation fig 2 the mean rainless interval between two consecutive rainfall events was seven days with 33 events separated by less than three days 3 2 throughfall

3 4 soil infiltration rate the soil infiltration rate was smaller in the chinese fir plantation than in the castanopsis forest and the difference was most pronounced in the first hour fig 5 initially the infiltration rate in the chinese fir plantation was less than 10 mm min 1 while that in the castanopsis forest was more than 20 mm min 1 fig 5 3 5 rainfall partitioning fig 6 summarizes rainfall partitioning in the two forests for all rainfall events having measurable surface runoff n 78 which comprised 85 of the total rainfall during the study period for the overstory layer the chinese fir plantation had greater throughfall smaller canopy interception loss and smaller stemflow than the castanopsis forest for the understory layer the chinese fir plantation had smaller litter interception loss but greater understory vegetation interception loss litter 6 3 understory vegetation 8 5 than the castanopsis forest litter 8 4 understory vegetation 3 2 based on our water balance equation p ic iv il sr si the rainfall that infiltrated into the soils was 65 13 in the chinese fir plantation and 63 12 in the castanopsis forest 4 discussion 4 1 forest structural dynamics can promote convergence of interception loss the structures of overstory and understory layers in a forest are dynamically linked a more open canopy typically lets in more light leading to a denser understory layer such dynamics could promote convergence in total interception loss across structurally different forests previous studies of forest hydrology rarely included understory interception possibly due to the difficulty in accurately measuring understory interception but see li et al 2017 however our findings strongly suggest that the structural dynamics of overstory and understory layers can be an important mechanism underlying the observed convergence of surface runoff between natural forests and forest plantations despite the large differences in tree density lai and understory vegetation cover we showed that total interception loss converged between the chinese fir plantation 34 and the natural forest 36 therefore we urge future studies to not only consider understory components in forest hydrological processes but also evaluate quantitative relationships between interception loss and specific properties of understory components e g percent cover biomass water storage capacity 4 2 overstory rainfall partitioning overstory interception is affected by many factors such as canopy structure e g a diverse tree composition increases interception huber and iroumé 2001 and foliar arrangement e g needle leaves retain more water than foliage of hardwood trees keim et al 2006 barbier et al 2009 however the most important factor is likely the area of intercepting chinese fir plantations are typically managed at low stand densities e g 1791 stems ha 1 in our studied forest in order to obtain greater wood production per tree and consequently they tend to have a lower canopy lai compared to natural forests in this study the lower lai of the chinese fir plantation 3 1 compared to that of the castanopsis forest 4 0 could explain the 5 smaller canopy interception loss in the chinese fir plantation than in the castanopsis forest therefore the difference in canopy interception between the two forests was likely due to their difference in the area of intercepting i e lai smaller canopy interception loss can subsequently lead to larger throughfall and stemflow therefore it is not surprising to find a greater throughfall in the chinese fir plantation than the castanopsis forest fig 6 interestingly stemflow was actually smaller in the chinese fir plantation possibly due to their higher bark water storage capacity than c carlesii yang unpublished data indeed previous studies suggest that bark storage capacity is an important factor determining stemflow quantity smooth bark generates more stemflow than rough bark aboal et al 1999 levia and herwitz 2005 our study adds to the increasing body of evidence that forest management practices can have major effects on overstory rainfall partitioning a careful selection of tree species with respect to their bark storage capacity and a thinning regime designed to balance wood production and canopy lai can help increase overstory interception loss in forest plantations 4 3 understory rainfall partitioning both throughfall and stemflow are sources of under canopy precipitation in this study the chinese fir plantation had 8 greater throughfall and 3 smaller stemflow than the castanopsis forest giving a net 5 greater under canopy precipitation after taking into account of the 3 greater understory interception loss the chinese fir plantation should still have an excess of 2 greater rainwater for either soil infiltration or surface runoff since the surface runoff was similar between the two forests our rainfall partitioning equation dictates that soil infiltration must be 2 greater in the chinese fir plantation greater soil infiltration can be a result of greater soil infiltration rate greater stemflow and or greater throughfall since soil infiltration rate was lower and the stemflow smaller in the chinese fir plantation than the castanopsis forest the most likely explanation for the greater soil infiltration in the chinese fir plantation is the greater throughfall understory vegetation and litter can facilitate throughfall entering the soil rather than becoming surface runoff it has been reported that it takes longer for rainwater to saturate litter than the overstory canopy li et al 2017 although not tested it is likely that the saturation of understory plant surface also takes longer than that overstory canopy as a result of time lag and the reduction in water quantity due to overstory interception thus the damping of the litter layer and understory plants may also help extend the retention of water within the forest by slowing down water movement and allowing more time for rainwater to enter the soil the denser understory vegetation and litter in the chinese fir plantation could be responsible for its 2 greater soil infiltration than the castanopsis forest in this case study the denser understory vegetation and litter in the chinese fir plantation than the castanopsis forest were sufficient to prevent an excess of surface runoff in the chinese fir plantation through two mechanisms the first one is an increase in understory interception loss and the second is an increase in soil infiltration our estimates although not without uncertainties suggest that these two mechanisms driven by the same understory components are likely of similar importance in terms of the amounts of rainwater diverted away from surface runoff 3 increase in interception loss and 2 increase in soil infiltration 4 4 uncertainties and limitations in the estimates of understory interception there are several uncertainties and limitations in our estimates of understory interception first the natural water content of understory vegetation and litter wn was measured on the third day after a rainfall event therefore the difference between w24 and wn i e w24 wn is likely an underestimate for understory interception if rainfall events were separated by more than three days while an overestimate if rainfall events were separated by less than three days to evaluate the robustness of this approach we also calculated il from the litter drying curve which were 1 55 mm and 1 70 mm for the chinese fir plantation and the catanopsis forest respectively these il were close to that measured on the third day after the rainfall event 1 30 mm and 1 80 mm for the chinese fir plantation and the catanopsis forest respectively a second potential source of uncertainty is our use of fixed location for throughfall and stemflow collection previous studies have shown that relocating the collectors could provide estimates with low variability high precision and accuracy ritter and regalado 2014 fan et al 2015 a third source of uncertainty is that we did one time measurement which would not capture seasonal variation in water storage capacities of understory vegetation and litter based on our field observation however we believe that seasonal variation in these two evergreen forests are small and should not affect the robustness of our estimates a fourth source of uncertainty is that the evaporation loss from understory vegetation and litter during rainfall was not measured the lack of consideration of during rainfall evaporation would lead to underestimation of understory interception loss despite this underestimation our estimates still suggest that understory interception is an important component to consider for a complete understating of rainfall partitioning therefore our study clearly highlights the importance of including understory components into the rainfall partitioning especially when comparing between forests with different understory vegetation cover and litter production the small 3 difference in understory interception between the two forests could result from uncertainties instead of a true difference however we believe that the 3 difference is likely a conservative estimate if understory interception is not taken into consideration the 5 greater throughfall stemflow in the chinese fir plantation than in the catanopsis forest should lead to a 5 greater surface runoff in the chinese fir plantation as well the inclusion of the understory interception helped explain the similar 1 surface runoff observed in both forests moreover based on our measurements the infiltration rate k10 is smaller in the chinese fir plantation than in the catanopsis forest so that without understory interception the difference in surface runoff between the two forests should be greater than 5 supporting that the 3 difference in understory interception is likely a conservative estimate simulated rainfall on understory vegetation and litter may provide more precise estimates of understory interception loss however we cautioned that understory interception loss is likely to vary with rainfall intensities durations and or quantities making it difficult to produce reliable estimates of overall interception on an annual basis even with rainfall simulation 5 conclusion this study highlights the importance of understory components vegetation litter in forest hydrological processes specifically we demonstrated that dense understory components such as those typically found in managed forests with more open canopy can increase interception loss and soil infiltration thereby reduce surface runoff these findings are particularly relevant in regions where large areas of natural forests have been converted to forest plantations a careful evaluation of the amounts of interception loss and soil infiltration that can be attributed to understory components should help inform management practices where understory components play a pivotal role in hydrological processes such as the case in this study increased surface runoff from forest conversion could be mitigated through maintaining dense understory components e g weed control regimes that do not remove understory vegetation and litter for firewood cao et al 2009 6 contribution of the co authors miao hua jiang designed the study

6473,climate change and human activities are two important factors affecting surface runoff in water resource planning and management it is usually important to separate the contribution of the mentioned factors to the runoff change in this paper a new methodology is proposed to obtain the relative impact of human activities and climate change on streamflow under uncertainty in this methodology the breakpoint of the annual time series of the observed runoff is estimated and the time series is divided into two study periods before and after the breakpoint namely the natural and impacted periods the jazim monthly water balance model is used for monthly runoff simulation to incorporate the effect of snow in simulating runoff two jazim based monthly water balance models with rao and al wagdany 1995 and mccabe and markstrom 2007 snow modules are used then the monthly water balance models are calibrated and verified for the natural and impacted periods the main parameters of the water balance models are optimized using the genetic algorithms the uncertainty of the parameters of the models is analyzed using differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream algorithm which is based on the markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm this algorithm provides the posterior probability distribution functions pdfs of parameters of the runoff simulation models next the pdfs of the contribution rate cr of the climate change and human activities to runoff are determined using the fixing changing method by taking into account the pdfs of the models parameters to show the applicability and efficiency of the proposed methodology it is applied to the zayandehrud sub basin in iran using the standard normal homogeneity test snht pettitt and buishand range tests one breakpoint at 2006 is detected in runoff time series through the monthly rainfall runoff simulations and the fixing changing method it is estimated that decrease in the runoff after the breakpoint can be attributed to climate change by 57 8 and 45 using the jazim rao al wagdany model and the jazim mccabe markstrom model respectively the results of the uncertainty analysis of the parameters of the water balance models show that the parameters of lsmx maximum moisture capacity of the lower soil layer and k3 deep percolation coefficient are the most significant parameters in the uncertainty of runoff simulated by both the models according to the pdfs of contribution rate cr of climate change and human activities which are obtained using each rainfall runoff model it can be inferred that the jazim mccabe markstrom model significantly decreased the uncertainty of estimations keywords climate change human activities uncertainty markov chain monte carlo differential evolution adaptive metropolis breakpoint water balance model 1 introduction climate change is a change in average weather conditions that persists for a long period of time it may result in temporal variations in the statistical properties of the elements of hydrological systems including precipitation soil water content evaporation and runoff human activities such as building dams diverting water and land use practices can also influence runoff variability optimal water resources management calls for simulating and forecasting the impacts of climate change and human activities on watershed runoff to determine the individual hydrological consequences of climate change and human activities is a key to take measures for adaptation to climate change in watersheds and to understand the future patterns of water use for different human activities dey and mishra 2017 several approaches have been taken to study the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes these approaches are based on hydrological modeling i e wang et al 2009 ma et al 2009 li et al 2009 zheng et al 2009 tang et al 2011 yang and yang 2011 liu et al 2013 yan et al 2013 dong et al 2014 and yan et al 2018

land use change and climate variability on surface hydrology runoff soil water and evapotranspiration in an agricultural catchment in the loess plateau of china using the swat soil and water assessment tools model to evaluate the effect of land use change and climate variability on streamflow variations they used the approach of one factor at a time i e changing one factor at a time while holding others constant they defined four scenarios based on meteorological data of the two time slices of 1981 1990 and 1991 2000 and land use maps of 1985 and 2000 the swat model was calibrated for each of four combinations of two time slices and two land use maps the impacts of the land use change and climate variability were quantified by comparing the swat outputs of the four scenarios wang and hejazi 2011 used a decomposition method based on the budyko hypothesis to quantify the climate and direct human impacts on mean annual streamflow in the united states they showed that mean annual streamflow has increased in most watersheds as a result of the climate change while increase in mean annual streamflow in the midwest and significant decrease in mean annual streamflow in the high plains have taken place due to human activities it was also found that the climate and anthropogenic changes had a more severe impact on runoff in arid regions wu et al 2017 discussed the characteristics of the calculation processes for ten commonly used methods from three main categories of empirical statistics elasticity based and hydrological modeling based methods they applied these methods to a case study in yanhe river basin according to their results similar estimates were obtained from elasticity based methods and hydrological modeling but empirical statistics gave very different estimates they concluded that empirical statistics were not a suitable method in their case dey and mishra 2017 presented a comprehensive review of different approaches used for separating the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff they discussed and interpreted main assumptions and issues associated with these methods they reviewed hydrological modeling approaches including conceptual approaches such as budyko hypothesis and tomer schilling framework analytical approaches such as climate elasticity method and hydrological sensitivity method and methods based on hydrological field data such as paired catchment method and time trend method yan et al 2018 used swat model to investigate the impacts of climate variability and human activities on streamflow into miyun reservoir they segmented the study period into three periods of a baseline period and two impact periods based on a heuristic segmentation algorithm the results indicated that the contributions of climate variability and human activities to streamflow decrease varied with different stages iran chamber of commerce industries mines and agriculture 2016 investigated the contribution of direct and indirect effects of human activities on surface runoff in the zayandehrud sub basin based on the results of this research the contribution rates of human activities to runoff reduction by the climate elasticity and linear regression methods were estimated as 53 and 53 respectively in the present paper the contribution of the climate change and human activities on runoff is quantified using hydrological modeling based on the fixing changing method zhang 2004 in the fixing changing method the contribution rate cr of the climate change and human activities to runoff variations is computed on the basis of the comparison between the results of runoff simulations corresponding to different combinations of the climate conditions and the parameters of the runoff simulation model before and after the breakpoint in the time series of data the cr of human activities and climate change to runoff variations is determined and a method is presented for uncertainty analysis of the cr of human activities and climate change to runoff changes in the last decade there has been a significant progress in developing approaches for addressing uncertainties in hydrological models thyer et al 2009 li et al 2010 schoups and vrugt 2010 koskela et al 2012 laloy and vrugt 2012 massoud and vrugt 2015 mirzaei et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 and nourali et al 2016 investigated the uncertainties related to the parameters of the rainfall runoff simulation models in a paper on dealing with input uncertainties in hydrologic models using markov chain monte carlo vrugt et al 2008 did a classified review of the main recent researches on treating uncertainties in hydrological models review of the past works shows that the uncertainties related to quantifying the impact of human activities and climate change on runoff have not yet been addressed in this paper the homogeneity of climatic and hydrological data are investigated using snht buishand and pettitt tests and the breakpoint in runoff time series is detected using these tests then the data set is divided into natural before the breakpoint and impacted after the breakpoint periods the jazim monthly water balance model jazim 2006 is used for monthly runoff simulation in a semi arid to arid region to improve the performance of the jazim model this model is coupled with the snow modules of rao al wagdany model and mccabe markstrom model the coupled models are respectively called the jazim rao al wagdany and the jazim mccabe markstorm next the two monthly water balance models are calibrated and verified for both the mentioned periods in this paper a new framework for addressing the uncertainties related to the impact of human activities and climate change on runoff variation is developed the uncertainty analysis of the parameters of the two monthly water balance models is carried out using the dream algorithm and the posterior probability distribution functions pdfs of parameters are derived for the two mentioned periods the crs of human activities and climate change to the runoff changes are calculated using the two monthly water balance models and the fixing changing method finally the pdfs of the crs of human activities and climate change to the changes of runoff are obtained by considering the pdfs of parameters the applicability of the proposed methodology is examined by applying it to a case study in iran 2 methodology a framework for the proposed methodology is presented in fig 1 the main steps of the framework are discussed in the following sections 2 1 breakpoint detection in this step the homogeneity of the annual runoff data is investigated there are different methods to test the homogeneity of the climatic and hydrologic data such as the standard normal homogeneity test snht alexandersson 1984 buishand 1982 and pettitt 1979 tests the snht standard normal homogeneity test developed by alexandersson 1984 can be used to determine the breakpoint in the rainfall time series in this test the breakpoint is known as the point where a sudden change occurs in the mean value of the time series in the buishand test developed by buishand 1982 the test statistics is assumed to have a normal distribution however this test can be used in cases with slight departures from normality buishand 1982 the pettitt test pettitt 1979 is a non parametric method that does not require fitting any probability distribution function to data and is used to determine the breakpoint in a time series the mentioned three tests detect single breakpoint in time series under the null hypothesis the actual annual runoff values y i of the testing annual runoff values y are assumed to be independent and identically distributed and the series is considered homogeneous meanwhile the alternative hypothesis considers the series inhomogeneous with a break in the mean the mentioned three tests are capable to detect the year where the break occurs kang and yusof 2012 identifying the runoff breakpoint is important for detecting the beginning year of the direct effects of human activities on runoff in fact it is assumed that before this year humans have no direct effect on runoff and the climate change is the main effective factor in this paper the homogeneity of the annual runoff data is investigated using snht pettitt and buishand tests and the location of breakpoint in this time series is also determined these tests are briefly discussed in the appendix section 2 2 dividing the study period into natural and impacted periods in this step after determining the location of the breakpoint in runoff time series the study period is divided into two periods natural period before the breakpoint and impacted period after the breakpoint the purpose is to determine the contribution of the climate change and human activities to runoff variations the climate change which has been caused by emitting too much co2 to the atmosphere mostly as a result of the increasing consumption of fossil fuels can affect climate variables including precipitation which produces runoff therefore climate change can be considered as an indirect impact of human activates on runoff change activities such as excessive water consumption as a result of rapid population growth significant land use changes altering the hydrologic flow regime of a river and deforestation are among direct human activities which affect runoff it is assumed that in the natural period humans have no significant direct effect on runoff and the climate change is the dominant affecting factor in the impacted period human factors are also considered directly effective 2 3 rainfall runoff simulation using the jazim rao al wagdany monthly water balance mwb model to incorporate the effect of snow in simulating runoff the jazim mwb model coupled with the snow module of rao and al wagdany 1995 is used for simulating rainfall runoff process thornthwaite 1948 introduced the first mwb model which was further improved by thornthwaite and mather 1957 the main aim of the thornthwaite s models was to estimate the shares of evapotranspiration and effective rainfall using two parameters related to soil moisture capacity and the surplus water above maximum soil moisture storage capacity neskili et al 2017 in general mwb models are based on monthly changes in the moisture storage balance of a catchment considering evaporation evapotranspiration runoff rainfall rain and snow and moisture storage in all these models the basin is regarded as a reservoir with a known initial volume representing the moisture content most of the mwb models have used one soil layer to save the soil moisture these models especially in dry months and arid and semi arid regions do not have the necessary dynamics to simulate water balance xiong and guo 1999 guo 2002 guo et al 2005 in order to improve the performance of the mwbs particularly in arid and semi arid regions jazim 2006 proposed a mwb model with two soil layers for a better conceptual water balance modeling in semi arid and arid regions in the jazim model each layer has a different potential for moisture absorption and retention the upper layer is considered for fast runoff simulation and soil moisture storage and the lower layer is considered for interacting with groundwater in this model it is assumed that potential evapotranspiration has a direct mathematical relationship with pan evaporation this assumption holds for most of the water balance models developed so far the jazim model equations variables parameters and recommended parameter ranges are shown in table a1 in appendix 4 as suggested by jazim 2006 the jazim model works very well in arid and semi arid catchments and when the interaction between surface and groundwater is very low the jazim model was also successfully used in two basins located in semi arid regions in iran namazifard 2014 analyzed the efficiency of the jazim model compared to the guo and gr2m mouelhi et al 2006 models in the zayandehrud sub basin in central iran rahnama et al 2014 showed that even though the jazim model was developed for arid basins it performed well in the humid adour garonne basin in france neskili et al 2017 showed that the performance of the jazim mwb model can be improved by coupling it with the snow module of another mwb model such as rao al wagdany mwb model in this model the shares of the snowfall as well as the snowmelt are determined using a nonlinear exponential relationship the rao al wagdany model considers a minimum quantity for rainfall based on the parameter α in this model precipitation p t in each month is divided into the rain r t and the snow p sn t by taking into account the mean monthly temperature t t the snowmelt runoff in this model is calculated based on the equations in table a2 in appendix 4 when coupling the rao al wagdany with the jazim model p t in equations a9 and a10 in the jazim model see table a1 in appendix 4 is replaced by r a t estimated using eq a26 in table a2 in appendix 4 the fraction of the snow budget that melts during a month q sn is added to rain to compute the total water infiltrating into the soil fig 2 shows the flowchart of the coupled model the coupled model has 11 parameters which will be optimized 2 3 1 calibration of the jazim rao al wagdany model the model parameters in the proposed methodology are optimized using the genetic algorithm ga the ga is considered as one of the most popular optimization algorithms in hydrologic modeling due to its simplicity of application the objective of the optimization model is to minimize the sum of square error criterion sse as the fitness function 2 3 2 validation of the jazim rao al wagdany model nash sutcliffe efficiency nse which has been widely used for assessing the performance of hydrologic models is used as a goodness of fit criterion this criterion is expressed as follows 1 nse 1 i 1 n q o t q t 2 i 1 n q o t q o 2 where q o t and q t are the observed and simulated runoffs in month t q o denotes the average observed runoff the ideal value of nse is 1 0 which means the model simulates the observations with 100 accuracy since the nse criterion squares the error it is sensitive to extreme values ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 suggested that if nse 0 9 the performance of the model can be reported as very good it was also suggested that if the value of nse falls in the spans of 0 8 0 9 0 65 0 8 and 0 65 the performance of the model can be reported as good acceptable and unsatisfactory respectively 2 4 rainfall runoff simulation using the jazim mccabe markstrom monthly water balance mwb model the development of rainfall runoff simulationmodels dates back at least to the 1920 s in the past decades numerous rainfall runoff models with hourly to annual time steps have been developed for a wide range of purposes from flood management to yearly water balance modeling hosseini et al 2015 hosseini and mahjouri 2016 2018 in this paper for simulating the rainfall runoff process the jazim monthly water balance model is coupled with the snow module of mccabe and markstrom 2007 the mccabe markstrom model which was developed by mccabe and markstrom 2007 has the utmost structural similarity to the primary thornthwaite model which assumed that snow contribution was linearly proportional to the atmospheric temperature the main difference between these two models is that the mccabe markstrom model considers snow variables and interaction with groundwater in this model precipitation p t in each month is divided into two variables of rain r t and snow p sn t by taking into account the mean monthly temperature t t if mean monthly temperature t t is below the snow threshold temperature tl all the precipitation is considered to be in the form of snow if t t is greater than the rainfall threshold temperature th tl and th are the parameters of the model which their values are optimized then precipitation is only considered in the form of rain if t t is between tl and th precipitation is composed of both snow and rain and the value of each is estimated using a linear relationship the fraction of snow budget that melts during a month q sn is added to rainfall to compute the total water infiltrating into the soil the snow module of the mccabe markstrom equations variables and parameters are shown in table a3 in appendix 4 when coupling the snow module of the mccabe markstrom and the jazim models p t in equations a9 and a10 in the jazim model see table a1 in appendix 4 is replaced with r a t which is estimated by eq a31 in table a3 in appendix 4 the flowchart of this coupled model is similar to that of the jazim rao al wagdany model which is shown in fig 2 the coupled model has 10 parameters which will be optimized 2 4 1 calibration and validation of the jazim mccabe markstrom model the ga is used to optimize the parameters of the jazim mccabe markstrom model the optimal parameters of the model are obtained by minimizing the sse criterion as the fitness function in this model as for the jazim rao al wagdany model 70 of the observed data in the natural period are used for calibration and the remaining data are utilized for the validation phase also the first three years of the natural period are considered as the preliminary period initial values of model variables such as moisture capacity of the soil layer and base flow in the previous month t 1 are considered to be zero and the model parameters in this period are calculated using the ga the values obtained at the end of the first three years 36th months are selected as the initial values of the model variables in the natural period and the values of these variables obtained for the end of the natural period are used as the initial values of the inputs in the impacted period the nse is used as a criterion for validating the model 2 5 uncertainty analysis of the parameters of the rainfall runoff simulation models in this step the uncertainty analysis of the parameters of the coupled models the jazim rao al wagdany model and the jazim mccabe markstrom model is done using the dream differential evolution adaptive metropolis algorithm vrugt et al 2008 which is based on markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm that generates a random walk from a search space mcmc algorithm has been widely used for uncertainty analysis in hydrological modeling this algorithm generates random and correlated samples with stable frequencies having the posterior probability distribution of parameters the mcmc methods include random simulation algorithms which automatically check the answers in the parameter space using a sequence of constant repetitions to converge to the posterior probability distribution of the parameters generally an mcmc algorithm generates random numbers from the current position at time t 1 x t 1 to a new state z laloy and vrugt 2012 vrugt et al 2008 proposed a formal bayesian approach using mcmc the formal bayesian approach is implemented using the dream mcmc scheme with a likelihood function that explicitly considers the uncertainties related to the inputs structure and parameters of model the dream algorithm provides an exact bayesian estimate of uncertainties of inputs and parameters in hydrological simulations vrugt et al 2008 shojaie et al 2015 2 5 1 the dream algorithm the dream algorithm examines the feasible parameter space so that initial distributions of samplers converge to stationary target distributions using multiple simultaneous chains and latin hypercube sampling method this algorithm consists of the following steps proposed by vrugt et al 2008 notations of y ɸ θ ρ denote observation data with length n initial conditions model parameters and first order correlation coefficient respectively 1 draw an initial population from the vector of parameters x i i 1 2 n which n d or 2d using the prior distribution and d is the number of parameters to be estimated 2 compute the density p x i y é of each point of x using the antilog of the following equation 2 l θ ρ μ y ϕ n 2 ln

interquartile range iqr statistic 8 compute the gelman rubin r state convergence diagnostic for each parameter for constructing the posterior probability distribution function pdf of parameters only the parameters that converged are used 2 5 2 constructing the posterior pdfs of the parameters of rainfall runoff simulation models to determine the posterior pdfs of the rainfall runoff simulation models parameters for example model parameters of the natural period first the input data of natural period such as rainfall evapotranspiration and temperature are entered into rainfall runoff simulation model also the range of parameters and runoff observations of the same period are entered into the uncertainty analysis model then rainfall runoff simulation model which is linked with the dream uncertainty analysis model is executed the objective function is the function of sum of squared errors and the purpose is to find the set of parameters that minimize the value of the target function finally the posterior pdfs of the parameters of rainfall runoff simulation models in the natural period are obtained these models are again executed with data of impacted period to obtain the pdfs of model parameters of the impacted period 2 6 uncertainty analysis of the contribution rate of human activities and climate change to the runoff changes in this step the contribution rate cr of climate change to runoff variations is determined using the fixing changing method zhang 2004 this method is based on fixing one factor and changing another factor to calculate the effect of the changing factor on model performance for example for assessing the effect of climate change on runoff in the impacted period runoff simulations are performed using three pairs of input information the first pair includes climatic conditions and model parameters of the natural period c 1 p 1 the second pair includes climatic conditions and model parameters of the impacted period c 2 p 2 and the third pair includes climatic conditions of the impacted period and model parameters of the natural period c 2 p 1 the cr of the effects of climate change on runoff variations is computed as follows 7 c r climate c h a n g e q c 2 p 1 q c 1 p 1 q c 2 p 2 q c 1 p 1 100 where q c 2 p 1 is the average annual runoff simulated by rainfall runoff simulation model based on the climate conditions of the impacted period and using the model parameters estimated for the natural period q c 2 p 2 and q c 1 p 1 are average annual runoff simulated by rainfall runoff simulation model using model inputs related to the impacted and natural periods respectively subsequently the cr of human activities to runoff change can be calculated by subtracting the cr of the climate change from 100 2 6 1 constructing the pdfs of the crs of human activities and climate change to the runoff change in this step the uncertainty of the cr of climate change to the runoff change is addressed by considering the pdfs of parameters as suggested by ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 the values less than 0 65 for nse show poor performance of the model also the comparison between the observed and the simulated runoff shows that in cases that the values of nse are lower than 0 65 the simulation errors seem to be high after determining the pdfs of the parameters of the rainfall runoff simulation model using the dream algorithm parameter sets with nse index higher than 0 65 in the simulation are selected to determine the pdf of the cr of climate change to the runoff change as mentioned in the fixing changing method the runoff simulations using three pairs of input data are required the first category of model inputs includes the climate conditions of the natural period c 1 and several sets of model parameters related to the natural period p 1 with the nse index higher than 0 6 the outputs of the model are sets of simulated runoff time series with a length equal to the length of the observed runoff q c 1 p 1 the second category of model inputs is related to the impacted period and the outputs of the model are sets of simulated runoff time series q c 2 p 2 the third category of model inputs is related to the climatic conditions of the impacted period c 2 and a number of sets of model parameters related to the natural period p 1 with the nse index higher than 0 6 the outputs of the model are a number of simulated runoff time series q c 2 p 1 based on the fixing changing equation and using simulated runoffs several values for crs are calculated for the crs of climate change impacts to the runoff change the crs of human activities to runoff change are calculated by subtracting the crs of climate change from 100 finally the pdfs of the cr of human activities and climate change to the runoff change are derived 3 the study area the proposed methodology is applied for constructing the pdf of the cr of human activities and climate change to the runoff change in the zayandehrud sub basin which is located in gavkhoni basin gavkhoni basin located in the iranian plateau in central iran east of isfahan city is the terminal basin of the zayandehrud river previous studies such as a research by the iran chamber of commerce industries mines and agriculture in 2016 indicate the significant effects of direct and indirect human activities on the hydrologic regime of this basin fig 3 shows the map of the gavkhouni basin and the locations of the selected stations in the zayandehrud sub basin in this study ghale shahrokh hydrometric station is selected for investigating the runoff changes fig 4 shows the annual time series of the observed runoff at ghale shahrokh station in the zayandehrud sub basin also ghale shahrokh damane feryden and eskandari stations are selected as climate stations the thiessen polygon method is used to calculate areal precipitation evapotranspiration and temperature in the thiessen polygon method the area related to each station is calculated using the arcgis software then regional precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration are calculated using eq 8 based on the data of ghale shahrokh damane feryden and eskandari stations the basin area related to ghale shahrokh damane feryden and eskandari stations are 1904 km2 1192 km2 and 1010 km2 respectively monthly climatic data at the three stations were gathered from iran water resources management company these regionalized data were used for runoff simulations fig a1 in appendix 5 shows monthly time series plots of regionalized precipitation potential evapotranspiration and temperature during 1976 to 2014 average annual precipitation average annual potential evaporation and average annual temperature at 1976 2014 are 375 mm 1590 mm and 9 7 c respectively 8 areal p a 1 p 1 a 2 p 2 a 3 p 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 basin areas related to the first second and third climate stations respectively p 1 p 2 p 3 climate data at the first second and third stations respectively in the study area time series of the snow data is available from 1989 to 2014 for instance fig a2 in appendix 5 shows the plot of average snow water equivalent in january february and march during 1990 2014 at ghale shahrokh station according to fig a2 in appendix 5 the share of snow in the total precipitation in january february and march during 1989 2014 are 42 93 and 16 respectively since the contribution of snow in producing runoff is significant it is necessary to consider this variable in runoff simulations fig 5 shows the time series of rainfall snow water equivalent and the summation of these variables according to fig 5 since the sum of rainfall and snow water equivalent have increased in 2004 runoff has also increased in this year according to the study of the zayandehrud catchment it has been found that human activities such as excessive water consumption as a result of the increase in population and significant land use changes are among the main human activities which have reduced runoff during the last decade 4 results and discussion monthly observations of precipitation runoff and potential evaporation data are available for 38 years 1976 2014 using the snht pettitt and buishand range tests one breakpoint at 2006 was detected in annual runoff time series the breakpoint location was determined using snht pettitt and buishand tests alexandersson 1984 investigated the details of the snht test and presented its critical value which depends on the sample size the p values for snht pettitt and buishand tests were considered to be 0 102 0 138 and 0 087 respectively the data set was divided into two study periods before and after the breakpoint namely natural 1976 2005 and impacted periods 2006 2014 average annual runoff at the natural and the impacted periods are 522 28 m3 s and 366 24 m3 s respectively which are significantly different student s t test was performed to determine the significance of the differences between the two means given the fact that the experimental t is higher than the critical t texp 3 25 tcritical 2 07 at a significant level of 0 05 then the difference between the two means is significant a summary of the climatic conditions of the natural and impacted periods is given in table 1 for example c1 see table 1 refers to the observed precipitation evaporation and temperature in the natural period which can represent the impacts of climate change on runoff in the natural period at ghale shahrokh station as shown in table 1 a significant decline in average annual precipitation and average annual potential evaporation from the natural period to the impacted period is seen 55 mm and 66 785 mm respectively also the average annual temperature has increased by 0 493 degrees celsius from the natural period to the impacted period the data required for rainfall runoff modeling are monthly precipitation runoff evaporation and temperature which were collected from iran water resources management company a ga with real values for decision variables was used for calibrating the rainfall runoff models the models were calibrated and verified for the natural and impacted periods tables 2 4 show the results of the optimized values of the parameters for the jazim the jazim rao al wagdany and the jazim mccabe markstrom models at ghale shahrokh station in zayandehrud sub basin respectively for example p1 and p2 see tables 3 and 4 refer to the optimal parameters of the rainfall runoff simulation model at the natural and impacted periods which are used to calculate the crs of climate change and human activities to runoff decrease during the impacted period fig 6 shows the simulation results of both the coupled models and the original jazim model in the calibration and validation phases and also for the impacted period to evaluate the performance of the mwb models the nash sutcliffe efficiency criterion nse was used the values of the nse criteria in the calibration and validation phases for both coupled models having the snow modules and the original jazim model without the snow module are shown in fig 7 based on the nse values see fig 7 corresponding to the simulation results see fig 6 according to ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 suggestion the coupled models have generally given more acceptable results compared to the original jazim model fig 7 shows that the coupled models have a good and very good performance in the calibration phase during the natural and impacted periods respectively they have also performed acceptably during the validation phase while the performance of the original jazim model which does not consider the effect of snow has not been satisfactory as previously mentioned the dream algorithm is used to analyze the uncertainty of the parameters of the rainfall runoff simulation models for example the jazim rao al wagdany model has 11 parameters and the posterior pdfs of this parameters are derived for the natural and impacted periods to construct the posterior pdfs of the parameters of the jazim rao al wagdany model in the natural period p 1 climate variations of the natural period are entered into the jazim rao al wagdany model and the range of parameters and runoff observations of the same period are entered into the dream uncertainty analysis model then the jazim rao al wagdany model which is linked with dream is executed aiming to find the set of parameters that minimize the sse as the objective function fig a3 in appendix 5 presents the posterior pdfs of the jazim rao al wagdany and the jazim mccabe markstrom models parameters using the dream algorithm at the natural and impacted periods the uncertainty of the parameters of each model is investigated using their posterior pdfs fig a3 in appendix for example for the jazim rao al wagdany model parameters in the natural period p1 a log normal distribution function can be fit to the pdfs of the th k 2 k 4 c and α the posterior pdfs of tl usmx k 1 and k sn seem to be close to an exponential form see the jazim rao al wagdany p1 in fig a3 in appendix by comparing the prior and posterior distributions of the parameters we conclude that the domains of tl th usmx k 1 k 2 k 4 c α and k sn in the posterior pdf are significantly smaller than those of the prior distributions see table 5 in contrast the domains of lsmx and k 3 do not differ significantly in the prior and posterior pdfs therefore it can be inferred that the latter parameters have a greater role in the uncertainty of runoff simulated by jazim rao al wagdany model in a similar argument it can be suggested that parameters of lsmx and k 3 are the most significant parameters in the uncertainty of runoff simulated by the jazim mccabe markstrom model lsmx is the maximum moisture capacity of the lower soil layer if the upper layer is completely free of moisture evapotranspiration affects the lower soil layer and evapotranspiration occurs from the lower layer in these conditions according to eq a9 in appendix 4 evapotranspiration is calculated based on the moisture capacity of the lower soil layer lsm pan evaporation e 0 and lsmx deep percolation k3 which is a coefficient of moisture capacity of the lower soil layer lsm occurs continuously every month eq a18 in appendix 4 to determine the cr of the climate change to the changes of runoff the fixing changing method is used eq 7 the cr is computed on the basis of the differences between the runoff simulations based on the climate conditions c and the parameters of the rainfall runoff model p at different periods q c 1 p 1 q c 2 p 2 and q c 2 p 1 based on the calibrated values of the parameters of the jazim rao al wagdany model the cr of the climate change and human activities to the changes of runoff are 57 8 and 42 2 respectively table 6 also the cr values of the climate change and human activities to the changes of runoff using the calibrated parameters of the jazim mccabe markstrom model are 45 and 55 respectively based on the results of the jazim rao al waghdany model the climate change is more effective in changing runoff on the other hand the results of the jazim mccabe markstrom model show that human activities are more effective on runoff change the discrepancy between the results of the two models is not very much about 13 this difference can be attributed to the difference in the structure of the two models the rao al wagdany model considers a minimum quantity for rainfall calculated based on the parameter α even when the temperature is lower than the snow melting threshold it still considers a portion of the precipitation as rainfall while the jazim mccabe markstrom model estimates snow share more than the share of rainfall as a general result the climate change and human activities both had significant contributions to total runoff change at ghale shahrokh station in zayandehrud sub basin as previously mentioned the uncertainty of the cr of climate change is modeled by taking into account the uncertainty of the rainfall runoff simulation model parameters the pdf of cr of the climate change is constructed by considering 500 sets of parameters corresponding to each period p 1 a n d p 2 that are generated using the posterior pdfs of the model parameters for each selected parameter set runoff simulations are performed and the crs of climate change are calculated using the fixing changing method the crs of human activities are calculated by subtracting the crs of climate change from 100 figs 8 and 9 show the pdfs of crs of climate change and human activities to the changes in the runoff for both the models according to eq 7 the cr value can be more than 100 for instance when the cr of the climate change to runoff reduction is 120 the cr of human activities is 20 this means that human activities have contributed to increasing runoff and runoff reduction has been caused as a result of the climate change therefore in theory if the total runoff reduction is considered to be one unit 1 2 units has been caused as a result of the climate change and 0 2 unit has been caused by human activities however in our case study this is unexpected since water withdrawal which is among the main human activities impacting the river flow is not likely to decrease figs 8 and 9 show that the cr values calculated using the calibrated set of the parameters see table 6 are close to the value of mean statistic of the pdfs the pdfs of crs obtained from the jazim rao al wagdany model are distributed in a much wider range compared to those obtained from the jazim mccabe markstrom model thus it can be inferred that the jazim mccabe markstrom model have significantly decreased the uncertainty of model estimations the uncertainty of the parameters in the rao al wagdany model is higher since its parameters had a wider range therefore it can be concluded that the pdfs for the crs derived using the rao al wagdany model are more scattered based on the study of the zayandehrud catchment human activities have significantly led to decrease in runoff excessive water consumption as a result of increase in population and significant land use changes are among the main human activities taken place during the last decade thus on the whole the results of the jazim mccabe markstrom has given closer estimates to reality according to a research by iran chamber of commerce industries mines and agriculture 2016 human activities are the main influencing factor on runoff change based on the results of this research the calculated contribution rate of human activities to runoff reduction in zayandehrud basin by the climate elasticity method and linear regression were both estimated as 53 comparing the results of the mentioned research with the current article shows that the results are not very discrepant in particular based on the derived pdfs figs 8 and 9 the expected values of crs show the similarity of the results however it can be mentioned that the results of the current paper are more realistic since they are obtained by considering the uncertainties of the parameters which can affect the simulation results furthermore through the derived pdfs the proposed methodology gives the statistical characteristics of the crs this for instance can be used to estimate the exceedance probability of the crs of the factors affecting runoff variations 5 summary and conclusions in this paper probably for the first time the uncertainty analysis on the contribution rates of human activities and the climate change to streamflow changes is performed to do this two monthly water balance models the jazim rao al wagdany and the jazim mccabe markstrom models were used to evaluate the impacts of the climate change and human activities on the changes of runoff at ghale shahrokh station in the zayandehrud sub basin based on the annual time series of the observed runoff one breakpoint at 2006 was detected which was used to divide the data set into two study periods the natural 1976 2005 and impacted periods 2006 2014 marking the onset of significant anthropogenic alteration of the flow the two models were calibrated and verified for the natural and impacted periods the parameters of the rainfall runoff models were used to derive the effects of human activities and climate variables on runoff variations the relative contribution of the climate change and human activities to runoff change were evaluated using the fixing changing method the contribution rates crs of the climate change and human activities to the changes of runoff calculated using the jazim rao al wagdany model were 57 8 and 42 2 respectively also the cr values of the climate change and human activities to the changes of runoff using the jazim mccabe markstrom model were 45 and 55 respectively the discrepancy between the results of the two models was further addressed using the uncertainty analysis on the parameters of the models the uncertainty of the model parameters was analyzed using the dream algorithm and posterior probability distribution functions pdfs constructed for the parameters the results of the uncertainty analysis of the parameters of the water balance models showed that the parameters of lsmx maximum moisture capacity of the lower soil layer and k3 deep percolation coefficient were the most significant parameters causing the uncertainty in the runoff simulated by both the models next considering the obtained pdfs of parameters the uncertainty of the crs of the climate change and human activities were addressed through several executions of the runoff simulation models finally the pdfs of the crs of human activities and the climate change were derived the pdfs of the crs obtained from the jazim rao al wagdany model were distributed in a much wider range comparing to those obtained from the jazim mccabe markstrom model therefore it can be concluded that the jazim mccabe markstrom model significantly decreased the uncertainty in the cr estimations the investigation of the study area shows that human activities i e excessive water consumption and significant land use changes have extensively taken place during the last decade it can be concluded that the results of the jazim mccabe markstrom model was more in line with the mentioned facts also according to the pdfs of crs obtained using the two models the jazim mccabe markstrom model estimated the crs with less uncertainty comparing with the rao al wagdany model therefore in general to estimate the crs of human activities and the climate change to decide on which approach has given more realistic results it is suggested that engineering judgments based on the information about the study area be made declaration of interests none acknowledgement it is hereby acknowledged that this research was partially supported by iran national science foundation insf under the grant number 97005565 appendix 1 standard normal homogeneity test for breakpoint detection snht test was developed by alexandersson 1984 to determine the location of breakpoint s in a rainfall time series a statistic t y is used for comparing the mean of the first y years with that of the last n y years and can be written as follows a1 t y y z 1 n y z 2 y 1 2 3 n where a2 z 1 1 y i 1 n y i y s a n d z 2 1 n y i y 1 n y i y s the year y is the breakpoint if the value of t y is maximum t 0 rejects the null hypothesis if the value of the below statistic is greater than its critical value which is dependent on the sample size alexandersson 1984 a3 t 0 max 1 y n t y in the above equations y i i denotes the year from 1 to n demonstrates the testing variable with y as the mean and s as the standard deviation appendix 2 buishand range test for breakpoint detection buishand range test was developed by buishand in 1982 the adjusted partial sum is defined as a4 s 0 0 a n d s y i 1 y y i y y 1 2 n when the series is homogeneous the value of s y will rise and fall around zero the year y has a break when s y reaches a maximum negative shift or minimum positive shift r is obtained using a5 r max 1 y n s y min 1 y n s y s the value of r n is then compared with the critical values given by buishand 1982 appendix 3 pettitt test pettitt s test was developed by pettitt 1979 the non parametric statistic of this test is defined as a6 k t m a x u t t where a7 u t t i 1 t j t 1 n s g n y i y j the variable u t t is equivalent to a mann whitney statistic used for testing that the two samples y 1 y 2 y t and y t 1 y t 2 y n come from the same population the statistic u t t is then considered for values of t with 1 t t pettitt 1979 the breakpoint of the series is located at k t provided that the statistic is significant the significance probability of k t is approximated for p 0 05 using the following formula a8 p 2 e x p 6 k t 2 t 3 t 2 there are some differences between the results obtained using snht br and pettitt tests snht is sensitive to the breaks near the beginning and the end of the time series br and pettitt tests are sensitive to the breaks in the middle of the time series besides the snht and br tests assume y i is normally distributed whereas pettitt test does not need this assumption since it is a non parametric rank test kang and yusof 2012 appendix

6473,climate change and human activities are two important factors affecting surface runoff in water resource planning and management it is usually important to separate the contribution of the mentioned factors to the runoff change in this paper a new methodology is proposed to obtain the relative impact of human activities and climate change on streamflow under uncertainty in this methodology the breakpoint of the annual time series of the observed runoff is estimated and the time series is divided into two study periods before and after the breakpoint namely the natural and impacted periods the jazim monthly water balance model is used for monthly runoff simulation to incorporate the effect of snow in simulating runoff two jazim based monthly water balance models with rao and al wagdany 1995 and mccabe and markstrom 2007 snow modules are used then the monthly water balance models are calibrated and verified for the natural and impacted periods the main parameters of the water balance models are optimized using the genetic algorithms the uncertainty of the parameters of the models is analyzed using differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream algorithm which is based on the markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm this algorithm provides the posterior probability distribution functions pdfs of parameters of the runoff simulation models next the pdfs of the contribution rate cr of the climate change and human activities to runoff are determined using the fixing changing method by taking into account the pdfs of the models parameters to show the applicability and efficiency of the proposed methodology it is applied to the zayandehrud sub basin in iran using the standard normal homogeneity test snht pettitt and buishand range tests one breakpoint at 2006 is detected in runoff time series through the monthly rainfall runoff simulations and the fixing changing method it is estimated that decrease in the runoff after the breakpoint can be attributed to climate change by 57 8 and 45 using the jazim rao al wagdany model and the jazim mccabe markstrom model respectively the results of the uncertainty analysis of the parameters of the water balance models show that the parameters of lsmx maximum moisture capacity of the lower soil layer and k3 deep percolation coefficient are the most significant parameters in the uncertainty of runoff simulated by both the models according to the pdfs of contribution rate cr of climate change and human activities which are obtained using each rainfall runoff model it can be inferred that the jazim mccabe markstrom model significantly decreased the uncertainty of estimations keywords climate change human activities uncertainty markov chain monte carlo differential evolution adaptive metropolis breakpoint water balance model 1 introduction climate change is a change in average weather conditions that persists for a long period of time it may result in temporal variations in the statistical properties of the elements of hydrological systems including precipitation soil water content evaporation and runoff human activities such as building dams diverting water and land use practices can also influence runoff variability optimal water resources management calls for simulating and forecasting the impacts of climate change and human activities on watershed runoff to determine the individual hydrological consequences of climate change and human activities is a key to take measures for adaptation to climate change in watersheds and to understand the future patterns of water use for different human activities dey and mishra 2017 several approaches have been taken to study the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes these approaches are

land use change and climate variability on surface hydrology runoff soil water and evapotranspiration in an agricultural catchment in the loess plateau of china using the swat soil and water assessment tools model to evaluate the effect of land use change and climate variability on streamflow variations they used the approach of one factor at a time i e changing one factor at a time while holding others constant they defined four scenarios based on meteorological data of the two time slices of 1981 1990 and 1991 2000 and land use maps of 1985 and 2000 the swat model was calibrated for each of four combinations of two time slices and two land use maps the impacts of the land use change and climate variability were quantified by comparing the swat outputs of the four scenarios wang and hejazi 2011 used a decomposition method based on the budyko hypothesis to quantify the climate and direct human impacts on mean annual streamflow in the united states they showed that mean annual streamflow has increased in most watersheds as a result of the climate change while increase in mean annual streamflow in the midwest and significant decrease in mean annual streamflow in the high plains have taken place due to human activities it was also found that the climate and anthropogenic changes had a more severe impact on runoff in arid regions wu et al 2017 discussed the characteristics of the calculation processes for ten commonly used methods from three main categories of empirical statistics elasticity based and hydrological modeling based methods they applied these methods to a case study in yanhe river basin according to their results similar estimates were obtained from elasticity based methods and hydrological modeling but empirical statistics gave very different estimates they concluded that empirical statistics were not a suitable method in their case dey and mishra 2017 presented a comprehensive review of different approaches used for separating the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff they discussed and interpreted main assumptions and issues associated with these methods they reviewed hydrological modeling approaches including conceptual approaches such as budyko hypothesis and tomer schilling framework analytical approaches such as climate elasticity method and hydrological sensitivity method and methods based on hydrological field data such as paired catchment method and time trend method yan et al 2018 used swat model to investigate the impacts of climate variability and human activities on streamflow into miyun reservoir they segmented the study period into three periods of a baseline period and two impact periods based on a heuristic segmentation algorithm the results indicated that the contributions of climate variability and human activities to streamflow decrease varied with different stages iran chamber of commerce industries mines and agriculture 2016 investigated the contribution of direct and indirect effects of human activities on surface runoff in the zayandehrud sub basin based on the results of this research the contribution rates of human activities to runoff reduction by the climate elasticity and linear regression methods were estimated as 53 and 53 respectively in the present paper the contribution of the climate change and human activities on runoff is quantified using hydrological modeling based on the fixing changing method zhang 2004 in the fixing changing method the contribution rate cr of the climate change and human activities to runoff variations is computed on the basis of the comparison between the results of runoff simulations corresponding to different combinations of the climate conditions and the parameters of the runoff simulation model before and after the breakpoint in the time series of data the cr of human activities and climate change to runoff variations is determined and a method is presented for uncertainty analysis of the cr of human activities and climate change to runoff changes in the last decade there has been a significant progress in developing approaches for addressing uncertainties in hydrological models thyer et al 2009 li et al 2010 schoups and vrugt 2010 koskela et al 2012 laloy and vrugt 2012 massoud and vrugt 2015 mirzaei et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 and nourali et al 2016 investigated the uncertainties related to the parameters of the rainfall runoff simulation models in a paper on dealing with input uncertainties in hydrologic models using markov chain monte carlo vrugt et al 2008 did a classified review of the main recent researches on treating uncertainties in hydrological models review of the past works shows that the uncertainties related to quantifying the impact of human activities and climate change on runoff have not yet been addressed in this paper the homogeneity of climatic and hydrological data are investigated using snht buishand and pettitt tests and the breakpoint in runoff time series is detected using these tests then the data set is divided into natural before the breakpoint and impacted after the breakpoint periods the jazim monthly water balance model jazim 2006 is used for monthly runoff simulation in a semi arid to arid region to improve the performance of the jazim model this model is coupled with the snow modules of rao al wagdany model and mccabe markstrom model the coupled models are respectively called the jazim rao al wagdany and the jazim mccabe markstorm next the two monthly water balance models are calibrated and verified for both the mentioned periods in this paper a new framework for addressing the uncertainties related to the impact of human activities and climate change on runoff variation is developed the uncertainty analysis of the parameters of the two monthly water balance models is carried out using the dream algorithm and the posterior probability distribution functions pdfs of parameters are derived for the two mentioned periods the crs of human activities and climate change to the runoff changes are calculated using the two monthly water balance models and the fixing changing method finally the pdfs of the crs of human activities and climate change to the changes of runoff are obtained by considering the pdfs of parameters the applicability of the proposed methodology is examined by applying it to a case study in iran 2 methodology a framework for the proposed methodology is presented in fig 1 the main steps of the framework are discussed in the following sections 2 1 breakpoint detection in this step the homogeneity of the annual runoff data is investigated there are different methods to test the homogeneity of the climatic and hydrologic data such as the standard normal homogeneity test snht alexandersson 1984 buishand 1982 and pettitt 1979 tests the snht standard normal homogeneity test developed by alexandersson 1984 can be used to determine the breakpoint in the rainfall time series in this test the breakpoint is known as the point where a sudden change occurs in the mean value of the time series in the buishand test developed by buishand 1982 the test statistics is assumed to have a normal distribution however this test can be used in cases with slight departures from normality buishand 1982 the pettitt test pettitt 1979 is a non parametric method that does not require fitting any probability distribution function to data and is used to determine the breakpoint in a time series the mentioned three tests detect single breakpoint in time series under the null hypothesis the actual annual runoff values y i of the testing annual runoff values y are assumed to be independent and identically distributed and the series is considered homogeneous meanwhile the alternative hypothesis considers the series inhomogeneous with a break in the mean the mentioned three tests are capable to detect the year where the break occurs kang and yusof 2012 identifying the runoff breakpoint is important for detecting the beginning year of the direct effects of human activities on runoff in fact it is assumed that before this year humans have no direct effect on runoff and the climate change is the main effective factor in this paper the homogeneity of the annual runoff data is investigated using snht pettitt and buishand tests and the location of breakpoint in this time series is also determined these tests are briefly discussed in the appendix section 2 2 dividing the study period into natural and impacted periods in this step after determining the location of the breakpoint in runoff time series the study period is divided into two periods natural period before the breakpoint and impacted period after the breakpoint the purpose is to determine the contribution of the climate change and human activities to runoff variations the climate change which has been caused by emitting too much co2 to the atmosphere mostly as a result of the increasing consumption of fossil fuels can affect climate variables including precipitation which produces runoff therefore climate change can be considered as an indirect impact of human activates on runoff change activities such as excessive water consumption as a result of rapid population growth significant land use changes altering the hydrologic flow regime of a river and deforestation are among direct human activities which affect runoff it is assumed that in the natural period humans have no significant direct effect on runoff and the climate change is the dominant affecting factor in the impacted period human factors are also considered directly effective 2 3 rainfall runoff simulation using the jazim rao al wagdany monthly water balance mwb model to incorporate the effect of snow in simulating runoff the jazim mwb model coupled with the snow module of rao and al wagdany 1995 is used for simulating rainfall runoff process thornthwaite 1948 introduced the first mwb model which was further improved by thornthwaite and mather 1957 the main aim of the thornthwaite s models was to estimate the shares of evapotranspiration and effective rainfall using two parameters related to soil moisture capacity and the surplus water above maximum soil moisture storage capacity neskili et al 2017 in general mwb models are based on monthly changes in the moisture storage balance of a catchment considering evaporation evapotranspiration runoff rainfall rain and snow and moisture storage in all these models the basin is regarded as a reservoir with a known initial volume representing the moisture content most of the mwb models have used one soil layer to save the soil moisture these models especially in dry months and arid and semi arid regions do not have the necessary dynamics to simulate water balance xiong and guo 1999 guo 2002 guo et al 2005 in order to improve the performance of the mwbs particularly in arid and semi arid regions jazim 2006 proposed a mwb model with two soil layers for a better conceptual water balance modeling in semi arid and arid regions in the jazim model each layer has a different potential for moisture absorption and retention the upper layer is considered for fast runoff simulation and soil moisture storage and the lower layer is considered for interacting with groundwater in this model it is assumed that potential evapotranspiration has a direct mathematical relationship with pan evaporation this assumption holds for most of the water balance models developed so far the jazim model equations variables parameters and recommended parameter ranges are shown in table a1 in appendix 4 as suggested by jazim 2006 the jazim model works very well in arid and semi arid catchments and when the interaction between surface and groundwater is very low the jazim model was also successfully used in two basins located in semi arid regions in iran namazifard 2014 analyzed the efficiency of the jazim model compared to the guo and gr2m mouelhi et al 2006 models in the zayandehrud sub basin in central iran rahnama et al 2014 showed that even though the jazim model was developed for arid basins it performed well in the humid adour garonne basin in france neskili et al 2017 showed that the performance of the jazim mwb model can be improved by coupling it with the snow module of another mwb model such as rao al wagdany mwb model in this model the shares of the snowfall as well as the snowmelt are determined using a nonlinear exponential relationship the rao al wagdany model considers a minimum quantity for rainfall based on the parameter α in this model precipitation p t in each month is divided into the rain r t and the snow p sn t by taking into account the mean monthly temperature t t the snowmelt runoff in this model is calculated based on the equations in table a2 in appendix 4 when coupling the rao al wagdany with the jazim model p t in equations a9 and a10 in the jazim model see table a1 in appendix 4 is replaced by r a t estimated using eq a26 in table a2 in appendix 4 the fraction of the snow budget that melts during a month q sn is added to rain to compute the total water infiltrating into the soil fig 2 shows the flowchart of the coupled model the coupled model has 11 parameters which will be optimized 2 3 1 calibration of the jazim rao al wagdany model the model parameters in the proposed methodology are optimized using the genetic algorithm ga the ga is considered as one of the most popular optimization algorithms in hydrologic modeling due to its simplicity of application the objective of the optimization model is to minimize the sum of square error criterion sse as the fitness function 2 3 2 validation of the jazim rao al wagdany model nash sutcliffe efficiency nse which has been widely used for assessing the performance of hydrologic models is used as a goodness of fit criterion this criterion is expressed as follows 1 nse 1 i 1 n q o t q t 2 i 1 n q o t q o 2 where q o t and q t are the observed and simulated runoffs in month t q o denotes the average observed runoff the ideal value of nse is 1 0 which means the model simulates the observations with 100 accuracy since the nse criterion squares the error it is sensitive to extreme values ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 suggested that if nse 0 9 the performance of the model can be reported as very good it was also suggested that if the value of nse falls in the spans of 0 8 0 9 0 65 0 8 and 0 65 the performance of the model can be reported as good acceptable and unsatisfactory respectively 2 4 rainfall runoff simulation using the jazim mccabe markstrom monthly water balance mwb model the development of rainfall runoff simulationmodels dates back at least to the 1920 s in the past decades numerous rainfall runoff models with hourly to annual time steps have been developed for a wide range of purposes from flood management to yearly water balance modeling hosseini et al 2015 hosseini and mahjouri 2016 2018 in this paper for simulating the rainfall runoff process the jazim monthly water balance model is coupled with the snow module of mccabe and markstrom 2007 the mccabe markstrom model which was developed by mccabe and markstrom 2007 has the utmost structural similarity to the primary thornthwaite model which assumed that snow contribution was linearly proportional to the atmospheric temperature the main difference between these two models is that the mccabe markstrom model considers snow variables and interaction with groundwater in this model precipitation p t in each month is divided into two variables of rain r t and snow p sn t by taking into account the mean monthly temperature t t if mean monthly temperature t t is below the snow threshold temperature tl all the precipitation is considered to be in the form of snow if t t is greater than the rainfall threshold temperature th tl and th are the parameters of the model which their values are optimized then precipitation is only considered in the form of rain if t t is between tl and th precipitation is composed of both snow and rain and the value of each is estimated using a linear relationship the fraction of snow budget that melts during a month q sn is added to rainfall to compute the total water infiltrating into the soil the snow module of the mccabe markstrom equations variables and parameters are shown in table a3 in appendix 4 when coupling the snow module of the mccabe markstrom and the jazim models p t in equations a9 and a10 in the jazim model see table a1 in appendix 4 is replaced with r a t which is estimated by eq a31 in table a3 in appendix 4 the flowchart of this coupled model is similar to that of the jazim rao al wagdany model which is shown in fig 2 the coupled model has 10 parameters which will be optimized 2 4 1 calibration and validation of the jazim mccabe markstrom model the ga is used to optimize the parameters of the jazim mccabe markstrom model the optimal parameters of the model are obtained by minimizing the sse criterion as the fitness function in this model as for the jazim rao al wagdany model 70 of the observed data in the natural period are used for calibration and the remaining data are utilized for the validation phase also the first three years of the natural period are considered as the preliminary period initial values of model variables such as moisture capacity of the soil layer and base flow in the previous month t 1 are considered to be zero and the model parameters in this period are calculated using the ga the values obtained at the end of the first three years 36th months are selected as the initial values of the model variables in the natural period and the values of these variables obtained for the end of the natural period are used as the initial values of the inputs in the impacted period the nse is used as a criterion for validating the model 2 5 uncertainty analysis of the parameters of the rainfall runoff simulation models in this step the uncertainty analysis of the parameters of the coupled models the jazim rao al wagdany model and the jazim mccabe markstrom model is done using the dream differential evolution adaptive metropolis algorithm vrugt et al 2008 which is based on markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm that generates a random walk from a search space mcmc algorithm has been widely used for uncertainty analysis in hydrological modeling this algorithm generates random and correlated samples with stable frequencies having the posterior probability distribution of parameters the mcmc methods include random simulation algorithms which automatically check the answers in the parameter space using a sequence of constant repetitions to converge to the posterior probability distribution of the parameters generally an mcmc algorithm generates random numbers from the current position at time t 1 x t 1 to a new state z laloy and vrugt 2012 vrugt et al 2008 proposed a formal bayesian approach using mcmc the formal bayesian approach is implemented using the dream mcmc scheme with a likelihood function that explicitly considers the uncertainties related to the inputs structure and parameters of model the dream algorithm provides an exact bayesian estimate of uncertainties of inputs and parameters in hydrological simulations vrugt et al 2008 shojaie et al 2015 2 5 1 the dream algorithm the dream algorithm examines the feasible parameter space so that initial distributions of samplers converge to stationary target distributions using multiple simultaneous chains and latin hypercube sampling method this algorithm consists of the following steps proposed by vrugt et al 2008 notations of y ɸ θ ρ denote

the parameters that converged are used 2 5 2 constructing the posterior pdfs of the parameters of rainfall runoff simulation models to determine the posterior pdfs of the rainfall runoff simulation models parameters for example model parameters of the natural period first the input data of natural period such as rainfall evapotranspiration and temperature are entered into rainfall runoff simulation model also the range of parameters and runoff observations of the same period are entered into the uncertainty analysis model then rainfall runoff simulation model which is linked with the dream uncertainty analysis model is executed the objective function is the function of sum of squared errors and the purpose is to find the set of parameters that minimize the value of the target function finally the posterior pdfs of the parameters of rainfall runoff simulation models in the natural period are obtained these models are again executed with data of impacted period to obtain the pdfs of model parameters of the impacted period 2 6 uncertainty analysis of the contribution rate of human activities and climate change to the runoff changes in this step the contribution rate cr of climate change to runoff variations is determined using the fixing changing method zhang 2004 this method is based on fixing one factor and changing another factor to calculate the effect of the changing factor on model performance for example for assessing the effect of climate change on runoff in the impacted period runoff simulations are performed using three pairs of input information the first pair includes climatic conditions and model parameters of the natural period c 1 p 1 the second pair includes climatic conditions and model parameters of the impacted period c 2 p 2 and the third pair includes climatic conditions of the impacted period and model parameters of the natural period c 2 p 1 the cr of the effects of climate change on runoff variations is computed as follows 7 c r climate c h a n g e q c 2 p 1 q c 1 p 1 q c 2 p 2 q c 1 p 1 100 where q c 2 p 1 is the average annual runoff simulated by rainfall runoff simulation model based on the climate conditions of the impacted period and using the model parameters estimated for the natural period q c 2 p 2 and q c 1 p 1 are average annual runoff simulated by rainfall runoff simulation model using model inputs related to the impacted and natural periods respectively subsequently the cr of human activities to runoff change can be calculated by subtracting the cr of the climate change from 100 2 6 1 constructing the pdfs of the crs of human activities and climate change to the runoff change in this step the uncertainty of the cr of climate change to the runoff change is addressed by considering the pdfs of parameters as suggested by ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 the values less than 0 65 for nse show poor performance of the model also the comparison between the observed and the simulated runoff shows that in cases that the values of nse are lower than 0 65 the simulation errors seem to be high after determining the pdfs of the parameters of the rainfall runoff simulation model using the dream algorithm parameter sets with nse index higher than 0 65 in the simulation are selected to determine the pdf of the cr of climate change to the runoff change as mentioned in the fixing changing method the runoff simulations using three pairs of input data are required the first category of model inputs includes the climate conditions of the natural period c 1 and several sets of model parameters related to the natural period p 1 with the nse index higher than 0 6 the outputs of the model are sets of simulated runoff time series with a length equal to the length of the observed runoff q c 1 p 1 the second category of model inputs is related to the impacted period and the outputs of the model are sets of simulated runoff time series q c 2 p 2 the third category of model inputs is related to the climatic conditions of the impacted period c 2 and a number of sets of model parameters related to the natural period p 1 with the nse index higher than 0 6 the outputs of the model are a number of simulated runoff time series q c 2 p 1 based on the fixing changing equation and using simulated runoffs several values for crs are calculated for the crs of climate change impacts to the runoff change the crs of human activities to runoff change are calculated by subtracting the crs of climate change from 100 finally the pdfs of the cr of human activities and climate change to the runoff change are derived 3 the study area the proposed methodology is applied for constructing the pdf of the cr of human activities and climate change to the runoff change in the zayandehrud sub basin which is located in gavkhoni basin gavkhoni basin located in the iranian plateau in central iran east of isfahan city is the terminal basin of the zayandehrud river previous studies such as a research by the iran chamber of commerce industries mines and agriculture in 2016 indicate the significant effects of direct and indirect human activities on the hydrologic regime of this basin fig 3 shows the map of the gavkhouni basin and the locations of the selected stations in the zayandehrud sub basin in this study ghale shahrokh hydrometric station is selected for investigating the runoff changes fig 4 shows the annual time series of the observed runoff at ghale shahrokh station in the zayandehrud sub basin also ghale shahrokh damane feryden and eskandari stations are selected as climate stations the thiessen polygon method is used to calculate areal precipitation evapotranspiration and temperature in the thiessen polygon method the area related to each station is calculated using the arcgis software then regional precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration are calculated using eq 8 based on the data of ghale shahrokh damane feryden and eskandari stations the basin area related to ghale shahrokh damane feryden and eskandari stations are 1904 km2 1192 km2 and 1010 km2 respectively monthly climatic data at the three stations were gathered from iran water resources management company these regionalized data were used for runoff simulations fig a1 in appendix 5 shows monthly time series plots of regionalized precipitation potential evapotranspiration and temperature during 1976 to 2014 average annual precipitation average annual potential evaporation and average annual temperature at 1976 2014 are 375 mm 1590 mm and 9 7 c respectively 8 areal p a 1 p 1 a 2 p 2 a 3 p 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 basin areas related to the first second and third climate stations respectively p 1 p 2 p 3 climate data at the first second and third stations respectively in the study area time series of the snow data is available from 1989 to 2014 for instance fig a2 in appendix 5 shows the plot of average snow water equivalent in january february and march during 1990 2014 at ghale shahrokh station according to fig a2 in appendix 5 the share of snow in the total precipitation in january february and march during 1989 2014 are 42 93 and 16 respectively since the contribution of snow in producing runoff is significant it is necessary to consider this variable in runoff simulations fig 5 shows the time series of rainfall snow water equivalent and the summation of these variables according to fig 5 since the sum of rainfall and snow water equivalent have increased in 2004 runoff has also increased in this year according to the study of the zayandehrud catchment it has been found that human activities such as excessive water consumption as a result of the increase in population and significant land use changes are among the main human activities which have reduced runoff during the last decade 4 results and discussion monthly observations of precipitation runoff and potential evaporation data are available for 38 years 1976 2014 using the snht pettitt and buishand range tests one breakpoint at 2006 was detected in annual runoff time series the breakpoint location was determined using snht pettitt and buishand tests alexandersson 1984 investigated the details of the snht test and presented its critical value which depends on the sample size the p values for snht pettitt and buishand tests were considered to be 0 102 0 138 and 0 087 respectively the data set was divided into two study periods before and after the breakpoint namely natural 1976 2005 and impacted periods 2006 2014 average annual runoff at the natural and the impacted periods are 522 28 m3 s and 366 24 m3 s respectively which are significantly different student s t test was performed to determine the significance of the differences between the two means given the fact that the experimental t is higher than the critical t texp 3 25 tcritical 2 07 at a significant level of 0 05 then the difference between the two means is significant a summary of the climatic conditions of the natural and impacted periods is given in table 1 for example c1 see table 1 refers to the observed precipitation evaporation and temperature in the natural period which can represent the impacts of climate change on runoff in the natural period at ghale shahrokh station as shown in table 1 a significant decline in average annual precipitation and average annual potential evaporation from the natural period to the impacted period is seen 55 mm and 66 785 mm respectively also the average annual temperature has increased by 0 493 degrees celsius from the natural period to the impacted period the data required for rainfall runoff modeling are monthly precipitation runoff evaporation and temperature which were collected from iran water resources management company a ga with real values for decision variables was used for calibrating the rainfall runoff models the models were calibrated and verified for the natural and impacted periods tables 2 4 show the results of the optimized values of the parameters for the jazim the jazim rao al wagdany and the jazim mccabe markstrom models at ghale shahrokh station in zayandehrud sub basin respectively for example p1 and p2 see tables 3 and 4 refer to the optimal parameters of the rainfall runoff simulation model at the natural and impacted periods which are used to calculate the crs of climate change and human activities to runoff decrease during the impacted period fig 6 shows the simulation results of both the coupled models and the original jazim model in the calibration and validation phases and also for the impacted period to evaluate the performance of the mwb models the nash sutcliffe efficiency criterion nse was used the values of the nse criteria in the calibration and validation phases for both coupled models having the snow modules and the original jazim model without the snow module are shown in fig 7 based on the nse values see fig 7 corresponding to the simulation results see fig 6 according to ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 suggestion the coupled models have generally given more acceptable results compared to the original jazim model fig 7 shows that the coupled models have a good and very good performance in the calibration phase during the natural and impacted periods respectively they have also performed acceptably during the validation phase while the performance of the original jazim model which does not consider the effect of snow has not been satisfactory as previously mentioned the dream algorithm is used to analyze the uncertainty of the parameters of the rainfall runoff simulation models for example the jazim rao al wagdany model has 11 parameters and the posterior pdfs of this parameters are derived for the natural and impacted periods to construct the posterior pdfs of the parameters of the jazim rao al wagdany model in the natural period p 1 climate variations of the natural period are entered into the jazim rao al wagdany model and the range of parameters and runoff observations of the same period are entered into the dream uncertainty analysis model then the jazim rao al wagdany model which is linked with dream is executed aiming to find the set of parameters that minimize the sse as the objective function fig a3 in appendix 5 presents the posterior pdfs of the jazim rao al wagdany and the jazim mccabe markstrom models parameters using the dream algorithm at the natural and impacted periods the uncertainty of the parameters of each model is investigated using their posterior pdfs fig a3 in appendix for example for the jazim rao al wagdany model parameters in the natural period p1 a log normal distribution function can be fit to the pdfs of the th k 2 k 4 c and α the posterior pdfs of tl usmx k 1 and k sn seem to be close to an exponential form see the jazim rao al wagdany p1 in fig a3 in appendix by comparing the prior and posterior distributions of the parameters we conclude that the domains of tl th usmx k 1 k 2 k 4 c α and k sn in the posterior pdf are significantly smaller than those of the prior distributions see table 5 in contrast the domains of lsmx and k 3 do not differ significantly in the prior and posterior pdfs therefore it can be inferred that the latter parameters have a greater role in the uncertainty of runoff simulated by jazim rao al wagdany model in a similar argument it can be suggested that parameters of lsmx and k 3 are the most significant parameters in the uncertainty of runoff simulated by the jazim mccabe markstrom model lsmx is the maximum moisture capacity of the lower soil layer if the upper layer is completely free of moisture evapotranspiration affects the lower soil layer and evapotranspiration occurs from the lower layer in these conditions according to eq a9 in appendix 4 evapotranspiration is calculated based on the moisture capacity of the lower soil layer lsm pan evaporation e 0 and lsmx deep percolation k3 which is a coefficient of moisture capacity of the lower soil layer lsm occurs continuously every month eq a18 in appendix 4 to determine the cr of the climate change to the changes of runoff the fixing changing method is used eq 7 the cr is computed on the basis of the differences between the runoff simulations based on the climate conditions c and the parameters of the rainfall runoff model p at different periods q c 1 p 1 q c 2 p 2 and q c 2 p 1 based on the calibrated values of the parameters of the jazim rao al wagdany model the cr of the climate change and human activities to the changes of runoff are 57 8 and 42 2 respectively table 6 also the cr values of the climate change and human activities to the changes of runoff using the calibrated parameters of the jazim mccabe markstrom model are 45 and 55 respectively based on the results of the jazim rao al waghdany model the climate change is more effective in changing runoff on the other hand the results of the jazim mccabe markstrom model show that human activities are more effective on runoff change the discrepancy between the results of the two models is not very much about 13 this difference can be attributed to the difference in the structure of the two models the rao al wagdany model considers a minimum quantity for rainfall calculated based on the parameter α even when the temperature is lower than the snow melting threshold it still considers a portion of the precipitation as rainfall while the jazim mccabe markstrom model estimates snow share more than the share of rainfall as a general result the climate change and human activities both had significant contributions to total runoff change at ghale shahrokh station in zayandehrud sub basin as previously mentioned the uncertainty of the cr of climate change is modeled by taking into account the uncertainty of the rainfall runoff simulation model parameters the pdf of cr of the climate change is constructed by considering 500 sets of parameters corresponding to each period p 1 a n d p 2 that are generated using the posterior pdfs of the model parameters for each selected parameter set runoff simulations are performed and the crs of climate change are calculated using the fixing changing method the crs of human activities are calculated by subtracting the crs of climate change from 100 figs 8 and 9 show the pdfs of crs of climate change and human activities to the changes in the runoff for both the models according to eq 7 the cr value can be more than 100 for instance when the cr of the climate change to runoff reduction is 120 the cr of human activities is 20 this means that human activities have contributed to increasing runoff and runoff reduction has been caused as a result of the climate change therefore in theory if the total runoff reduction is considered to be one unit 1 2 units has been caused as a result of the climate change and 0 2 unit has been caused by human activities however in our case study this is unexpected since water withdrawal which is among the main human activities impacting the river flow is not likely to decrease figs 8 and 9 show that the cr values calculated using the calibrated set of the parameters see table 6 are close to the value of mean statistic of the pdfs the pdfs of crs obtained from the jazim rao al wagdany model are distributed in a much wider range compared to those obtained from the jazim mccabe markstrom model thus it can be inferred that the jazim mccabe markstrom model have significantly decreased the uncertainty of model estimations the uncertainty of the parameters in the rao al wagdany model is higher since its parameters had a wider range therefore it can be concluded that the pdfs for the crs derived using the rao al wagdany model are more scattered based on the study of the zayandehrud catchment human activities have significantly led to decrease in runoff excessive water consumption as a result of increase in population and significant land use changes are among the main human activities taken place during the last decade thus on the whole the results of the jazim mccabe markstrom has given closer estimates to reality according to a research by iran chamber of commerce industries mines and agriculture 2016 human activities are the main influencing factor on runoff change based on the results of this research the calculated contribution rate of human activities to runoff reduction in zayandehrud basin by the climate elasticity method and linear regression were both estimated as 53 comparing the results of the mentioned research with the current article shows that the results are not very discrepant in particular based on the derived pdfs figs 8 and 9 the expected values of crs show the similarity of the results however it can be mentioned that the results of the current paper are more realistic since they are obtained by considering the uncertainties of the parameters which can affect the simulation results furthermore through the derived pdfs the proposed methodology gives the statistical characteristics of the crs this for instance can be used to estimate the exceedance probability of the crs of the factors affecting runoff variations 5 summary and conclusions in this paper probably for the first time the uncertainty analysis on the contribution rates of human activities and the climate change to streamflow changes is performed to do this two monthly water balance models the jazim rao al wagdany and the jazim mccabe markstrom models were used to evaluate the impacts of the climate change and human activities on the changes of runoff at ghale shahrokh station in the zayandehrud sub basin based on the annual time series of the observed runoff one breakpoint at 2006 was detected which was used to divide the data set into two study periods the natural 1976 2005 and impacted periods 2006 2014 marking the onset of significant anthropogenic alteration of the flow the two models were calibrated and verified for the natural and impacted periods the parameters of the rainfall runoff models were used to derive the effects of human activities and climate variables on runoff variations the relative contribution of the climate change and human activities to runoff change were evaluated using the fixing changing method the contribution rates crs of the climate change and human activities to the changes of runoff calculated using the jazim rao al wagdany model were 57 8 and 42 2 respectively also the cr values of the climate change and human activities to the changes of runoff using the jazim mccabe markstrom model were 45 and 55 respectively the discrepancy between the results of the two models was further addressed using the uncertainty analysis on the parameters of the models the uncertainty of the model parameters was analyzed using the dream algorithm and posterior probability distribution functions pdfs constructed for the parameters the results of the uncertainty analysis of the parameters of the water balance models showed that the parameters of lsmx maximum moisture capacity of the lower soil layer and k3 deep percolation coefficient were the most significant parameters causing the uncertainty in the runoff simulated by both the models next considering the obtained pdfs of parameters the uncertainty of the crs of the climate change and human activities were addressed through several executions of the runoff simulation models finally the pdfs of the crs of human activities and the climate change were derived the pdfs of the crs obtained from the jazim rao al wagdany model were distributed in a much wider range comparing to those obtained from the jazim mccabe markstrom model therefore it can be concluded that the jazim mccabe markstrom model significantly decreased the uncertainty in the cr estimations the investigation of the study area shows that human activities i e excessive water consumption and significant land use changes have extensively taken place during the last decade it can be concluded that the results of the jazim mccabe markstrom model was more in line with the mentioned facts also according to the pdfs of crs obtained using the two models the jazim mccabe markstrom model estimated the crs with less uncertainty comparing with the rao al wagdany model therefore in general to estimate the crs of human activities and the climate change to decide on which approach has given more realistic results it is suggested that engineering judgments based on the information about the study area be made declaration of interests none acknowledgement it is hereby acknowledged that this research was partially supported by iran national science foundation insf under the grant number 97005565 appendix 1 standard normal homogeneity test for breakpoint detection snht test was developed by alexandersson 1984 to determine the location of breakpoint s in a rainfall time series a statistic t y is used for comparing the mean of the first y years with that of the last n y years and can be written as follows a1 t y y z 1 n y z 2 y 1 2 3 n where a2 z 1 1 y i 1 n y i y s a n d z 2 1 n y i y 1 n y i y s the year y is the breakpoint if the value of t y is maximum t 0 rejects the null hypothesis if the value of the below statistic is greater than its critical value which is dependent on the sample size alexandersson 1984 a3 t 0 max 1 y n t y in the above equations y i i denotes the year from 1 to n demonstrates the testing variable with y as the mean and s

using a5 r max 1 y n s y min 1 y n s y s the value of r n is then compared with the critical values given by buishand 1982 appendix 3 pettitt test pettitt s test was developed by pettitt 1979 the non parametric statistic of this test is defined as a6 k t m a x u t t where a7 u t t i 1 t j t 1 n s g n y i y j the variable u t t is equivalent to a mann whitney statistic used for testing that the two samples y 1 y 2 y t and y t 1 y t 2 y n come from the same population the statistic u t t is then considered for values of t with 1 t t pettitt 1979 the breakpoint of the series is located at k t provided that the statistic is significant the significance probability of k t is approximated for p 0 05 using the following formula a8 p 2 e x p 6 k t 2 t 3 t 2 there are some differences between the results obtained using snht br and pettitt tests snht is sensitive to the breaks near the beginning and the end of the time series br and pettitt tests are sensitive to the breaks in the middle of the time series besides the snht and br tests assume y i is normally distributed whereas pettitt test does not need this assumption since it is a non parametric rank test kang and yusof 2012 appendix

soil water content this sensor can continuously and automatically monitor soil moisture in real time at each of the 85 monitoring sites soil moisture is measured at eight depths 10 20 30 40 50 60 80 and 100 cm in this study we obtained the daily soil moisture data from january 1 2012 to august 19 2016 from the network to investigate the relationship between soil moisture and precipitation we obtained two types of rainfall data for analysis one is derived from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b42 research version satellite rainfall data huffman et al 2007 for regional level analyses the other rainfall data are station level observations from the soil moisture observing network in this study the 3 hourly tmpa 3b42 research version data were summed up to daily and used to study the relationship between soil moisture and precipitation across the study area the tmpa 3b42 research version data are available from january 1998 to present and have a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 over 50 n 50 s https pmm nasa gov data access downloads trmm the gauge level data of rainfall is provided by national meteorological information center the data are daily rainfall from 8 00 pm to 8 00 pm and available from 2012 to present 2 3 methods 2 3 1 spatial interpolation we applied the ordinary kriging interpolation method to interpolate the station observations to gridded soil moisture data the value of a variable z at the unsampled location x 0 z x 0 is estimated based on the data from the surrounding locations z x i as 1 z x 0 i 1 n w i z x i where w i are the weights assigned to each z x i value and n is the number of the closest neighboring sampled data points used for estimation kravchenko and bullock 1999 kriging is based on the theory and structural properties of a semi variogram which makes optimal and unbiased estimations for regionalized variables at unsampled locations zhang et al 2018 the experimental semi variogram is defined as the following 2 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i z x i h 2 where n h is the number of pairs of observations separated by distance h lakhankar et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 it is used to calculate the values of w i in eq 1 we coped with the daily data for each soil layer the daily data with less than 60 samples were discarded as a quality control then the station observations were interpolated into the gridded data using the kriging interpolation method with a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 2 3 2 validation we assessed the effectiveness of the interpolated results through three types of cross validations in these cross validations we only validated the interpolated data in the 10 cm depth to simplify the analysis and minimize the resultant figures since the same interpolation method is applied to the other soil layers and the cross validation for the other soil layers would be essentially the same as these applied to the top soil layer the first set of cross validation is the holdout method in which we split the data points to two sets 10 of 85 sites i e 9 sites that were randomly selected as the validation set and the rest sites as the training set fig 3 a the kriging interpolation was applied using the training set we then compared the interpolated results at the validation sites with their corresponding observations the second set of cross validation is the repeated random sub sampling validation method in which we repeated the previous holdout method one more time by randomly splitting the data points to two new sets 10 of 85 sites 9 sites as the validation set and the rest as the training set fig 3b moreover we made sure that the new validation set does not overlap with the previous validation set we then assessed the validation results and compared the new validation results with these of the previous holdout method the final set of cross validation is the leave one out cross validation in other words we chose one site as the validation set and the other 84 sites as the train set and repeated this process 85 times to measure the validation results we adopted three statistical metrics namely the correlation coefficient r the root mean square error rmse and the bias bias between observations and interpolated results 3 r i 1 n k i k o i o i 1 n k i k 2 i 1 n o i o 2 4 bias 1 n i 1 n o i i 1 n k i 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n k i o i 2 1 2 where n is the number of data points k i i 1 n is the interpolated soil water content k is the mean of interpolated soil water contents o i i 1 n is the observed soil water content and o is the mean of observed soil water contents here we calculated the three metrics of interpolated daily soil water content time series at each site of the validation set the series of these metrics were then analyzed and summarized through the box whisker plot i e box plot 2 3 3 variability analysis first we investigated the vertical distribution of soil moisture in this region by producing the daily time series of regional mean soil water contents averaged from the observations of the 85 stations for each soil layer we compared the daily soil moisture time series in different layer and analyzed the statistical distribution of daily soil water contents of the 85 stations in each soil layer second we analyzed the spatial variability of soil moisture on a grid cell by cell basis and compared the difference of spatial distributions of soil moisture between different soil layers we also compared the longitudinal and latitudinal distributions and variability of soil moisture finally we calculated the multi year mean monthly values of soil water contents in the eight layers for the five geographical zones and analyzed the multi year mean seasonal average values in the eight layers on a grid cell by cell basis to explore the temporal and seasonal variability of soil moisture 2 3 4 correlation analysis relationship between soil moisture and precipitation at different locations and soil layers were analyzed through simple correlation analyses the correlation analyses were conducted both at the site level and on a grid cell by cell basis in particular we also compared the difference of the correlations in different soil layers 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of spatial interpolation the distributions of the three statistical metrics for the two sets of holdout validations are shown in fig 3c e blue is for the first holdout validation while red is for the second as shown in fig 3c the correlation coefficient between the interpolated values and the observations is more than 0 65 at 90 of the validation sites in both of the holdout validations more than 80 of the rmse values for the validation sites of the two sets of holdout validations are lower than 0 15 m3 m3 with a mean of 0 10 m3 m3 and 0 08 m3 m3 for the first and second validation respectively fig 3d in terms of the bias metric most values of the first validation is between 0 m3 m3 and 0 05 m3 m3 while most values of the second validation falls between 0 10 m3 m3 and 0 m3 m3 fig 3e the mean values of the bias metric for the two validation sets are 0 m3 m and 0 05 m3 m respectively fig 3e these results indicate that the kriging interpolation is able to capture the spatial variability of the original data in this study and obtain satisfactory interpolated results it is also worth noting that the results of the second validation set are slightly better than those of the first validation set in terms of the r and rmse metrics fig 3c d these results indicate that the selection and spatial distribution of the training set can impact the interpolation results as shown in figs 1 and 3a b the 85 measurement sites used in this study are generally evenly distributed across the study area which ensures the kriging interpolation to preserve the spatial variability of soil moisture across this study region moreover we further assessed the effectiveness of the kriging interpolation method by using a leave one out cross validation clearly these statistical results of the cross validation are overall good and comparable to these of the two sets of holdout validations the correlation coefficients of the interpolated and observed values at most sites are more than 0 65 fig 3f while most of the rmse values vary between 0 05 m3 m3 and 0 12 m3 m3 fig 3g in terms of the bias metric majority of its values are between 0 08 m3 m3 with a mean around 0 m3 m3 fig 3h once again the leave one out cross validation proves the effectiveness of the kriging interpolation method used in this study in summary these results indicate that the kriging interpolation is able to preserve the spatial variability of the original data in this study and the spatial patterns shown in the gridded data indeed represents the spatial patterns of the original data 3 2 vertical distributions of soil moisture in this region for the whole province soil water contents of these different layers show large inter daily variability and fluctuations without a clear seasonality fig 4 a however regional average soil water content shows an apparent vertical gradient with value increasing with soil depth fig 4a and 4b for example the multi year mean regional soil water content of the top layer is 0 31 m3 m 3 while the eighth layer with a depth of 100 cm has a value of 0 38 m3 m 3 furthermore inter daily variability of soil water content also decreases with soil depth as indicated by the shrinking spread of boxplots with increasing soil depth shown in fig 4b the above results can be easily explained soil water in the upper soil layers are susceptible to and frequently influenced by transient land surface processes such as rainfall soil evaporation and water uptake of plant roots while soil water in the lower soil layers are much more stable and are mainly impacted by prolonged dry or wet conditions since infiltration and percolation rates quickly decrease with soil depth he et al 2013 as plant roots are mainly distributed in the upper soil layers yu et al 2006 and soil evaporation largely occurs in these layers soil water in the upper layers are easier to be lost than these in the lower layers 3 3 spatial distributions of soil moisture in this region fig 5 a shows the spatial distributions of soil water contents at the eight soil layers across anhui province the upper six soil layers show clear spatial variability but spatial distribution of soil moisture in the lower two layers are much more homogenous fig 5a generally the northern and southwestern parts of this province have lower soil moisture varying between 0 29 0 38 m3 m 3 than the rest part of the province ranging between 0 32 0 38 m3 m 3 fig 5a in general the yangtze river floodplain and jianghuai hilly region have the highest soil moisture while most of the huaibei plain and dabie mountain area have lower soil water contents both climatic condition and soil porosity contribute to the spatial distribution of soil moisture across the province the yangtze river floodplain and jianghuai hilly region have a more humid climate and receive more rainfall than the huaibei plain in terms of soil porosity dabie mountain area has relatively lower values fig 2 which likely cause the generally lower soil moisture in this region than in the yangtze river floodplain and jianghuai hilly region similar to the results shown in fig 4b the inter daily variability quantified as standard deviations of soil water content decreases with soil depth fig 5b the inter daily variability across the region in the 10 20 30 and 40 cm layers is 0 04 0 09 0 04 0 08 0 03 0 09 and 0 03 0 07 m3 m 3 respectively while the inter daily variability in the 50 60 80 100 cm is 0 02 0 06 0 02 0 08 0 02 0 07 and 0 02 0 04 m3 m 3 respectively fig 5b in addition the areas such as most of the jianghuai hilly region and yangtze river floodplain which have higher soil moisture also show higher inter daily variability in soil moisture fig 5b the huaibei plain has a drier climate and less frequent rainfall than the other parts of this province thus it has a relatively lower inter daily variability in soil moisture the southern mountain area also has low inter daily variability in soil moisture this is likely because this region has a humid climate and is well vegetated resulting in prevailing wet conditions we also investigated the longitudinal and latitudinal distributions of soil moisture in four soil depths i e 10 30 50 and 80 cm across anhui province for all of the four layers soil moisture generally increases from 115 e to 118 e and then slightly decreases eastwards fig 6 a although the meridional internal variability differs between the soil layers on the latitudinal direction soil moisture generally increases from 29 30 n 32 n and then decreases northwards fig 6b apparently the areas between 31 30 n and 32 30 n have the highest soil water contents in all of the four layers fig 6b because these regions span jianghuai hilly region and part of yangtze river floodplain which have the highest soil water contents across the province fig 5a in terms of the zonal internal variability the latitudinal bands between 29 30 n 32 n has much lower variability than these between 32 n 34 n fig 6b 3 4 temporal variability and seasonality of soil moisture in this region to check the seasonality of soil moisture across the region we first plotted the multi year mean monthly values of regional average soil moisture of the five geographical zones in anhui province in the eight soil layers fig 7 it is clear that seasonality of soil moisture differs between the geographical zones and between the soil layers fig 7 none of the five zones really shows a single peak seasonality instead daily regional average soil water contents of the five zones fluctuate frequently throughout a year in general july is the wettest month in jianghuai hilly area yangtze river floodplain dabie mountain area and southern mountain area with average values of 0 40 0 38 0 37 and 0 35 m3 m 3 respectively fig 7b e while huaibei plain appears to be the wettest in both july and september with average values of 0 35 and 0 35 m3 m 3 respectively fig 7a the magnitude of seasonal fluctuations of soil moisture in all of the five geographical regions gradually decreases with increasing soil depth fig 7 which is consistent with the results shown in fig 4 once again regional average soil moisture appears to increase with soil depth as shown in fig 7 moreover we analyzed the seasonal variations of soil moisture at four soil layers 10 cm 30 cm 50 cm and 80 cm across anhui province from 2012 to 2016 fig 8 for the upper soil layers i e the 10 cm and 30 cm layers spring and winter are the wettest seasons for most part of the province with regional average values of 0 34 and 0 33 m3 m 3 respectively in particular the central and southern regions followed by summer in contrast autumn is the driest season with a regional average value of 0 31 m3 m 3 fig 8a b the northern region namely huaibei plain does not show strong seasonality in the upper layers fig 8a b as depth becomes deeper seasonal and spatial variations become smaller fig 8c d relatively speaking soil moisture in the 50 cm and 80 cm layers has higher values in spring and summer than in autumn and winter in most regions of the province though seasonal difference is not large fig 8c d in other words the phases of seasonality shown in the lower layers seem to be lagged for a couple of months relative to these shown in the upper layers these phase shiftings reflect the impacts of soil hydrology such water movement and exchange along the soil depth on vertical distribution of soil water 3 5 correlation between soil water content and precipitation rainfall is the main factor controlling the variability and availability of soil moisture therefore we analyzed the correlation between soil water content and precipitation at the observation sites and on the grid cell by grid cell basis there are four sites that have records for both precipitation and soil water content we first calculated the correlation coefficients between soil water contents in different soil layers and antecedent accumulated rainfalls with time periods ranging from 1 day to 30 days at the four sites fig 9 at station 58102 located in bozhou of huaibei plain correlation coefficients between soil moisture and antecedent accumulated rainfalls generally decreases with soil depth indicating water storages in the upper layers are more sensitive to the rainfall events than in the lower layers at this site fig 9a additionally correlation between soil moisture and antecedent accumulated rainfall gradually increases with increasing length of cumulative period until the cumulative period reaches eight days in the upper three layers 10 20 and 30 cm fig 9a this result indicates that soil water in the upper three layers at station 58102 are mainly controlled by the amount of rainfall received on the previous eight days unlike in the upper layers the correlation coefficients in the lower layers reach maximum when the cumulative period is 15 days fig 9a indicating that rainfall 15 days ago does not impose much impact on the soil water content in the lower layers the differential relationships of soil moisture with the temporal length of cumulative rainfall in the lower and upper layers reflect the characteristics of soil wetness in the huaibei plain as the huaibei plain is relatively dry most of rainfall is likely quickly evaporated by the upper soils and or uptaken by plant roots in the upper soils as a result soil water content in the lower layers is relatively stable and less impacted by the antecedent rainfall events in lu an of dabie mountain area station 58311 the strength of correlation between soil moisture and antecedent accumulated rainfalls decreases from the first layer 10 cm to the third layer 30 cm then slightly increases until in the fifth layer and varies little in the rest deep layers fig 9b soil moisture in the upper two layers is the most sensitive to accumulated rainfall over the antecedent 10 days while soil moisture in the third layer is most sensitive to accumulated rainfall over the antecedent 15 days fig 9b for the rest layers the antecedent rainfall beyond 15 days can still impose large impacts on soil moisture fig 9b similar to the results of station 58311 the strength of correlation between soil moisture and antecedent antecedent accumulated rainfalls in both station 58314 of dabie mountain and station 58338 of yangtze river floodplain varies little between the deep soil layers fig 9c d the correlation strength is the largest in the 2nd to 4th layers at station 58314 fig 9c while the highest strength appears in the 3rd layer at station 58338 fig 9d similar to the results of station 58311 soil moisture in the upper layers at both stations 58314 fig 9c and 58338 fig 9d are mainly controlled by the rainfall over the past 15 days while soil moisture in the lower layers can be impacted by the accumulated rainfall over the past 15 days and beyond we further calculated the correlation coefficients between soil moisture in different soil depths and antecedent accumulated rainfalls over different time periods using the interpolated gridded soil moisture data from 2012 to 2016 for the top layer the average correlation coefficient rapidly increases as the cumulative time period of rainfall increases from 1 day to 6 days and reaches the maximum when the cumulative period is 8 days fig 10 a suggesting that rainfall over the previous 8 days is the main controlling factor of soil water content in the top layer for the 30 cm layer the average correlation coefficient reaches the maximum when the cumulative period is 12 days fig 10b indicating that rainfall over the previous 12 days has substantial impact on the soil water content in this layer in contrast accumulated rainfalls over the previous 25 days and over the previous 30 days have the largest correlations with soil moisture in the 50 cm and 80 cm layers respectively fig 10c d all the above results indicate that the lower soil layers have delayed response to the rainfall events as soil layer becomes deeper the delay is longer next we analyzed the spatial patterns of correlations between monthly soil moisture and its corresponding monthly rainfall fig 11 a and between monthly soil moisture and rainfall of its previous month fig 11b across anhui province in eight soil depths first there is clear positive correlation 0 20 between soil moisture and its concurrent rainfall in all soil depths in 95 5 of this province fig 11a second the correlation strength varies spatially with lower correlations in northern part of the huaihe river and higher correlations in the rest of the region fig 11a in addition as depth increases the correlation strength decreases in most of the northern part except the deepest layer fig 11a comparing to the correlations between monthly soil moisture and the corresponding monthly rainfall the correlations between monthly soil moisture and rainfall of its previous month are generally weaker in the upper six soil layers fig 11a b in contrast the 1 month lagged correlations are generally stronger in the lower two layers than the synchronous correlations fig 11a b again these results indicate that the lower soil layers can be influenced by rainfall events a relatively longer time ago due to slow water movement and water exchange through the upper soil layers finally we calculated the proportional area of anhui province showing apparent correlation r 0 20 between monthly soil moisture and its corresponding monthly rainfall in the eight depths and the proportional area of anhui province showing apparent correlation between monthly soil moisture and monthly rainfall of the previous month in the eight depths fig 12 it is clear that the proportional area with apparent correlation between monthly soil water content and rainfall decreases with soil depth in the upper six soil layers the black line in fig 12 on the contrary the proportional area with apparent correlation between monthly rainfall and 1 month lagged soil water content increases with soil depth the red line in fig 12 these results further confirm that the lower soil layers are more impacted by the prolonged antecedent rainfall events while the upper layers are more impacted by more recent rainfall events 4 conclusions in this study we took advantage of the daily observations of soil water contents in eight soil layers of 85 sites across anhui province china to produce a gridded soil moisture dataset using the ordinary kriging interpolation method we then investigated the vertical and spatial distributions and temporal variability of soil water content across anhui province using both site observations and the gridded data anhui province located in the east of china spans several types of hydroclimatic and geomorphological zones both climate and soil property play an important role in controlling soil water content in this region with lower values in huaibei plain located in the north due to drier climate soil water content has apparent vertical gradients along soil depth with generally lower and higher values in the upper and lower layers respectively seasonality of soil moisture in this region is complicated and has fluctuations throughout a year but july is the wettest month in most of the province inter monthly fluctuation of soil moisture is larger in the upper soil layers than in the lower layers antecedent accumulated rainfall is a major factor influencing soil water content throughout this region for the drier region like huaibei plain soil moisture in the upper soil layers 30 cm is mainly controlled by rainfall over the previous eight days however rainfall during the previous two weeks can impose significant impacts on soil moisture of the upper layers in the drier regions in general soil moisture in the upper layers is more sensitive to immediate weather conditions while soil moisture in the lower layers shows lagged responses to the weather conditions based on the observed station data we successfully applied the ordinary kriging interpolation method to produce a multi layer gridded soil water content dataset through the dataset we are able to unveil the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture and its relationships to the controlling factors across anhui province an important agricultural and hydroclimatic region in china this study is useful to prove the effectiveness of the kriging interpolations method for regional interpolation of soil moisture it also provides a valuable case study for how to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture across different spatial scales it reveals the spatiotemporally varying characteristics of soil moisture in this study area which can potentially provide guidance for the development of agricultural economy studying the impacts of various factors on soil moisture illustrates the critical role of soil moisture in hydrometeorological processes and points out the direction on how to improve the simulation of soil moisture the resultant data also

6474,little measurement based soil moisture information is available for the humid to semi humid transitional zones in china anhui province is a representative area of these zones and spans several hydroclimatic and geomorphological zones to overcome shortage of observational soil moisture information in this area we collected and compiled a multi layer daily soil moisture record from 2012 to 2016 across anhui province based on the observations of a soil moisture observing network composed of 85 sites we then analyzed the vertical and spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture across this region primary findings are a soil moisture in this region has apparent vertical gradients and increases with soil depth b substantial soil moisture spatial variability appears in the shallow soil layers depth 40 cm with the highest values in the middle part of this region but soil moisture in the deep layers depth 40 cm shows low spatial variability c seasonality of soil moisture across this region is complicated and has fluctuations with july as the wettest month in most of the province d inter monthly fluctuation of soil moisture is larger in the upper soil layers than in the lower layers and e antecedent accumulated rainfall is a major factor influencing soil moisture throughout this region with soil moisture in the upper layers more sensitive to immediate weather conditions and soil moisture in the lower layers showing lagged responses to the weather conditions this study can not only reveal the spatiotemporal and vertical characteristics of soil moisture across this

rapid development of remote sensing technologies has largely expanded the extent of monitoring areas providing a powerful tool for regional soil moisture retrieval and estimation yao et al 2013 zhang and zhou 2016 however due to the limitations and uncertainty of the remote sensing methods ground based soil moisture monitoring is still the most accurate and direct way to gain critical information

km2 and is situated between 114 54 e and 119 37 e and between 29 41 n and 34 38 n liu et al 2014 both yangtze river and huaihe river two major rivers in china flow through anhui province fig 1 dividing the province into plains foothills and mountainous areas shi et al 2008 the part of anhui province in the north of the huaihe river belongs to a warm temperate zone that has a semi humid monsoon climate while the part in the south has a subtropical humid monsoon climate annual mean temperature varies between 14 and 16 c while annual mean rainfall ranges between 800 and 1600 mm across anhui province li et al 2017 there are five geographical zones in this province including the huaibei plain jianghuai hilly region dabie mountain area yangtze river floodplain and southern mountain

type in this region and covers over one third of this province fig 2a most of cultivated lands are distributed in the north and middle of this province fig 2a while the rest of this province is mainly covered by forests mainly in the southwest and south in the middle there are complicated river networks and several large lakes fig 2a in addition there are a few areas that are man made surfaces such as cities and urban areas the distribution of soil type provided by the harmonized world soil database tifafi et al 2018 in anhui province is shown in fig 2b loam is the dominant soil type and covers 39 4 of this region silt loam and clay are the second and third dominant soil types with fractional covers of 24 7 and 15 4 respectively fig 2b silty clay loam and loam are the major soil types in huaibei plain while silt loam is mainly distributed in the jianghuai hilly region and the yangtze river floodplain fig 2b in contrast the major soil types in dabie mountain area and southern mountain area are loam and clay respectively fig 2c shows the distribution of soil porosity across anhui province soil porosity is larger than 0 45 in most areas of this province fig 2c soil porosity is relatively larger in huaibei plain and southern mountain area than in jianghuai hilly region dabie mountain area and yangtze river floodplain 2 2 data the original soil moisture data used in this study are from the observations of the soil moisture observing network in anhui province implemented and managed by anhui meteorology administration the network consists of 85 automatic soil moisture observing stations distributed in 71 counties of anhui province fig 1 the instruments deployed in the network are the dzn2 gstar i automatic soil moisture sensors which were produced by henan institute of meteorological sciences and no 27 institute of china electronic technology group corporation it measures the relative dielectric constant of the soil which can be converted to volumetric

information center the data are daily rainfall from 8 00 pm to 8 00 pm and available from 2012 to present 2 3 methods 2 3 1 spatial interpolation we applied the ordinary kriging interpolation method to interpolate the station observations to gridded soil moisture data the value of a variable z at the unsampled location x 0 z x 0 is estimated based on the data from the surrounding locations z x i as 1 z x 0 i 1 n w i z x i where w i are the weights assigned to each z x i value and n is the number of the closest neighboring sampled data points used for estimation kravchenko and bullock 1999 kriging is based on the theory and structural properties of a semi variogram which makes optimal and unbiased estimations for regionalized variables at unsampled locations zhang et al 2018 the experimental semi variogram is defined as the following 2 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i z x i h 2 where n h is the number of pairs of observations separated by distance h lakhankar et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 it is used to calculate the values of w i in eq 1 we coped with the daily data for each soil layer the daily data with less than 60 samples were discarded as a quality control then the station observations were interpolated into the gridded data using the kriging interpolation method with a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 2 3 2 validation we assessed the effectiveness of the interpolated results through three types of cross validations in these cross validations we only validated the interpolated data in the 10 cm depth to simplify the analysis and minimize the resultant figures since the same interpolation method is applied to the other soil layers and the cross validation for the other soil layers would be essentially the same as these applied to the top soil layer the first set of cross validation is the holdout method in which we split the data points to two sets 10 of 85 sites i e 9 sites that were randomly selected as the validation set and the rest sites as the training set fig 3 a the kriging interpolation was applied using the training set we then compared the interpolated results at the validation sites with their corresponding observations the second set of cross validation is the repeated random sub sampling validation method in which we repeated the previous holdout method one more time by randomly splitting the data points to two new sets 10 of 85 sites 9 sites as the validation set and the rest as the training set fig 3b moreover we made sure that the new validation set does not overlap with the previous validation set we then assessed the validation results and compared the new validation results with these of the previous holdout method the final set of cross validation is the leave one out cross validation in other words we chose one site as the validation set and the other 84 sites as the train set and repeated this process 85 times to measure the validation results we adopted three statistical metrics namely the correlation coefficient r the root mean square error rmse and the bias bias between observations and interpolated results 3 r i 1 n k i k o i o i 1 n k i k 2 i 1 n o i o 2 4 bias 1 n i 1 n o i i 1 n k i 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n k i o i 2 1 2 where n is the number of data points k i i 1 n is the interpolated soil water content k is the mean of interpolated soil water contents o i i 1 n is the observed soil water content and o is the mean of observed soil water contents here we calculated the three metrics of interpolated daily soil water content time series at each site of the validation set the series of these metrics were then analyzed and summarized through the box whisker plot i e box plot 2 3 3 variability analysis first we investigated the vertical distribution of soil moisture in this region by producing the daily time series of regional mean soil water contents averaged from the observations of the 85 stations for each soil layer we compared the daily soil moisture time series in different layer and analyzed the statistical distribution of daily soil water contents of the 85 stations in each soil layer second we analyzed the spatial variability of soil moisture on a grid cell by cell basis and compared the difference of spatial distributions of soil moisture between different soil layers we also compared the longitudinal and latitudinal distributions and variability of soil moisture finally we calculated the multi year mean monthly values of soil water contents in the eight layers for the five geographical zones and analyzed the multi year mean seasonal average values in the eight layers on a grid cell by cell basis to explore the temporal and seasonal variability of soil moisture 2 3 4 correlation analysis relationship between soil moisture and precipitation at different locations and soil layers were analyzed through simple correlation analyses the correlation analyses were conducted both at the site level and on a grid cell by cell basis in particular we also compared the difference of the correlations in different soil layers 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of spatial interpolation the distributions of the three statistical metrics for the two sets of holdout validations are shown in fig 3c e blue is for the first holdout validation while red is for the second as shown in fig 3c the correlation coefficient between the interpolated values and the observations is more than 0 65 at 90 of the validation sites in both of the holdout validations more than 80 of the rmse values for the validation sites of the two sets of holdout validations are lower than 0 15 m3 m3 with a mean of 0 10 m3 m3 and 0 08 m3 m3 for the first and second validation respectively fig 3d in terms of the bias metric most values of the first validation is between 0 m3 m3 and 0 05 m3 m3 while most values of the second validation falls between 0 10 m3 m3 and 0 m3 m3 fig 3e the mean values of the bias metric for the two validation sets are 0 m3 m and 0 05 m3 m respectively fig 3e these results indicate that the kriging interpolation is able to capture the spatial variability of the original data in this study and obtain satisfactory interpolated results it is also worth noting that the results of the second validation set are slightly better than those of the first validation set in terms of the r and rmse metrics fig 3c d these results indicate that the selection and spatial distribution of the training set can impact the interpolation results as shown in figs 1 and 3a b the 85 measurement sites used in this study are generally evenly distributed across the study area which ensures the kriging interpolation to preserve the spatial variability of soil moisture across this study region moreover we further assessed the effectiveness of the kriging interpolation method by using a leave one out cross validation clearly these statistical results of the cross validation are overall good and comparable to these of the two sets of holdout validations the correlation coefficients of the interpolated and observed values at most sites are more than 0 65 fig 3f while most of the rmse values vary between 0 05 m3 m3 and 0 12 m3 m3 fig 3g in terms of the bias metric majority of its values are between 0 08 m3 m3 with a mean around 0 m3 m3 fig 3h once again the leave one out cross validation proves the effectiveness of the kriging interpolation method used in this study in summary these results indicate that the kriging interpolation is able to preserve the spatial variability of the original data in this study and the spatial patterns shown in the gridded data indeed represents the spatial patterns of the original data 3 2 vertical distributions of soil moisture in this region for the whole province soil water contents of these different layers show large inter daily variability and fluctuations without a clear seasonality fig 4 a however regional average soil water content shows an apparent vertical gradient with value increasing with soil depth fig 4a and 4b for example the multi year mean regional soil water content of the top layer is 0 31 m3 m 3 while the eighth layer with a depth of 100 cm has a value of 0 38 m3 m 3 furthermore inter daily variability of soil water content also decreases with soil depth as indicated by the shrinking spread of boxplots with increasing soil depth shown in fig 4b the above results can be easily explained soil water in the upper soil layers are susceptible to and frequently influenced by transient land surface processes such as rainfall soil evaporation and water uptake of plant roots while soil water in the lower soil layers are much more stable and are mainly impacted by prolonged dry or wet conditions since infiltration and percolation rates quickly decrease with soil depth he et al 2013 as plant roots are mainly distributed in the upper soil layers yu et al 2006 and soil evaporation largely occurs in these layers soil water in the upper layers are easier to be lost than these in the lower layers 3 3 spatial distributions of soil moisture in this region fig 5 a shows the spatial distributions of soil water contents at the eight soil layers across anhui province the upper six soil layers show clear spatial variability but spatial distribution of soil moisture in the lower two layers are much more homogenous fig 5a generally the northern and southwestern parts of this province have lower soil moisture varying between 0 29 0 38 m3 m 3 than the rest part of the province ranging between 0 32 0 38 m3 m 3 fig 5a in general the yangtze river floodplain and jianghuai hilly region have the highest soil moisture while most of the huaibei plain and dabie mountain area have lower soil water contents both climatic condition and soil porosity contribute to the spatial distribution of soil moisture across the province the yangtze river floodplain and jianghuai hilly region have a more humid climate and receive more rainfall than the huaibei plain in terms of soil porosity dabie mountain area has relatively lower values fig 2 which likely cause the generally lower soil moisture in this region than in the yangtze river floodplain and jianghuai hilly region similar to the results shown in fig 4b the inter daily variability quantified as standard deviations of soil water content decreases with soil depth fig 5b the inter daily variability across the region in the 10 20 30 and 40 cm layers is 0 04 0 09 0 04 0 08 0 03 0 09 and 0 03 0 07 m3 m 3 respectively while the inter daily variability in the 50 60 80 100 cm is 0 02 0 06 0 02 0 08 0 02 0 07 and 0 02 0 04 m3 m 3 respectively fig 5b in addition the areas such as most of the jianghuai hilly region and yangtze river floodplain which have higher soil moisture also show higher inter daily variability in soil moisture fig 5b the huaibei plain has a drier climate and less frequent rainfall than the other parts of this province thus it has a relatively lower inter daily variability in soil moisture the southern mountain area also has low inter daily variability in soil moisture this is likely because this region has a humid climate and is well vegetated resulting in prevailing wet conditions we also investigated the longitudinal and latitudinal distributions of soil moisture in four soil depths i e 10 30 50 and 80 cm across anhui province for all of the four layers soil moisture generally increases from 115 e to 118 e and then slightly decreases eastwards fig 6 a although the meridional internal variability differs between the soil layers on the latitudinal direction soil moisture generally increases from 29 30 n 32 n and then decreases northwards fig 6b apparently the areas between 31 30 n and 32 30 n have the highest soil water contents in all of the four layers fig 6b because these regions span jianghuai hilly region and part of yangtze river floodplain which have the highest soil water contents across the province fig 5a in terms of the zonal internal variability the latitudinal bands between 29 30 n 32 n has much lower variability than these between 32 n 34 n fig 6b 3 4 temporal variability and seasonality of soil moisture in this region to check the seasonality of soil moisture across the region we first plotted the multi year mean monthly values of regional average soil moisture of the five geographical zones in anhui province in the eight soil layers fig 7 it is clear that seasonality of soil moisture differs between the geographical zones and between the soil layers fig 7 none of the five zones really shows a single peak seasonality instead daily regional average soil water contents of the five zones fluctuate frequently throughout a year in general july is the wettest month in jianghuai hilly area yangtze river floodplain dabie mountain area and southern mountain area with average values of 0 40 0 38 0 37 and 0 35 m3 m 3 respectively fig 7b e while huaibei plain appears to be the wettest in both july and september with average values of 0 35 and 0 35 m3 m 3 respectively fig 7a the magnitude of seasonal fluctuations of soil moisture in all of the five geographical regions gradually decreases with increasing soil depth fig 7 which is consistent with the results shown in fig 4 once again regional average soil moisture appears to increase with soil depth as shown in fig 7 moreover we analyzed the seasonal variations of soil moisture at four soil layers 10 cm 30 cm 50 cm and 80 cm across anhui province from 2012 to 2016 fig 8 for the upper soil layers i e the 10 cm and 30 cm layers spring and winter are the wettest seasons for most part of the province with regional average values of 0 34 and 0 33 m3 m 3 respectively in particular the central and southern regions followed by summer in contrast autumn is the driest season with a regional average value of 0 31 m3 m 3 fig 8a b the northern region namely huaibei plain does not show strong seasonality in the upper layers fig 8a b as depth becomes deeper seasonal and spatial variations become smaller fig 8c d relatively speaking soil moisture in the 50 cm and 80 cm layers has higher values in spring and summer than in autumn and winter in most regions of the province though seasonal difference is not large fig 8c d in other words the phases of seasonality shown in the lower layers seem to be lagged for a couple of months relative to these shown in the upper layers these phase shiftings reflect the impacts of soil hydrology such water movement and exchange along the soil depth on vertical distribution of soil water 3 5 correlation between soil water content and precipitation rainfall is the main factor controlling the variability and availability of soil moisture therefore we analyzed the correlation between soil water content and precipitation at the observation sites and on the grid cell by grid cell basis there are four sites that have records for both precipitation and soil water content we first calculated the correlation coefficients between soil water contents in different soil layers and antecedent accumulated rainfalls with time periods ranging from 1 day to 30 days at the four sites fig 9 at station 58102 located in bozhou of huaibei plain correlation coefficients between soil moisture and antecedent accumulated rainfalls generally decreases with soil depth indicating water storages in the upper layers are more sensitive to the rainfall events than in the lower layers at this site fig 9a additionally correlation between soil moisture and antecedent accumulated rainfall gradually increases with increasing length of cumulative period until the cumulative period reaches eight days in the upper three layers 10 20 and 30 cm fig 9a this result indicates that soil water in the upper three layers at station 58102 are mainly controlled by the amount of rainfall received on the previous eight days unlike in the upper layers the correlation coefficients in the lower layers reach maximum when the cumulative period is 15 days fig 9a indicating that rainfall 15 days ago does not impose much impact on the soil water content in the lower layers the differential relationships of soil moisture with the temporal length of cumulative rainfall in the lower and upper layers reflect the characteristics of soil wetness in the huaibei plain as the huaibei plain is relatively dry most of rainfall is likely quickly evaporated by the upper soils and or uptaken by plant roots in the upper soils as a result soil water content in the lower layers is relatively stable and less impacted by the antecedent rainfall events in lu an of dabie mountain area station 58311 the strength of correlation between soil moisture and antecedent accumulated rainfalls decreases from the first layer 10 cm to the third layer 30 cm then slightly increases until in the fifth layer and varies little in the rest deep layers fig 9b soil moisture in the upper two layers is the most sensitive to accumulated rainfall over the antecedent 10 days while soil moisture in the third layer is most sensitive to accumulated rainfall over the antecedent 15 days fig 9b for the rest layers the antecedent rainfall beyond 15 days can still impose large impacts on soil moisture fig 9b similar to the results of station 58311 the strength of correlation between soil moisture and antecedent antecedent accumulated rainfalls in both station 58314 of dabie mountain and station 58338 of yangtze river floodplain varies little between the deep soil layers fig 9c d the correlation strength is the largest in the 2nd to 4th layers at station 58314 fig 9c while the highest strength appears in the 3rd layer at station 58338 fig 9d similar to the results of station 58311 soil moisture in the upper layers at both stations 58314 fig 9c and 58338 fig 9d are mainly controlled by the rainfall over the past 15 days while soil moisture in the lower layers can be impacted by the accumulated rainfall over the past 15 days and beyond we further calculated the correlation coefficients between soil moisture in different soil depths and antecedent accumulated rainfalls over different time periods using the interpolated gridded soil moisture data from 2012 to 2016 for the top layer the average correlation coefficient rapidly increases as the cumulative time period of rainfall increases from 1 day to 6 days and reaches the maximum when the cumulative period is 8 days fig 10 a suggesting that rainfall over the previous 8 days is the main controlling factor of soil water content in the top layer for the 30 cm layer the average correlation coefficient reaches the maximum when the cumulative period is 12 days fig 10b indicating that rainfall over the previous 12 days has substantial impact on the soil water content in this layer in contrast accumulated rainfalls over the previous 25 days and over the previous 30 days have the largest correlations with soil moisture in the 50 cm and 80 cm layers respectively fig 10c d all the above results indicate that the lower soil layers have delayed response to the rainfall events as soil layer becomes deeper the delay is longer next we analyzed the spatial patterns of correlations between monthly soil moisture and its corresponding monthly rainfall fig 11 a and between monthly soil moisture and rainfall of its previous month fig 11b across anhui province in eight soil depths first there is clear positive correlation 0 20 between soil moisture and its concurrent rainfall in all soil depths in 95 5 of this province fig 11a second the correlation strength varies spatially with lower correlations in northern part of the huaihe river and higher correlations in the rest of the region fig 11a in addition as depth increases the correlation strength decreases in most of the northern part except the deepest layer fig 11a comparing to the correlations between monthly soil moisture and the corresponding monthly rainfall the correlations between monthly soil moisture and rainfall of its previous month are generally weaker in the upper six soil layers fig 11a b in contrast the 1 month lagged correlations are generally stronger in the lower two layers than the synchronous correlations fig 11a b again these results indicate that the lower soil layers can be influenced by rainfall events a relatively longer time ago due to slow water movement and water exchange through the upper soil layers finally we calculated the proportional area of anhui province showing apparent correlation r 0 20 between monthly soil moisture and its corresponding monthly rainfall in the eight depths and the proportional area of anhui province showing apparent correlation between monthly soil moisture and monthly rainfall of the previous month in the eight depths fig 12 it is clear that the proportional area with apparent correlation between monthly soil water content and rainfall decreases with soil depth in the upper six soil layers the black line in fig 12 on the contrary the proportional area with apparent correlation between monthly rainfall and 1 month lagged soil water content increases with soil depth the red line in fig 12 these results further confirm that the lower soil layers are more impacted by the prolonged antecedent rainfall events while the upper layers are more impacted by more recent rainfall events 4 conclusions in this study we took advantage of the daily observations of soil water contents in eight soil layers of 85 sites across anhui province china to produce a gridded soil moisture dataset using the ordinary kriging interpolation method we then investigated the vertical and spatial distributions and temporal variability of soil water content across anhui province using both site observations and the gridded data anhui province located in the east of china spans several types of hydroclimatic and geomorphological zones both climate and soil property play an important role in controlling soil water content in this region with lower values in huaibei plain located in the north due to drier climate soil water content has apparent vertical gradients along soil depth with generally lower and higher values in the upper and lower layers respectively seasonality of soil moisture in this region is complicated and has fluctuations throughout a year but july is the wettest month in most of the province inter monthly fluctuation of soil moisture is larger in the upper soil layers than in the lower layers antecedent accumulated rainfall is a major factor influencing soil water content throughout this region for the drier region like huaibei plain soil moisture in the upper soil layers 30 cm is mainly controlled by rainfall over the previous eight days however rainfall during the previous two weeks can impose significant impacts on soil moisture of the upper layers in the drier regions in general soil moisture in the upper layers is more sensitive to immediate weather conditions while soil moisture in the lower layers shows lagged responses to the weather conditions based on the observed station data we successfully applied the ordinary kriging interpolation method to produce a multi layer gridded soil water content dataset through the dataset we are able to unveil the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture and its relationships to the controlling factors across anhui province an important agricultural and hydroclimatic region in china this study is useful to prove the effectiveness of the kriging interpolations method for regional interpolation of soil moisture it also provides a valuable case study for how to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture across different spatial scales it reveals the spatiotemporally varying characteristics of soil moisture in this study area which can potentially provide guidance for the development of agricultural economy studying the impacts of various factors on soil moisture illustrates the critical role of soil moisture in hydrometeorological processes and points out the direction on how to improve the simulation of soil moisture the resultant data also provide a useful measurement based reference dataset for the other soil moisture modeling and retrieval studies declaration of interest there is no conflict of interest acknowledgements this study was
