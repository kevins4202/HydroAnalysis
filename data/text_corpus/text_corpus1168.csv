5840,the focus of this work was on understanding the impact of evaporation on the capillary pressure saturation pc s state of a porous medium evaporation is ubiquitous near the ground surface in the vadose zone but little is known about how evaporation impacts the relationship between capillary pressure and saturation the hypothesis driving the work was that the pc s relationship is the result of an equilibrium between evaporative water loss capillary forces and the upward flow of water to replenish evaporated water experiments were conducted using two different porous media a coarse sand and a nylon membrane with a 20 μm pore size long term evaporation experiments were conducted using different configurations to control evaporation within the media results found that increased accessibility to evaporation caused saturation in drainage pc s curves to decrease over time causing the curves to become closer to imbibition pc s curves in the membrane the high external surface area to pore volume ratio caused changes in evaporative flux to produce rapid changes in the pc s state of the medium one implication of the work is that results suggest that long term drainage experiments in vented columns may not necessarily provide a meaningful measurement of static pc s curve but rather may be impacted by evaporation keywords evaporation capillary pressure saturation soil water characteristic drainage imbibition 1 introduction the relationship between capillary pressure and water saturation in a porous medium is essential to understanding the behavior of the medium in its partially saturated state capillary pressure pc is a measure of the difference in pressure between two immiscible non mixing fluids in a porous medium for unsaturated flow the fluids are air and water below the water table in a natural porous medium e g an aquifer water is under positive pressure while above the water table water is under negative pressure positive capillary pressure is equivalent to negative water pressure and is often measured in height units in the absence of flow capillary pressure is equivalent to the height above the water table saturation s is the ratio of the volume of water contained in the voids within a porous medium to the total volume of voids in the porous medium below the water table a porous medium is fully saturated meaning that only water fills the pores above the water table a porous medium remains saturated for some distance a region known as the capillary fringe and then is unsaturated above that meaning that both air and water are present in the pores the relationship between capillary pressure and saturation is hysteretic in that the capillary pressure observed at a given saturation depends on the wetting drying history of the medium in general when water is drained out of a porous medium a higher capillary pressure is observed at a given saturation compared with the case where water is allowed to imbibe flow in to the porous medium chen et al 2007 the capillary pressure saturation pc s relationship is an important input for a range of practical applications including understanding and simulating contaminant fate and transport in multiphase systems pasha et al 2014 hossain and mumford 2017 simulating slope stability chiu et al 2012 rianna et al 2018 modeling pavement subsurface drainage lebeau and konrad 2009 and understanding the hydraulic performance of geosynthetic clay liners beddoe et al 2011 many properties of porous media depend on the pc s relationship including water storage vaunat et al 2000 huang et al 2011 shear strength fredlund et al 1996 öberg and sällfors 1997 vanapalli and fredlund 2000 hydraulic conductivity rawls et al 1998 parent et al 2007 as well as structural properties such as tensile strength yin and vanapalli 2018 and resilient modulus for pavement design han et al 2016 evaporation is a process that can occur when a water surface is in contact with air that isn t fully saturated with water vapor i e air with a relative humidity less than 100 in the subsurface evaporation occurs from partially saturated soil pores and can be significant near the ground surface brutsaert 2014 factors influencing the temporal variation in evaporation and the effects of evaporation on ground surface water content have been widely studied e g daamen and simmonds 1996 brutsaert 2014 mosthaf et al 2014 haghighi and or 2015 however to date little work has been reported examining the effects of evaporation on the pc s relationship because of the importance of the pc s relationship to the movement of water in unsaturated porous media this is a critical knowledge gap the hypothesis driving this work was that the pc s relationship is the result of a dynamic equilibrium between the various factors that influence water content in unsaturated media i e capillary forces evaporative water loss and the upward flow of water to replenish evaporated water for a given system increasing evaporation rate should lead to a lower pc for a given s to explore this hypothesis long term evaporation experiments were conducted in a sand in two configurations with different capacities for evaporation one a closed column where air could only enter the top the other an open column vented along its entire length additional experiments were conducted using a membrane as the porous medium to explore a system with a very high ratio of surface area available for evaporation to bulk volume where evaporation was likely to dominate observed behavior 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials two porous media were used in experiments discussed in this paper a sand and a membrane the sand was us silica ottawa il f30 sand a coarse high purity foundry grade sand with an average grain size d50 of 590 µm the sand was used for long term evaporation experiments the membrane was a supported nylon membrane with a 20 µm pore size purchased from ge osmonics minnetonka mn the membrane was purchased in 293 mm diameter discs and cut into strips for the work as described below 2 2 experimental procedures fig 1 shows the experimental configuration used for the sand two parallel columns of sand were packed into a frame made from 3 2 mm thick acrylic the sand columns were 304 8 mm tall 25 4 mm wide and 12 7 mm thick the closed column was covered on both the front and back face with acrylic while the open column was covered with acrylic on the front face and a stainless steel 40 mesh screen on the back face to increase accessibility of air to the sand column internal opaque plastic spacers were used between and to the sides of the two columns to create the 12 7 mm spacing between the front and back faces the bottoms of both columns were covered with the 40 mesh to hold the sand in place while allowing water to imbibe or drain the tops of both columns were left open to allow air to move freely in and out of the sand columns were packed dry to allow measurement of spontaneous imbibition because of the thin 12 7 mm optical path of the columns columns were packed in a horizontal orientation prior to assembly i e the acrylic cover was carefully attached after dry sand was packed into the horizontal partially assembled columns this approach yielded a stable packing that did not shift during experiments and did not exhibit layers along the height of columns in their vertical orientation the columns were placed vertically in a clear plastic reservoir of width 193 mm depth in the direction of the optical path 90 mm and height 280 mm the reservoir had a small opening on the side near the bottom which was connected to a tank of identical dimensions with a clear plastic hose the tank was filled with water and raised to fill the reservoir or lowered to drain it the hose contained a valve along its length which could be opened to allow flow between the reservoir and tank or closed to prevent flow between them imaging for the experiment was done with a basler pua1280 54uc camera and a fujinon tv zoom lens model h6x12 5r with a focal length range of 12 5 75 mm and maximum aperture of f 1 2 columns were backlit with a fluorescent backlight measuring 600 mm by 500 mm consisting of two fluorescent tubes behind a translucent white plastic diffuser non reflective opaque material was attached around the perimeter of the reservoir to ensure that only light passing through the columns reached the camera there was a distance of 3 2 m between the experimental setup and the camera the reservoir was filled to a desired height by raising the tank above the reservoir thus allowing water from the external tank to flow into the reservoir under gravity once the desired level water was reached in the reservoir the valve on the hose was closed to stop the flow of water the columns were allowed to imbibe with their bottom ends submerged in water for at least 24 h or until the wetting front in the porous medium stabilized stopped advancing next the columns were saturated by opening the valve and letting water fill the reservoir completely submerging the columns the columns were allowed to stand submerged in the water for at least 12 h until no further change in water content was observed in the columns although some entrapped air may have been present in the columns none was apparent through visible observation it is likely that the fact the entire length of the columns was under positive pressure minimized the potential for residual air the water level was then lowered in the reservoir by lowering the tank level below the reservoir opening up the valve and allowing water to flow out of the reservoir into the tank under gravity until the water level was again near the bottom of the columns the columns were allowed to stand undisturbed and evaporation was allowed to proceed under ambient room conditions within a temperature range of approx 21 23 c for the four month duration of the experiment atmospheric humidity was not controlled to prevent the water level from dropping too fast because of evaporation a thin layer of flexible polymer foam was used to cover the exposed water surface in the reservoir lehmann et al 2019 in addition 30 50 ml of water was added directly to the reservoir daily this allowed for a gradual drop of the water level over the course of the experiment ensuring that drainage curves were observed the columns were monitored by taking images of them at regular intervals the long term drainage evaporation experiment was continued until the water level in the reservoir dropped too low for its location to be observed in images a similar system was used to image the membrane a rectangular piece of nylon membrane 290 mm tall by 55 mm wide was attached to a rectangular aluminum frame 310 mm tall and 76 mm wide approx 25 mm width of the membrane was visible through the frame the frame was placed inside a clear reservoir identical to the one used for the sand columns the procedures with the membrane were similar to those used with the sand columns except the flexible polymer foam and regular water additions were not needed to slow the evaporation in the reservoir because of the much shorter timescales of the membrane experiments additional experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of reducing evaporation by covering the reservoir containing the membrane with polyethylene cling wrap images were processed using a python program written for the work the program calculates saturation as a function of height using light transmission calculations based on method a described by niemet and selker 2001 a variation of the approach used previously by naghavi and kibbey 2014 for this work light intensity was averaged at each elevation to yield a single saturation value for each elevation the measurements had the vertical imaged resolution one pixel height approx 530 µm although that is similar to the average grain size for the sand used it is important to emphasize that each measured point represents a value based on the full width and thickness of the column at that elevation a volume that corresponds to the pore water surrounding approx 170 sand grains for each measured saturation value note that because of differences in the refraction by wet vs dry porous media images of saturated media are brighter than images of dry media 3 results and discussion fig 2 shows selected images from a long term experiment conducted with the f30 sand image pairs are shown for the closed left and open right system at different wetting or drying states note that the water levels in the reservoir have been aligned in the images to allow direct comparison between images the leftmost image pair shows the columns after spontaneous imbibition into initially dry columns had stabilized and was no longer changing the image shown corresponds to 39 h after the start of imbibition note that a subsequent experiment in a different packing of the same media found no measurable change in water content above the air entry pressure for the open or closed systems over two weeks after imbibition had initially stabilized so the imbibition image in the figure can be considered representative of equilibrium imbibition the remaining five image pairs in fig 2 show drainage over the course of 60 days the image labeled t 0 is the image that was taken immediately after the water level was initially dropped to begin the process of draining the columns from their fully saturated state it is apparent from the images that substantial drainage had occurred within the first hour within both the open and closed systems over the remainder of the 60 days both the open and closed systems continued to change at much slower rates with the saturated bright portion of each column gradually decreasing in height in each case while some of the initial decrease in both systems e g over the first day in the images perhaps slightly longer likely includes contributions from continued drainage it is likely that the longer term changes in both systems result from evaporation fig 3 shows pc s drainage curves calculated from the images for the f30 sand systems over a period of 117 7 days imbibition curves are also shown for reference fig 3a corresponds to the closed system while fig 3b corresponds to the open system fig 3a shows initial rapid drainage which occurred within the first 2 h of draining the samples after which little change is evident over much of the pc s curve it should be noted that elevation and capillary pressure are not equivalent in cases where there is significant pressure driven vertical flow so the curves from the first few hours of drainage are not pc s curves but rather are plots of elevation vs s only the top portion of the closed column the portion initially near residual saturation above the capillary fringe continued to decrease in saturation over the remainder of the 117 7 days after 5 7 days the saturation at the very top of the closed sample had dropped to approximately zero over the next 111 days the saturation of the top 6 cm of the closed sample continued to gradually decrease as a drying front moved down the column from the open top in contrast no change is observed lower in the column note that the curves between 12 6 and 101 days are plotted at 7 day intervals because the experiment ended when the water became too low in the reservoir to observe the water level the datum from which capillary pressure is measured it is not known whether the drying front would have ultimately continued down into the capillary fringe however the higher wetting phase relative permeability in the more saturated capillary fringe compared with the portion higher in the column initially near residual saturation likely means that upward flow of water through the capillary fringe would be greater than higher in the column so could potentially provide water at a greater rate it is probable there is an equilibrium pc s curve perhaps not too different from the 117 7 day curve where water flow balances evaporation and no further change is observed over time this is made increasingly likely by the larger zone of dry sand at the top of the column a situation which has been reported by others to slow evaporation e g good et al 2015 balugani et al 2018 like the closed system fig 3a the open system fig 3b shows both rapid initial drainage and gradual evaporation above the capillary fringe unlike the closed system however the open system exhibits two major differences first the initial drainage in the capillary fringe the higher saturation portion was actually slower for the open system than the closed system note that at 1 h the capillary pressures were actually higher in the open system fig 3b than in the closed system at high saturations this is likely because air entering lower in the column slows drainage of water from the top of the column by reducing the wetting phase relative permeability lower in the column a similar phenomenon has been identified as the source of boundary induced saturation inversion in rapidly draining columns e g kibbey et al 2016 second unlike the closed system fig 3a the higher saturation region of the open column fig 3b continued to gradually decrease in saturation to well beyond the time when the high saturation region of the closed system had stopped changing only after approx 60 days did the capillary fringe of the open system appear to stop changing note that curves from 51 to 117 days are largely overlapping in fig 3b with any differences falling mostly within the measurement noise while the capillary pressures in the open system fig 3b appear to have plateaued at levels higher than the imbibition curve they are lower than in the closed system fig 3a the difference in response to evaporation between the two systems likely results from the different air accessibility between them producing different evaporation rates the greater area for air mass transfer in the open system produces a higher rate of evaporative water removal from the column than in the closed system yielding a different equilibrium between upward water flow and evaporation fig 4 provides a direct comparison between the imbibition and long term drainage pc s curves for both the closed and open systems in fig 3 it is apparent from fig 4 that the long term drainage curve in the open system is significantly lower than in the closed system note that the two imbibition curves are virtually identical a fact that highlights that the observed differences in behavior could not have resulted from differences in packing between the two systems figs 5 and 6 further illustrate the differences between the closed and open systems fig 5 shows the elevation from the water table as a function of time for water saturations of 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 in the f30 sand systems fig 5a corresponds to the closed system while fig 5b corresponds to the open system note that elevations in the closed system fig 5a stabilize rapidly for all but the lowest saturation 0 2 exhibiting virtually no change over the duration of the experiment in contrast elevations at all saturations in the open system continue to decrease over time up to approx 60 days after 60 days elevations at the lowest saturation 0 2 continue to decrease gradually in the closed system fig 5a but not in the open system fig 5b fig 6 shows ratios of the curves in fig 5a and b illustrating both the lower initial elevation in the closed system likely due to the slowed initial drainage in the open system and then the extent to which evaporation causes the behavior of the two to deviate for approx 60 days after which near steady state configurations are reached i e the long term drainage curves in fig 4 to better understand the differences in behavior between the open and closed sand systems experiments were conducted using a porous nylon membrane as the porous medium the membrane is like an extreme case of the open system with a very high external surface area to bulk volume ratio that fact should accentuate the effect of evaporation on water configuration in the system fig 7 shows selected images from a drainage experiment with the membrane the leftmost image shows the membrane after spontaneous imbibition from an initially dry state the remaining images show drainage after 0 24 and 48 h note that the water levels in the reservoir have been aligned in the images to allow direct comparison between images fig 8 shows pc s drainage curves calculated from the images for the membrane over a period of 63 h the imbibition curve is also shown for reference note that the evaporation in the system occurs much more rapidly than in the sand systems so after approx 48 h the drainage curves had evaporated to the imbibition curve after which no change was observed subsequent experiments with the reservoir covered with polyethylene cling wrap were conducted as a means of slowing evaporation from the membrane by increasing humidity in the air around it the experiments led to the interesting discovery that both the imbibition and drainage curves were above the top of the membrane in the covered system that is if the reservoir were covered an initially saturated membrane would never drain the air entry pressure was above the top of the membrane and if an imbibition experiment were conducted in the covered reservoir the water would rapidly rise to the top of the membrane this phenomenon is illustrated in fig 9 which shows the elevation above the water table where s 0 4 for another membrane experiment note that elevation decreases over the course of approx 5 d as evaporation occurs after which the elevation remains approximately steady the plateau is slightly lower than in fig 8 presumably because of slightly different ambient temperature or humidity at the times the experiments were conducted just after 8 days the reservoir containing the membrane was covered increasing the moisture content in the air around the membrane by preventing equilibration between water and the reservoir and the surrounding room it is apparent from the figure that the membrane rapidly re saturates once the reservoir is covered highlighting the link between evaporation rate and the pc s state covering the reservoir decreases the driving force for evaporation slowing its rate and ultimately yielding a different equilibrium relationship between pc and s throughout the membrane 4 conclusions results of this work suggest that there is link between the observed pc s relationship in a porous medium and the rate of evaporation systems where evaporation is significant exhibit long term changes in the pc s state with drainage pc s curves appearing to gradually drop towards imbibition curves over time no changes were observed in evaporating imbibition curves under constant evaporation conditions in a closed column where evaporation could occur from the top of the column saturation decreased only at the top of the column where moisture content was near residual saturation this was likely both due to the fact that evaporation only occurred from the open top of the column and the fact that relative permeability is low at low saturation slowing upward flow to replenish the evaporated porewater in an open column where evaporation could occur along the length of the column saturation gradually decreased over the entire height of the profile experiments conducted with a membrane as the porous medium found that the high external area to volume ratio caused evaporation rate to play a substantial role in the pc s behavior drainage curves were observed to evaporate down to match imbibition curves furthermore changing the evaporation rate by closing an open system led to rapid changes in pc s state for the membrane a practical implication of the results of this work is that long term experiments in a column vented along its length may not necessarily be representative of equilibrium capillary pressure measurements but may reflect the effects of evaporation there are many historical examples in the literature where vented columns are used to measure static capillary pressures for comparison with dynamic measurements e g rogers and klute 1971 depending on the extent of venting those measurements may not be true static values so may not really be appropriate for comparison with dynamic measurements the work also suggests that equilibrium pc s state in some systems may depend not only on capillary forces but also on conditions that influence evaporation credit authorship contribution statement aderonke o adegbule conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft

size for the sand used it is important to emphasize that each measured point represents a value based on the full width and thickness of the column at that elevation a volume that corresponds to the pore water surrounding approx 170 sand grains for each measured saturation value note that because of differences in the refraction by wet vs dry porous media images of saturated media are brighter than images of dry media 3 results and discussion fig 2 shows selected images from a long term experiment conducted with the f30 sand image pairs are shown for the closed left and open right system at different wetting or drying states note that the water levels in the reservoir have been aligned in the images to allow direct comparison between images the leftmost image pair shows the columns after spontaneous imbibition into initially dry columns had stabilized and was no longer changing the image shown corresponds to 39 h after the start of imbibition note that a subsequent experiment in a different packing of the same media found no measurable change in water content above the air entry pressure for the open or closed systems over two weeks after imbibition had initially stabilized so the imbibition image in the figure can be considered representative of equilibrium imbibition the remaining five image pairs in fig 2 show drainage over the course of 60 days the image labeled t 0 is the image that was taken immediately after the water level was initially dropped to begin the process of draining the columns from their fully saturated state it is apparent from the images that substantial drainage had occurred within the first hour within both the open and closed systems over the remainder of the 60 days both the open and closed systems continued to change at much slower rates with the saturated bright portion of each column gradually decreasing in height in each case while some of the initial decrease in both systems e g over the first day in the images perhaps slightly longer likely includes contributions from continued drainage it is likely that the longer term changes in both systems result from evaporation fig 3 shows pc s drainage curves calculated from the images for the f30 sand systems over a period of 117 7 days imbibition curves are also shown for reference fig 3a corresponds to the closed system while fig 3b corresponds to the open system fig 3a shows initial rapid drainage which occurred within the first 2 h of draining the samples after which little change is evident over much of the pc s curve it should be noted that elevation and capillary pressure are not equivalent in cases where there is significant pressure driven vertical flow so the curves from the first few hours of drainage are not pc s curves but rather are plots of elevation vs s only the top portion of the closed column the portion initially near residual saturation above the capillary fringe continued to decrease in saturation over the remainder of the 117 7 days after 5 7 days the saturation at the very top of the closed sample had dropped to approximately zero over the next 111 days the saturation of the top 6 cm of the closed sample continued to gradually decrease as a drying front moved down the column from the open top in contrast no change is observed lower in the column note that the curves between 12 6 and 101 days are plotted at 7 day intervals because the experiment ended when the water became too low in the reservoir to observe the water level the datum from which capillary pressure is measured it is not known whether the drying front would have ultimately continued down into the capillary fringe however the higher wetting phase relative permeability in the more saturated capillary fringe compared with the portion higher in the column initially near residual saturation likely means that upward flow of water through the capillary fringe would be greater than higher in the column so could potentially provide water at a greater rate it is probable there is an equilibrium pc s curve perhaps not too different from the 117 7 day curve where water flow balances evaporation and no further change is observed over time this is made increasingly likely by the larger zone of dry sand at the top of the column a situation which has been reported by others to slow evaporation e g good et al 2015 balugani et al 2018 like the closed system fig 3a the open system fig 3b shows both rapid initial drainage and gradual evaporation above the capillary fringe unlike the closed system however the open system exhibits two major differences first the initial drainage in the capillary fringe the higher saturation portion was actually slower for the open system than the closed system note that at 1 h the capillary pressures were actually higher in the open system fig 3b than in the closed system at high saturations this is likely because air entering lower in the column slows drainage of water from the top of the column by reducing the wetting phase relative permeability lower in the column a similar phenomenon has been identified as the source of boundary induced saturation inversion in rapidly draining columns e g kibbey et al 2016 second unlike the closed system fig 3a the higher saturation region of the open column fig 3b continued to gradually decrease in saturation to well beyond the time when the high saturation region of the closed system had stopped changing only after approx 60 days did the capillary fringe of the open system appear to stop changing note that curves from 51 to 117 days are largely overlapping in fig 3b with any differences falling mostly within the measurement noise while the capillary pressures in the open system fig 3b appear to have plateaued at levels higher than the imbibition curve they are lower than in the closed system fig 3a the difference in response to evaporation between the two systems likely results from the different air accessibility between them producing different evaporation rates the greater area for air mass transfer in the open system produces a higher rate of evaporative water removal from the column than in the closed system yielding a different equilibrium between upward water flow and evaporation fig 4 provides a direct comparison between the imbibition and long term drainage pc s curves for both the closed and open systems in fig 3 it is apparent from fig 4 that the long term drainage curve in the open system is significantly lower than in the closed system note that the two imbibition curves are virtually identical a fact that highlights that the observed differences in behavior could not have resulted from differences in packing between the two systems figs 5 and 6 further illustrate the differences between the closed and open systems fig 5 shows the elevation from the water table as a function of time for water saturations of 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 in the f30 sand systems fig 5a corresponds to the closed system while fig 5b corresponds to the open system note that elevations in the closed system fig 5a stabilize rapidly for all but the lowest saturation 0 2 exhibiting virtually no change over the duration of the experiment in contrast elevations at all saturations in the open system continue to decrease over time up to approx 60 days after 60 days elevations at the lowest saturation 0 2 continue to decrease gradually in the closed system fig 5a but not in the open system fig 5b fig 6 shows ratios of the curves in fig 5a and b illustrating both the lower initial elevation in the closed system likely due to the slowed initial drainage in the open system and then the extent to which evaporation causes the behavior of the two to deviate for approx 60 days after which near steady state configurations are reached i e the long term drainage curves in fig 4 to better understand the differences in behavior between the open and closed sand systems experiments were conducted using a porous nylon membrane as the porous medium the membrane is like an extreme case of the open system with a very high external surface area to bulk volume ratio that fact should accentuate the effect of evaporation on water configuration in the system fig 7 shows selected images from a drainage experiment with the membrane the leftmost image shows the membrane after spontaneous imbibition from an initially dry state the remaining images show drainage after 0 24 and 48 h note that the water levels in the reservoir have been aligned in the images to allow direct comparison between images fig 8 shows pc s drainage curves calculated from the images for the membrane over a period of 63 h the imbibition curve is also shown for reference note that the evaporation in the system occurs much more rapidly than in the sand systems so after approx 48 h the drainage curves had evaporated to the imbibition curve after which no change was observed subsequent experiments with the reservoir covered with polyethylene cling wrap were conducted as a means of slowing evaporation from the membrane by increasing humidity in the air around it the experiments led to the interesting discovery that both the imbibition and drainage curves were above the top of the membrane in the covered system that is if the reservoir were covered an initially saturated membrane would never drain the air entry pressure was above the top of the membrane and if an imbibition experiment were conducted in the covered reservoir the water would rapidly rise to the top of the membrane this phenomenon is illustrated in fig 9 which shows the elevation above the water table where s 0 4 for another membrane experiment note that elevation decreases over the course of approx 5 d as evaporation occurs after which the elevation remains approximately steady the plateau is slightly lower than in fig 8 presumably because of slightly different ambient temperature or humidity at the times the experiments were conducted just after 8 days the reservoir containing the membrane was covered increasing the moisture content in the air around the membrane by preventing equilibration between water and the reservoir and the surrounding room it is apparent from the figure that the membrane rapidly re saturates once the reservoir is covered highlighting the link between evaporation rate and the pc s state covering the reservoir decreases the driving force for evaporation slowing its rate and ultimately yielding a different equilibrium relationship between pc and s throughout the membrane 4 conclusions results of this work suggest that there is link between the observed pc s relationship in a porous medium and the rate of evaporation systems where evaporation is significant exhibit long term changes in the pc s state with drainage pc s curves appearing to gradually drop towards imbibition curves over time no changes were observed in evaporating imbibition curves under constant evaporation conditions in a closed column where evaporation could occur from the top of the column saturation decreased only at the top of the column where moisture content was near residual saturation this was likely both due to the fact that evaporation only occurred from the open top of the column and the fact that relative permeability is low at low saturation slowing upward flow to replenish the evaporated porewater in an open column where evaporation could occur along the length of the column saturation gradually decreased over the entire height of the profile experiments conducted with a membrane as the porous medium found that the high external area to volume ratio caused evaporation rate to play a substantial role in the pc s behavior drainage curves were observed to evaporate down to match imbibition curves furthermore changing the evaporation rate by closing an open system led to rapid changes in pc s state for the membrane a practical implication of the results of this work is that long term experiments in a column vented along its length may not necessarily be representative of equilibrium capillary pressure measurements but may reflect the effects of evaporation there are many historical examples in the literature where vented columns are used to measure static capillary pressures for comparison with dynamic measurements e g rogers and klute 1971 depending on the extent of venting those measurements may not be true static values so may not really be appropriate for comparison with dynamic measurements the work also suggests that equilibrium pc s state in some systems may depend not only on capillary forces but also on conditions that influence evaporation credit authorship contribution statement aderonke o adegbule conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft

5841,artificial recharge of groundwater is an effective strategy for supplementing groundwater resources it is noteworthy that most artificial recharge facilities suffer from clogging problems which mainly result from suspended particles or bacteria in the recharge water in this study percolation experiments in sand columns were used to investigate the combined effects of suspended particles and bacteria on the permeability of porous media which has been ignored in the past during the recharge process it took a much shorter period of time 3 h for a particle bacteria group pbg to achieve a relative hydraulic conductivity of 0 30 compared with a particle only group pg 28 h and a bacteria only group bg 3 5 h a combination of relevance analysis pathway analysis electron microscopy and high throughput sequencing were employed to identify the key controlling factors in the occurrence of clogging and the governing mechanisms under the co existence of particles and bacteria the dominant genera of the pbg included acinetobacter sphingobacterium comamonas and elizabethkingia these microbes displayed a poor ability for movement and high adhesion which facilitated the clogging process for the pbg the results indicated that bacterial cell growth and particle accumulation contributed to a reduction in k both separately and interactively during the recharge process 0 3 h but that polysaccharide produced by bacteria began to have an impact during the later stages stage ii 0 5 1 h and stage iii 1 3 h the development of clogging in the pbg was primarily controlled by van der waals forces electrostatic repulsion and bridging during stage i 0 0 5 h during the later stages hydrogen bonds and polymerization of extracellular polymeric substances became the governing factors these results provide an evaluation of clogging under the coexistence of suspended particles and bacteria having implications for field based artificial recharge keywords clogging relative hydraulic

groundwater is one of the most important water resources which plays a crucial role in human activities global groundwater extraction is estimated to be approximately 1500 km3 yr 1 aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 which seriously aggravates groundwater depletion as the demand for groundwater increases overexploitation leads to a series of environmental problems soil salinization ground subsidence seawater intrusion etc cui et al 2018 page et al 2014 artificial groundwater recharge systems can supplement groundwater resources by injection of water into aquifers this is practiced worldwide in countries rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 such as the netherlands peters 1989 the usa pyne 1995 and australia pavelic and dillon 1997 to mitigate the overexploitation of groundwater however artificial recharge of groundwater suffers from clogging issues relating to the initial quality of the recharged water this can reduce the efficiency of artificial groundwater recharge facilities and may render such facilities completely ineffective reclaimed water is one kind of important recharge water which can reduce the risk of clogging however the amount of reclaimed water is limited storm water is also an important source the artificial recharge of storm water can mitigate the flood risk and replenish groundwater masetti et al 2016 rathay et al 2018 many countries promote the reuse of storm water actively such as japan germany and china yan et al 2013 however no matter what kind of recharge water is used one cannot completely avoid the occurrence of clogging especially for storm water mainly due to suspended particles and microbes contained in recharge water or from the soil clogging of artificial recharge systems is mainly caused by suspended particles fetzer et al 2017 chemical sedimentation cui et al 2018 microorganism growth baveye et al 1998 xian et al 2019 production of extracellular polymeric substances xia et al 2016 entrapment of gas ye et al 2009 previous field surveys have indicated that clogging caused by suspended particles microbes chemical sedimentation gas accumulation colloid release granular particles reorganization and other factors accounted for 50 15 10 10 5 5 5 of cases of clogging respectively dillon and pavelic 1996 it was demonstrated that suspended particles and microorganisms were two dominant contributors to clogging yet these two factors have usually been investigated separately page et al 2014 for studies concerned with the occurrence of physical clogging hydraulic permeability has usually been measured using a column filled with sterilized porous media and fed with sterilized recharge water containing suspended particles zheng et al 2014 the properties of the suspended particles such as concentration particle size play a crucial role in the clogging process pavelic et al 2007 some researchers have proposed that a suspended particle content of more than 25 mg l or more than 3 nephelometric turbidity units ntu will trigger clogging pavelic et al 2011 in addition the properties of the porous media hua et al 2010 and the percolation velocity alem et al 2013 of feed water also show correlations with permeability of porous media to elucidate the formation of biological clogging and the influence of microbial growth and metabolism on the permeability of porous media experimental columns recharged with water deprived of suspended particles have been used pavelic et al 2011 hua et al 2018 it has been reported that biological clogging is induced by algae and other microorganisms the number of colony forming units cfu that results in the clogging of soil was discussed vandevivere and baveye 1992 doretto et al 2017 singh et al 2018 suleiman and swartzendruber 2003 found that hydraulic conductivity was reduced by two orders of magnitude when the content of bacteria exceeded 1 3 106 cfu g as well as microbial cell accumulation extracellular polymeric substances eps produced by microbial metabolism also contributes to biological clogging xia et al 2014 given that most existing research has focused on single clogging processes and mechanisms i e either physical or biological realistic recharge conditions in which both suspended particles and microorganisms coexist and interact have not yet been considered therefore the formation mechanism and evolution of clogging under more realistic conditions need to be explored further as ubiquitous fractions in recharged water the fate of microorganisms and suspended particles in porous media may be determined by their mutual interaction and their interactions with the porous media surface some researchers have demonstrated that bacteria bind to solids through van der waals forces for a short time at first and then adsorbs tightly and irreversibly through other forces denkhaus et al 2007 flemming and wingender 2001 proposed that electrostatic forces play a key role in the adsorption of eps to solid surfaces these interactions between microorganisms and solid surface including both suspended particles and porous media can influence the migration and sedimentation of coexisting suspended particles onto the surface of porous media at the same time the presence of microorganisms and their secretions can interact with particles which affects the migration of particles matter by coagulation he et al 2015 roche et al 2017 some microbes such as aspergillus flavus can flocculate activated carbon kaolin clay and soil solids via charge neutralization or bridging with their secretions aljuboori et al 2015 microorganisms also influence the migration of particles by modifying the surfaces of the solids for example leon morales et al 2007 observed that the presence of biofilms on the surfaces of filter media can affect the migration of colloidal particles eps coated sand promoted the migration of carboxylate modified latex particles tripathi et al 2012 in comparison with clean sand the decreased retention of poly vinylpyrrolidone stabilized silver nanoparticle pvp nag in biofilm coated sand was attributed to the repulsive electrostatic forces between pvp nag and the biofilm coated sand mitzel and tufenkji 2014 although attempts have been made to clarify the interactions between suspended particles and microbes studies have been rarely considered how these interactions influence the permeability of porous media in this study the percolation experiment in sand column was conducted to simulate the process of storm water recharge our specific research objectives were 1 to compare the permeability characteristics of porous media and identify dominant influence factors among three groups a particle only group a bacteria only group and a particle bacteria group 2 to elucidate the interactions between suspended particles and bacteria and their combined effects on the permeability of porous media 3 to unveil the time dependent clogging evolution mechanisms under the coexistence of suspended particles and bacteria and 4 to provide implications for clogging prevention and control 2 materials and methods 2 1 quartz sand and suspended particles quartz grains sio2 96 loss on ignition 0 40 xiamen iso standard sand co ltd china was used to simulate porous media which had particles sizes in the range of 0 50 1 00 mm quartz sand was soaked in hcl solution 0 25 m for 12 h to remove metal impurities followed by naoh solution 0 25 m for 12 h then they were washed in milli q water rinsing to neutral and incinerated in a muffle furnace at 550 for 2 h to remove organic matter before being packed into the experimental column the sand was sterilized using ultraviolet uv light x ray diffraction xrd analysis of suspended particles from storm water collected in the qingdao area shandong province of china revealed that the main component was sio2 88 in order to avoid the influence of organic matter and unknown components on the microorganisms and to avoid the destruction of the structure of the suspended particles by removing organic matter using incineration quartz powder was used to simulate suspended particles with particle size 20 μm sediment of this diameter size effectively simulates particle sizes of suspended particles in real storm water the quartz powder was immersed in 0 25 m hcl with at a liquid to solid ratio of 3 1 it was then heated at 80 c in a water bath for 8 h and the distilled water was repeatedly washed to neutral finally quartz powder was vacuum dried and sterilized using uv light 2 2 inoculum and nutrient solution to simulate storm water a mixture of a microbial consortium and water was collected from wangjiaxia river n36 17999 e120 492455 in qingdao city shandong province of china as the inoculum then the inoculum was cultivated in an enriched liquid medium containing peptone 0 5 g l beef extract 1 g l and nacl 0 5 g l when the experiment was conducted the nutrient solution was added to the sand column along with recharge water the nutrient solution contained c n p and 1 ml of a trace element solution in order to maintain stability and consistency in the influent microorganisms the inoculum for the entire experiment was cultivated and collected in a single batch 2 3 experimental setup and operation the experimental setup mainly comprises a plexiglas column a water inlet tank including a stirring device a peristaltic pump a water control head device and a manometer fig 1 the plexiglass column was 38 cm in length and 5 cm in an internal diameter piezometers were connected to the experimental column at 0 3 5 7 13 19 and 25 cm from the inlet to measure the hydraulic gradient triplicate identical experiments were conducted in this study the pretreated quartz sand was packed into plexiglas columns with equal volume density using the wet method then the sand filled columns were slowly saturated with sterilized milli q water from the bottom to top the percolation process was continued for 24 h to remove the residual gas after the pressure plate reading was stable an initial value was recorded the synthetic recharge water was then introduced from the top of the column with a constant water head δh 10 cm after complete saturation three types of synthetic recharge water were used in the experiments 1 a particle only group pg which had a suspended particle content of 100 ntu 2 a bacteria only group bg which had a microbial content of 106 cfu ml and 3 a particle bacteria group pbg which had a suspended particle content of 100 ntu and a microbial content of 106 cfu ml 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 hydraulic conductivity the saturated hydraulic conductivity k is calculated according to darcy s law 1 k 4 q δ x π d 2 δ h where q is the flow rate m 3 d δ x is the distance between two manometric tubes along the column m δ h is the hydraulic head difference at a distance of δ x m and d is the inner diameter of the column m in this paper the relative hydraulic conductivity k is used to depict the degree of clogging 2 k k k 0 where k is relative hydraulic conductivity k0 is initial hydraulic conductivity m d k is hydraulic conductivity at any time m d 2 4 2 deposition of suspended particles the deposition of the suspended particles in the porous media was determined by gravimetric methods sand samples were carefully taken out from the first layer 0 3 cm in the columns after the percolation experiments dried at 110 c to constant weight and weighed using a high precision 0 0001 g electronic balance the clogged weight samples were then ultrasonically cleaned for 15 min rinsed with tap water to remove suspended particles and dried at 110 c and re weighed the unclogged weight the difference between the clogged and unclogged weights provided a measure of the number of suspended particles deposited in the media during the experiments 2 4 3 bacterial cell count and eps quantification the number of bacterial cells was determined by plate counting after dismantling each sand column a 15 g sand sample was collected from the upper layer 0 3 cm which was sonicated in a sterile centrifuge tube containing 15 ml of phosphate buffer solution pb ph 7 4 and 1 5 g of glass beads xia et al 2016 the mixture was vortexed for 1 min and then was diluted to an appropriate dilution as to coat the plate the coated plates were incubated at 37 c for 48 h eps was extracted via formaldehyde naoh method depicted by liu and fang 2002 and modified by xia et al 2014 the content of polysaccharide μg g sand in eps was measured by phenol sulfuric acid method the protein content μg g sand was determined by bradford assay method the content was analyzed using 2800 uv vis spectrophotometer unico usa the polysaccharide content and protein content were then measured the sum of which was recorded as the eps yield 2 4 4 electron microscopy analysis after recharge 5 g sand samples were rinsed lightly with deionized water several times the sand samples were then immersed in 4 w v glutaraldehyde solution at 4 c for 24 h and gently washed several times with 0 1 mol l phosphate buffer the samples were dehydrated by sequential immersion in ethanol solution 30 50 70 90 and 100 v v for 10 15 min in each case the dehydrated samples were dried in a vacuum dryer for 24 h and their surfaces were plated with a platinum film the prepared samples were observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy s 4800 n hitachi limited japan 2 4 5 high throughput sequencing the dna of the microbial sample collected from sand surface was extracted with powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca the extracted dna was detected by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis in each case 30 ng dna sample was used in pcr amplification the universal primers 341f 5 gtactcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 534r 5 gtggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 were used to amplify the 16s rrna gene the obtained pcr amplification products were detected by 2 agarose gel electrophoresis finally the dna insert was dual ends sequenced using target region amplification in conjunction with an illumina miseq sequencer san diego ca usa 2 4 6 statistical analysis pearson s correlation analysis was conducted in ibm spss 22 0 and a test of significance was conducted by two way analysis of variance anova the path coefficient was calculated as described by dewey and lu 1959 using spss path coefficient analysis was used to partition the correlation coefficients and to determine the direct and indirect effects of the independent variables i e the deposition of suspended particles the bacterial cell count the polysaccharide content and protein content on the dependent variables k in order to carry out the path coefficient analysis normality of k for the pbg was checked using spss where normality was confirmed stepwise regression analysis between the dependent variable and the independent variables could be performed 3 results 3 1 variation of relative hydraulic conductivity relative hydraulic conductivity k was adopted to indicate the degree of clogging as shown in fig 2 k values of the entire sand column gradually decreased over time for the three groups pg bg and pbg as the percolation experiment preceded k declined steadily until a constant lower plateau was reached in the pg taking pg for example k of the pg decreased to 0 79 0 42 0 16 after 5 h 20 h 45 h respectively by comparing the k variation within the same period the decrease degree of k was in the order of pbg bg pg for example k values for the bg and the pbg had decreased to 0 41 and 0 30 respectively after 3 h while k of the pg was approximately 0 82 after the same period of time the recharge water flowed through the porous media from the top to the bottom which led to variation in the permeability throughout the column for each layer permeability decreased as the recharge proceeded but this occurred at different rates in the different layers in order to facilitate the analysis of these results the clogging process for each group was divided into three stages according to values of k in the upper layer 0 3 cm of the column as follows stage i 0 51 0 05 stage ii 0 20 0 05 and stage iii 0 05 0 05 for pg bg and pbg stage i therefore referred to 0 5 h 0 0 5 h and 0 0 5 h respectively stage ii referred to 5 20 h 0 5 2 h and 0 5 1 h respectively and stage iii referred to 20 45 h 2 3 5 h and 1 3 h respectively when the percolation progressed during stage ii 5 20 h as illustrated in fig 3 a k in the upper layer 0 3 cm of the pg dropped from 0 56 to 0 20 while in the lowest layer 19 25 cm k decreased from 0 93 to 0 79 k values for the different layers of the columns all showed a decreasing trend from the top to bottom this indicated that the differences in k between the surface layer and the lower layers was gradually augmented as the experiment proceeded for example for the pg the difference between the surface layer 0 3 cm and the bottom layer 19 25 cm increased over time from approximately 0 37 after 5 h to approximately 0 60 after 45 h fig 3 b and c show a similar decreasing trend for the bg and the pbg along the respective columns over time the change in k within the 0 3 cm layer showed the maximum drop among all the layers in the column for the bg and the pbg the rate of decrease in k in the upper layer was significantly higher for the bg and the pbg than the pg the difference in k between in the upper layer and the bottom layer in the bg and the pbg was 0 80 and 0 98 respectively which was 1 33 and 1 61 times that of the pg respectively in terms of the decrease rate of k between 0 and 3 cm the results in descending order was pbg bg pg 3 2 suspended particle accumulation over time according to the data shown in section 3 1 k decreased rapidly and displayed the greatest decrease within the surface layers 0 3 cm correspondingly the accumulation of suspended particles in the surface layers was recorded as a function of recharge time in both the pg and the pbg in fig 4 a the accumulation of suspended particles of the pg increased from 6 53 mg g sand to 26 11 mg g sand during stage ii while k decreased from 0 56 to 0 20 at the end of stage iii 45 h k had decreased to 0 05 which was attributed to the cumulative number of suspended particles 56 30 mg g sand as the recharge proceeded k decreased gradually with the increasing accumulation of suspended particles in fig 4 b the suspended particles in the pbg increased from 6 11 mg g sand at the end of stage i 0 5 h to 22 27 mg g sand at the end of stage iii 3 h whilst k decreased from 0 46 to 0 06 when k showed similar decreases between the experimental groups the accumulation of suspended particles in the pg was notably higher than that in the pbg while it took less time for the same k reduction to occur in the pbg 3 3 variations in bacterial cell count and eps over time 3 3 1 bacterial cell count the porous media was sterilized before being packed into the experimental columns therefore all the bacteria obtained from porous media were derived from the artificial recharge water during stage i the bacteria cell count in the bg was 3 18e 06 cfu g sand higher than that of the pbg while k decreased to 0 56 and 0 46 in bg and pbg respectively from stage ii the bacterial cell count for the bg and the pbg increased sharply although they had notable differences as shown in fig 5 it is noteworthy that the bacterial cell count in the bg continuously increased over time at a progressively slower rate while the bacterial cell count in the pbg first increased and then decreased over time at the end of stage iii 3 5 h and 3 h for the bg and the pbg respectively with a bacterial cell count of 2 60e 08 and 1 75e 08 cfu g sand in the bg and the pbg respectively k had decreased to 0 04 and 0 06 respectively although the bacteria cell count in both of these groups increased the difference between the bg and the pbg became more and more pronounced over time by the end of the experiment the bacterial cell count in the bg was 8 52e 07 cfu g sand more than in the pbg 3 3 2 eps accumulation as shown in fig 6 the protein content of the bg and the pbg maintained generally stable as recharge proceeded during stage i and stage ii the polysaccharide content of the bg showed little fluctuation but a significant increase from 13 64 to 23 07 μg g sand was observed during stage iii along with a reduction of k from 0 24 to 0 04 the polysaccharide content of the pbg showed a rapid reduction during the initial stage and then followed a continuous increase over time during stage i the polysaccharide content of the pbg was higher than that of the bg however during stage ii the polysaccharide content of the pbg dropped to 13 01 μg g sand the polysaccharide content of the pbg then continuously increased to 21 12 μg g sand by the end of stage iii which was lower than that of the bg 3 4 surface morphology of the porous media during the recharge process suspended particles were continuously deposited on the surfaces of the porous media and microorganisms also grew and metabolized which led to changes in surface microtopography as displayed in fig 7 a the surfaces of the porous media were smooth and clean without any modifications prior to the start of the experiment at the end of the experiment the sem observations displayed flaky or powdery deposits on the sand fig 7 b the surfaces of the porous media for the bg were covered by three dimensional network structures and a dense biofilm fig 7 c at the same time clear bacterial outlines and a totally obscured sand grain surface indicated that bacteria growth was abundant in the porous media at the end of the experiment the surfaces of sand grains from the pbg were also covered by microorganisms and flaky suspended particles fig 7 d 3 5 microbial community composition fig 8 showed the diversity and dominant species of the different experimental groups varied over time shannon index was often used to illustrate the diversity of microbial community at the initial time of experiment the shannon index of both bg and pbg had a same value of 5 50 at the end of stage i 0 5 h the shannon index for the bg was 5 08 falling to 4 54 at the end of stage iii 3 5 h which reflected the microbial diversity was reduced the shannon index for the pbg increased from 3 82 to 4 35 from the end of stage i 0 5 h to the end of stage iii 3 h indicating that microbial diversity increased nevertheless the shannon index of the pbg remained lower than for the bg during the entire recharge process at the end of stage i the dominant genera in the bg and the pbg both included paucibacter elizabethkingia acinetobacter sphingobacterium and comamonas among these acinetobacter sphingobacterium comamonas elizabethkingia displayed a poor ability for movement and high adhesion which offered advantages for their preferential adhesion onto the porous media from the end of stage i to stage iii in the bg the relative abundance of sphingobacterium dworin et al 2006 that are able to metabolize polysaccharide increased from 4 32 to 15 79 the relative abundance of facultative exiguobacterium in the bg increased significantly and became dominant comparing stage i with stage iii the dominant genera in the pbg were very similar but varied in their relative abundance over time 4 discussion 4 1 the correlations between influential factors and relative hydraulic conductivity during the entire recharge process in the pg the reduction in k of the upper layer 0 3 cm was attributed to the accumulation of suspended particles during the first two stages 0 2 h in the bg the polysaccharide and protein content remained stable while the bacterial cell count increased sharply this indicated that the reduction in k resulted from the increase in the bacterial cell count during stage iii the content of polysaccharide in the bg increased over time and the ratio of genera that can secrete polysaccharide such as sphingobacterium increased in addition to the bacterial cell count polysaccharide contributed to the decline in k in the bg during stage iii based on the analysis of k suspended particles bacterial cell count and eps the clogging development process was compared among the different experimental groups and the key controlling factors in the different groups were identified as displayed in fig 4 when k declined to approximate 0 05 the number of suspended particles being deposited in the pg was approximately 2 53 times higher than that in the pbg this demonstrates that bacteria played a crucial role in the measured variation in k variation in the pbg the bacterial cell count in the bg increased by 4 99 times from stage i to stage ii while k declined from 0 56 to 0 24 by comparing the end of stage i 0 5 h with the end of stage ii 1 h it was found that in the pbg the bacterial cell count was increased by 3 38 times and k was reduced from 0 46 to 0 25 the increase in bacterial cell count in the bg was much higher than that in the pbg when the difference in k was almost the same during stage i and stage ii the bacterial cell count in the bg was increased by 7 33 times from the end of stage i 0 5 h to the end of stage iii 3 5 h and k was reduced to 0 04 by the end of stage iii 3 5 h comparing stage i with stage iii the bacterial cell count in the pbg was increased by 5 42 times and k had declined to 0 06 by the end of stage iii these results indicate that even a small number of suspended particles could aggravate the clogging process when the microbial content was high which is consistent with the results in other studies pavelic et al 2011 in order to assess the effects of the experimental variables on k during the recharge of the pbg correlation analysis was conducted the results depicted that particle deposition the bacterial cell count and the polysaccharide and protein contents were all significantly negatively associated with k table 1 in descending order the relative strength of the correlations was as follows bacterial cell count particle deposition polysaccharide content protein content these results are consistent with the results reported in sections 3 2 and 3 3 bacterial cell count continuously increased to 1 75e 08 cfu g sand and suspended particles accumulated to 22 27 mg g sand in the pbg which contributed to the reduction in k throughout the recharge experiment however the polysaccharide content in the pbg showed a decreasing trend during stage i and then increased from 13 01 to 21 12 μg g sand during stage ii and stage iii this indicated that the increase in the polysaccharide content resulted in the reduction in k during the last two stages 4 2 the interaction between suspended particles and bacterial cell count in particle bacteria clogging the data in fig 9 shows that k was gradually reduced with the accumulation of suspended particles in the pg a fitting formula between suspended particles and k could therefore be established a mathematical fitting formula was also established between bacterial cell count and k in the bg but the polysaccharide content was excluded based on the consideration that polysaccharide only contributed to the reduction in k during the last two stages the derived formula indicated an exponential relationship between suspended particles and k as follows 3 y e 0 02461 0 0692 x where y is the relative hydraulic conductivity k and x is the suspended particle content mg g sand the fitting formula between bacterial cell count and k was as follows 4 y 0 90453 6 17079 10 9 x 1 13784 10 17 x 2 where x is bacteria cell count cfu g sand by comparing the predicted and calculated values of k the influence of the interaction between suspended particles and bacteria on clogging could be assessed the predicted value of k in the pg and the bg were obtained by inputting the corresponding values for suspended particles and bacterial cell count in the pbg for each specific measured value of k in eqs 3 and 4 for instance the concentration of suspended particles in pbg reached 22 27 mg g sand during stage iii for which k was calculated by substituting this value into eq 3 yielding a predicted k of 0 21 a predicted k of 0 17 was calculated using eq 4 by applying the bacterial cell count of the pbg in the same way however during stage iii the k of the pbg actually decreased to 0 06 which indicated that the effect of suspended particle deposition and microbial biomass on the permeability of porous media was interactive it can be inferred that microorganisms and suspended particles not only affected variations of k independently but also interacted with each other to influence the clogging process therefore the mathematical relationship between bacterial cell count and k in the pg and between suspended particle deposition and k in the bg cannot accurately predict the combined contribution of these two factors to k in the pbg therefore path coefficient analysis was used to partition the correlation coefficients and determine the direct and indirect effects of particle deposition and bacteria on k the results of the regression analysis were as follows 5 y 1 002 0 023 x 1 0 057 x 2 where y is the relative hydraulic conductivity k x1 is the suspended particle content deposited on the porous media mg g sand and x2 is log10 of the bacterial cell count cfu g sand the significance of eq 5 was p 0 05 and r2 0 988 indicating that there was a good fit between the measured and predicted data the results of the path analysis are shown in table 2 these results show that the direct contribution of bacterial cell counts to k was greater than the contribution of suspended particle deposition which is consistent with the results in section 4 1 however based on the path analysis the indirect effect of suspended particles on k i e by influencing bacterial cell count was slightly higher than the indirect effect of bacterial cell count i e by influencing suspended particle deposition this indicates that suspended particles settling on porous media facilitate the adsorption of bacteria as discussed in more detail in section 4 3 the parameters derived in this study only can provide references for other studies but the numerical correlations mentioned in this section are strictly valid for this study and cannot be used as general equations valid for other lab and or field cases 4 3 the mechanism and evolution of physical biological clogging when suspended particles and microorganisms coexisted in the recharge water the forces between clogging related factors and the porous media were different from that under single factor conditions there was a variety of forces operating including van der waals forces electrostatic forces and hydrogen bonds between bacteria and suspended particles and between bacteria and the porous media explicit analysis of these forces was necessary to elucidate the mechanism and evolution of complex clogging the interplay between microbes porous media and suspended particles changes dynamically as recharge proceeds which has an impact on the evolution of clogging the isoelectric point of the bacteria was ph 2 to 5 as the artificial recharge water was close to neutral the surfaces of the bacterial cells were negatively charged cui et al 2018 in neutral recharge water the quartz sand used to simulate the porous media and the quartz powder used to simulate suspended particles were all negatively charged morrow et al 2005 zhao et al 2014 during stage i bacteria and suspended particles were transported with the water flow as free cells and free particles respectively the migration and deposition of suspended particles may be affected by inertia gravity sedimentation interception brownian diffusion and hydrodynamics chang et al 2004 ives 1970 when bacterial cells are far from porous media and suspended particles they diffuse by brownian motion and also convectively move within the water flow during this process the van der waals attraction plays a major role between bacteria and the solid surfaces i e the porous media and the suspended particles as distance decreased the electric fields among bacteria the porous media and the suspended particles become superimposed on each other because all of them had negative charge at this period of time electrostatic interactions become dominant in addition to van der waals forces and electrostatic repulsion bacteria can move towards the surfaces of porous media and suspended particles by flagellar propulsion and within flowing water subsequently bacteria can colonize on the porous media to form biofilms which can influence the settlement of suspended particles settled suspended particles provide a larger specific surface area which promotes the adsorption of bacteria in addition bacterial surface viscous materials can connect with the surfaces of the porous media and the suspended particles by bridging baveye et al 1998 grasso et al 2002 which results in stronger adsorption rong et al 2010 this promotes coagulation between the bacterial cells and the suspended particles ernissee and abbott 1975 comparing the suspended particle content of the pbg with that of the pg during stage i 0 0 5 h and 0 5 h respectively the pbg took less time to accumulate a similar number of suspended particles as the pg and the suspended particles in the pg migrated deeper into the column based on the analysis described in section 3 1 this is consistent with the results showing that the adsorption of bacteria onto the surfaces of particles made the particles more likely to settle in the upper layer within a short period time of recharge with recharge proceeding free bacteria would have been gradually adsorbed onto the surfaces of the porous media and the settled particles which accounts for the increasing contribution of bacterial cells to the decrease in k after stage i 0 5 3 h the bacterial cell count of the pbg increased at a slow rate while the polysaccharide content gradually increased and the deposition of suspended particles also continued to increase during this time the dextran contained in the bacterial extracellular lipopolysaccharide could combine with bound water on the surface of the media via the formation of hydrogen bonds jucker et al 1997 the acetyl group of extracellular polysaccharides enhance the adhesion of eps to solid surfaces porous media suspended particles flemming and wingender 2001 the increase in the amount of polysaccharide during this stage will result in a firmer bond with the surfaces of suspended particles so that more suspended particle can be adhered as recharge progressed the polysaccharide content in the eps increased significantly and polymerization dominated among the eps porous media and suspended particles thus the decrease in k in the pbg during this stage was mainly caused by the increase in the content of polysaccharides and suspended particles in the porous media suspended particles showed a negative correlation with k during the entire recharge process a schematic diagram of the recharge development process is shown in fig 10 4 4 implications for the prevention and control of clogging we demonstrated that bacteria and suspended particles can influence the permeability of porous media both separately and interactively which made clogging process more complex therefore it is fundamental to exercise strict control over the content of suspended particles and microorganisms in recharged water before the start of recharge taking china as an example the water quality standard for groundwater recharge for the reuse of urban recycling water has been established until 2005 and restrictions on total bacterial colony count in recharge water have not yet been included therefore it is recommended that the standard should be further revised to include such restrictions in addition to reduce the clogging risk pretreatments of recharge water are usually necessary however sometimes the pretreatment of recharge water merely by traditional disinfection and sterilization such as chemical chlorination fail to avoid clogging effectively although the dead microorganisms killed through these ways cannot further grow and reproduce they are still sticky substances that can adhere to porous media and then will trap suspended particles therefore environmental friendly biocides that are capable of completely hydrolyzing microbial cells are urgently needed to be developed even though the pretreatment of influent has been conducted there is still potential for clogging after long term operation according to our study during the clogging process the formation of biofilms consisting mainly of microbes and eps made it more resistant to external changes and the microbes and eps can trap suspended particles then the microbes and suspended particles formed a tight complex due to their interactions and the polymerization of eps which increases the potential for clogging and lowers the efficiency of recharge facilities therefore the proteolytic enzyme or polysaccharide hydrolase can be used to destroy the eps matrix so stability of biofilms will be weakened meanwhile the intermittent increase of recharge rate that provides higher shear forces can be implemented which can immediately wash out the destroyed biofilm part of suspended particles can also be removed by the change of shear forces therefore the combination use of hydrolase and change of recharge rate are recommended to remove the tightly bound abiotic and biotic components deposited on the surface of the medium in this way aquifer clogging can be alleviated and the permeability of porous media can be effectively recovered 5 conclusions the individual and combined effects of suspended particles and bacterial cells on the permeability of porous media were experimentally investigated to provide insights into the clogging mechanisms affecting groundwater facilities across the three experimental groups the rate of the decrease in relative hydraulic conductivity in descending order was pbg bg pg it took a much shorter period of time 3 h for the pbg to achieve a relative hydraulic conductivity of 0 30 for the entire sand column compared with the pg 28 h and the bg 3 5 h suspended particles and bacterial cells were the two main dominant factors the results indicated that bacterial cell growth and particle accumulation contributed to a reduction in k both separately and interactively during the recharge process 0 3 h but that polysaccharide produced by bacteria began to have an impact during the later stages stage ii 0 5 1 h and stage iii 1 3 h as recharge proceeds the dominant forces between the microbes the porous media and the suspended particles evolved dynamically from van der waals forces electrostatic repulsion and bridging to polymerization of eps based on our findings the pretreatments of microbes by environmental friendly biocides that can hydrolyze microbial cells need to be developed the combination use of proteolytic enzyme polysaccharide hydrolase intermittent increase of recharge rate are proposed for recovering the operational efficiency and prolonging the service life of groundwater recharge facilities credit authorship

5841,artificial recharge of groundwater is an effective strategy for supplementing groundwater resources it is noteworthy that most artificial recharge facilities suffer from clogging problems which mainly result from suspended particles or bacteria in the recharge water in this study percolation experiments in sand columns were used to investigate the combined effects of suspended particles and bacteria on the permeability of porous media which has been ignored in the past during the recharge process it took a much shorter period of time 3 h for a particle bacteria group pbg to achieve a relative hydraulic conductivity of 0 30 compared with a particle only group pg 28 h and a bacteria only group bg 3 5 h a combination of relevance analysis pathway analysis electron microscopy and high throughput sequencing were employed to identify the key controlling factors in the occurrence of clogging and the governing mechanisms under the co existence of particles and bacteria the dominant genera of the pbg included acinetobacter sphingobacterium comamonas and elizabethkingia these microbes displayed a poor ability for movement and high adhesion which facilitated the clogging process for the pbg the results indicated that bacterial cell growth and particle accumulation contributed to a reduction in k both separately and interactively during the recharge process 0 3 h but that polysaccharide produced by bacteria began to have an impact during the later stages stage ii 0 5 1 h and stage iii 1 3 h the development of clogging in the pbg was primarily controlled by van der waals forces electrostatic repulsion and bridging during stage i 0 0 5 h during the later stages hydrogen bonds and polymerization of extracellular polymeric substances became the governing factors

groundwater is one of the most important water resources which plays a crucial role in human activities global groundwater extraction is estimated to be approximately 1500 km3 yr 1 aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 which seriously aggravates groundwater depletion as the demand for groundwater increases overexploitation leads to a series of environmental problems soil salinization ground subsidence seawater intrusion etc cui et al 2018 page et al 2014 artificial groundwater recharge systems can supplement groundwater resources by injection of water into aquifers this is practiced worldwide in countries rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 such as the netherlands peters 1989 the usa pyne 1995 and australia pavelic and dillon 1997 to mitigate the overexploitation of groundwater however artificial recharge of groundwater suffers from clogging issues relating to the initial quality of the recharged water this can reduce the efficiency of artificial groundwater recharge facilities and may render such facilities completely ineffective reclaimed water is one kind of important recharge water which can reduce the risk of clogging however the amount of reclaimed water is limited storm water is also an important source the artificial recharge of storm water can mitigate the flood risk and replenish groundwater masetti et al 2016 rathay et al 2018 many countries promote the reuse of storm water actively such as japan germany and china yan et al 2013 however no matter what kind of recharge water is used one cannot completely avoid the occurrence of clogging especially for storm water mainly due to suspended particles and microbes contained in recharge water or from the soil clogging of artificial recharge systems is mainly caused by suspended particles fetzer et al 2017 chemical sedimentation cui et al 2018 microorganism growth baveye et al 1998 xian et al 2019 production of extracellular polymeric substances xia et al 2016 entrapment of gas ye et al 2009 previous field surveys have indicated that clogging caused by suspended particles microbes chemical sedimentation gas accumulation colloid release granular particles reorganization and other factors accounted for 50 15 10 10 5 5 5 of cases of clogging respectively dillon and pavelic 1996 it was demonstrated that suspended particles and microorganisms were two dominant contributors to clogging yet these two factors have usually been investigated separately page et al 2014 for studies concerned with the occurrence of physical clogging hydraulic permeability has usually been measured using a column filled with sterilized porous media and fed with sterilized recharge water containing suspended particles zheng et al 2014 the properties of the suspended particles such as concentration particle size play a crucial role in the clogging process pavelic et al 2007 some researchers have proposed that a suspended particle content of more than 25 mg l or more than 3 nephelometric turbidity units ntu will trigger clogging pavelic et al 2011 in addition the properties of the porous media hua et al 2010 and the percolation velocity alem et al 2013 of feed water also show correlations with permeability of porous media to elucidate the formation of biological clogging and the influence of microbial growth and metabolism on the permeability of porous media experimental columns recharged with water deprived of suspended particles have been used pavelic et al 2011 hua et al 2018 it has been reported that biological clogging is induced by algae and other microorganisms the number of colony forming units cfu that results in the clogging of soil was discussed vandevivere and baveye 1992 doretto et al 2017 singh et al 2018 suleiman and swartzendruber 2003 found that hydraulic conductivity was reduced by two orders of magnitude when the content of bacteria exceeded 1 3 106 cfu g as well as microbial cell accumulation extracellular polymeric substances eps produced by microbial metabolism also contributes to biological clogging xia et al 2014 given that most existing research has focused on single clogging processes and mechanisms i e either physical or biological realistic recharge conditions in which both suspended particles and microorganisms coexist and interact have not yet been considered therefore the formation mechanism and evolution of clogging under more realistic conditions need to be explored further as ubiquitous fractions in recharged water the fate of microorganisms and suspended particles in porous media may be determined by their mutual interaction and their interactions with the porous media surface some researchers have demonstrated that bacteria bind to solids through van der waals forces for a short time at first and then adsorbs tightly and irreversibly through other forces denkhaus et al 2007 flemming and wingender 2001 proposed that electrostatic forces play a key role in the adsorption of eps to solid surfaces these interactions between microorganisms and solid surface including both suspended particles and porous media can influence the migration and sedimentation of coexisting suspended particles onto the surface of porous media at the same time the presence of microorganisms and their secretions can interact with particles which affects the migration of particles matter by coagulation he et al 2015 roche et al 2017 some microbes such as aspergillus flavus can flocculate activated carbon kaolin clay and soil solids via charge neutralization or bridging with their secretions aljuboori et al 2015 microorganisms also influence the migration of particles by modifying the surfaces of the solids for example leon morales et al 2007 observed that the presence of biofilms on the surfaces of filter media can affect the migration of colloidal particles eps coated sand promoted the migration of carboxylate modified latex particles tripathi et al 2012 in comparison with clean sand the decreased retention of poly vinylpyrrolidone stabilized silver nanoparticle pvp nag in biofilm coated sand was attributed to the repulsive electrostatic forces between pvp nag and the biofilm coated sand mitzel and tufenkji 2014 although attempts have been made to clarify the interactions between suspended particles and microbes studies have been rarely considered how these interactions influence the permeability of porous media in this study the percolation experiment in sand column was conducted to simulate the process of storm water recharge our specific research objectives were 1 to compare the permeability characteristics of porous media and identify dominant influence factors among three groups a particle only group a bacteria only group and a particle bacteria group 2 to elucidate the interactions between suspended particles and bacteria and their combined effects on the permeability of porous media 3 to unveil the time dependent clogging evolution mechanisms under the coexistence of suspended particles and bacteria and 4 to provide implications for clogging prevention and control 2 materials and methods 2 1 quartz sand and suspended particles quartz grains sio2 96 loss on ignition 0 40 xiamen iso standard sand co ltd china was used to simulate porous media which had particles sizes in the range of 0 50 1 00 mm quartz sand was soaked in hcl solution 0 25 m for 12 h to remove metal impurities followed by naoh solution 0 25 m for 12 h then they were washed in milli q water rinsing to neutral and incinerated in a muffle furnace at 550 for 2 h to remove organic matter before being packed into the experimental column the sand was sterilized using ultraviolet uv light x ray diffraction xrd analysis of suspended particles from storm water collected in the qingdao area shandong province of china revealed that the main component was sio2 88 in order to avoid the influence of organic matter and unknown components on the microorganisms and to avoid the destruction of the structure of the suspended particles by removing organic matter using incineration quartz powder was used to simulate suspended particles with particle size 20 μm sediment of this diameter size effectively simulates particle sizes of suspended particles in real storm water the quartz powder was immersed in 0 25 m hcl with at a liquid to solid ratio of 3 1 it was then heated at 80 c in a water bath for 8 h and the distilled water was repeatedly washed to neutral finally quartz powder was vacuum dried and sterilized using uv light 2 2 inoculum and nutrient solution to simulate storm water a mixture of a microbial consortium and water was collected from wangjiaxia river n36 17999 e120 492455 in qingdao city shandong province of china as the inoculum then the inoculum was cultivated in an enriched liquid medium containing peptone 0 5 g l beef extract 1 g l and nacl 0 5 g l when the experiment was conducted the nutrient solution was added to the sand column along with recharge water the nutrient solution contained c n p and 1 ml of a trace element solution in order to maintain stability and consistency in the influent microorganisms the inoculum for the entire experiment was cultivated and collected in a single batch 2 3 experimental setup and operation the experimental setup mainly comprises a plexiglas column a water inlet tank including a stirring device a peristaltic pump a water control head device and a manometer fig 1 the plexiglass column was 38 cm in length and 5 cm in an internal diameter piezometers were connected to the experimental column at 0 3 5 7 13 19 and 25 cm from the inlet to measure the hydraulic gradient triplicate identical experiments were conducted in this study the pretreated quartz sand was packed into plexiglas columns with equal volume density using the wet method then the sand filled columns were slowly saturated with sterilized milli q water from the bottom to top the percolation process was continued for 24 h to remove the residual gas after the pressure plate reading was stable an initial value was recorded the synthetic recharge water was then introduced from the top of the column with a constant water head δh 10 cm after complete saturation three types of synthetic recharge water were used in the experiments 1 a particle only group pg which had a suspended particle content of 100 ntu 2 a bacteria only group bg which had a microbial content of 106 cfu ml and 3 a particle bacteria group pbg which had a suspended particle content of 100 ntu and a microbial content of 106 cfu ml 2 4 analytical methods

manometric tubes along the column m δ h is the hydraulic head difference at a distance of δ x m and d is the inner diameter of the column m in this paper the relative hydraulic conductivity k is used to depict the degree of clogging 2 k k k 0 where k is relative hydraulic conductivity k0 is initial hydraulic conductivity m d k is hydraulic conductivity at any time m d 2 4 2 deposition of suspended particles the deposition of the suspended particles in the porous media was determined by gravimetric methods sand samples were carefully taken out from the first layer 0 3 cm in the columns after the percolation experiments dried at 110 c to constant weight and weighed using a high precision 0 0001 g electronic balance the clogged weight samples were then ultrasonically cleaned for 15 min rinsed with tap water to remove suspended particles and dried at 110 c and re weighed the unclogged weight the difference between the clogged and unclogged weights provided a measure of the number of suspended particles deposited in the media during the experiments 2 4 3 bacterial cell count and eps quantification the number of bacterial cells was determined by plate counting after dismantling each sand column a 15 g sand sample was collected from the upper layer 0 3 cm which was sonicated in a sterile centrifuge tube containing 15 ml of phosphate buffer solution pb ph 7 4 and 1 5 g of glass beads xia et al 2016 the mixture was vortexed for 1 min and then was diluted to an appropriate dilution as to coat the plate the coated plates were incubated at 37 c for 48 h eps was extracted via formaldehyde naoh method depicted by liu and fang 2002 and modified by xia et al 2014 the content of polysaccharide μg g sand in eps was measured by phenol sulfuric acid method the protein content μg g sand was determined by bradford assay method the content was analyzed using 2800 uv vis spectrophotometer unico usa the polysaccharide content and protein content were then measured the sum of which was recorded as the eps yield 2 4 4 electron microscopy analysis after recharge 5 g sand samples were rinsed lightly with deionized water several times the sand samples were then immersed in 4 w v glutaraldehyde solution at 4 c for 24 h and gently washed several times with 0 1 mol l phosphate buffer the samples were dehydrated by sequential immersion in ethanol solution 30 50 70 90 and 100 v v for 10 15 min in each case the dehydrated samples were dried in a vacuum dryer for 24 h and their surfaces were plated with a platinum film the prepared samples were observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy s 4800 n hitachi limited japan 2 4 5 high throughput sequencing the dna of the microbial sample collected from sand surface was extracted with powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca the extracted dna was detected by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis in each case 30 ng dna sample was used in pcr amplification the universal primers 341f 5

dna insert was dual ends sequenced using target region amplification in conjunction with an illumina miseq sequencer san diego ca usa 2 4 6 statistical analysis pearson s correlation analysis was conducted in ibm spss 22 0 and a test of significance was conducted by two way analysis of variance anova the path coefficient was calculated as described by dewey and lu 1959 using spss path coefficient analysis was used to partition the correlation coefficients and to determine the direct and indirect effects of the independent variables i e the deposition of suspended particles the bacterial cell count the polysaccharide content and protein content on the dependent variables k in order to carry out the path coefficient analysis normality of k for the pbg was checked using spss where normality was confirmed stepwise regression analysis between the dependent variable and the independent variables could be performed 3 results 3 1 variation of relative hydraulic conductivity relative hydraulic conductivity k was adopted to indicate the degree of clogging as shown in fig 2 k values of the entire sand column gradually decreased over time for the three groups pg bg and pbg as the percolation experiment preceded k declined steadily until a constant lower plateau was reached in the pg taking pg for example k of the pg decreased to 0 79 0 42 0 16 after 5 h 20 h 45 h respectively by comparing the k variation within the same period the decrease degree of k was in the order of pbg bg pg for example k values for the bg and the pbg had decreased to 0 41 and 0 30 respectively after 3 h while k of the pg was approximately 0 82 after the same period of time the recharge water flowed through the porous media from the top to the bottom which led to variation in the permeability throughout the column for each layer permeability decreased as the recharge proceeded but this occurred at different rates in the different layers in order to facilitate the analysis of these results the clogging process for each group was divided into three stages according to values of k in the upper layer 0 3 cm of the column as follows stage i 0 51 0 05 stage ii 0 20 0 05 and stage iii 0 05 0 05 for pg bg and pbg stage i therefore referred to 0 5 h 0 0 5 h and 0 0 5 h respectively stage ii referred to 5 20 h 0 5 2 h and 0 5 1 h respectively and stage iii referred to 20 45 h 2 3 5 h and 1 3 h respectively when the percolation progressed during stage ii 5 20 h as illustrated in fig 3 a k in the upper layer 0 3 cm of the pg dropped from 0 56 to 0 20 while in the lowest layer 19 25 cm k decreased from 0 93 to 0 79 k values for the different layers of the columns all showed a decreasing trend from the top to bottom this indicated that the differences in k between the surface layer and the lower layers was gradually augmented as the experiment proceeded for example for the pg the difference between the surface layer 0 3 cm and the bottom layer 19 25 cm increased over time from approximately 0 37 after 5 h to approximately 0 60 after 45 h fig 3 b and c show a similar decreasing trend for the bg and the pbg along the respective columns over time the change in k within the 0 3 cm layer showed the maximum drop among all the layers in the column for the bg and the pbg the rate of decrease in k in the upper layer was significantly higher for the bg and the pbg than the pg the difference in k between in the upper layer and the bottom layer in the bg and the pbg was 0 80 and 0 98 respectively which was 1 33 and 1 61 times that of the pg respectively in terms of the decrease rate of k between 0 and 3 cm the results in descending order was pbg bg pg 3 2 suspended particle accumulation over time according to the data shown in section 3 1 k decreased rapidly and displayed the greatest decrease within the surface layers 0 3 cm correspondingly the accumulation of suspended particles in the surface layers was recorded as a function of recharge time in both the pg and the pbg in fig 4 a the accumulation of suspended particles of the pg increased from 6 53 mg g sand to 26 11 mg g sand during stage ii while k decreased from 0 56 to 0 20 at the end of stage iii 45 h k had decreased to 0 05 which was attributed to the cumulative number of suspended particles 56 30 mg g sand as the recharge proceeded k decreased gradually with the increasing accumulation of suspended particles in fig 4 b the suspended particles in the pbg increased from 6 11 mg g sand at the end of stage i 0 5 h to 22 27 mg g sand at the end of stage iii 3 h whilst k decreased from 0 46 to 0 06 when k showed similar decreases between the experimental groups the accumulation of suspended particles in the pg was notably higher than that in the pbg while it took less time for the same k reduction to occur in the pbg 3 3 variations in bacterial cell count and eps over time 3 3 1 bacterial cell count the porous media was sterilized before being packed into the experimental columns therefore all the bacteria obtained from porous media were derived from the artificial recharge water during stage i the bacteria cell count in the bg was 3 18e 06 cfu g sand higher than that of the pbg while k decreased to 0 56 and 0 46 in bg and pbg respectively from stage ii the bacterial cell count for the bg and the pbg increased sharply although they had notable differences as shown in fig 5 it is noteworthy that the bacterial cell count in the bg continuously increased over time at a progressively slower rate while the bacterial cell count in the pbg first increased and then decreased over time at the end of stage iii 3 5 h and 3 h for the bg and the pbg respectively with a bacterial cell count of 2 60e 08 and 1 75e 08 cfu g sand in the bg and the pbg respectively k had decreased to 0 04 and 0 06 respectively although the bacteria cell count in both of these groups increased the difference between the bg and the pbg became more and more pronounced over time by the end of the experiment the bacterial cell count in the bg was 8 52e 07 cfu g sand more than in the pbg 3 3 2 eps accumulation as shown in fig 6 the protein content of the bg and the pbg maintained generally stable as recharge proceeded during stage i and stage ii the polysaccharide content of the bg showed little fluctuation but a significant increase from 13 64 to 23 07 μg g sand was observed during stage iii along with a reduction of k from 0 24 to 0 04 the polysaccharide content of the pbg showed a rapid reduction during the initial stage and then followed a continuous increase over time during stage i the polysaccharide content of the pbg was higher than that of the bg however during stage ii the polysaccharide content of the pbg dropped to 13 01 μg g sand the polysaccharide content of the pbg then continuously increased to 21 12 μg g sand by the end of stage iii which was lower than that of the bg 3 4 surface morphology of the porous media during the recharge process suspended particles were continuously deposited on the surfaces of the porous media and microorganisms also grew and metabolized which led to changes in surface microtopography as displayed in fig 7 a the surfaces of the porous media were smooth and clean without any modifications prior to the start of the experiment at the end of the experiment the sem observations displayed flaky or powdery deposits on the sand fig 7 b the surfaces of the porous media for the bg were covered by three dimensional network structures and a dense biofilm fig 7 c at the same time clear bacterial outlines and a totally obscured sand grain surface indicated that bacteria growth was abundant in the porous media at the end of the experiment the surfaces of sand grains from the pbg were also covered by microorganisms and flaky suspended particles fig 7 d 3 5 microbial community composition fig 8 showed the diversity and dominant species of the different experimental groups varied over time shannon index was often used to illustrate the diversity of microbial community at the initial time of experiment the shannon index of both bg and pbg had a same value of 5 50 at the end of stage i 0 5 h the shannon index for the bg was 5 08 falling to 4 54 at the end of stage iii 3 5 h which reflected the microbial diversity was reduced the shannon index for the pbg increased from 3 82 to 4 35 from the end of stage i 0 5 h to the end of stage iii 3 h indicating that microbial diversity increased nevertheless the shannon index of the pbg remained lower than for the bg during the entire recharge process at the end of stage i the dominant genera in the bg and the pbg both included paucibacter elizabethkingia acinetobacter sphingobacterium and comamonas among these acinetobacter sphingobacterium comamonas elizabethkingia displayed a poor ability for movement and high adhesion which offered advantages for their preferential adhesion onto the porous media from the end of stage i to stage iii in the bg the relative abundance of sphingobacterium dworin et al 2006 that are able to metabolize polysaccharide increased from 4 32 to 15 79 the relative abundance of facultative exiguobacterium in the bg increased significantly and became dominant comparing stage i with stage iii the dominant genera in the pbg were very similar but varied in their relative abundance over time 4 discussion 4 1 the correlations between influential factors and relative hydraulic conductivity during the entire recharge process in the pg the reduction in k of the upper layer 0 3 cm was attributed to the accumulation of suspended particles during the first two stages 0 2 h in the bg the polysaccharide and protein content remained stable while the bacterial cell count increased sharply this indicated that the reduction in k resulted from the increase in the bacterial cell count during stage iii the content of polysaccharide in the bg increased over time and the ratio of genera that can secrete polysaccharide such as sphingobacterium increased in addition to the bacterial cell count polysaccharide contributed to the decline in k in the bg during stage iii based on the analysis of k suspended particles bacterial cell count and eps the clogging development process was compared among the different experimental groups and the key controlling factors in the different groups were identified as displayed in fig 4 when k declined to approximate 0 05 the number of suspended particles being deposited in the pg was approximately 2 53 times higher than that in the pbg this demonstrates that bacteria played a crucial role in the measured variation in k variation in the pbg the bacterial cell count in the bg increased by 4 99 times from stage i to stage ii while k declined from 0 56 to 0 24 by comparing the end of stage i 0 5 h with the end of stage ii 1 h it was found that in the pbg the bacterial cell count was increased by 3 38 times and k was reduced from 0 46 to 0 25 the increase in bacterial cell count in the bg was much higher than that in the pbg when the difference in k was almost the same during stage i and stage ii the bacterial cell count in the bg was increased by 7 33 times from the end of stage i 0 5 h to the end of stage iii 3 5 h and k was reduced to 0 04 by the end of stage iii 3 5 h comparing stage i with stage iii the bacterial cell count in the pbg was increased by 5 42 times and k had declined to 0 06 by the end of stage iii these results indicate that even a small number of suspended particles could aggravate the clogging process when the microbial content was high which is consistent with the results in other studies pavelic et al 2011 in order to assess the effects of the experimental variables on k during the recharge of the pbg correlation analysis was conducted the results depicted that particle deposition the bacterial cell count and the polysaccharide and protein contents were all significantly negatively associated with k table 1 in descending order the relative strength of the correlations was as follows bacterial cell count particle deposition polysaccharide content protein content these results are consistent with the results reported in sections 3 2 and 3 3 bacterial cell count continuously increased to 1 75e 08 cfu g sand and suspended particles accumulated to 22 27 mg g sand in the pbg which contributed to the reduction in k throughout the recharge experiment however the polysaccharide content in the pbg showed a decreasing trend during stage i and then increased from 13 01 to 21 12 μg g sand during stage ii and stage iii this indicated that the increase in the polysaccharide content resulted in the reduction in k during the last two stages 4 2 the interaction between suspended particles and bacterial cell count in particle bacteria clogging the data in fig 9 shows that k was gradually reduced with the accumulation of suspended particles in the pg a fitting formula between suspended particles and k could therefore be established a mathematical fitting formula was also established between bacterial cell count and k in the bg but the polysaccharide content was excluded based on the consideration that polysaccharide only contributed to the reduction in k during the last two stages the derived formula indicated an exponential relationship between suspended particles and k as follows 3 y e 0 02461 0 0692 x where y is the relative hydraulic conductivity k and x is the suspended particle content mg g sand the fitting formula between bacterial cell count and k was as follows 4 y 0 90453 6 17079 10 9 x 1 13784 10 17 x 2 where x is bacteria cell count cfu g sand by comparing the predicted and calculated values of k the influence of the interaction between suspended particles and bacteria on clogging could be assessed the predicted value of k in the pg and the bg were obtained by inputting the corresponding values for suspended particles and bacterial cell count in the pbg for each specific measured value of k in eqs 3 and 4 for instance the concentration of suspended particles in pbg reached 22 27 mg g sand during stage iii for which k was calculated by substituting this value into eq 3 yielding a predicted k of 0 21 a predicted k of 0 17 was calculated using eq 4 by applying the bacterial cell count of the pbg in the same way however during stage iii the k of the pbg actually decreased to 0 06 which indicated that the effect of suspended particle deposition and microbial biomass on the permeability of porous media was interactive it can be inferred that microorganisms and suspended particles not only affected variations of k independently but also interacted with each other to influence the clogging process therefore the mathematical relationship between bacterial cell count and k in the pg and between suspended particle deposition and k in the bg cannot accurately predict the combined contribution of these two factors to k in the pbg therefore path coefficient analysis was used to partition the correlation coefficients and determine the direct and indirect effects of particle deposition and bacteria on k the results of the regression analysis were as follows 5 y 1 002 0 023 x 1 0 057 x 2 where y is the relative hydraulic conductivity k x1 is the suspended particle content deposited on the porous media mg g sand and x2 is log10 of the bacterial cell count cfu g sand the significance of eq 5 was p 0 05 and r2 0 988 indicating that there was a good fit between the measured and predicted data the results of the path analysis are shown in table 2 these results show that the direct contribution of bacterial cell counts to k was greater than the contribution of suspended particle deposition which is consistent with the results in section 4 1 however based on the path analysis the indirect effect of suspended particles on k i e by influencing bacterial cell count was slightly higher than the indirect effect of bacterial cell count i e by influencing suspended particle deposition this indicates that suspended particles settling on porous media facilitate the adsorption of bacteria as discussed in more detail in section 4 3 the parameters derived in this study only can provide references for other studies but the numerical correlations mentioned in this section are strictly valid for this study and cannot be used as general equations valid for other lab and or field cases 4 3 the mechanism and evolution of physical biological clogging when suspended particles and microorganisms coexisted in the recharge water the forces between clogging related factors and the porous media were different from that under single factor conditions there was a variety of forces operating including van der waals forces electrostatic forces and hydrogen bonds between bacteria and suspended particles and between bacteria and the porous media explicit analysis of these forces was necessary to elucidate the mechanism and evolution of complex clogging the interplay between microbes porous media and suspended particles changes dynamically as recharge proceeds which has an impact on the evolution of clogging the isoelectric point of the bacteria was ph 2 to 5 as the artificial recharge water was close to neutral the surfaces of the bacterial cells were negatively charged cui et al 2018 in neutral recharge water the quartz sand used to simulate the porous media and the quartz powder used to simulate suspended particles were all negatively charged morrow et al 2005 zhao et al 2014 during stage i bacteria and suspended particles were transported with the water flow as free cells and free particles respectively the migration and deposition of suspended particles may be affected by inertia gravity sedimentation interception brownian diffusion and hydrodynamics chang et al 2004 ives 1970 when bacterial cells are far from porous media and suspended particles they diffuse by brownian motion and also convectively move within the water flow during this process the van der waals attraction plays a major role between bacteria and the solid surfaces i e the porous media and the suspended particles as distance decreased the electric fields among bacteria the porous media and the suspended particles become superimposed on each other because all of them had negative charge at this period of time electrostatic interactions become dominant in addition to van der waals forces and electrostatic repulsion bacteria can move towards the surfaces of porous media and suspended particles by flagellar propulsion and within flowing water subsequently bacteria can colonize on the porous media to form biofilms which can influence the settlement of suspended particles settled suspended particles provide a larger specific surface area which promotes the adsorption of bacteria in addition bacterial surface viscous materials can connect with the surfaces of the porous media and the suspended particles by bridging baveye et al 1998 grasso et al 2002 which results in stronger adsorption rong et al 2010 this promotes coagulation between the bacterial cells and the suspended particles ernissee and abbott 1975 comparing the suspended particle content of the pbg with that of the pg during stage i 0 0 5 h and 0 5 h respectively the pbg took less time to accumulate a similar number of suspended particles as the pg and the suspended particles in the pg migrated deeper into the column based on the analysis described in section 3 1 this is consistent with the results showing that the adsorption of bacteria onto the surfaces of particles made the particles more likely to settle in the upper layer within a short period time of recharge with recharge proceeding free bacteria would have been gradually adsorbed onto the surfaces of the porous media and the settled particles which accounts for the increasing contribution of bacterial cells to the decrease in k after stage i 0 5 3 h the bacterial cell count of the pbg increased at a slow rate while the polysaccharide content gradually increased and the deposition of suspended particles also continued to increase during this time the dextran contained in the bacterial extracellular lipopolysaccharide could combine with bound water on the surface of the media via the formation of hydrogen bonds jucker et al 1997 the acetyl group of extracellular polysaccharides enhance the adhesion of eps to solid surfaces porous media suspended particles flemming and wingender 2001 the increase in the amount of polysaccharide during this stage will result in a firmer bond with the surfaces of suspended particles so that more suspended particle can be adhered as recharge progressed the polysaccharide content in the eps increased significantly and polymerization dominated among the eps porous media and suspended particles thus the decrease in k in the pbg during this stage was mainly caused by the increase in the content of polysaccharides and suspended particles in the porous media suspended particles showed a negative correlation with k during the entire recharge process a schematic diagram of the recharge development process is shown in fig 10 4 4 implications for the prevention and control of clogging we demonstrated that bacteria and suspended particles can influence the permeability of porous media both separately and interactively which made clogging process more complex therefore it is fundamental to exercise strict control over the content of suspended particles and microorganisms in recharged water before the start of recharge taking china as an example the water quality standard for groundwater recharge for the reuse of urban recycling water has been established until 2005 and restrictions on total bacterial colony count in recharge water have not yet been included therefore it is recommended that the standard should be further revised to include such restrictions in addition to reduce the clogging risk pretreatments of recharge water are usually necessary however sometimes the pretreatment of recharge water merely by traditional disinfection and sterilization such as chemical chlorination fail to avoid clogging effectively although the dead microorganisms killed through these ways cannot further grow and reproduce they are still sticky substances that can adhere to porous media and then will trap suspended particles therefore environmental friendly biocides that are capable of completely hydrolyzing microbial cells are urgently needed to be developed even though the pretreatment of influent has been conducted there is still potential for clogging after long term operation according to our study during the clogging process the formation of biofilms consisting mainly of microbes and eps made it more resistant to external changes and the microbes and eps can trap suspended particles then the microbes and suspended particles formed a tight complex due to their interactions and the polymerization of eps which increases the potential for clogging and lowers the efficiency of recharge facilities therefore the proteolytic enzyme or polysaccharide hydrolase can be used to destroy the eps matrix so stability of biofilms will be weakened meanwhile the intermittent increase of recharge rate that provides higher shear forces can be implemented which can immediately wash out the destroyed biofilm part of suspended particles can also be removed by the change of shear forces therefore the combination use of hydrolase and change of recharge rate are recommended to remove the tightly bound abiotic and biotic components deposited on the surface of the medium in this way aquifer clogging can be alleviated and the permeability of porous media can be effectively recovered 5 conclusions the individual and combined effects of suspended particles and bacterial cells on the permeability of porous media were experimentally investigated to provide insights into the clogging mechanisms affecting groundwater facilities across the three experimental groups the rate of the decrease in relative hydraulic conductivity in descending order was pbg bg pg it took a much shorter period of time 3 h for the pbg to achieve a relative hydraulic conductivity of 0 30 for the entire sand column compared with the pg 28 h and the bg 3 5 h suspended particles and bacterial cells were the two main dominant factors the results indicated that bacterial cell growth and particle accumulation contributed to a reduction in k both separately and interactively during the recharge process 0 3 h but that polysaccharide produced by bacteria began to have an impact during the later stages stage ii 0 5 1 h and stage iii 1 3 h as recharge proceeds the dominant forces between the microbes the porous media and the suspended particles evolved dynamically from van der waals forces electrostatic repulsion and bridging to polymerization of eps based on our findings the pretreatments of microbes by environmental friendly biocides that can hydrolyze microbial cells need to be developed the combination use of proteolytic enzyme polysaccharide hydrolase intermittent increase of recharge rate are proposed for recovering the operational efficiency and prolonging the service life of groundwater recharge facilities credit authorship

5842,establishing an optimal water allocation scheme is a challenging yet crucial task for effective risk management of water resources the dynamic and complex interaction among various risk related components in a water resources management system cannot be easily modeled to characterize the system response under different risk control settings in this study a risk based fuzzy boundary interval two stage stochastic water resources management programming rfitswmp model is developed for the optimization of water consumption this model incorporates a series of risk control constraints such as water availability maximum allowable penalty and allowable benefit violation constraints into a fuzzy boundary interval two stage stochastic programming framework for water resources management it can address the uncertainties presented as fuzzy boundary intervals and probability distributions it can also tackle the recourse action to minimize penalties based on interactive influences of different risk control measures further generating optimal water allocation alternatives and guiding water resources management this developed model is applied to a case study of water consumption optimization in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin in china feasible water allocation schemes under given risk levels as well as the associated economic benefit actual benefit and penalty loss are generated the results can help decision makers to gain an insight into the inherent conflicts and tradeoffs amid risk benefit and water allocation the performance of developed model is further demonstrated by comparing it with a fuzzy boundary interval two stage stochastic water resources management programming fitswmp model in addition a multiple factorial analysis mfa approach is employed to analyze the impacts of interactive risk parameters on the optimal decisions the result disclosed that 1 the higher individual risk parameter levels correspond to higher water shortage penalty loss and benefit value at risk but higher economic benefit 2 the combination of risk parameters can achieve robust water allocation and economic benefit as the constraints concerned with risk parameters affect and limited by each other 3 the condition that water violated probability p is 0 2 penalty violated risk level β is 1 and benefit violated risk level γ is 1 has the highest water allocation and biggest economic benefit keywords water resources management risk controls sensitivity analysis uncertainty 1 introduction sustainable socioeconomic development relies on the development of industrial activities e g primary secondary and tertiary industries and ecological construction mostly related to water resources tsai et al 2015 sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 however many countries are facing inevitable conflicts among industries and the ecological sector caused by limited water resources li et al 2018 moreover under the impacts of climate change and human activities the probability of extreme events increases aggravating the unbalanced relationship between water supply and water demand zhang et al 2017 therefore it is urgent to improve water use efficiency through reasonable allocation of water resources and optimization of the water use structure in order to ensure the sustainability of socioeconomic development in water resources allocation systems there exist many uncertainties in the parameters and their interrelationships such as the randomness of runoff events and the uncertain interaction between runoff and precipitation which leads to significant complexities of water allocation traditional optimization methods are usually not capable of dealing with such problems more advanced optimization methods that addresses uncertainties in different formats such as stochastic programming fuzzy programming and interval programming methods were developed to tackle these complexities wang et al 2019 yang et al 2017 li et al 2013a b zhang and guo 2017 zhang et al 2017 bai et al 2019 among these methods inexact two stage stochastic programming itsp is widely used for water allocation because of its advantage in reflecting the tradeoffs between pre defined economic targets and random water availability besides it can reflect the uncertainties presented as both probability distributions and intervals wang and huang 2011 zhang et al 2018 however in water resources management there exists dual uncertain parameters in which a single interval number or fuzzy set could not well describe the parameter uncertainty for example the net water allocated benefit for each water user could be expressed as an interval number 0 35 0 55 yuan m3 however in practice the lower and upper bounds may be uncertain while the most likely value of the lower bound is 0 35 the smallest and largest possible value could be 0 25 and 0 45 respectively similarly the smallest and largest possible value of the upper bound could be 0 40 and 0 60 respectively thus the net water allocated benefit should be presented as a fuzzy boundary interval 0 25 0 35 0 40 0 45 0 55 0 60 yuan m3 fuzzy boundary intervals can be used when the upper and lower bounds of the interval parameters in an optimization model are uncertain and thus quantify the risk caused by uncertainties they have been extensively used in water allocation systems bekri et al 2015 kong et al 2017 wang and huang 2011 li et al 2010 in this study fuzzy boundary intervals are introduced to the inexact two stage stochastic programming framework and the resulted fuzzy boundary interval two stage stochastic water resources programming fitswmp approach is adopted for water resources management there also exist other problems in water resources management decision makers might encounter the problems as follows 1 how to achieve a balance between water shortage risk and economic benefit 2 how to control the penalty loss effectively 3 how to govern the actual benefit under different flow levels to meet economic targets a single risk control approach could not deal with all of the above problems for example the chance constrained programming ccp approach requires that all of the constraints are satisfied under a given probability level it can measure the relationship between economic benefit and the risk of violating water availability constraint s guo et al 2009 piao et al 2014 nonetheless it just considers the expected economic benefit and does not concern the exorbitant penalty loss caused by random events in reality the randomness of runoff or precipitation may arise the exorbitant penalty loss which is unacceptable for economic development the fuzzy random value at risk as a risk control measurement is also a useful tool for controlling penalty loss and has been widely used in water resources management hu et al 2016 tong et al 2010 zhang and guo 2018 it can reflect the ambiguity and vagueness in penalty loss compared with the conditional value at risk method and can control the penalty under different violated risk levels of penalty peng 2009 nevertheless the fuzzy value at risk take over the expected penalty loss resulted from a random event and neglects the actual benefit under different flow levels in water allocation processes the actual benefit under each water flow level is affected by second stage recourse which might result in undesirably low benefit the benefit value at risk can measure the relationship between expected economic benefit and risk of violating given target actual benefit i e the net benefit after the second stage decision of each scenario e g high medium and low flow levels under multiple specific risk exposure levels barbaro and bagajewicz 2004 li et al 2015 liu et al 2016 liu and huang 2008 however it could not consider the expected economic benefit of all flow levels due to neglecting random events all of the three abovementioned individual risk control methods have their own advantages and disadvantages although they can provide detailed results about risk water allocation and economic benefit the three elements affect each other and the complex relationships among them are not clear hence a sensitivity analysis method called multi level factorial analysis mfa is introduced in this study to tackle the effects of individual parameters and their interactions on the system response mfa has been extensively used in water resources management hu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 wu and fan 2008 however there are very few studies on its application for analyzing the effects of multiple uncertain risk parameters or their multi level effects on water allocation the objective of this study is therefore to develop a risk based fuzzy boundary interval two stage stochastic water resources management programming rfitswmp model for water resources management under uncertainties in the proposed model risk control constraints are integrated into a fitswmp optimization framework the goal of this study is to allocate limited water resources to different water users in different subareas and quantify the interactive effects of risk parameters on water allocation and economic benefit which could further support risk control the rfitswmp model has the following advantages 1 it realizes the balance amid expected economic benefit penalty loss and actual benefit 2 it generates more water allocation alternatives under different risk levels 3 it can support in depth analysis of the interrelationships among system benefit water allocation and risk the proposed model is applied to a real world case study of a water resources management system in the heihe river basin gansu province china to demonstrate its applicability 2 methodology notation i index of subarea i i 1 gz i 2 lz i 3 gt

fuzzy boundary interval two stage stochastic water resources management programming model fitswmp can reflect the tradeoffs between pre regulated policy and the associated economic penalty and deal with the fuzzy boundary interval and random number with known existed in the objective and constraints the fitswmp approach is based on the interactive two stage stochastic fuzzy programming itsfp approach proposed by wang and huang 2011 the integrated model can be written as follows max f i 1 i j 1 j c ij x ij i i j 1 j h 1 h p h d ij y ijh 1 i 1 i j 1 j a ij x ij y ijh b h h x ij 0 y ijh 0 i j h where x ij is first stage decision variables before the random events occur x ij is in the format of interval and can be expressed as x ij x ij x ij where x ij x ij are the lower and upper bound of x ij respectively y ijh is second stage decision variables depending on the realization of the random events y ijh is an interval with a lower and upper bounds of y ijh and y ijh and its expression is y ijh y ijh y ijh b t is random variables with known distributions p h is the occurrence probability of a flow level h c ij d ij are benefit and penalty coefficients respectively and they are both fuzzy boundary interval numbers the fuzzy boundary interval is defined as an interval number where the lower and upper bound are presented as fuzzy number the fuzzy number can be transformed into the expected value presented as a number through solving inverse function of its membership function wang and huang 2011 and the membership function of triangular fuzzy numbers can be described as follows 2 μ a x f a x f o r a 1 x a 2 1 f o r x a 2 g a x f o r a 2 x a 3 where μ a x is the membership function of fuzzy sets a which can be denoted by fuzzy number a a 1 a 2 a 3 the α level set of fuzzy sets a can be defined as a α x r u a α where α 0 1 f a x and g a x represent a continuous and monotonically increasing linear function given a 1 x a 2 and monotonically decreasing linear function given a 2 x a 3 respectively since μ a is upper semi continuous the α level set of a forms a closed and bound interval a α f a 1 α g a 1 α where f a 1 α inf x μ a x α 3a g a 1 α sup x μ a x α therefore the expected interval of a fuzzy set can be defined as follows 3b ei a e 1 a e 2 a 0 1 f a 1 α 0 1 g a 1 α the expected value of fuzzy set is the average of its expected interval 3c ev a e 1 a e 2 a 2 for a fuzzy set with a triangular membership function the expected interval and expected value can be calculated through the abovementioned transformation as follows ei a 1 2 a 1 a 2 1 2 a 2

control by chance constrained programming 2 penalty control by fuzzy random value at risk and 3 benefit control through exposure risk of benefit under each scenario they are described as follows 1 chance constrained programming 5a pr i 1 i j 1 j a ij x ij y ijh b h 1 q l h q l this constraint can be transformed into 5b i 1 i j 1 j a ij x ij y ijh b h q l h q l and b h q l f l 1 q l f l 1 q l denotes the inverse function value of cumulative distribution function of b h under constraint violated probability q l therefore the ccp model can be solved through the following steps 1 determining the probability value q l q l 0 1 for each constraint and 2 finding the solutions that satisfy all constraints with a probability of 1 q l ren et al 2013 2 fuzzy random value at risk value at risk can measure the financial loss caused by uncertain events under a given confidence level it provides a manner to set the probability of loss and find the corresponding threshold when the financial loss results from fuzzy random variables the fuzzy random value at risk f v α r can characterize the risk value in a fuzzy random environment according to liu 2007 f v α r for the risk at a probability level β can be expressed as follows 6a ξ f v a r β inf x m ξ x β where ξ f v a r β is a fuzzy random variables β is the risk level m λ is an axiomatic uncertain measurement the ξ f v a r β is the quantile of the distribution φ of the fuzzy random variable based on jin 2000 for a risk level of β 0 β 1 the ξ f v a r β can be transformed as follows 6b ξ var β inf x φ x β φ 1 β where φ 1 β denoted the generalized inverse function of φ let ξ a b c be a triangular fuzzy number and its membership function is as follows 6c ω x x a 2 b a i f a x b x c 2 b c i f b x c 0 o t h e r w i s e the risk value of fuzzy variables ξ could be measured using its cumulative distribution function which can be presented as follows liu 2007 7 φ x 0 i f x a x a 2 b a i f a x b x c 2 b 2 c b i f b x c 1 i f x c thus the ξ v a r β can be calculated as follows 8a ξ v α r β a 2 b a β i f β 0 5 2 b c 2 c b β i f β 0 5 when the fuzzy boundary interval exists in the constraints concerned with value at risk the ξ f v a r β can be presented as follows kong et al 2017 8b ξ f v α r ν β a ξ 2 b ξ a ξ β i f β 0 5 2 b ξ c ξ 2 c ξ b ξ β i f β 0 5 where ν a b c a b c is a fuzzy boundary interval eq 8 b can be transformed into an interval format where the upper bound lower bound values can be calculated as follows ξ f v α r ν β a ξ 2 b ξ a ξ β i f β 0 5 2 b ξ c ξ 2 c ξ b ξ β i f β 0 5 ξ f v α r ν β a ξ 2 b ξ a ξ β i f β 0 5 2 b ξ c ξ 2 c ξ b ξ β i f β 0 5 8c ξ f v α r ν β ξ f v α r ν β ξ f v α r ν β according to the theorem translation invariance let μ be an uncertain variable and b is a real number then we have μ b ξ v α r β μ ξ v α r β b the steps of determining fuzzy random value at risk are as follows 1 defining the triangular fuzzy variable 2 obtaining the cumulative distribution function of the triangular fuzzy variable 3 calculating the fuzzy random value at risk under given risk level 3 benefit value at risk the benefit risk control presented as exposure risk of benefit is proposed to characterize the probability of not meeting a target benefit level liu et al 2016 it is defined as follows 9a ris k x ij η h h 1 h p h z h λ x ij η h 9b h 1 h p h z h λ ε λ λ 9c z h λ x ij η h λ 1 i f b h η h λ 0 o t h e r w i s e 9d b h x ij i 1 i j 1 j c ij x ij i 1 i j 1 j d ij y ijh h where b h x is the actual benefit i e the benefit resulting after the uncertainty has been unveiled and scenario h has been realized ε λ presents the exposure risk level η h is the pre defined target benefit and it changes with the variation of probability of flow level and exposure risk level z h is a binary variable the actual benefit under each scenario should be controlled within a reasonable range therefore the benefit control risk constraints can be converted into the form as follows 10a i 1 i j 1 j ev c ij x ij i 1 i j 1 j ev d ij y ijh η h λ u b h λ z h λ h λ 10b i 1 i j 1 j ev c ij x ij i 1 i j 1 j ev d ij y ijh η h λ u b h λ 1 z h λ h λ 10c z h λ x ij η h λ 1 i f b h η h λ 0 o t h e r w i s e 10d h 1 h p h z h λ ε λ λ where u b h λ is auxiliary variable for balancing benefit for scenario h and the target benefit the exposure risk can deal with risk of not meeting the pre defined benefit target under each scenario through the following steps 1 defining the exposure risk levels and corresponding target benefit of each scenario 2 obtain the actual benefit of each scenario under corresponding exposure risk levels 2 3 risk based fuzzy boundary interval two stage stochastic water resources management programming approach rfitswmp the objective function is to maximize the expected economic benefit and the constraints comprise water availability penalty loss exposure risk of benefit minimum and maximum water demand and non negative constraints the decision variable is

factorial analysis mfa mfa is a sensitivity analysis method which can reflect the interaction among parameters and characterize the relationship between parameters and response zhang et al 2016 the mfa has advantages of easy implementation and low computational demand in three level factorial analysis the main effects of individual parameters can be calculated based on the variation range of average model output response when individual parameter varies across its three levels 14 a m a i n e f f e c t max y l y m y h min y l y m y h where y h y m a n d y l present the average response of

when a is at the l level and b is at the h level and so on 3 case study 3 1 study area the study area shown in fig 2 is located in the oasis basin of middle reaches of the heihe river basin hrb 97 37 102 06 e 37 44 42 40 n zhangye city gansu province northwest china it consists of ganzhou district gz linze county lz and gaotai county gt the mean annual precipitation is 140 mm mainly during june to september the mean annual evapotranspiration is more than 1400 mm which makes it an arid area the major resources of water resources of the study area are surface water from hrb and groundwater the main water users is this study include primary industry pi secondary industry si tertiary industry ti and the ecological sector es the water resources system suffers from inefficient water use which intensifies the competition for the limited water supplies as well as the conflicts among water users besides there are many uncertainties existing in the water allocation system such as runoff and water prices for example the randomness of water availability could lead to economic loss risk therefore the randomness of water availability should be quantitatively characterized and corresponding risk control measurement should be adopted in water management the system is faced with various risks such as the risks of water shortage benefit loss and penalty loss which further affects the robustness of system therefore it is necessary to measure such risks and allocate the limited water resources to different water users with considerations risk control the water allocation target benefit and penalty coefficient of water sectors are shown in table 1 the water availability under different risk levels is listed in table 2 and the maximum allowable loss and target benefit is shown in table 3 3 2 data collection 3 2 1 water demands the water demands of primary industry are the sum of water demands from animal husbandry irrigation and woodland the water demand of animal husbandry is calculated through multiplying water quota by the livestock population the irrigation water demand is obtained via multiplying the irrigation water quota by the total irrigation area while that of woodland is the product of the forest and grassland area multiplies its irrigation water quota the water demand of secondary industry consists of the water from construction and industrial activities the water demand of industrial activities is calculated by multiplying industrial value added water quantity by industrial value added the water demand of tertiary industry is calculated via corresponding tertiary industrial value added water quantity by its value added the ecological water demand is the sum of evaporation from water surface and water requirement for urban greening and natural vegetation the water quota and livestock population irrigation quota and area value added water quantity and industrial value added are obtained through statistical yearbook of zhangye city from 2005 to 2016 3 2 2 water supply the water sources of water sectors in the study area include surface water and groundwater for surface water its amount is equal to the difference that the runoff from the upstream and the water release to the downstream area the runoff data from 1952 to 2012 are obtained from the local water conservancy annual report the inflow are classified into three levels based on frequency analysis method low medium and high level flows are defined as flows with an exceedance probability of greater than 75 between 25 and 75 and less than 25 respectively the classification result is shown in fig 3 the 95 confidence level interval is adopted to define the lower and upper bounds of interval numbers the amount of groundwater that is extracted to compensate for water deficiency is estimated as an interval based on historic data from the water conservancy annual reports from 2001 to 2003 3 2 3 economic efficiency thresholds the economic efficiency thresholds comprise the maximum acceptable loss under different risk levels the pre defined target benefit of each scenario under different allowable exposure risk levels the maximum acceptable loss varies with the risk levels and also is affected by water availability violation levels therefore the maximum acceptable loss under different risk levels i e 0 5 0 8 and1 can be determined through solving the fuzzy random value at risk at the constraints of p taking 0 2 that is because that the penalty loss increases with the increase of water availability the target benefit is affected by water availability and allowable risk exposure level thus the target benefit of each flow level under different exposure risk level 0 0 65 and 1 can be gained by solving the model at the constraints of p taking 0 that can be explained by the actual benefit increases with the water availability increase 3 2 4 other parameters the benefit and penalty coefficients are hard to be defined as determined values due to uncertainties resulting from temporal spatial variations in socioeconomic and natural conditions fuzzy boundary interval is effective in tackling uncertainties expressed as interval values with fuzziness the fuzzy numbers of the lower bound are determined using minimum mean and maximum values of statistical data the fuzzy numbers of the upper bound are determined by multiplying an enlargement coefficient 1 10 in this study the benefit coefficient for each water sector is multiplied by 1 11 and 1 20 to get the lower and upper bounds of the corresponding penalty coefficient respectively 4 results and discussion this section includes the result from three aspects 1 the results analysis of optimal water allocation of a total of 27 risk scenarios which is the combination of three water availability constraint violation levels p 0 05 0 15 and 0 2 three penalty risk levels β 0 5 0 8 and 1 and three benefit exposure risk levels λ 0 0 65 and 1 and 2 the analysis of relationship between economic benefit and benefit penalty control values under different risk parameters 3 the sensitivity analysis about the effect of individual parameter e g p β and λ and interactive parameters on economic benefit and total water allocation under high medium and low flow levels which is conducted by the three level factorial analysis the results can provide optimal water allocation schemes for decision makers according to their risk preference 4 1 the optimal water allocation schemes the optimal water allocation schemes under 27 risk scenarios are listed in table 4 taking all the combinations of p β λ values a total of 27 scenarios are presented to help verify this the p β λ values of scenarios 1 3 are 0 05 0 5 0 0 05 0 5 0 65 and 0 05 0 5 1 respectively the result demonstrates that there are interactive effects among risk parameters in water allocation processes to examine the effects of individual parameters on optimal water allocation scheme a set of sensitivity analysis are conducted by allowing the one parameter to change while keeping two other parameters fixed thus the 27 scenarios combinations are generated the nine combinations for p comprises s1 s10 s19 sk sk 9 sk 18 s9 s18 s27 where k is the scenario subscript and ranges from 1to 9 respectively the combinations for β are s1 s4 s7 sk sk 3 sk 6 s21 s24 s27 where k is 1 2 3 10 11 12 19 20 and 21 respectively and the combinations for λ include s1 s2 s3 sk sk 1 sk 2 s25 s26 s27 where k is 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22 and 25 individually for s1 s10 s19 combination the case is that β is equal to 0 5 and λ is 0 the result shows that p value distinctly influences the water allocation in pi and si but have no significant impacts on ti and es the p value greatly affects the water allocation results in gz but slightly affects the results in lz and gt this is because the maximum water demands of ti and es are satisfied before pi and si due to their relative higher benefit and lower penalty another reason is that the benefit of pi in gz is higher than that in lz and gt the water resources are firstly allocated to pi in gz in exchange the water allocation of pi in gz and lz keep in the lower bound of water allocation target the results also disclosed that the water allocations of pt and si increase with the growing of risk parameter p value and the water allocation raises with improvement of water flow levels this can be explained by the fact that the increase of risk parameter p and flow levels means higher water availability and thus water availability constraints are loosened the water availability is firstly allocated to ti and es to meet their water allocation targets while water allocation target of pi and si are not satisfied when p varies from 0 0 05 to 0 2 for example the water allocation of pi in gz is 0 622 0 699 109m3 for low flow 0 744 0 804 109m3 for medium flow and 0 804 109m3 for high flow the results of other combinations including s4 s13 s21 s6 s15 s24 s7 s16 s25 and s9 s18 s27 reveal different system response caused by interactive influence from p β and λ take s21 s24 s27 as example when p is 0 2 and λ is 1 the β clearly has an effect on water allocation in gz but it has no significant effect on the allocation in lz and gt the β has a remarkable influence on the results in pi but has a small impact on the results in si ti and es also the water allocation of pi in gz increases with the improvement of β this is because that the maximum allowable loss is set to increase with the raise of risk level which means constraints are loosened indirectly leading to an growing water availability however the other combinations such as s2 s6 s9 the water allocation shows no obvious variation pattern as it is not only affected by the penalty risk level but also the allowable exposure risk level for combination of s1 s2 s3 where p is 0 05 and β is 0 the change in λ remarkably affects the results in gz but has little impacts on the results in lz and gt the λ significantly affects the results in pi and si but barely changes the results in ti and es and the water allocation of pi si in gz enlarges with an increase in λ this can be explained by the fact that the increased violated risk level of benefit corresponds to the higher acceptable benefit interval and thus exposure risk of benefit constraints are loosened but other combinations including s10 s11 s12 s19 s20 s21 s22 s23 s24 and s25 s26 s27 illustrate that the water allocations are increased first and decreased then therefore quantifying the influence of individual parameter and their interactions on water allocation is essential for formulating reasonable water allocation schemes according to the preference of decision makers figs 4 6 illustrate the total water allocation under high medium and low flow levels in the 27 scenarios for higher flow level when p is 0 05 β take 0 5 0 8 and1 and λ take 0 0 65 and 1 the lower bound of total water allocation is exactly the same while the upper bound increases with the improvement of β and λ this is because that the raises of p β and λ indicate the constraints are loosened and constraints concerned with other risk parameters do not take effect due to the limitation of water availability constraints the result also disclosed that the variation amplitude of first line is largest followed by the second and third lines when p is 0 15 β takes 0 5 0 8 and 1 and λ take 0 0 65 and1 the upper bound of water allocation shows obvious increasing pattern with the raise of β and λ the first line has the greatest slop followed by third and second lines the lower bound of water allocation except for the case that β takes 0 5 and λ takes 0 is the same this can be explained by the fact that the water allocation is constrained by the interaction of β and λ when p is 0 2 β take 0 5 0 8 and1 and λ take 0 0 65 and 1 the upper bound of water allocation performs the same increasing pattern for combinations that p equals to 0 5 and p takes 0 15 respectively while the water allocation is bigger than that two cases the lower bound of total water allocation except for case that λ takes 0 is the same the result discovers that the water allocation amplifies with the increase of p for example line slope becomes bigger as p varies from 0 05 to 0 15 and then from 0 15 to 0 2 when β and λ are fixed consequently the total water allocation increases with the improvement of water availability violation risk penalty loss and allowable exposure benefit risk levels when the flow level is medium the total water allocation increases from 1 636 1 697 109m3 to 1 642 1 972 109m3 as p changes from 0 05 to 0 15 and the total water allocation grows from 1 642 1 972 109m3 to 1 669 1 951 109m3 when p varies from 0 15 to 0 2 for low flow level the total water allocation rises from 1 447 1 523 109m3 to 1 455 1 561 109m3 when p changes from 0 05 to 0 15 and the total water allocation ascends from 1 455 1 561 109m3 to 1 485 1 599 109m3 when p alters from 0 15 to 0 2 this is because that the water allocation is mainly determined by water availability under current conditions and the increased water availability violation risk leads to more water availability and thus constraints are loosen further more water allocation are generated this also indicates the higher water availability violation risk generates higher water allocation and higher water shortage risk 4 2 the economic benefit and benefit control analysis fig 7 shows the economic benefit in the 27 scenarios the result reveals that the economic benefit is the same as λ are 0 and 0 65 while upper bound of economic benefit grows when λ is 1 0 and p and β increase the lower bound of economic benefit enlarges with the improvement of λ while it abates with the raise of p and β this can be explained by the fact that the interactive relationship amid expected economic benefit regular benefit penalty and actual benefit and thus the cases that p equals 0 2 β take 0 5 0 8 and 1 and λ take 0 0 65 and 1 are quantified and analyzed which is shown in table 5 the actual benefit is the benefit of each flow level the regular benefit is the weighted sum of actual benefit the expected economic benefit is regular benefit subtracting penalty value at risk when β is 0 5 the actual benefit amplifies with the improvement of λ which results to an increase of regular benefit and penalty value at risk the raise of penalty value at risk is greater than that of regular benefit therefore the expected economic benefit presents reduced pattern the variation of water allocation under case that β takes 0 8 and case β is 1 is the same the expected economic benefit changes from 0 92548 1 05019 109yuan to 0 92536 1 05019 109yuan as β alters from 0 5 to 0 8 and λ is 0 65 and the expected economic benefit varies from 0 92536 1 05019 109yuan to 0 92528 1 05019 109 yuan when β transforms from 0 8 to 1 and λ is 0 65 the expected economic benefit variation is resulted from difference between regular benefit and penalty value at risk the improvement of lower boundary of regular benefit is smaller than that of penalty value at risk while the upper boundary of regular benefit is the same as that of penalty value at risk and thus expected economic benefit presents diminished pattern along with the increase of β and the decision makers can realize their expected benefit based on parameters interaction on benefits 4 3 sensitivity analysis in this study a three level factorial analysis is conducted to analyze the influence of individual parameter and the interactive effect on water allocation and economic benefit it is implemented at low l medium m and high h levels for each parameter the parameters and their three levels are listed in table 6 this sub section results from three contents 1 the effects of individual parameters on total water allocation and economic benefit 2 the effects of interactive parameters on total water allocation and economic benefit 4 3 1 effect of individual parameters fig 8 depicts the effects of p β and λ on total water allocation under three flows levels for the plot on top left corner it shows increasing variation pattern of total water allocation as p changes across its low medium and high levels the total water allocation grows from 1 913 1 997 109m3 to 1 952 2 042 109m3 and then from 1 952 2 042 109m3 to 1 977 2 086 109m3 when parameter p varies across its three levels of 0 05 0 15 and 0 2 respectively the positive slope of the line indicates p has a positive effect on water allocation under the high flow level compared with β and λ p has the steepest slope implying that it has the greatest magnitude of main effect on water allocation under the high flow level the β has no effect on water allocation under each flow level the irregular slope of upper line of λ under high flow level indicates that it has an obvious nonlinear effect on water allocation while it has no effect on water allocation for lower line this illustrates that water availability and exposure risk of benefit constraints work in order to avoid over water shortage and unreasonable actual benefit however the maximum penalty loss constraints do not take effect because the obtained penalty loss does not excess the maximum penalty loss the p has the most important individual effect on water allocation under medium and low flow levels the fig 9 shows the impact of individual risk parameter on expected value it shows that the p and λ have positive effect on economic benefit while the β has no effect on it that auxiliary decision variables z of pi in gz and lz are less than 1 0 which illustrates that the water availability under given p value do not satisfy the maximum water demands and that is still a certain water shortage risk this is because the water availability is less than maximum water demand from all sectors and subareas when p reaches its maximum of 0 2 a higher violation risk indicates a higher water shortage risk but higher economic benefit the exposure risk of benefit constraints control what degree of actual benefit under each water flow level could violate given target benefit the higher λ value leads to higher economic benefit and higher water shortage risk 4 3 2 effects of interactive parameter pairs figs 10 12 demonstrate that the interactive effects on water allocation and economic benefit of risk parameters through the specific variations of one parameter under the impact of another parameter for interactive plot of p β in fig 10 the solid line represents upper bound of water allocation and the dotted line represents lower bound of water allocation the water allocation of p taking 0 05 is the same whereas case that p is 0 15 and case that p is 0 2 present different increasing amplitude variation pattern when β varies cross its three levels under high flow level this is because the penalty loss does not exceed the maximum penalty loss when p takes 0 05 while the water allocation increase with the improvement of p and thus it arises excessive penalty loss which are constrained by maximum allowable penalty constraints the risk control constraints take effect and affect each other which can achieve the tradeoff between penalty loss water availability and economic benefit this also indicates the higher water availability violation risk arises higher economic benefit as well as higher penalty loss fig 11 shows that the higher water availability violation risk and allowable exposure risk level of benefit result into higher water allocation the combination of β and λ significantly affects water allocation under high flow level while they have no interactive influence on water allocation under medium and low flow levels from the fig 12 those constraints related to β and λ function when the water availability reaches a special value the actual benefit when λ is 1 0 exceed the target benefit which results into over penalty loss and then it is constrained by maximum penalty loss constraints this also disclosed that higher penalty loss risk and allowable exposure risk level of benefit lead to higher water allocation fig 13 shows that economic benefit increases as p value varies across its low medium and high levels under the impact of β and vice versa besides combination of p and λ has similar interactive effect on economic benefit with combination of p and β but the increasing amplitude of the former is bigger than that of the latter this lies in reason that the mutual restrictions amid water availability penalty and actual benefit under combination of p and β is smaller than that for combination of p and λ the combination of β and λ has no effect on economic benefit which is caused by the limited water availability table 7 illustrates that p has the largest main effect of 0 066 0 090 109m3 0 033 0 055 109m3 and 0 011 0 023 109m3 on water allocation under high medium and low flow levels respectively the λ has the largest main effect of 0 053 0 062 109 yuan on economic benefit in addition combination of p and λ has a highest interactive effect on water allocation under high flow level and p and β have the greatest interactive effect on economic benefit specially except for p other parameters and interactive parameters have no effect on water allocation under medium and low flow levels it indicates that the higher water availability violation risk the higher penalty loss risk level and higher exposure risk level of benefit result in the increased water allocation and economic benefit however the influence degree of interactive parameters on water allocation and economic benefit is slighter than that of individual parameter thus the tradeoff between water allocation and economic benefit based on risk controls in decision making processes could generate more robust water allocation schemes and improve the robustness of decision making based on results calculated by rfitswmp model numbers of findings can be disclosed as follows a the total water allocation under the case that p is 0 05 and β is 0 5 and λ is 0 for high flow level is smallest where it corresponds to lower economic benefit and higher reliability and b the biggest total water allocation when p takes 0 2 and β is 1 and λ values1 for high flow level occur where it results into highest expected economic and lower reliability and 3 the water allocation and economic benefit under other risk scenarios and other flow levels are between above two scenarios 4 the water allocation and economic benefit have similar variation pattern with the change of risk parameters the managers could balance the relationship amid water allocation risk and economic benefit based on above findings if managers desires to get higher economic benefit they might afford higher water shortage penalty loss risks which is suitable for optimistic managers by contrary the pessimistic managers could choose the water allocation scheme corresponding to lower economic benefit and lower water shortage and penalty loss risk 4 4 the comparison between rfitswmp model and actual water allocation the actual water allocation is shown in table 8 the actual water allocation falls in the interval solution obtained from rfitswmp model compared with the actual water allocation the rfitswmp model has following advantages 1 it provides more robust solution by covering more water allocation schemes with consideration of risk levels 2 it generates different water allocation plans for different annual hydrological conditions by introducing the occurrence probabilities of flow levels 4 5 the comparison fitswmp model and rfitswmp model the rfitswmp model can be transformed into a fuzzy boundary interval two stage stochastic water resources management fitswmp model when there is no risk control measurement in other words the fitswmp model is a special case of rfitswmp model generally speaking the total water allocation of fitswmp model is conservative than that of the rfitswmp model this is because the total water availability of fitswmp model is lesser than the rfitswmp model as the latter considers water availability violation risk besides the economic benefit of fitswmp model falls in the intervals obtained from rfitswmp model under 27 risk control scenarios which indicates that the developed model has more robustness and that decision makers could choose the optimal water allocation schemes according to their own risk attitudes 5 conclusion in this study a risk based fuzzy boundary interval two stage stochastic water resources management programming rfitswmp approach is proposed for water consumption structure optimization the proposed approach integrates three risk control methods including chance constrained programming fuzzy random value at risk and exposure risk of benefit with an inexact water resources management model the case study of heihe river basin for optimization of water allocation for primary industry secondary industry tertiary industry and ecological sector shows the proposed model can be a reliable and effective tool the results disclosed that 1 the individual risk parameters i e p β and λ have different impact on optimal water allocation schemes in each subarea and the higher risk levels correspond to higher water shortage penalty loss and benefit value at risk but higher economic benefit 2 higher economic benefit is associated with increased individual risk parameter and risk levels 3 economic benefit is affected by of risk parameters combination and it is a solution with consideration of the interactions of regular benefit penalty lose and actual benefit it is demonstrated that the rfitswmp model is more robust and applicable for addressing the water allocation optimization problems however in practical applications water managers may face with the interactions among multiple objectives during water resources allocation therefore more robust optimization techniques that could deal with multiple interactive uncertainties and complexities should be further integrated into the rfitswmp framework in the future research credit authorship contribution statement youzhi wang data curation methodology writing original draft zhong li writing review

5842,establishing an optimal water allocation scheme is a challenging yet crucial task for effective risk management of water resources the dynamic and complex interaction among various risk related components in a water resources management system cannot be easily modeled to characterize the system response under different risk control settings in this study a risk based fuzzy boundary interval two stage stochastic water resources management programming rfitswmp model is developed for the optimization of water consumption this model incorporates a series of risk control constraints such as water availability maximum allowable penalty and allowable benefit violation constraints into a fuzzy boundary interval two stage stochastic programming framework for water resources management it can address the uncertainties presented as fuzzy boundary intervals and probability distributions it can also tackle the recourse action to minimize penalties based on interactive influences of different risk control measures further generating optimal water allocation alternatives and guiding water resources management this developed model is applied to a case study of water consumption optimization in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin in china feasible water allocation schemes under given risk levels as well as the associated economic benefit actual benefit and penalty loss are generated the results can help decision makers to gain an insight into the inherent conflicts and tradeoffs amid risk benefit and water allocation the performance of developed model is further demonstrated by comparing it with a fuzzy boundary interval two stage stochastic water resources management programming fitswmp model in addition a multiple factorial analysis mfa approach is employed to analyze the impacts of interactive risk parameters on the optimal decisions the result disclosed that 1 the higher individual risk parameter levels correspond to higher water shortage penalty loss and benefit value at risk but higher economic benefit 2 the combination of risk parameters can achieve robust water allocation and economic benefit as the constraints concerned with risk parameters affect and limited by each other 3 the condition that water violated probability p is 0 2 penalty violated risk level β is 1 and benefit violated risk level γ is 1 has the highest water allocation and biggest economic benefit keywords water resources management risk controls sensitivity analysis uncertainty 1 introduction sustainable socioeconomic development relies on the development of industrial activities e g primary secondary and tertiary industries and ecological construction mostly related to water resources tsai et al 2015 sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 however many countries are facing inevitable conflicts among industries and the ecological sector caused by limited water resources li et al 2018 moreover under the impacts of climate change and human activities the probability of extreme events increases aggravating the unbalanced relationship between water supply and water demand zhang et al 2017 therefore it is urgent to improve water use efficiency through reasonable allocation of water resources and optimization of the water use structure in order to ensure the sustainability of socioeconomic development in water resources allocation systems there exist many uncertainties in the parameters and their interrelationships such as the randomness of runoff events and the uncertain interaction between runoff and precipitation which leads to significant complexities of water allocation traditional optimization methods are usually not capable of dealing with such problems more advanced optimization methods that addresses uncertainties in different formats such as stochastic programming fuzzy programming and interval programming methods were developed to tackle these complexities wang et al 2019 yang et al 2017 li et al 2013a b zhang and guo 2017 zhang et al 2017 bai et al 2019 among these methods inexact two stage stochastic programming itsp is widely used for water allocation because of its advantage in reflecting the tradeoffs between pre defined economic targets and random water availability besides it can reflect the uncertainties presented as both probability distributions and intervals wang and huang 2011 zhang et al 2018 however in water resources management there exists dual uncertain parameters in which a single interval number or fuzzy set could not well describe the parameter uncertainty for example the net water allocated benefit for each water user could be expressed as an interval number 0 35 0 55 yuan m3 however in practice the lower and upper bounds may be uncertain while the most likely value of the lower bound is 0 35 the smallest and largest possible value could be 0 25 and 0 45 respectively similarly the smallest and largest possible value of the upper bound could be 0 40 and 0 60 respectively thus the net water allocated benefit should be presented as a fuzzy boundary interval 0 25 0 35 0 40 0 45 0 55 0 60 yuan m3 fuzzy boundary intervals can be used when the upper and lower bounds of the interval parameters in an optimization model are uncertain and thus quantify the risk caused by uncertainties they have been extensively used in water allocation systems bekri et al 2015 kong et al 2017 wang and huang 2011 li et al 2010 in this study fuzzy boundary intervals are introduced to the inexact two stage stochastic programming framework and the resulted fuzzy boundary interval two stage stochastic water resources programming fitswmp approach is adopted for water resources management there also exist other problems in water resources management decision makers might encounter the problems as follows 1 how to achieve a balance between water shortage risk and economic benefit 2 how to control the penalty loss effectively 3 how to govern the actual benefit under different flow levels to meet economic targets a single risk control approach could not deal with all of the above problems for example the chance constrained programming ccp approach requires that all of the constraints are satisfied under a given probability level it can measure the relationship between economic benefit and the risk of violating water availability constraint s guo et al 2009 piao et al 2014 nonetheless it just considers the expected economic benefit and does not concern the exorbitant penalty loss caused by random events in reality the randomness of runoff or precipitation may arise the exorbitant penalty loss which is unacceptable for economic development the fuzzy random value at risk as a risk control measurement is also a useful tool for controlling penalty loss and has been widely used in water resources management hu et al 2016 tong et al 2010 zhang and guo 2018 it can reflect the ambiguity and vagueness in penalty loss compared with the conditional value at risk method and can control the penalty under different violated risk levels of penalty peng 2009 nevertheless the fuzzy value at risk take over the expected penalty loss resulted from a random event and neglects the actual benefit under different flow levels in water allocation processes the actual benefit under each water flow level is affected by second stage recourse which might result in undesirably low benefit the benefit value at risk can measure the relationship between expected economic benefit and risk of violating given target actual benefit i e the net benefit after the second stage decision of each scenario e g high medium and low flow levels under multiple specific risk exposure levels barbaro and bagajewicz 2004 li et al 2015 liu et al 2016 liu and huang 2008 however it could not consider the expected economic benefit of all flow levels due to neglecting random events all of the three abovementioned individual risk control methods have their own advantages and disadvantages although they can provide detailed results about risk water allocation and economic benefit the three elements affect each other and the complex relationships among them are not clear hence a sensitivity analysis method called multi level factorial analysis mfa is introduced in this study to tackle the effects of individual parameters and their interactions on the system response mfa has been extensively used in water resources management hu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 wu and fan 2008 however there are very few studies on its application for analyzing the effects of multiple uncertain risk parameters or their multi level effects on water allocation the objective of this study is therefore to develop a risk based fuzzy boundary interval two stage stochastic water resources management programming rfitswmp model for water resources management under uncertainties in the proposed model risk control constraints are integrated into a fitswmp optimization framework the goal of this study is to allocate limited water resources to different water users in different subareas and quantify the interactive effects of risk parameters on water allocation and economic benefit which could further support risk control the rfitswmp model has the following advantages 1 it realizes the balance amid expected economic benefit penalty loss and actual benefit 2 it generates more water allocation alternatives under different risk levels 3 it can support in depth analysis of the interrelationships among system benefit water allocation and risk the proposed model is applied to a real world case study of a water resources management system in the heihe river basin gansu province china to demonstrate its applicability 2 methodology notation i index of subarea i i 1 gz i 2 lz i 3 gt

fuzzy boundary interval two stage stochastic water resources management programming model fitswmp can reflect the tradeoffs between pre regulated policy and the associated economic penalty and deal with the fuzzy boundary interval and random number with known existed in the objective and constraints the fitswmp approach is based on the interactive two stage stochastic fuzzy programming itsfp approach proposed by wang and huang 2011 the integrated model can be written as follows max f i 1 i j 1 j c ij x ij i i j 1 j h 1 h p h d ij y ijh 1 i 1 i j 1 j a ij x ij y ijh b h h x ij 0 y ijh 0 i j h where x ij is first stage decision variables before the random events occur x ij is in the format of interval and can be expressed as x ij x ij x ij where x ij x ij are the lower and upper bound of x ij respectively y ijh is second stage decision variables depending on the realization of the random events y ijh is an interval with a lower and upper bounds of y ijh and y ijh and its expression is y ijh y ijh y ijh b t is random variables with known distributions p h is the occurrence probability of a flow level h c ij d ij are benefit and penalty coefficients respectively and they are both fuzzy boundary interval numbers the fuzzy boundary interval is defined as an interval number where the lower and upper bound are presented as fuzzy number the fuzzy number can be transformed into the expected value presented as a number through solving inverse function of its membership function wang and huang 2011 and the membership function of triangular fuzzy numbers can be described as follows 2 μ a x f a x f o r a 1 x a 2 1 f o r x a 2 g a x f o r a 2 x a 3 where μ a x is the membership function of fuzzy sets a which can be denoted by fuzzy number a a 1 a 2 a 3 the α level set of fuzzy sets a can be defined as a α x r u a α where α 0 1 f a x and g a x represent a continuous and monotonically increasing linear function given a 1 x a 2 and monotonically decreasing linear function given a 2 x a 3 respectively since μ a is upper semi continuous the α level set of a forms a closed and bound interval a α f a 1 α g a 1 α where f a 1 α inf x μ a x α 3a g a 1 α sup x μ a x α therefore the expected interval of a fuzzy set can be defined as follows 3b ei a e 1 a e 2 a 0 1 f a 1 α 0 1 g a 1 α the expected value of fuzzy set is the average of its expected interval 3c ev a e 1 a e 2 a 2 for a fuzzy set with a triangular membership function the expected interval and expected value can be calculated through the abovementioned transformation as follows ei a 1 2 a 1 a 2 1 2 a 2

ij denotes the expected interval of d ij and its format is ev d ij 1 4 d 1 2 d 2 c 3 1 4 c 1 2 c 2 c 3 2 2 risk control measurement the risk control measurement includes three aspects 1 water shortage control by chance constrained programming 2 penalty control by fuzzy random value at risk and 3 benefit control through exposure risk of benefit under each scenario they are described as follows 1 chance constrained programming 5a pr i 1 i j 1 j a ij x ij y ijh b h 1 q l h q l this constraint can be transformed into 5b i 1 i j 1 j a ij x ij y ijh b h q l h q l and b h q l f l 1 q l f l 1 q l denotes the inverse function value of cumulative distribution function of b h under constraint violated probability q l therefore the ccp model can be solved through the following steps 1 determining the probability value q l q l 0 1 for each constraint and 2 finding the solutions that satisfy all constraints with a probability of 1 q l ren et al 2013 2 fuzzy random value at risk value at risk can measure the financial loss caused by uncertain events under a given confidence level it provides a manner to set the probability of loss and find the corresponding threshold when the financial loss results from fuzzy random variables the fuzzy random value at risk f v α r can characterize the risk value in a fuzzy random environment according to liu 2007 f v α r for the risk at a probability level β can be expressed as follows 6a ξ f v a r β inf x m ξ x β where ξ f v a r β is a fuzzy random variables β is the risk level m λ is an axiomatic uncertain measurement the ξ f v a r β is the quantile of the distribution φ of the fuzzy random variable based on jin 2000 for a risk level of β 0 β 1 the ξ f v a r β can be transformed as follows 6b ξ var β inf x φ x β φ 1 β where φ 1 β denoted the generalized inverse function of φ let ξ a b c be a triangular fuzzy number and its membership function is as follows 6c ω x x a 2 b a i f a x b x c 2 b c i f b x c 0 o t h e r w i s e the risk value of fuzzy variables ξ could be measured using its cumulative distribution function which can be presented as follows liu 2007 7 φ x 0 i f x a x a 2 b a i f a x b x c 2 b 2 c b i f b x c 1 i f x c thus the ξ v a r β can be calculated as follows 8a ξ v α r β a 2 b a β i f β 0 5 2 b c 2 c b β i f β 0 5 when the fuzzy boundary interval exists in the constraints concerned with value at risk the ξ f v a r β can be presented as follows kong et al 2017 8b ξ f v α r ν β a ξ 2 b ξ a ξ β i f β 0 5 2 b ξ c ξ 2 c ξ b ξ β i f β 0 5 where ν a b c a b c is a fuzzy boundary interval eq 8 b can be transformed into an interval format where the upper bound lower bound values can be calculated as follows ξ f v α r ν β a ξ 2 b ξ a ξ β i f β 0 5 2 b ξ c ξ 2 c ξ b ξ β i f β 0 5 ξ f v α r ν β a ξ 2 b ξ a ξ β i f β 0 5 2 b ξ c ξ 2 c ξ b ξ β i f β 0 5 8c ξ f v α r ν β ξ f v α r ν β ξ f v α r ν β according to the theorem translation invariance let μ be an uncertain variable and b is a real number then we have μ b ξ v α r β μ ξ v α r β b the steps of determining fuzzy random value at risk are as follows 1 defining the triangular fuzzy variable 2 obtaining the cumulative distribution function of the triangular fuzzy variable 3 calculating the fuzzy random value at risk under given risk level 3 benefit value at risk the benefit risk control presented as exposure risk of benefit is proposed to characterize the probability of not meeting a target benefit level liu et al 2016 it is defined as follows 9a ris k x ij η h h 1 h p h z h λ x ij η h 9b h 1 h p h z h λ ε λ λ 9c z h λ x ij η h λ 1 i f b h η h λ 0 o t h e r w i s e 9d b h x ij i 1 i j 1 j c ij x ij i 1 i j 1 j d ij y ijh h where b h x is the actual benefit i e the benefit resulting after the uncertainty has been unveiled and scenario h has been realized ε λ presents the exposure risk level η h is the pre defined target benefit and it changes with the variation of probability of flow level and exposure risk level z h is a binary variable the actual benefit under each scenario should be controlled within a reasonable range therefore the benefit control risk constraints can be converted into the form as follows 10a i 1 i j 1 j ev c ij x ij i 1 i j 1 j ev d ij y ijh η h λ u b h λ z h λ h λ 10b i 1 i j 1 j ev c ij x ij i 1 i j 1 j ev d ij y ijh η h λ u b h λ 1 z h λ h λ 10c z h λ x ij η h λ 1 i f b h η h λ 0 o t h e r w i s e 10d h 1 h p h z h λ ε λ λ where u b h λ is auxiliary variable for balancing benefit for scenario h and the target benefit the exposure risk can deal with risk of not meeting the pre defined benefit target under each scenario through the following steps 1 defining the exposure risk levels and corresponding target benefit of each scenario 2 obtain the actual benefit of each scenario under corresponding exposure risk levels 2 3 risk based fuzzy boundary interval two stage stochastic water resources management programming approach rfitswmp the objective function is to maximize the expected economic benefit and the constraints comprise water availability penalty loss exposure risk of benefit minimum and maximum water demand and non negative constraints the decision variable is the amount of allocated to each sector in each subarea under each water flow level objective function 11a max f i 1 i j 1 j b ij t ij i 1 i j 1 j p 1 p p h c ij d ijh constraints 1 water availability

factorial analysis mfa mfa is a sensitivity analysis method which can reflect the interaction among parameters and characterize the relationship between parameters and response zhang et al 2016 the mfa has advantages of easy implementation and low computational demand in three level factorial analysis the main effects of individual parameters can be calculated based on the variation range of average model output response when individual parameter varies across its three levels 14 a m a i n e f f e c t max y l y m y h min y l y m y h where y h y m a n d y l present the average response of

when a is at the l level and b is at the h level and so on 3 case study 3 1 study area the study area shown in fig 2 is located in the oasis basin of middle reaches of the heihe river basin hrb 97 37 102 06 e 37 44 42 40 n zhangye city gansu province northwest china it consists of ganzhou district gz linze county lz and gaotai county gt the mean annual precipitation is 140 mm mainly during june to september the mean annual evapotranspiration is more than 1400 mm which makes it an arid area the major resources of water resources of the study area are surface water from hrb and groundwater the main water users is this study include primary industry pi secondary industry si tertiary industry ti and the ecological sector es the water resources system suffers from inefficient water use which intensifies the competition for the limited water supplies as well as the conflicts among water users besides there are many uncertainties existing in the water allocation system such as runoff and water prices for example the randomness of water availability could lead to economic loss risk therefore the randomness of water availability should be quantitatively characterized and corresponding risk control measurement should be adopted in water management the system is faced with various risks such as the risks of water shortage benefit loss and penalty loss which further affects the robustness of system therefore it is necessary to measure such risks and allocate the limited water resources to different water users with considerations risk control the water allocation target benefit and penalty coefficient of water sectors are shown in table 1 the water availability under different risk levels is listed in table 2 and the maximum allowable loss and target benefit is shown in table 3 3 2 data collection 3 2 1 water demands the water demands of primary industry are the sum of water demands from animal husbandry irrigation and woodland the water demand of animal husbandry is calculated through multiplying water quota by the livestock population the irrigation water demand is obtained via multiplying the irrigation water quota by the total irrigation area while that of woodland is the product of the forest and grassland area multiplies its irrigation water quota the water demand of secondary industry consists of the water from construction and industrial activities the water demand of industrial activities is calculated by multiplying industrial value added water quantity by industrial value added the water demand of tertiary industry is calculated via corresponding tertiary industrial value added water quantity by its value added the ecological water demand is the sum of evaporation from water surface and water requirement for urban greening and natural vegetation the water quota and livestock population irrigation quota and area value added water quantity and industrial value added are obtained through statistical yearbook of zhangye city from 2005 to 2016 3 2 2 water supply the water sources of water sectors in the study area include surface water and groundwater for surface water its amount is equal to the difference that the runoff from the upstream and the water release to the downstream area the runoff data from 1952 to 2012 are obtained from the local water conservancy annual report the inflow are classified into three levels based on frequency analysis method low medium and high level flows are defined as flows with an exceedance probability of greater than 75 between 25 and 75 and less than 25 respectively the classification result is shown in fig 3 the 95 confidence level interval is adopted to define the lower and upper bounds of interval numbers the amount of groundwater that is extracted to compensate for water deficiency is estimated as an interval based on historic data from the water conservancy annual reports from 2001 to 2003 3 2 3 economic efficiency thresholds the economic efficiency thresholds comprise the maximum acceptable loss under different risk levels the pre defined target benefit of each scenario under different allowable exposure risk levels the maximum acceptable loss varies with the risk levels and also is affected by water availability violation levels therefore the maximum acceptable loss under different risk levels i e 0 5 0 8 and1 can be determined through solving the fuzzy random value at risk at the constraints of p taking 0 2 that is because that the penalty loss increases with the increase of water availability the target benefit is affected by water availability and allowable risk exposure level thus the target benefit of each flow level under different exposure risk level 0 0 65 and 1 can be gained by solving the model at the constraints of p taking 0 that can be explained by the actual benefit increases with the water availability increase 3 2 4 other parameters the benefit and penalty coefficients are hard to be defined as determined values due to uncertainties resulting from temporal spatial variations in socioeconomic and natural conditions fuzzy boundary interval is effective in tackling uncertainties expressed as interval values with fuzziness the fuzzy numbers of the lower bound are determined using minimum mean and maximum values of statistical data the fuzzy numbers of the upper bound are determined by multiplying an enlargement coefficient 1 10 in this study the benefit coefficient for each water sector is multiplied by 1 11 and 1 20 to get the lower and upper bounds of the corresponding penalty coefficient respectively 4 results and discussion this section includes the result from three aspects 1 the results analysis of optimal water allocation of a total of 27 risk scenarios which is the combination of three water availability constraint violation levels p 0 05 0 15 and 0 2 three penalty risk levels β 0 5 0 8 and 1 and three benefit exposure risk levels λ 0 0 65 and 1 and 2 the analysis of relationship between economic benefit and benefit penalty control values under different risk parameters 3 the sensitivity analysis about the effect of individual parameter e g p β and λ and interactive parameters on economic benefit and total water allocation under high medium and low flow levels which is conducted by the three level factorial analysis the results can provide optimal water allocation schemes for decision makers according to their risk preference 4 1 the optimal water allocation schemes the optimal water allocation schemes under 27 risk scenarios are listed in table 4 taking all the combinations of p β λ values a total of 27 scenarios are presented to help verify this the p β λ values of scenarios 1 3 are 0 05 0 5 0 0 05 0 5 0 65 and 0 05 0 5 1 respectively the result demonstrates that there are interactive effects among risk parameters in water allocation processes to examine the effects of individual parameters on optimal water allocation scheme a set of sensitivity analysis are conducted by allowing the one parameter to change while keeping two other parameters fixed thus the 27 scenarios combinations are generated the nine combinations for p comprises s1 s10 s19 sk sk 9 sk 18 s9 s18 s27 where k is the scenario subscript and ranges from 1to 9 respectively the combinations for β are s1 s4 s7 sk sk 3 sk 6 s21 s24 s27 where k is 1 2 3 10 11 12 19 20 and 21 respectively and the combinations for λ include s1 s2 s3 sk sk 1 sk 2 s25 s26 s27 where k is 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22 and 25 individually for s1 s10 s19 combination the case is that β is equal to 0 5 and λ is 0 the result shows that p value distinctly influences the water allocation in pi and si but have no significant impacts on ti and es the p value greatly affects the water allocation results in gz but slightly affects the results in lz and gt this is because the maximum water demands of ti and es are satisfied before pi and si due to their relative higher benefit and lower penalty another reason is that the benefit of pi in gz is higher than that in lz and gt the water resources are firstly allocated to pi in gz in exchange the water allocation of pi in gz and lz keep in the lower bound of water allocation target the results also disclosed that the water allocations of pt and si increase with the growing of risk parameter p value and the water allocation raises with improvement of water flow levels this can be explained by the fact that the increase of risk parameter p and flow levels means higher water availability and thus water availability constraints are loosened the water availability is firstly allocated to ti and es to meet their water allocation targets while water allocation target of pi and si are not satisfied when p varies from 0 0 05 to 0 2 for example the water allocation of pi in gz is 0 622 0 699 109m3 for low flow 0 744 0 804 109m3 for medium flow and 0 804 109m3 for high flow the results of other combinations including s4 s13 s21 s6 s15 s24 s7 s16 s25 and s9 s18 s27 reveal different system response caused by interactive influence from p β and λ take s21 s24 s27 as example when p is 0 2 and λ is 1 the β clearly has an effect on water allocation in gz but it has no significant effect on the allocation in lz and gt the β has a remarkable influence on the results in pi but has a small impact on the results in si ti and es also the water allocation of pi in gz increases with the improvement of β this is because that the maximum allowable loss is set to increase with the raise of risk level which means constraints are loosened indirectly leading to an growing water availability however the other combinations such as s2 s6 s9 the water allocation shows no obvious variation pattern as it is not only affected by the penalty risk level but also the allowable exposure risk level for combination of s1 s2 s3 where p is 0 05 and β is 0 the change in λ remarkably affects the results in gz but has little impacts on the results in lz and gt the λ significantly affects the results in pi and si but barely changes the results in ti and es and the water allocation of pi si in gz enlarges with an increase in λ this can be explained by the fact that the increased violated risk level of benefit corresponds to the higher acceptable benefit interval and thus exposure risk of benefit constraints are loosened but other combinations including s10 s11 s12 s19 s20 s21 s22 s23 s24 and s25 s26 s27 illustrate that the water allocations are increased first and decreased then therefore quantifying the influence of individual parameter and their interactions on water allocation is essential for formulating reasonable water allocation schemes according to the preference of decision makers figs 4 6 illustrate the total water allocation under high medium and low flow levels in the 27 scenarios for higher flow level when p is 0 05 β take 0 5 0 8 and1 and λ take 0 0 65 and 1 the lower bound of total water allocation is exactly the same while the upper bound increases with the improvement of β and λ this is because that the raises of p β and λ indicate the constraints are loosened and constraints concerned with other risk parameters do not take effect due to the limitation of water availability constraints the result also disclosed that the variation amplitude of first line is largest followed by the second and third lines when p is 0 15 β takes 0 5 0 8 and 1 and λ take 0 0 65 and1 the upper bound of water allocation shows obvious increasing pattern with the raise of β and λ the first line has the greatest slop followed by third and second lines the lower bound of water allocation except for the case that β takes 0 5 and λ takes 0 is the same this can be explained by the fact that the water allocation is constrained by the interaction of β and λ when p is 0 2 β take 0 5 0 8 and1 and λ take 0 0 65 and 1 the upper bound of water allocation performs the same increasing pattern for combinations that p equals to 0 5 and p takes 0 15 respectively while the water allocation is bigger than that two cases the lower bound of total water allocation except for case that λ takes 0 is the same the result discovers that the water allocation amplifies with the increase of p for example line slope becomes bigger as p varies from 0 05 to 0 15 and then from 0 15 to 0 2 when β and λ are fixed consequently the total water allocation increases with the improvement of water availability violation risk penalty loss and allowable exposure benefit risk levels when the flow level is medium the total water allocation increases from 1 636 1 697 109m3 to 1 642 1 972 109m3 as p changes from 0 05 to 0 15 and the total water allocation grows from 1 642 1 972 109m3 to 1 669 1 951 109m3 when p varies from 0 15 to 0 2 for low flow level the total water allocation rises from 1 447 1 523 109m3 to 1 455 1 561 109m3 when p changes from 0 05 to 0 15 and the total water allocation ascends from 1 455 1 561 109m3 to 1 485 1 599 109m3 when p alters from 0 15 to 0 2 this is because that the water allocation is mainly determined by water availability under current conditions and the increased water availability violation risk leads to more water availability and thus constraints are loosen further more water allocation are generated this also indicates the higher water availability violation risk generates higher water allocation and higher water shortage risk 4 2 the economic benefit and benefit control analysis fig 7 shows the economic benefit in the 27 scenarios the result reveals that the economic benefit is the same as λ are 0 and 0 65 while upper bound of economic benefit grows when λ is 1 0 and p and β increase the lower bound of economic benefit enlarges with the improvement of λ while it abates with the raise of p and β this can be explained by the fact that the interactive relationship amid expected economic benefit regular benefit penalty and actual benefit and thus the cases that p equals 0 2 β take 0 5 0 8 and 1 and λ take 0 0 65 and 1 are quantified and analyzed which is shown in table 5 the actual benefit is the benefit of each flow level the regular benefit is the weighted sum of actual benefit the expected economic benefit is regular benefit subtracting penalty value at risk when β is 0 5 the actual benefit amplifies with the improvement of λ which results to an increase of regular benefit and penalty value at risk the raise of penalty value at risk is greater than that of regular benefit therefore the expected economic benefit presents reduced pattern the variation of water allocation under case that β takes 0 8 and case β is 1 is the same the expected economic benefit changes from 0 92548 1 05019 109yuan to 0 92536 1 05019 109yuan as β alters from 0 5 to 0 8 and λ is 0 65 and the expected economic benefit varies from 0 92536 1 05019 109yuan to 0 92528 1 05019 109 yuan when β transforms from 0 8 to 1 and λ is 0 65 the expected economic benefit variation is resulted from difference between regular benefit and penalty value at risk the improvement of lower boundary of regular benefit is smaller than that of penalty value at risk while the upper boundary of regular benefit is the same as that of penalty value at risk and thus expected economic benefit presents diminished pattern along with the increase of β and the decision makers can realize their expected benefit based on parameters interaction on benefits 4 3 sensitivity analysis in this study a three level factorial analysis is conducted to analyze the influence of individual parameter and the interactive effect on water allocation and economic benefit it is implemented at low l medium m and high h levels for each parameter the parameters and their three levels are listed in table 6 this sub section results from three contents 1 the effects of individual parameters on total water allocation and economic benefit 2 the effects of interactive parameters on total water allocation and economic benefit 4 3 1 effect of individual parameters fig 8 depicts the effects of p β and λ on total water allocation under three flows levels for the plot on top left corner it shows increasing variation pattern of total water allocation as p changes across its low medium and high levels the total water allocation grows from 1 913 1 997 109m3 to 1 952 2 042 109m3 and then from 1 952 2 042 109m3 to 1 977 2 086 109m3 when parameter p varies across its three levels of 0 05 0 15 and 0 2 respectively the positive slope of the line indicates p has a positive effect on water allocation under the high flow level compared with β and λ p has the steepest slope implying that it has the greatest magnitude of main effect on water allocation under the high flow level the β has no effect on water allocation under each flow level the irregular slope of upper line of λ under high flow level indicates that it has an obvious nonlinear effect on water allocation while it has no effect on water allocation for lower line this illustrates that water availability and exposure risk of benefit constraints work in order to avoid over water shortage and unreasonable actual benefit however the maximum penalty loss constraints do not take effect because the obtained penalty loss does not excess the maximum penalty loss the p has the most important individual effect on water allocation under medium and low flow levels the fig 9 shows the impact of individual risk parameter on expected value it shows that the p and λ have positive effect on economic benefit while the β has no effect on it that auxiliary decision variables z of pi in gz and lz are less than 1 0 which illustrates that the water availability under given p value do not satisfy the maximum water demands and that is still a certain water shortage risk this is because the water availability is less than maximum water demand from all sectors and subareas when p reaches its maximum of 0 2 a higher violation risk indicates a higher water shortage risk but higher economic benefit the exposure risk of benefit constraints control what degree of actual benefit under each water flow level could violate given target benefit the higher λ value leads to higher economic benefit and higher water shortage risk 4 3 2 effects of interactive parameter pairs figs 10 12 demonstrate that the interactive effects on water allocation and economic benefit of risk parameters through the specific variations of one parameter under the impact of another parameter for interactive plot of p β in fig 10 the solid line represents upper bound of water allocation and the dotted line represents lower bound of water allocation the water allocation of p taking 0 05 is the same whereas case that p is 0 15 and case that p is 0 2 present different increasing amplitude variation pattern when β varies cross its three levels under high flow level this is because the penalty loss does not exceed the maximum penalty loss when p takes 0 05 while the water allocation increase with the improvement of p and thus it arises excessive penalty loss which are constrained by maximum allowable penalty constraints the risk control constraints take effect and affect each other which can achieve the tradeoff between penalty loss water availability and economic benefit this also indicates the higher water availability violation risk arises higher economic benefit as well as higher penalty loss fig 11 shows that the higher water availability violation risk and allowable exposure risk level of benefit result into higher water allocation the combination of β and λ significantly affects water allocation under high flow level while they have no interactive influence on water allocation under medium and low flow levels from the fig 12 those constraints related to β and λ function when the water availability reaches a special value the actual benefit when λ is 1 0 exceed the target benefit which results into over penalty loss and then it is constrained by maximum penalty loss constraints this also disclosed that higher penalty loss risk and allowable exposure risk level of benefit lead to higher water allocation fig 13 shows that economic benefit increases as p value varies across its low medium and high levels under the impact of β and vice versa besides combination of p and λ has similar interactive effect on economic benefit with combination of p and β but the increasing amplitude of the former is bigger than that of the latter this lies in reason that the mutual restrictions amid water availability penalty and actual benefit under combination of p and β is smaller than that for combination of p and λ the combination of β and λ has no effect on economic benefit which is caused by the limited water availability table 7 illustrates that p has the largest main effect of 0 066 0 090 109m3 0 033 0 055 109m3 and 0 011 0 023 109m3 on water allocation under high medium and low flow levels respectively the λ has the largest main effect of 0 053 0 062 109 yuan on economic benefit in addition combination of p and λ has a highest interactive effect on water allocation under high flow level and p and β have the greatest interactive effect on economic benefit specially except for p other parameters and interactive parameters have no effect on water allocation under medium and low flow levels it indicates that the higher water availability violation risk the higher penalty loss risk level and higher exposure risk level of benefit result in the increased water allocation and economic benefit however the influence degree of interactive parameters on water allocation and economic benefit is slighter than that of individual parameter thus the tradeoff between water allocation and economic benefit based on risk controls in decision making processes could generate more robust water allocation schemes and improve the robustness of decision making based on results calculated by rfitswmp model numbers of findings can be disclosed as follows a the total water allocation under the case that p is 0 05 and β is 0 5 and λ is 0 for high flow level is smallest where it corresponds to lower economic benefit and higher reliability and b the biggest total water allocation when p takes 0 2 and β is 1 and λ values1 for high flow level occur where it results into highest expected economic and lower reliability and 3 the water allocation and economic benefit under other risk scenarios and other flow levels are between above two scenarios 4 the water allocation and economic benefit have similar variation pattern with the change of risk parameters the managers could balance the relationship amid water allocation risk and economic benefit based on above findings if managers desires to get higher economic benefit they might afford higher water shortage penalty loss risks which is suitable for optimistic managers by contrary the pessimistic managers could choose the water allocation scheme corresponding to lower economic benefit and lower water shortage and penalty loss risk 4 4 the comparison between rfitswmp model and actual water allocation the actual water allocation is shown in table 8 the actual water allocation falls in the interval solution obtained from rfitswmp model compared with the actual water allocation the rfitswmp model has following advantages 1 it provides more robust solution by covering more water allocation schemes with consideration of risk levels 2 it generates different water allocation plans for different annual hydrological conditions by introducing the occurrence probabilities of flow levels 4 5 the comparison fitswmp model and rfitswmp model the rfitswmp model can be transformed into a fuzzy boundary interval two stage stochastic water resources management fitswmp model when there is no risk control measurement in other words the fitswmp model is a special case of rfitswmp model generally speaking the total water allocation of fitswmp model is conservative than that of the rfitswmp model this is because the total water availability of fitswmp model is lesser than the rfitswmp model as the latter considers water availability violation risk besides the economic benefit of fitswmp model falls in the intervals obtained from rfitswmp model under 27 risk control scenarios which indicates that the developed model has more robustness and that decision makers could choose the optimal water allocation schemes according to their own risk attitudes 5 conclusion in this study a risk based fuzzy boundary interval two stage stochastic water resources management programming rfitswmp approach is proposed for water consumption structure optimization the proposed approach integrates three risk control methods including chance constrained programming fuzzy random value at risk and exposure risk of benefit with an inexact water resources management model the case study of heihe river basin for optimization of water allocation for primary industry secondary industry tertiary industry and ecological sector shows the proposed model can be a reliable and effective tool the results disclosed that 1 the individual risk parameters i e p β and λ have different impact on optimal water allocation schemes in each subarea and the higher risk levels correspond to higher water shortage penalty loss and benefit value at risk but higher economic benefit 2 higher economic benefit is associated with increased individual risk parameter and risk levels 3 economic benefit is affected by of risk parameters combination and it is a solution with consideration of the interactions of regular benefit penalty lose and actual benefit it is demonstrated that the rfitswmp model is more robust and applicable for addressing the water allocation optimization problems however in practical applications water managers may face with the interactions among multiple objectives during water resources allocation therefore more robust optimization techniques that could deal with multiple interactive uncertainties and complexities should be further integrated into the rfitswmp framework in the future research credit authorship contribution statement youzhi wang data curation methodology writing original draft zhong li writing review

5843,nitrous oxide n2o is one of major potent long lived atmospheric greenhouse gases ghgs with a global warming potential of approximately 300 times that of carbon dioxide co2 over a 100 year timespan to date only several studies have explored the contribution of n2o emission from aquaculture systems to global emission but with large uncertainty in this study the spatiotemporal distribution of dissolved n2o concentrations along the water column within ponds and the n2o fluxes over the whole annual cycle were determined in the shrimp ponds in the min river estuary southeast china our results showed that n2o concentrations did not differ among sampling depths but varied significantly among sampling dates the temporal variation of n2o concentration was significantly correlated with the concentrations of n nh4 and total dissolved nitrogen the one year study found an annual mean n2o emission of 57 63 μg n2o m 2 h 1 that was equivalent to an annual emission of 504 9 mg n2o m 2 yr 1 demonstrating the aquaculture ponds as an important source of atmospheric n2o the n2o fluxes during the non aquaculture period were one to three orders larger than those in the aquaculture period and accounted for approximately 97 of the annual total emissions from aquaculture ponds our results showed that the n2o emission during the non aquaculture period should not be overlooked owing to its marked contribution to the annual n2o budget in mariculture ponds further studies on n2o production dynamics including the abundance and activity of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in coastal aquaculture ponds are needed to improve our understanding of n2o biogeochemical cycle and facilitate strategies to reduce n2o emission keywords nitrous oxide annual emissions non aquaculture period mariculture ponds subtropical estuary 1 introduction the increasing worldwide concern over global climate change and its effects on environment and human well beings calls for a better understanding of the magnitude of global greenhouse gas ghg emissions tong et al 2010 yang and flower 2012 nitrous oxide n2o is one of major potent long lived atmospheric ghgs that has a global warming potential gwp of approximately 300 times that of carbon dioxide co2 on a mass basis over a 100 year time horizon hu et al 2012 ipcc 2013 global atmospheric n2o concentration was reported to be 329 9 0 1 ppbv in 2017 having increased steadily by approximately 121 since the industrial revolution world meteorological organization 2018 quantifying the potential source strength of various ecosystems has become one of the top priorities for predicting future n2o emission and climate change agricultural ecosystem is considered to be the primary anthropogenic source of n2o emission liebig et al 2005 mccarl and schneider 2001 smith et al 2008 as an indispensable part of global agriculture aquaculture systems e g aquaculture wetlands aquaculture ponds have gained much attention in recent years due to their increasing area fao 2017 and significant contribution to atmospheric n2o level hu et al 2012 2014 paudel et al 2015 wu et al 2018a b yang et al 2015 yogev et al 2018 williams and crutzen 2010 estimated that n2o emissions from aquaculture systems amounted to 0 09 tg in 2008 accounting for approximately 0 33 of global n2o emissions yuan et al 2019 estimated that freshwater aquaculture systems could annually emit n2o at a rate of 0 367 tg hu et al 2012 further estimated that aquaculture systems could contribute up to 5 72 0 60 tg of anthropogenic n2o n emission by 2030 assuming an annual growth rate of the aquaculture industry of about 7 10 although these studies have explored the contribution of aquaculture systems to global n2o budgets these estimates are still highly uncertain due to the small available data up to now compared to total area of seas the area of global aquaculture is relatively small with the further rapid growth of world population and demand of sea food protein the development of global aquaculture will accelerate in the next decades particularly in developing countries in addition considering the local impact of greenhouse gas emission and the consequence of environmental change more field measurements in typical aquaculture systems are essential to provide more accurate large scale assessments of n2o emissions from aquaculture systems at the global scale the total surface area of global aquaculture ponds is estimated to be 110 832 km2 verdegem and bosma 2009 to date some efforts have been made on characterizing n2o fluxes across the water air interface and their influencing factors in aquaculture ponds wetland paudel et al 2015 yogev et al 2018 especially in china hu et al 2013 2014 wu et al 2018b yang et al 2015 however the majority of these existing studies of n2o fluxes have focused on freshwater aquaculture ponds but not mariculture brackish ponds according to the statistical data maintained by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations the total area of global mariculture ponds is found to be 23 332 km2 verdegem and bosma 2009 china is an important international player in the mariculture industry contributing to more than 17 of the world s mariculture volume and approximately a third of the global production value in 2014 fao 2017 land based aquaculture shrimp pond is one of the dominant approaches of mariculture production with a wide distribution along the coastal regions of china yang et al 2017a the aquaculture ponds are semi artificial ecosystems which are often managed during the aquaculture period by stocking feeding aeration harvesting and others annual drainage is a typical management activity that is practiced by the operators during the non culture period after harvest as a way to export aquaculture effluent accelerate aerobic decomposition of sediment and avoid eutrophication herbeck et al 2013 molnar et al 2013 drainage activities can cause large changes in hydrology nutrient cycling and sediment physicochemical properties yang et al 2018 which might in turn strongly affect the production and emissions of n2o yet the potential contribution of fluxes during the non aquaculture period to the annual n2o emissions from shrimp aquaculture ponds remains poorly understood in order to fill these knowledge gaps field measurements of n2o fluxes over a complete annual cycle were conducted at three active aquaculture shrimp ponds the main objectives of this study were to 1 determine the magnitude of n2o fluxes from mariculture shrimp ponds during the aquaculture and non aquaculture periods 2 characterize the spatial and temporal variation of dissolved n2o concentrations during the aquaculture period among different sampling depths and dates and 3 examine the dependence of temporal changes in n2o fluxes on water and soil sediment parameters overall this research would shed light on the role of mariculture shrimp ponds in the national anthropogenic n2o budget in china the conversion from salt marsh to aquaculture greatly changed the biogeochemical cycle in the system including the n2o emission the results of the present study will provide the scientific basis for the development of global biogeochemical models and national ghg inventories through characterizing n2o emission from the extensive shrimp ponds in the tropical and subtropical coastal zones 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the min river estuary in southeast china with measurement sites located at the central western part of the shanyutan wetland 26 00 36 26 03 42 n 119 34 12 119 40 40 e fig 1 the shanyutan wetland is the largest tidal wetland ca 3120 ha in the min river estuary the study area is characterized by a typically subtropical monsoon climate with an annual mean temperature of 19 6 c and precipitation of 1350 mm tong et al 2010 the tides at the min river estuary are typically semidiurnal such that the soil surface is generally submerged for approximately 7 h over a 24 h cycle tong et al 2010 at other times the soil surface was exposed to air intrazonal tidal soil and salt soil dominate the area and the main vegetation types include the native cyperus malaccensis shichito matgrass and phragmites australis common reed as well as the invasive spartina alterniflora smooth cordgrass conversion of the tidal marsh ecosystem was performed in the shanyutan wetland in recent years and almost all of the converted lands were used as aquaculture ponds yang et al 2017a shrimp ponds at the shanyutan wetland in the min river estuary were constructed in 2012 by removing the original marsh vegetation and re profiling the bunds with steep slopes 2 2 shrimp pond system and management aquaculture shrimp pond is one of the dominant landscapes at the shanyutan wetland of the min river estuary the aquacultural production cycle usually starts in june and ends in november with only one single crop of shrimps litopenaeus vannamei being produced on an annual cycle yang et al 2017b prior to shrimp production the ponds were filled with sea water from the adjacent estuary through a submerged pump the water depth in these shrimp ponds ranged from 1 1 to 1 8 m during the aquaculture period the ponds water was not exchanged during the rearing cycle and was added only to replace the water lost from evaporation and seepage a commercial aquatic feed pellet manufactured by hangsheng and tianma chia tai feed co ltd hangsheng and tianma fujian china was fed to the shrimps twice per day 07 00 am and 16 00 pm with the feeding rate determined according to the manufacturer s instructions the paddlewheel aerators were operated four times per day at 07 00 09 00 12 00 14 00 18 00 20 00 and 00 00 03 00 local standard time respectively in each pond to improve oxygen supply after shrimp harvesting water was discharged from the pond spillways further details about the shrimp pond system and the associated management practices can be found in earlier studies yang et al 2017b 2018 to assess the dynamics of n2o concentrations and fluxes in shrimp aquaculture ponds water sediment and gas samples were collected from three shrimp ponds at shanyutan wetland of the min river estuary fig 1 the basic details about the studied shrimp ponds in the wetland are given in table s1 2 3 measurement of the n2o concentration and flux 2 3 1 dissolved n2o concentration to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of dissolved n2o concentration during the aquaculture period fifteen sampling campaigns were conducted from june to november 2017 during each campaign three parallel sampling sites were deployed in each pond bubble free pond water was collected at 10 cm depth intervals from the surface to the bottom of the water column using a homemade water sampler water samples for the determination of dissolved n2o concentration was transferred quickly into 55 ml preweighted serum glass bottles with the excess water overflowing out of the bottle the bottle was then immediately sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and crimped with an aluminum cap borges et al 2018 cotovicz et al 2016 all the water samples were stored in a cooler with ice during transport back to the laboratory and were analyzed within 48 h of collection for n2o concentration measurements the headspace equilibrium technique was used to determine the concentrations of dissolved gases hu et al 2018 liu et al 2015b briefly approximately 25 ml of ultrahigh purity n2 gas 99 999 was injected into the sample bottle via a syringe to displace the water the bottles were then vigorously shaken for 30 min in an oscillator to achieve a complete equilibration between air and water phases liu et al 2015b after waiting for 30 min approximately 8 ml of the headspace gas was sampled and injected into 30 ml pre evacuated airtight gas sampling bags dalian delin gas packing co ltd china using 15 ml gas tight syringes equipped with three way stopcocks the headspace n2o concentrations were determined using gas chromatography gc 2014 shimadzu kyoto japan equipped with an electron capture detector ecd three different concentrations of standard n2o gas namely 0 3 0 4 and 1 0 ppm were used to calibrate the ecd of gas chromatograph the detection limit for n2o was 0 02 ppm and the relative standard deviation of n2o analyses was 5 0 the dissolved n2o concentration in water was calculated according to the measured headspace gas concentration using henry s law e g hu et al 2018 liu et al 2015b

2014 2017 and coastal wetland e g tong et al 2018 olsson et al 2015 wang et al 2018 the floating chambers and enclosed static chamber based techniques were adopted to measure n2o fluxes from aquaculture ponds in situ during the culture period from june to november 2017 and the non culture period from december 2017 to may 2018 the floating chambers were similar to those used by other researchers chuang et al 2017 lorke et al 2015 natchimuthu et al 2014 2017 the basin shaped opaque floating chambers had an area of 0 1 m2 and a volume of 5 2 l and were fitted with styrofoam floats on their sides each chamber was covered with a layer of sponge and aluminum foil to minimize internal heating by sunlight during gas sampling the enclosed static chambers were similar to those used in previous studies tong et al 2018 wang et al 2018 the enclosed static chamber had a polyvinyl chloride pvc bottom collar length width and height of 35 35 50 cm and an opaque pvc top chamber length width and height of 35 35 50 cm the bottom collar was permanently inserted into the pond sediment with 2 cm protruding above the sediment surface an electric fan was installed inside the enclosed static chamber to ensure slow but complete homogeneous air mixing during measurements on each sampling date measurements were conducted between 9 00 am and 11 00 am each n2o flux measurement was performed with four samples being collected at 15 min intervals over a 45 min period after chamber enclosure by using 60 ml plastic syringes equipped with three way stopcocks 50 ml samples were then immediately injected into 100 ml pre evacuated airtight gas sampling bags dalian delin gas packing co ltd china and transported to the laboratory for analysis by a gas chromatograph gc 2014 shimadzu kyoto japan within 48 hr after sampling the fluxes of n2o were calculated from the slope of the regression between gas concentration in the chamber headspace and time and expressed as μg m 2 h 1 the detailed information of n2o flux calculation process can be found in wu et al 2018 2 4 water and sediment sampling and analysis on each sampling date water sampling sites were selected at three different depths of the water column namely the surface layer approximately 10 cm below the surface the middle layer between the surface and bottom layers and the bottom layer approximately 5 cm above the surface sediment water samples were collected from the above mentioned depths using organic glass hydrophores and then transferred into 150 ml polyethylene bottles each water sample was preserved with approximately 0 2 ml of saturated hgcl2 solution to inhibit bacterial activity yang et al 2017b zhang et al 2013 and subsequently transported to the laboratory within 4 6 h and stored in a 4 c cooler for a week for physico chemical analysis approximately 50 ml of water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter biotrans nylon membranes and subsequently used to determine the concentrations of n nh4 total dissolved nitrogen tdn and total dissolved phosphorus tdp by a flow injection analyser skalar analytical san netherlands chlorophyll a chl a was extracted with acetone 90 v v in dark for 24 h after filtering 100 ml of water samples through gf f glass microfiber filters and then analyzed according to the method of zhang et al 2016 and yang et al 2017b triplicate sediment cores were collected in situ at a depth of 0 15 cm by a cylindrical metal corer diameter 6 cm during each sampling campaign in the non culture period and stored upright at 4 c in

pressure wind speed and precipitation were recorded at 30 min interval by an automatic meteorological station vantage pro 2 china installed at the min river estuary station of the china wetland ecosystem research network during each sampling campaign in the aquaculture period water temperature electrical conductivity ec ph and dissolved oxygen do at different depths were also determined in situ at each sampling site water temperature and ph were measured using a portable ph mv temperature meter system iq150 iq scientific instruments usa the ec and do were determined sing a 2265fs ec meter spectrum technologies usa and a multiparameter probe 550a ysi usa respectively during the non aquaculture period sediment temperature ec and ph at 15 cm depth were also measured in situ at each sampling site using the above mentioned portable instruments 2 6 statistical analysis data were tested for normality and homogeneity of variance two way analysis of variance anova was conducted to explore the effects of sampling depth culture time and their interactions on dissolved n2o concentrations or water quality parameters in shrimp ponds with ponds specified as the random term the independent sample t test was used to examine the differences in n2o fluxes between the aquaculture period and the non aquaculture period pearson correlation analysis was used to examine the relationships between n2o concentrations or fluxes and environmental variables the coefficient of variation cv of n2o concentration was determined by dividing the standard deviation of the variables measured at each sampling depth by the average value all statistical analyses were conducted using the spss statistical software package spss v 17 0 spss inc usa the results were considered significant at the 0 05 level and presented as mean 1 standard error statistical plots and conceptual diagrams were generated using originpro 7 5 originlab corp usa to determine the environmental variables which can predict n2o concentrations linear mixed effects models were created with pond id as a random effect using the nlme package of r holgerson 2015 fitted model also considered possible temporal autocorrelations by implementing a first order autoregressive correlation structure ar1 as n2o concentrations were repeatedly measured on different sampling dates for the model selection the stepaic function in the r package mass was used the model with the lowest aic value was selected and the relationship between the dependent variables and chosen predictors was further tested by type ii wald s test implemented in the r package car the dredge function in the r package mumin barton 2018 was also used and the output of best fitted models turned out to be similar to the above method following the multimodel inference method in this package the relative importances of predictor variables were also determined the relative importance for the predictor variables was then calculated by summing the akaike weights of each model containing that variable values 1 and a maximum value of 1 indicates the variable was computed in all models bieber et al 2014 the explained variances by the final model and by each best predictor i e conditional r2 values were then calculated following the method proposed by nakagawa and schielzeth 2013 3 results 3 1 water sediment parameters and meteorological parameters details of the temporal variations in water parameters from the shrimp ponds during the culture period are shown in fig 2 briefly physico chemical properties of pond water varied significantly among sampling dates p 0 01 but they did not differ significantly between depths except for do p 0 05 table s2 the mean n nh4 concentration in shrimp ponds water over the aquaculture period ranged between 0 1 and 1 2 mg l 1 which increased firstly and decreased later with time fig 2e minimum average water tdn was recorded in july at shrimp ponds 0 2 mg l 1 and reached maximum average values in november 1 8 mg l 1 fig 2f the average tdp and chl a concentrations increased gradually with time fig 2g and 2 h ranging from 0 1 to 0 3 mg l 1 and from 17 3 to 550 3 µg l 1 respectively the variations in sediment parameters from the shrimp ponds during the non aquaculture period are shown in fig s1 overall sediment temperature increased gradually with time while the tn and smc decreased gradually during the same period details of the monthly variations in meteorological data e g air temperature air pressure wind speed and precipitation were reported previously fig s2 yang et al 2019 3 2 water dissolved n2o concentrations and n2o emissions fluxes dissolved n2o concentrations and saturation of the shrimp ponds varied between 6 61 0 02 and 10 18 0 02 nmol l 1 fig 3 and 143 25 0 87 and 335 67 0 74 respectively the concentrations of n2o did not differ significantly with sampling depth fdf 14 0 15 p 0 05 but concentrations varied significantly by sampling dates fdf 14 7 75 p 0 01 high n2o concentrations occurred in june and september while low concentrations appeared in july and august fig 3 n2o fluxes from the shrimp ponds showed distinct temporal variation fig 4 during the aquaculture period the n2o fluxes ranged between 0 85 0 09 july and 12 01 9 49 μg m 2 h 1 october fig 4 during the non aquaculture period from november to june the n2o fluxes ranged between 0 73 0 27 and 214 08 31 32 μg m 2 h 1 which showed an increasing trend with time fig 4 the mean n2o fluxes in the ponds during the non aquaculture period was 112 43 μg m 2 h 1 which was significantly higher than that in the aquaculture period of 3 16 μg m 2 h 1 p 0 01 3 3 relationship between n2o concentrations or fluxes and environmental variables pearson correlation analysis showed that n2o concentrations in the shrimp ponds were significantly correlated with n nh4 and tdn p 0 01 table 1 and fig 5 as of water parameters the mixed effects models showed that n2o concentrations were best explained by a positive relationship with tdn table 2 which explained 22 6 of the temporal variations during the aquaculture period the temporal patterns of n2o emission fluxes from the shrimp ponds showed significantly positive correlation with wind speed atmospheric pressure water n nh4 and tdn concentration p 0 05 or p 0 01 table 1 and fig 5 respectively during the non aquaculture period the temporal patterns of n2o emission fluxes from the shrimp ponds showed significantly positive correlation with sediment temperature p 0 05 table 1 and negative correlation with smc p 0 01 table 1 4 discussion 4 1 role of nitrification and denitrification in the n2o production in the shrimp pond it has been reported that nitrification denitrification coupled nitrification denitrification and nitrifier denitrification are responsible for n2o emissions beaulieu et al 2011 hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 marty et al 2011 smith and zimmerman 1981 shi et al 2017 wrage et al 2004 n2o is produced as both an intermediate during stepwise heterotrophic no3 reduction denitrification and a by product during autotrophic oxidation of ammonia to no3 nitrification it can also be consumed during complete denitrification n2o reduction to n2 butterbach bahl et al 2013 the relative contributions of nitrification and denitrification to n2o emissions are dependent on organic matter availability and oxygen content butterbach bahl et al 2013 in general higher nitrate n no3 and nitrite n no2 concentrations can accelerate nitrifier denitrification and hydroxylamine decomposition which are largely responsible for n2o production in sediment and the subsequent transfer murray et al 2015 relatively higher n nh4 concentration can promote n2o production in nitrification either in the sediment or water column barnes et al 2011 wang et al 2015b however denitrification is favorable in reducing and anoxic conditions therefore the relationships between n2o concentration or fluxes and do n nox e g n no3 and n nh4 concentrations could provide valuable information about the main pathway of n2o production in aquatic environment garnier et al 2009 mengis et al 1996 pakulski et al 2000 wang et al 2009 our results suggested a weak and negative correlation between n2o concentrations and do table 1 with oxygen contents being consistently high in the range of 5 20 mg l 1 thus denitrification may not be the primary pathway of n2o production in our aquaculture ponds liu et al 2011 found that n2o concentration in reservoirs was positively correlated with n nh4 and n no3 and n2o production was correlated with apparent oxygen utilization indicating that nitrification was the dominant process responsible for n2o production in the reservoirs similar results were also reported in the riverine and estuarine areas barnard et al 2005 gribsholt et al 2005 wang et al 2015a yu et al 2013 many studies suggest that nitrification may become the primary pathway of n2o production in environments with rich supply of nh4 and oxygen barnard et al 2005 gribsholt et al 2005 wang et al 2015a yu et al 2013 the concentrations of dissolved n no3 and n nh4 in the water column of our aquaculture ponds ranged from 0 01 to 0 50 mg l 1 and 0 11 to 1 24 mg l 1 respectively the mean n nh4 concentration in the shrimp ponds 0 44 0 16 mg l 1 was approximately six times of n no3 0 08 0 04 mg l 1 n2o concentration showed a significant and positive correlation with n nh4 concentration during the aquaculture period p 0 01 fig 5a and table 1 furthermore the high oxygen level in water column 5 20 mg l 1 might also enhance anaerobic nh4 oxidation resulting in a limited denitrification rate these results together indicated that nitrification may be the primary pathway responsible for the n2o production in our aquaculture ponds further tdn n nox n nh4 showed a stronger relationship with the n2o concentrations p 0 01 r 2 0 32 fig 5b indicating that a coupled nitrification denitrification played a certain role in n2o production in our sampled ponds during the aquaculture period similar relationship between the tdn and n2o production was also found in river studies he et al 2017 wang et al 2015b 4 2 spatiotemporal variation in water dissolved n2o concentrations large vertical variations in dissolved co2 and ch4 concentration along the water column have also been widely reported in the different aquatic ecosystems such as reservoirs e g gerardo nieto et al 2017 wang et al 2011 2015 lakes e g bastviken et al 2008 gerardo nieto et al 2017 martinez cruz et al 2015 and ocean e g gülzow et al 2014 sierra et al 2017 to the best of our knowledge such information is limited for dissolved n2o concentration in the current research the small spatial scale variations in n2o concentration with water depths within shrimp ponds were investigated it was assumed that n2o concentration in the ponds would vary significantly along the water column due to the differences in do concentration however an interesting finding of this study was ponds n2o concentration had less change along the water column during each campaign p 0 05 fig 6 the coefficient of variation of n2o concentration with water depths across all sampling dates ranged between 1 5 and 8 2 the small spatial variation of n2o concentration might be related to the pond water with a well mixed condition generally speaking the coastal shrimp ponds are characterized by being small 0 5 ha and shallow 1 2 1 6 m and aeration activities occur frequently for improving the oxygen supply in addition the wind speed is generally high in estuary areas thus the pond water was well mixed by the combined wind disturbance and aeration activity which in turn will cause similar concentration of the n2o with little spatial variation in the water column at the month scale the mean dissolved n2o concentrations in the ponds showed some variation between the different sampling campaigns fig 3 with a relatively higher concentration in june and september seasonal variations in dissolved n2o have been reported in rivers and reservoirs burgos et al 2015 cole and caraco 2001 he et al 2017 hu et al 2018 musenze et al 2014 rajkumar et al 2008 wang et al 2015b vidon et al 2015 temperature is generally considered as the most important driver of the seasonal variations of n2o concentrations due to its stimulation of microbial activity beaulieu et al 2010 harrison and matson 2003 he et al 2017 hu et al 2018 however no any significant relationship between water temperature and n2o concentration p 0 05 tale 1 was found in the present study implying that temperature was not the main factors driving the change in n2o concentration in our research area among the environmental variables only water n nh4 and tdn concentrations exhibited a largely similar seasonal trend with n2o concentration fig 2e 2f and fig 3 furthermore water n nh4 and tdn concentrations were significantly correlated with dissolved n2o concentrations p 0 01 fig 5 and table 1 these results implied that nitrogen substrate supply was an important factor influencing the change in n2o concentration in shrimp ponds similarly changes in nitrogen substrate concentrations e g n no3 n nh4 and tdn controlled n2o in nitrogen enriched rivers streams and estuaries e g beaulieu et al 2008 hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 mccrackin and elser 2010 robinson et al 1998 silvennoinen et al 2008 yang et al 2011 the mechanisms of nitrogen substrate on n2o concentrations could be attributed mainly to high nitrogen substrate enhancing nitrification or denitrification rate of microorganism which in turn results in higher n2o yields liu et al 2011a hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 hu et al 2018 wang et al 2015a 2017 wu et al 2018b 4 3 temporal variation in n2o emission fluxes over the aquaculture period n2o fluxes showed significantly temporal variation with relatively higher fluxes in september and october fig 4 large temporal variation in n2o fluxes was also found in water bodies of the agricultural watersheds beaulieu et al 2008 hama aziz et al 2017 wu et al 2018a xiao et al 2019 corresponding to temporal variation in n loads through agricultural leaching and runoff in the present study the studied ponds were maintained through daily feed supply to produce aquatic animals where high bait supply occurred during the shrimp vigorous growth period from august to october therefore temporal differences in n inputs associated with management practices would incur the seasonal pattern of n2o fluxes from aquaculture shrimp ponds this assumption was supported by the significantly positive relationships between water nitrogen substrate concentrations e g n nh4 and tdn and n2o fluxes p 0 01 table 1 in addition previous studies have shown that high wind speed would enhance gas transfer velocity across the air water interface ultimately resulting in a higher greenhouse gas efflux e g bates et al 1998 hu et al 2018 musenze et al 2014 nemoto et al 2009 in accordance with the measured data of automatic meteorological station at the min river estuary high wind speed frequently occurred during the aquaculture period from september to november with the instantaneous average wind speed up to 5 m s 1 this study also found a significantly positive relationship between n2o efflux and wind speed p 0 01 table 1 these results showed that the temporal variation of n2o flux across the air water interface in the estuarine aquaculture ponds could also be governed by wind speed over the non aquaculture period n2o emissions from the estuarine shrimp ponds varied greatly with a significant increase trend with time fig 4 the temporal patterns of n2o fluxes was largely similar to that of sediment temperature p 0 05 fig s1a and table 1 implying that temperature was an important factor driving the change in n2o emission from the aquaculture ponds during the non aquaculture period the results are consistent with the previous studies in wetlands where higher n2o emission fluxes appeared with higher temperatures hirota et al 2007 sun et al 2013 wang et al 2018 the effects of sediment temperature could be related to the decomposition rate of sediment organic matter through its effect on microbial activity enzymes and metabolism and consequently regulates the rates of n2o production consumption and ultimately the emission into the atmosphere wang et al 2018 in general pond drainage after shrimp harvest is a typical management activity practiced by the farmers as an approach for exporting aquaculture effluent yang et al 2018 the exposure of sediment to air could cause a gradual decrease in sediment moisture due to strong evaporation which facilitated the penetration of oxygen into the sediment with a more aerobic environment nitrogen mineralization in the sediments could increase because of a faster decomposition rate under oxic conditions and an adequate supply of n substrate that can increase n2o production through nitrification and denitrification martikainen et al 1993 yang et al 2013 therefore the larger n2o emission observed during the non aquaculture period than the aquaculture period was to a large extent caused by the change in oxidation reduction status in ponds the increase in n2o emission fluxes from the ponds with time over the non aquaculture period fig 4 was also at least partly related to the gradual decline in sediment moisture fig s1e which provided a more favorable environment for n2o production the significantly negative correlation between n2o fluxes and sediment water content smc p 0 01 table 1 further supports the interpretation 4 4 aquaculture ponds as n2o emission hotspots during the non aquaculture period across the experimental year annual n2o emissions from the shrimp ponds totaled 504 9 mg n2o m 2 with an average flux of 57 6 μg m 2 h 1 the average n2o flux in our estuarine mariculture ponds was substantially smaller than that of xin an tang river xia et al 2013 and some reservoirs e g petit saut reservoir and fortuna reservoir in tropical and subtropical regions guérin et al 2008 wang et al 2017 however n2o fluxes in our researched mariculture ponds are comparable to fluxes in some n enriched rivers i e neuse river stow et al 2005 and adyar river rajkumar et al 2008 table 3 compared with other rivers and reservoirs table 3 our estuarine mariculture ponds had a larger n2o emission fluxes the n2o fluxes in our ponds were one to two orders of magnitude higher than those observed in most lakes in temperate subtropical and arctic regions e g hirota et al 2007 huttunen et al 2003 liu et al 2011b 2015b wang et al 2009 2017a furthermore the magnitudes of n2o emissions observed in our ponds were also substantially higher than those from the freshwater aquaculture systems e g li et al 2019 liu et al 2015a paudel et al 2015 the average n2o fluxes observed in our ponds were similar to those in inland fish aquaculture wetlands wu et al 2018b due to the growing demand of seafood in the world an increasing number of aquaculture ponds have been built and the total area of ponds had increased continually over the last decades in the coastal areas in china and other countries the total area has been 110 832 km2 verdegem and bosma 2009 in the next decades the expansion of aquaculture will accelerate because of rapid population increase particularly in the developing countries and the increasing needs of sea food protein especially unprecedented expansion of the global middle class regarding n2o emissions in coastal wetlands and estuarine waters table 3 the magnitude observed in our ponds was comparable to that in the bhitarkanika mangrove in india chauhan et al 2015 but substantially larger than those observed in most coastal wetlands in the temperate and subtropical regions e g martin et al 2018 liikanen et al 2009 sun et al 2013 welti et al 2017 xu et al 2014 yang and silver 2016 yuan et al 2015 in addition the mean n2o emission from our ponds was approximately 2 1 times higher than the average of 27 7 µg m 2 h 1 found in cyperus malaccensis marsh from the adjacent estuary wang et al 2018 and was also much larger than those from most other estuarine sites including the sado estuary gonçalves et al 2015 brisbane river estuary sturm et al 2017 guadalete river estuary burgos et al 2017 guadalquivir estuary huertas1 2018 and yangtze river estuary zhang et al 2010 furthermore the n2o emission from our ponds was markedly higher than the global median n2o flux reported in estuarine mangroves 41 8 μg m 2 h 1 salt marshes 14 9 μg m 2 h 1 estuarine open waters 33 4 μg m 2 h 1 and intertidal sediments 22 0 μg m 2 h 1 murray et al 2015 because of their large area and high n2o flux aquaculture ponds should not be overlooked as the potentially important sources of atmospheric n2o substantial n2o emissions from the aquaculture ponds occurred during the non aquaculture period accounting for approximately 97 of the annual total emission the results indicate that aquaculture ponds are n2o emission hotspots during the non aquaculture period fig 4 which may contribute to the higher n2o flux in our study compared with those in other lakes rivers and reservoirs table 3 4 5 limitations and future research similar to many studies there are some limitations in the current study n2o fluxes measurement and estimation were conducted in one estuary over the whole annual cycle in the present study the limited number of sampling sites might cause a lack of adequate spatiotemporal representations moreover n2o fluxes in the aquatic ecosystems varied greatly in diurnal cycle e g laursen and seitzinger 2004 wu et al 2018a yang et al 2011 in spite of no direct measurement of day night pattern of n2o fluxes in the current study a significantly diurnal variation can also appear in our research area therefore future research should cover more sites with a greater frequency to better quantify the magnitude of n2o fluxes at different temporal scale e g diurnal seasonal and interannual scales meanwhile some agricultural practices such as aeration and feeding and aquaculture type could affect n2o emissions from aquaculture ponds however the measurements of this study were limited to a typical estuary and stocking density focused on a very specific selection of species consequently when the data are scaled up from local to regional level may expand the estimation uncertainty to obtain a clearer and more precise picture of the national and global n2o emissions from mariculture ponds therefore more than one set of in situ direct measurements are highly needed by taking various factors into consideration such as regional climate aquaculture pond type and different kinds of aquaculture management practice furthermore this study examined only n2o emissions and basic environmental factors in field while the contribution of n2o production and consumption and microbial abundance and activity nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria were lacking thus detailed investigation of the microbial processes driving the n2o biogeochemical process in coastal mariculture ponds should receive more attention in future 5 conclusions our results demonstrated that subtropical mariculture shrimp ponds had much higher n2o emission as compared with others aquatic ecosystems such as lakes reservoirs and rivers the estuarine mariculture ponds were an important source of atmospheric n2o with strong temporal variations n2o emission during the non aquaculture phase was much larger than that in aquaculture phase the dissolved n2o concentrations in shrimp ponds varied considerably during the aquaculture phase among different sampling dates the temporal variation of n2o concentrations in the ponds closely followed the changes in the concentrations of nitrogen substrates e g n nh4 and tdn further studies on n2o production and consumption dynamics within maricultural ponds will improve our understanding of the n2o biogeochemistry and facilitate the development of strategies for reducing n2o emissions credit authorship contribution

5843,nitrous oxide n2o is one of major potent long lived atmospheric greenhouse gases ghgs with a global warming potential of approximately 300 times that of carbon dioxide co2 over a 100 year timespan to date only several studies have explored the contribution of n2o emission from aquaculture systems to global emission but with large uncertainty in this study the spatiotemporal distribution of dissolved n2o concentrations along the water column within ponds and the n2o fluxes over the whole annual cycle were determined in the shrimp ponds in the min river estuary southeast china our results showed that n2o concentrations did not differ among sampling depths but varied significantly among sampling dates the temporal variation of n2o concentration was significantly correlated with the concentrations of n nh4 and total dissolved nitrogen the one year study found an annual mean n2o emission of 57 63 μg n2o m 2 h 1 that was equivalent to an annual emission of 504 9 mg n2o m 2 yr 1 demonstrating the aquaculture ponds as an important source of atmospheric n2o the n2o fluxes during the non aquaculture period were one to three orders larger than those in the aquaculture period and accounted for approximately 97 of the annual total emissions from aquaculture ponds our results showed that the n2o emission during the non aquaculture period should not be overlooked owing to its marked contribution to the annual n2o budget in mariculture ponds further studies on n2o production dynamics including the abundance and activity of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in coastal aquaculture ponds are needed to improve our understanding of n2o biogeochemical cycle and facilitate strategies to reduce n2o emission keywords nitrous oxide annual emissions non

better understanding of the magnitude of global greenhouse gas ghg emissions tong et al 2010 yang and flower 2012 nitrous oxide n2o is one of major potent long lived atmospheric ghgs that has a global warming potential gwp of approximately 300 times that of carbon dioxide co2 on a mass basis over a 100 year time horizon hu et al 2012 ipcc 2013 global atmospheric n2o concentration was reported to be 329 9 0 1 ppbv in 2017 having increased steadily by approximately 121 since the industrial revolution world meteorological organization 2018 quantifying the potential source strength of various ecosystems has become one of the top priorities for predicting future n2o emission and climate change agricultural ecosystem is considered to be the primary anthropogenic source of n2o emission liebig et al 2005 mccarl and schneider 2001 smith et al 2008 as an indispensable part of global agriculture aquaculture systems e g aquaculture wetlands aquaculture ponds have gained much attention in recent years due to their increasing area fao 2017 and significant contribution to atmospheric n2o level hu et al 2012 2014 paudel et al 2015 wu et al 2018a b yang et al 2015 yogev et al 2018 williams and crutzen 2010 estimated that n2o emissions from aquaculture systems amounted to 0 09 tg in 2008 accounting for approximately 0 33 of global n2o emissions yuan et al 2019 estimated that freshwater aquaculture systems could annually emit n2o at a rate of 0 367 tg hu et al 2012 further estimated that aquaculture systems could contribute up to 5 72 0 60 tg of anthropogenic n2o n emission by 2030 assuming an annual growth rate of the aquaculture industry of about 7 10 although these studies have explored the contribution of aquaculture systems to global n2o budgets these estimates are still highly uncertain due to the small available data up to now compared to total area of seas the area of global aquaculture is relatively small with the further rapid growth of world population and demand of sea food protein the development of global aquaculture will accelerate in the next decades particularly in developing countries in addition considering the local impact of greenhouse gas emission and the consequence of environmental change more field measurements in typical aquaculture systems are essential to provide more accurate large scale assessments of n2o emissions from aquaculture systems at the global scale the total surface area of global aquaculture ponds is estimated to be 110 832 km2 verdegem and bosma 2009 to date some efforts have been made on characterizing n2o fluxes across the water air interface and their influencing factors in aquaculture ponds wetland paudel et al 2015 yogev et al 2018 especially in china hu et al 2013 2014 wu et al 2018b yang et al 2015 however the majority of these existing studies of n2o fluxes have focused on freshwater aquaculture ponds but not mariculture brackish ponds according to the statistical data maintained by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations the total area of global mariculture ponds is found to be 23 332 km2 verdegem and bosma 2009 china is an important international player in the mariculture industry contributing to more than 17 of the world s mariculture volume and approximately a third of the global production value in 2014 fao 2017 land based aquaculture shrimp pond is one of the dominant approaches of mariculture production with a wide distribution along the coastal regions of china yang et al 2017a the aquaculture ponds are semi artificial ecosystems which are often managed during the aquaculture period by stocking feeding aeration harvesting and others annual drainage is a typical management activity that is practiced by the operators during the non culture period after harvest as a way to export aquaculture effluent accelerate aerobic decomposition of sediment and avoid eutrophication herbeck et al 2013 molnar et al 2013 drainage activities can cause large changes in hydrology nutrient cycling and sediment physicochemical properties yang et al 2018 which might in turn strongly affect the production and emissions of n2o yet the potential contribution of fluxes during the non aquaculture period to the annual n2o emissions from shrimp aquaculture ponds remains poorly understood in order to fill these knowledge gaps field measurements of n2o fluxes over a complete annual cycle were conducted at three active aquaculture shrimp ponds the main objectives of this study were to 1 determine the magnitude of n2o fluxes from mariculture shrimp ponds during the aquaculture and non aquaculture periods 2 characterize the spatial and temporal variation of dissolved n2o concentrations during the aquaculture period among different sampling depths and dates and 3 examine the dependence of temporal changes in n2o fluxes on water and soil sediment parameters overall this research would shed light on the role of mariculture shrimp ponds in the national anthropogenic n2o budget in china the conversion from salt marsh to aquaculture greatly changed the biogeochemical cycle in the system including the n2o emission the results of the present study will provide the scientific basis for the development of global biogeochemical models and national ghg inventories through characterizing n2o emission from the extensive shrimp ponds in the tropical and subtropical coastal zones 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the min river estuary in southeast china with measurement sites located at the central western part of the shanyutan wetland 26 00 36 26 03 42 n 119 34 12 119 40 40 e fig 1 the shanyutan wetland is the largest tidal wetland ca 3120 ha in the min river estuary the study area is characterized by a typically subtropical monsoon climate with an annual mean temperature of 19 6 c and precipitation of 1350 mm tong et al 2010 the tides at the min river estuary are typically semidiurnal such that the soil surface is generally submerged for approximately 7 h over a 24 h cycle tong et al 2010 at other times the soil surface was exposed to air intrazonal tidal soil and salt soil dominate the area and the main vegetation types include the native cyperus malaccensis shichito matgrass and phragmites australis common reed as well as the invasive spartina alterniflora smooth cordgrass conversion of the tidal marsh ecosystem was performed in the shanyutan wetland in recent years and almost all of the converted lands were used as aquaculture ponds yang et al 2017a shrimp ponds at the shanyutan wetland in the min river estuary were constructed in 2012 by removing the original marsh vegetation and re profiling the bunds with steep slopes 2 2 shrimp pond system and management aquaculture shrimp pond is one of the dominant landscapes at the shanyutan wetland of the min river estuary the aquacultural production cycle usually starts in june and ends in november with only one single crop of shrimps litopenaeus vannamei being produced on an annual cycle yang et al 2017b prior to shrimp production the ponds were filled with sea water from the adjacent estuary through a submerged pump the water depth in these shrimp ponds ranged from 1 1 to 1 8 m during the aquaculture period the ponds water was not exchanged during the rearing cycle and was added only to replace the water lost from evaporation and seepage a commercial aquatic feed pellet manufactured by hangsheng and tianma chia tai feed co ltd hangsheng and tianma fujian china was fed to the shrimps twice per day 07 00 am and 16 00 pm with the feeding rate determined according to the manufacturer s instructions the paddlewheel aerators were operated four times per day at 07 00 09 00 12 00 14 00 18 00 20 00 and 00 00 03 00 local standard time respectively in each pond to improve oxygen supply after shrimp harvesting water was discharged from the pond spillways further details about the shrimp pond system and the associated management practices can be found in earlier studies yang et al 2017b 2018 to assess the dynamics of n2o concentrations and fluxes in shrimp aquaculture ponds water sediment and gas samples were collected from three shrimp ponds at shanyutan wetland of the min river estuary fig 1 the basic details about the studied shrimp ponds in the wetland are given in table s1 2 3 measurement of the n2o concentration and flux 2 3 1 dissolved n2o concentration to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of dissolved n2o concentration during the aquaculture period fifteen sampling campaigns were conducted from june to november 2017 during each campaign three parallel sampling sites were deployed in each pond bubble free pond water was collected at 10 cm depth intervals from the surface to the bottom of the water column using a homemade water sampler water samples for the determination of dissolved n2o concentration was transferred quickly into 55 ml preweighted serum glass bottles with the excess water overflowing out of the bottle the bottle was then immediately sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and crimped with an aluminum cap borges et al 2018 cotovicz et al 2016 all the water samples were stored in a cooler with ice during transport back to the laboratory and were analyzed within 48 h of collection for n2o concentration measurements the headspace equilibrium technique was used to determine the concentrations of dissolved gases hu et al 2018 liu et al 2015b briefly approximately 25 ml of ultrahigh purity n2 gas 99 999 was injected into the sample bottle via a syringe to displace the water the bottles were then vigorously shaken for 30 min in an oscillator to achieve a complete equilibration between air and water phases liu et al 2015b after waiting for 30 min approximately 8 ml of the headspace gas was sampled and injected into 30 ml pre evacuated airtight gas sampling bags dalian delin gas packing co ltd china using 15 ml gas tight syringes equipped with three way stopcocks the headspace n2o concentrations were determined using gas chromatography gc 2014 shimadzu kyoto japan equipped with an electron capture detector ecd three different concentrations of standard n2o gas namely 0 3 0 4 and 1 0 ppm were used to calibrate the ecd of gas chromatograph the detection limit for n2o was 0 02 ppm and the relative standard deviation of n2o analyses was 5 0 the dissolved n2o concentration in water was calculated according to the measured headspace gas concentration using henry s law e g hu et al 2018 liu et al 2015b musenze et al 2014 and the constants of weiss and price 1980 based on the in situ water temperature water salinity and the headspace gas n2o concentration 2 3 2 n2o flux from direct measurement using chamber three replicate sites were established in each pond for n2o flux measurement similar to previous studies on ghg flux measurements in aquatic ecosystems e g lorke et al 2015 natchimuthu et al 2014 2017 and coastal wetland e g tong et al 2018 olsson et al 2015 wang et al 2018 the floating chambers and enclosed static chamber based techniques were adopted to measure n2o fluxes from aquaculture ponds in situ during the culture period from june to november 2017 and the non culture period from december 2017 to may 2018 the floating chambers were similar to those used by other researchers chuang et al 2017 lorke et al 2015 natchimuthu et al 2014 2017 the basin shaped opaque floating chambers had an area of 0 1 m2 and a volume of 5 2 l and were fitted with styrofoam floats on their sides each chamber was covered with a layer of sponge and aluminum foil to minimize internal heating by sunlight during gas sampling the enclosed static chambers were similar to those used in previous studies tong et al 2018 wang et al 2018 the enclosed static chamber had a polyvinyl chloride pvc bottom collar length width and height of 35 35 50 cm and an opaque pvc top chamber length width and height of 35 35 50 cm the bottom collar was permanently inserted into the pond sediment with 2 cm protruding above the sediment surface an electric fan was installed inside the enclosed static chamber to ensure slow but complete homogeneous air mixing during measurements on each sampling date measurements were conducted between 9 00 am and 11 00 am each n2o flux measurement was performed with four samples being collected at 15 min intervals over a 45 min period after chamber enclosure by using 60 ml plastic syringes equipped with three way stopcocks 50 ml samples were then immediately injected into 100 ml pre evacuated airtight gas sampling bags dalian delin gas packing co ltd china and transported to the laboratory for analysis by a gas chromatograph gc 2014 shimadzu kyoto japan within 48 hr after sampling the fluxes of n2o were calculated from the slope of the regression between gas concentration in the chamber headspace and time and expressed as μg m 2 h 1 the detailed information of n2o flux calculation process can be found in wu et al 2018 2 4 water and sediment sampling and analysis on each sampling date water sampling sites were selected at three different depths of the water column namely the surface layer approximately 10 cm below the surface the middle layer between the surface and bottom layers and the bottom layer approximately 5 cm above the surface sediment water samples were collected from the above mentioned depths using organic glass hydrophores and then transferred into 150 ml polyethylene bottles each water sample was preserved with approximately 0 2 ml of saturated hgcl2 solution to inhibit bacterial activity yang et al 2017b zhang et al 2013 and subsequently transported to the laboratory within 4 6 h and stored in a 4 c cooler for a week for physico chemical analysis approximately 50 ml of water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter biotrans nylon membranes and subsequently used to determine the concentrations of n nh4 total dissolved nitrogen tdn and total dissolved phosphorus tdp by a flow injection analyser skalar analytical san netherlands chlorophyll a chl a was extracted with acetone 90 v v in dark for 24 h after filtering 100 ml of water samples through gf f glass microfiber filters and then analyzed according to the method of zhang et al 2016 and yang et al 2017b triplicate sediment cores were collected in situ at a depth of 0 15 cm by a cylindrical metal corer diameter 6 cm during each sampling campaign in the non culture period and stored upright at 4 c in

and then grounded to fine powder for the analyses of total nitrogen tn content using an elemental analyzer elementar vario max cn germany 2 5 measurement of ancillary variables air temperature air pressure wind speed and precipitation were recorded at 30 min interval by an automatic meteorological station vantage pro 2 china installed at the min river estuary station of the china wetland ecosystem research network during each sampling campaign in the aquaculture period water temperature electrical conductivity ec ph and dissolved oxygen do at different depths were also determined in situ at each sampling site water temperature and ph were measured using a portable ph mv temperature meter system iq150 iq scientific instruments usa the ec and do were determined sing a 2265fs ec meter spectrum technologies usa and a multiparameter probe 550a ysi usa respectively during the non aquaculture period sediment temperature ec and ph at 15 cm depth were also measured in situ at each sampling site using the above mentioned portable instruments 2 6 statistical analysis data were tested for normality and homogeneity of variance two way analysis of variance anova was conducted to explore the effects of sampling depth culture time and their interactions on dissolved n2o concentrations or water quality parameters in shrimp ponds with ponds specified as the random term the independent sample t test was used to examine the differences in n2o fluxes between the aquaculture period and the non aquaculture period pearson correlation analysis was used to examine the relationships between n2o concentrations or fluxes and environmental variables the coefficient of variation cv of n2o concentration was determined by dividing the standard deviation of the variables measured at each sampling depth by the average value all statistical analyses were conducted using the spss statistical software package spss v 17 0 spss inc usa the results were considered significant at the 0 05 level and presented as mean 1 standard error statistical plots and conceptual diagrams were generated using originpro 7 5 originlab corp usa to determine the environmental variables which can predict n2o concentrations linear mixed effects models were created with pond id as a random effect using the nlme package of r holgerson 2015 fitted model also considered possible temporal autocorrelations by implementing a first order autoregressive correlation structure ar1 as n2o concentrations were repeatedly measured on different sampling dates for the model selection the stepaic function in the r package mass was used the model with the lowest aic value was selected and the relationship between the dependent variables and chosen predictors was further tested by type ii wald s test implemented in the r package car the dredge function in the r package mumin barton 2018 was also used and the output of best fitted models turned out to be similar to the above method following the multimodel inference method in this package the relative importances of predictor variables were also determined the relative importance for the predictor variables was then calculated by summing the akaike weights of each model containing that variable values 1 and a maximum value of 1 indicates the variable was computed in all models bieber et al 2014 the explained variances by the final model and by each best predictor i e conditional r2 values were then calculated following the method proposed by nakagawa and schielzeth 2013 3 results 3 1 water sediment parameters and meteorological parameters details of the temporal variations in water parameters from the shrimp ponds during the culture period are shown in fig 2 briefly physico chemical properties of pond water varied significantly among sampling dates p 0 01 but they did not differ significantly between depths except for do p 0 05 table s2 the mean n nh4 concentration in shrimp ponds water over the aquaculture period ranged between 0 1 and 1 2 mg l 1 which increased firstly and decreased later with time fig 2e minimum average water tdn was recorded in july at shrimp ponds 0 2 mg l 1 and reached maximum average values in november 1 8 mg l 1 fig 2f the average tdp and chl a concentrations increased gradually with time fig 2g and 2 h ranging from 0 1 to 0 3 mg l 1 and from 17 3 to 550 3 µg l 1 respectively the variations in sediment parameters from the shrimp ponds during the non aquaculture period are shown in fig s1 overall sediment temperature increased gradually with time while the tn and smc decreased gradually during the same period details of the monthly variations in meteorological data e g air temperature air pressure wind speed and precipitation were reported previously fig s2 yang et al 2019 3 2 water dissolved n2o concentrations and n2o emissions fluxes dissolved n2o concentrations and saturation of the shrimp ponds varied between 6 61 0 02 and 10 18 0 02 nmol l 1 fig 3 and 143 25 0 87 and 335 67 0 74 respectively the concentrations of n2o did not differ significantly with sampling depth fdf 14 0 15 p 0 05 but concentrations varied significantly by sampling dates fdf 14 7 75 p 0 01 high n2o concentrations occurred in june and september while low concentrations appeared in july and august fig 3 n2o fluxes from the shrimp ponds showed distinct temporal variation fig 4 during the aquaculture period the n2o fluxes ranged between 0 85 0 09 july and 12 01 9 49 μg m 2 h 1 october fig 4 during the non aquaculture period from november to june the n2o fluxes ranged between 0 73 0 27 and 214 08 31 32 μg m 2 h 1 which showed an increasing trend with time fig 4 the mean n2o fluxes in the ponds during the non aquaculture period was 112 43 μg m 2 h 1 which was significantly higher than that in the aquaculture period of 3 16 μg m 2 h 1 p 0 01 3 3 relationship between n2o concentrations or fluxes and environmental variables pearson correlation analysis showed that n2o concentrations in the shrimp ponds were significantly correlated with n nh4 and tdn p 0 01 table 1 and fig 5 as of water parameters the mixed effects models showed that n2o concentrations were best explained by a positive relationship with tdn table 2 which explained 22 6 of the temporal variations during the aquaculture period the temporal patterns of n2o emission fluxes from the shrimp ponds showed significantly positive correlation with wind speed atmospheric pressure water n nh4 and tdn concentration p 0 05 or p 0 01 table 1 and fig 5 respectively during the non aquaculture period the temporal patterns of n2o emission fluxes from the shrimp ponds showed significantly positive correlation with sediment temperature p 0 05 table 1 and negative correlation with smc p 0 01 table 1 4 discussion 4 1 role of nitrification and denitrification in the n2o production in the shrimp pond it has been reported that nitrification denitrification coupled nitrification denitrification and nitrifier denitrification are responsible for n2o emissions beaulieu et al 2011 hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 marty et al 2011 smith and zimmerman 1981 shi et al 2017 wrage et al 2004 n2o is produced as both an intermediate during stepwise heterotrophic no3 reduction denitrification and a by product during autotrophic oxidation of ammonia to no3 nitrification it can also be consumed during complete denitrification n2o reduction to n2 butterbach bahl et al 2013 the relative contributions of nitrification and denitrification to n2o emissions are dependent on organic matter availability and oxygen content butterbach bahl et al 2013 in general higher nitrate n no3 and nitrite n no2 concentrations can accelerate nitrifier denitrification and hydroxylamine decomposition which are largely responsible for n2o production in sediment and the subsequent transfer murray et al 2015 relatively higher n nh4 concentration can promote n2o production in nitrification either in the sediment or water column barnes et al 2011 wang et al 2015b however denitrification is favorable in reducing and anoxic conditions therefore the relationships between n2o concentration or fluxes and do n nox e g n no3 and n nh4 concentrations could provide valuable information about the main pathway of n2o production in aquatic environment garnier et al 2009 mengis et al 1996 pakulski et al 2000 wang et al 2009 our results suggested a weak and negative correlation between n2o concentrations and do table 1 with oxygen contents being consistently high in the range of 5 20 mg l 1 thus denitrification may not be the primary pathway of n2o production in our aquaculture ponds liu et al 2011 found that n2o concentration in reservoirs was positively correlated with n nh4 and n no3 and n2o production was correlated with apparent oxygen utilization indicating that nitrification was the dominant process responsible for n2o production in the reservoirs similar results were also reported in the riverine and estuarine areas barnard et al 2005 gribsholt et al 2005 wang et al 2015a yu et al 2013 many studies suggest that nitrification may become the primary pathway of n2o production in environments with rich supply of nh4 and oxygen barnard et al 2005 gribsholt et al 2005 wang et al 2015a yu et al 2013 the concentrations of dissolved n no3 and n nh4 in the water column of our aquaculture ponds ranged from 0 01 to 0 50 mg l 1 and 0 11 to 1 24 mg l 1 respectively the mean n nh4 concentration in the shrimp ponds 0 44 0 16 mg l 1 was approximately six times of n no3 0 08 0 04 mg l 1 n2o concentration showed a significant and positive correlation with n nh4 concentration during the aquaculture period p 0 01 fig 5a and table 1 furthermore the high oxygen level in water column 5 20 mg l 1 might also enhance anaerobic nh4 oxidation resulting in a limited denitrification rate these results together indicated that nitrification may be the primary pathway responsible for the n2o production in our aquaculture ponds further tdn n nox n nh4 showed a stronger relationship with the n2o concentrations p 0 01 r 2 0 32 fig 5b indicating that a coupled nitrification denitrification played a certain role in n2o production in our sampled ponds during the aquaculture period similar relationship between the tdn and n2o production was also found in river studies he et al 2017 wang et al 2015b 4 2 spatiotemporal variation in water dissolved n2o concentrations large vertical variations in dissolved co2 and ch4 concentration along the water column have also been widely reported in the different aquatic ecosystems such as reservoirs e g gerardo nieto et al 2017 wang et al 2011 2015 lakes e g bastviken et al 2008 gerardo nieto et al 2017 martinez cruz et al 2015 and ocean e g gülzow et al 2014 sierra et al 2017 to the best of our knowledge such information is limited for dissolved n2o concentration in the current research the small spatial scale variations in n2o concentration with water depths within shrimp ponds were investigated it was assumed that n2o concentration in the ponds would vary significantly along the water column due to the differences in do concentration however an interesting finding of this study was ponds n2o concentration had less change along the water column during each campaign p 0 05 fig 6 the coefficient of variation of n2o concentration with water depths across all sampling dates ranged between 1 5 and 8 2 the small spatial variation of n2o concentration might be related to the pond water with a well mixed condition generally speaking the coastal shrimp ponds are characterized by being small 0 5 ha and shallow 1 2 1 6 m and aeration activities occur frequently for improving the oxygen supply in addition the wind speed is generally high in estuary areas thus the pond water was well mixed by the combined wind disturbance and aeration activity which in turn will cause similar concentration of the n2o with little spatial variation in the water column at the month scale the mean dissolved n2o concentrations in the ponds showed some variation between the different sampling campaigns fig 3 with a relatively higher concentration in june and september seasonal variations in dissolved n2o have been reported in rivers and reservoirs burgos et al 2015 cole and caraco 2001 he et al 2017 hu et al 2018 musenze et al 2014 rajkumar et al 2008 wang et al 2015b vidon et al 2015 temperature is generally considered as the most important driver of the seasonal variations of n2o concentrations due to its stimulation of microbial activity beaulieu et al 2010 harrison and matson 2003 he et al 2017 hu et al 2018 however no any significant relationship between water temperature and n2o concentration p 0 05 tale 1 was found in the present study implying that temperature was not the main factors driving the change in n2o concentration in our research area among the environmental variables only water n nh4 and tdn concentrations exhibited a largely similar seasonal trend with n2o concentration fig 2e 2f and fig 3 furthermore water n nh4 and tdn concentrations were significantly correlated with dissolved n2o concentrations p 0 01 fig 5 and table 1 these results implied that nitrogen substrate supply was an important factor influencing the change in n2o concentration in shrimp ponds similarly changes in nitrogen substrate concentrations e g n no3 n nh4 and tdn controlled n2o in nitrogen enriched rivers streams and estuaries e g beaulieu et al 2008 hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 mccrackin and elser 2010 robinson et al 1998 silvennoinen et al 2008 yang et al 2011 the mechanisms of nitrogen substrate on n2o concentrations could be attributed mainly to high nitrogen substrate enhancing nitrification or denitrification rate of microorganism which in turn results in higher n2o yields liu et al 2011a hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 hu et al 2018 wang et al 2015a 2017 wu et al 2018b 4 3 temporal variation in n2o emission fluxes over the aquaculture period n2o fluxes showed significantly temporal variation with relatively higher fluxes in september and october fig 4 large temporal variation in n2o fluxes was also found in water bodies of the agricultural watersheds beaulieu et al 2008 hama aziz et al 2017 wu et al 2018a xiao et al 2019 corresponding to temporal variation in n loads through agricultural leaching and runoff in the present study the studied ponds were maintained through daily feed supply to produce aquatic animals where high bait supply occurred during the shrimp vigorous growth period from august to october therefore temporal differences in n inputs associated with management practices would incur the seasonal pattern of n2o fluxes from aquaculture shrimp ponds this assumption was supported by the significantly positive relationships between water nitrogen substrate concentrations e g n nh4 and tdn and n2o fluxes p 0 01 table 1 in addition previous studies have shown that high wind speed would enhance gas transfer velocity across the air water interface ultimately resulting in a higher greenhouse gas efflux e g bates et al 1998 hu et al 2018 musenze et al 2014 nemoto et al 2009 in accordance with the measured data of automatic meteorological station at the min river estuary high wind speed frequently occurred during the aquaculture period from september to november with the instantaneous average wind speed up to 5 m s 1 this study also found a significantly positive relationship between n2o efflux and wind speed p 0 01 table 1 these results showed that the temporal variation of n2o flux across the air water interface in the estuarine aquaculture ponds could also be governed by wind speed over the non aquaculture period n2o emissions from the estuarine shrimp ponds varied greatly with a significant increase trend with time fig 4 the temporal patterns of n2o fluxes was largely similar to that of sediment temperature p 0 05 fig s1a and table 1 implying that temperature was an important factor driving the change in n2o emission from the aquaculture ponds during the non aquaculture period the results are consistent with the previous studies in wetlands where higher n2o emission fluxes appeared with higher temperatures hirota et al 2007 sun et al 2013 wang et al 2018 the effects of sediment temperature could be related to the decomposition rate of sediment organic matter through its effect on microbial activity enzymes and metabolism and consequently regulates the rates of n2o production consumption and ultimately the emission into the atmosphere wang et al 2018 in general pond drainage after shrimp harvest is a typical management activity practiced by the farmers as an approach for exporting aquaculture effluent yang et al 2018 the exposure of sediment to air could cause a gradual decrease in sediment moisture due to strong evaporation which facilitated the penetration of oxygen into the sediment with a more aerobic environment nitrogen mineralization in the sediments could increase because of a faster decomposition rate under oxic conditions and an adequate supply of n substrate that can increase n2o production through nitrification and denitrification martikainen et al 1993 yang et al 2013 therefore the larger n2o emission observed during the non aquaculture period than the aquaculture period was to a large extent caused by the change in oxidation reduction status in ponds the increase in n2o emission fluxes from the ponds with time over the non aquaculture period fig 4 was also at least partly related to the gradual decline in sediment moisture fig s1e which provided a more favorable environment for n2o production the significantly negative correlation between n2o fluxes and sediment water content smc p 0 01 table 1 further supports the interpretation 4 4 aquaculture ponds as n2o emission hotspots during the non aquaculture period across the experimental year annual n2o emissions from the shrimp ponds totaled 504 9 mg n2o m 2 with an average flux of 57 6 μg m 2 h 1 the average n2o flux in our estuarine mariculture ponds was substantially smaller than that of xin an tang river xia et al 2013 and some reservoirs e g petit saut reservoir and fortuna reservoir in tropical and subtropical regions guérin et al 2008 wang et al 2017 however n2o fluxes in our researched mariculture ponds are comparable to fluxes in some n enriched rivers i e neuse river stow et al 2005 and adyar river rajkumar et al 2008 table 3 compared with other rivers and reservoirs table 3 our estuarine mariculture ponds had a larger n2o emission fluxes the n2o fluxes in our ponds were one to two orders of magnitude higher than those observed in most lakes in temperate subtropical and arctic regions e g hirota et al 2007 huttunen et al 2003 liu et al 2011b 2015b wang et al 2009 2017a furthermore the magnitudes of n2o emissions observed in our ponds were also substantially higher than those from the freshwater aquaculture systems e g li et al 2019 liu et al 2015a paudel et al 2015 the average n2o fluxes observed in our ponds were similar to those in inland fish aquaculture wetlands wu et al 2018b due to the growing demand of seafood in the world an increasing number of aquaculture ponds have been built and the total area of ponds had increased continually over the last decades in the coastal areas in china and other countries the total area has been 110 832 km2 verdegem and bosma 2009 in the next decades the expansion of aquaculture will accelerate because of rapid population increase particularly in the developing countries and the increasing needs of sea food protein especially unprecedented expansion of the global middle class regarding n2o emissions in coastal wetlands and estuarine waters table 3 the magnitude observed in our ponds was comparable to that in the bhitarkanika mangrove in india chauhan et al 2015 but substantially larger than those observed in most coastal wetlands in the temperate and subtropical regions e g martin et al 2018 liikanen et al 2009 sun et al 2013 welti et al 2017 xu et al 2014 yang and silver 2016 yuan et al 2015 in addition the mean n2o emission from our ponds was approximately 2 1 times higher than the average of 27 7 µg m 2 h 1 found in cyperus malaccensis marsh from the adjacent estuary wang et al 2018 and was also much larger than those from most other estuarine sites including the sado estuary gonçalves et al 2015 brisbane river estuary sturm et al 2017 guadalete river estuary burgos et al 2017 guadalquivir estuary huertas1 2018 and yangtze river estuary zhang et al 2010 furthermore the n2o emission from our ponds was markedly higher than the global median n2o flux reported in estuarine mangroves 41 8 μg m 2 h 1 salt marshes 14 9 μg m 2 h 1 estuarine open waters 33 4 μg m 2 h 1 and intertidal sediments 22 0 μg m 2 h 1 murray et al 2015 because of their large area and high n2o flux aquaculture ponds should not be overlooked as the potentially important sources of atmospheric n2o substantial n2o emissions from the aquaculture ponds occurred during the non aquaculture period accounting for approximately 97 of the annual total emission the results indicate that aquaculture ponds are n2o emission hotspots during the non aquaculture period fig 4 which may contribute to the higher n2o flux in our study compared with those in other lakes rivers and reservoirs table 3 4 5 limitations and future research similar to many studies there are some limitations in the current study n2o fluxes measurement and estimation were conducted in one estuary over the whole annual cycle in the present study the limited number of sampling sites might cause a lack of adequate spatiotemporal representations moreover n2o fluxes in the aquatic ecosystems varied greatly in diurnal cycle e g laursen and seitzinger 2004 wu et al 2018a yang et al 2011 in spite of no direct measurement of day night pattern of n2o fluxes in the current study a significantly diurnal variation can also appear in our research area therefore future research should cover more sites with a greater frequency to better quantify the magnitude of n2o fluxes at different temporal scale e g diurnal seasonal and interannual scales meanwhile some agricultural practices such as aeration and feeding and aquaculture type could affect n2o emissions from aquaculture ponds however the measurements of this study were limited to a typical estuary and stocking density focused on a very specific selection of species consequently when the data are scaled up from local to regional level may expand the estimation uncertainty to obtain a clearer and more precise picture of the national and global n2o emissions from mariculture ponds therefore more than one set of in situ direct measurements are highly needed by taking various factors into consideration such as regional climate aquaculture pond type and different kinds of aquaculture management practice furthermore this study examined only n2o emissions and basic environmental factors in field while the contribution of n2o production and consumption and microbial abundance and activity nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria were lacking thus detailed investigation of the microbial processes driving the n2o biogeochemical process in coastal mariculture ponds should receive more attention in future 5 conclusions our results demonstrated that subtropical mariculture shrimp ponds had much higher n2o emission as compared with others aquatic ecosystems such as lakes reservoirs and rivers the estuarine mariculture ponds were an important source of atmospheric n2o with strong temporal variations n2o emission during the non aquaculture phase was much larger than that in aquaculture phase the dissolved n2o concentrations in shrimp ponds varied considerably during the aquaculture phase among different sampling dates the temporal variation of n2o concentrations in the ponds closely followed the changes in the concentrations of nitrogen substrates e g n nh4 and tdn further studies on n2o production and consumption dynamics within maricultural ponds will improve our understanding of the n2o biogeochemistry and facilitate the development of strategies for reducing n2o emissions credit authorship contribution

5844,the impact of human activities on river systems has reached a state in which they can no longer be considered to be controlled only by natural processes of the earth but also by anthropogenic forces in many regions of world however most approaches for assessing the impact still consider human activities to be an external influence in the study of feedback mechanisms between human activities and river systems and they are usually complicated and specialized this paper aims to develop an indicator system that includes the artificial water surface ratio awsr artificial water surface density ratio awsdr disruption of longitudinal connectivity ratio dlcr artificial river ratio arr sinuosity of artificial cutoff sac channelization ratio cr artificial levee ratio alr road along river ratio rarr artificial sediment transport ratio astr and the integrated river structure impact index irsii to quantitatively assess the impact of human activities on river structure by comparing natural and anthropogenic forces in a river system the nanliu river basin under the dramatic impact of human activities was selected to validate the indicator system the case results showed the nanliu river has become an anthropogenic river according to its high irsii value greater than 0 49 the artificialwater surface area and artificialsediment discharge were 2 96 awsr 2 96 and 2 51 astr 2 51 times of the outcome of natural process the river was dramatically blocked by human made buildings dlcr 68 63 and artificialchannel accounts for 54 23 of total length of natural river arr 0 54 within the river basin upper and lower sub basins in areas with a higher economic level were more affected by human activities future management of the nanliu river basin should focus on restoration of river connectivity sand mining and irrigation issues unlike most previous assessment methods the approach developed in this study is simple and readily comprehensible by the public and decision makers cost effective for long term monitoring and not subject to the reference condition keywords river structure human activity natural force anthropogenic force assessment indicator system nanliu river basin 1 introduction rivers are of immense importance geologically hydrologically biologically historically and culturally sponseller et al 2013 poff 2014 rivers have been used by humans in support of economic development activities for the past several decades approximately 45 000 large dams greater than 15 m in height have been built to retain approximately 15 of the world s total runoff 40 000 km3y 1 nilsson et al 2005 approximately 54 of geographically accessible global runoff is currently being used to supply human related services postel et al 1996 the estimated amount of sediment that has been deliberately shifted by humans 57 000 mt around the world is 2 59 times the amount naturally moved by river systems from the land to the oceans douglas and lawson 2000 price et al 2011 only 23 of flow was uninterrupted to the ocean grill et al 2019 major river systems such as the ganges river yellowriver indus river and colorado river are severely fragmented and have ceased to flow to the sea from time to time sear and newson 2003 found that over 60 of the river channel structure around the world have been changed or altered because of urbanization the impact of human activities on river systems has now reached a state in which the river systems can no longer be considered to be controlled solely by earth system processes and also influenced by increasing anthropogenic forces turner et al 1990 messerli et al 2000 meybeck 2003 due to the combined effects of increasing human population efficient technology and the ability to pay for its deployment haff 2002 thus an assessment of the impact of human activities on river systems is needed to understand the evolution of rivers drivenby these two forces in order to maintain their function and support sustainable management practices indicators are recognized as valuable tools that provide signals of change and a valuable means of communication dale and beyeler 2001 del et al 2016 many indicators based on chemical biotic hydrological morphological habitat e g the river habitat survey rapid assessment protocols and index of stream condition and landscape aspects have been developed to quantify human impact on river systems singh et al 2009 chemical indices require laborious field monitoring and experimentation and water quality always changes due to seasonal variation biotic indicators such as the index of biotic integrity karr 1981 and the river invertebrate prediction and classification system riv pacs rely on a reference condition as a benchmark i e a non impacted or less impacted river system but we all know that it is a considerable challenge to find this reference condition especially in the anthropocene morphological indicators such as the morphological quality index mqi also need reference conditions against which the deviation of present geomorphic reach conditions is measured rinaldi et al 2013 hydrological indicators such as the index of hydrologic alteration richter et al 1996 and hydraulic flow methods do not directly link to habitat in addition these historic and long term flow data are not always readily available landscape indicators such as average buffer width weller et al 1998 mostly focus on the terrestrial system and miss the river channel in general these traditional approaches cannot directly quantify human impact from a simple and visual angle compared to these chemical biotic hydrological morphological habitat and landscape indicators gergel et al 2002 river structure may be a good visual angle from which to evaluate human impact on river systems because 1 river structure controls its functions according to the law of structure and function of systematicism wei and zeng 1995 2 river structure is directly changed by human activities ranging from engineering related to rivers e g dams weirs floodgates pipelines canals ponds dredging sand mining roads buildings revetment gabion riprap protection refuse dump and pump station to engineering induced disasters such as landslides invasion by exotic species destruction or degradation of habitat döll et al 2009 and is usually dominated by these activities over a long term ji et al 2014 3 many parameters of river structure on a broad scale reach and basin can be acquired through remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis which are easy to measure and visual several single river structure indicators have been developed for example drainage density water surface ratio complexity of river stability of river and storage capacity ji et al 2014 however these indicators are not sufficiently comprehensive to assess the impact of human activities from a system perspective the nanliu river basin located in the northern part of beibu gulf is the largest river in the southwest china with theriseof beibu gulf economiczoneforchina s nationalstrategy the nanliu river basin is experiencing rapid changes the river system has increasingly been impacted by human activities and caused environmental issues growing literatures have researched the nanliu river in many fields li et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 tong et al 2018 yang et al 2018 liang et al 2019 lin et al 2019 but no similar study related to assessment the impact of human activities on river system has been carried out given this background our paper aims to develop an indicator system to assess the impact of human activities on river structures by comparing the natural and anthropogenic forces that act on the river systems using gis and rs techniques in which the nanliu river basin is used as an example 2 methods and data 2 1 development of a river structure assessment indicator system based on the principles that indicators should be simple practical and visual this paper proposed the following 9 indicators to assess human impact on river structures by comparing outcomes of two forces anthropogenic vs natural forces within a river system table 1 finally these indicators were normalized and integrated into an index for easy practice operation 1 artificial water surface ratio water surface area is a very visual parameter in quantifying human alterations and plays an important role in explaining a change in ecological conditions compared to natural water surface artificial water bodies are widely distributed in the world for example at least 2 6 million small artificial water bodies e g ponds dot the landscape of the united states and account for approximately 20 of its standing water area smith et al 2002 these artificial water bodies have impacted on hydrology sedimentology geochemistry and ecology in their area smith et al 2002 fairchild and velinsky 2006 similar to the widely used index of water surface ratio ji et al 2014 we proposed an artificial water surface ratio that was calculated as below 1 awsr aws area nws area nws area 0 where awsr is the area ratio of artificial water surface to natural water surface on a basin scale that indicates how many man made water bodies are inserted into fnatural river systems awsarea is the area of artificial water bodies created by all kinds of water conservancy facilities such as reservoirs and artificial ponds nwsarea is the area of natural water surface from natural rivers and lakes in general the range of awsr is 0 a higher value of awsr indicates a higher anthropogenic force on the river system awsr 1 indicate that these two forces are at equilibrium from the perspective of water surface area the water surface area is mainly controlled by anthropogenic force when awsr is greater than 1 2 artificial water surface density ratio artificial water bodies have increased the ratio of water surfacearea to total basin area in a river basin this variation could result in habitat alteration degradation ofwater quality change of groundwater recharge and connectivity of the river basin especially in agriculture regions tarolli and sofia 2016 artificial water surface density is the ratio of awsarea to the whole basin area basinarea that represents the degree to which land surface has been modified to water surface by human activities we assume that global mean land water ratio 2 73 is a natural background value cao et al 2014 artificial water surface density ratio awsdr was designed to compare with this natural background as below 2 awsdr 100 a ws area 2 73 basin area in general the value range of awsdr is 0 a higher awsdr value indicates that more artificial water area was built and more land surface was covered by artificial water bodies in a basin the river system was controlled by anthropogenic force from the viewpoint of water surface density when awsdr is greater than 1 3 disruption of longitudinal connectivity ratio longitudinal connectivity from a hydrologic viewpoint is considered as a water mediated transfer of matter energy or organisms within or between elements of the hydrological cycle it is important in river ecology due to its relation to the community structure and biodiversity patterns in river channels and its role as a transport pathway for species migration and organic inorganic matter into the downstream wohl et al 2019 however river longitudinal connectivity is presently disrupted the river fragmentation index grill et al 2015 the river connectivity index grill et al 2014 and degree of fragmentation grill et al 2019 are three indicators that evaluate the effect of river fragmentation by reservoirs or dams on structural connectivity per basin or sub basin these indicators represent the ratio of the controlled river volume in a basin in an attempt to directly capture the obstruction of the river structure in a river channel liermann et al 2012 used the longest undammed river length to derive the percentage of unobstructed watercourse to reflect the connectivity which is direct simple and useful we were inspired to develop the longitudinal connectivity dlc index that is defined as below 3 dlc n l 4 dlcr dlc 0 6 where dlc is the disruption of longitudinal connectivity of a river that indicates the frequency intensity and level of blockage to water flow sediment transport and fish migration by man made buildings the dlc is usually represented as the number of buildings per 100 km channel length n is the number of the buildings such as dams gates and weirs l is the river length and its unit is 100 km natural barriers e g waterfalls or some artificial barriers with something like fish passages are assumed not to have any negative impact on river connectivity o hanley 2011 an ideal dlc value of a natural river is small 0 6 buildings 100 km water resources and hydropower planning and design general institute 2010 dlcr was designed to compare with this ideal dlc condition and indicate the degree of river channel blockage by human made buildings dlcr is dimensionlessand its range is 0 a high dlcr value means the river system is more blocked 4 artificial river ratio natural river length is always a basic parameter in the assessment of river structure in the anthropocene the artificial river such as irrigation canals ditches and aqueducts becomes part of the river network an artificial river plays different roles in landscape ecology and water quality thus the artificial river ratio was proposed to compare the channels made by natural and anthropogenic forces in length and was calculated as below 5 arr al l where arr is the artificial river ratio and equals the length ratio of an artificial channel al and natural river l artificial channels indicate the force of human activity cast on the river structure in general the value range of arr is 0 high arr values reflect a low degree of naturalness of the whole river system the river channel is mainly created by anthropogenic force when arr is greater than 1 whereas by natural force 5 sinuosity of artificial cutoff cutoff is a physical evolution process of a meandering channel li and gao 2019 however artificial cutoff is a man made process of straightening a sinuous channel for the purpose of flood control infrastructure protection or navigation which is a major measure of channel realignment smith and winkley 1996 the morphological complexity hydrodynamic process and length of meandering river were reduced after artificial cutoffs li and gao 2019 artificial cutoff projects are widely distributed around the world for example 16 artificial cutoffs had been constructed and shortened the channel by 243 km in lower mississippi river as early asfrom 1929 to 1945 smith and winkley 1996 the most obvious change of each cutoff is its sinuosity river sinuosity reflects the capacity of a river for horizontal movement zhao and ding 2016 thus the sinuosity of artificial cutoff sac was proposed as an indicator to compare channel lengths between sinuous channels derived by the hydrologic process and straight channel derived by anthropogenic force it can be calculated as below 6 sac sl ll where sl is the length of the sinuosity reach of a cut and ll is the length of a new man made line reach in general the range of cr is 1 high sac values reflect a highly shortened degree of river system 6 channelization ratio channelization is a group of engineering practices to ensure river navigation flood protection and increasing the sediment transport capacity scorpio et al 2018 channelization basically fixes the evolutionary trajectory of channel and limited horizontal movement of rivers in europe channelization has been planned since the 18th century and now they seem to beeverywhere around world channelization in most cases has resulted in channel narrowing bed level lowering simplification of channel morphology and ecological degradation oscoz et al 2005 zawiejska and wyżga 2010 scorpio et al 2018 to evaluate the impact of these modified channels the channelization ratio cr was designed and calculated as below 7 cr c l where c is the length of the channelization channel and l is the length of the natural river the range of cr is 0 river channels are mainly created by natural force cr 0 1 or anthropogenic force cr 1 7 artificial levee ratio in natural conditions valley floor width indicates the maximum lateral extent of river movement and the degree to which the river is confined within its valley polvi et al 2011 zhao and ding 2016 zhao et al 2019 the lateral dimension of a river expresses the link between riverine systems and wetlands and floodplains nowadays most river channels could not freely laterally move within the valley floor because they are directly limited by an artificial levee i e artificial levees provide a smaller space than the valley floor for river lateral movement therefore interactions between rivers and their levees will be more violent during a flood thus the artificial levee ratio was designed to compare artificial confined channel with natural confined channel it can be calculated as below 8 alr lel l where alr is the artificial levee ratio lel is the length of the artificial levee and l is the length of the natural river in general the range of alr is 0 lateral movement extent of river system is mainly defined by natural force alr 0 1 or anthropogenic force alr 1 8 road along river ratio many road networks are parallelly distributed along river systems compared to natural river system exclusiveof irrigation canals ditches and aqueducts these roads are so close to a river in a giver buffer area which seems to be a part of the river system these two networks have many types of interaction jones et al 2000 roads can affect the manner in which incoming precipitation is routed through a basin to produce a flood jones grant 1996 water carried by roads will be delivered to streams to coincide with the flood peak they also indirectly change river structure disrupt the lateral connectivity from floodplains and longitudinal connectivity at intersections with streams in particular culverts grill et al 2019 road construction would induce landslides and increase the crushed zone that could persistently modify the river structure road drainage systems a portion of the road network have the potential to act as extensions of the river drainage network wemple et al 1996 roads also provide opportunities for humans to reach and impact the river structure in addition road transport is a main source of water pollution the road density was used as a dominant pressure indicator to assess river connectivity status grill et al 2019 here we assumed that road and natural river networks are products of anthropogenic and natural forces in a given buffer area along river systems receptively these two products were compared and calculated as follows 9 rarr r l where rarr is the ratio of roads along a river system r is a length of road along a river system and less than a given distance e g 50 m to near channels and l is total length of natural river system in general the range of rarr is 0 rarr approximately indicates the percentage of the length of natural river was attached by roads 9 artificial sediment transport ratio sediment transport is a basic function of a natural river system sediment is a gift for the ocean and the fundamental material that forms a delta in addition it is a very important building material therefore legal and illegal sand mining is very popular thus sediment discharge change resulted from human impact are often considered as an index fan et al 2006 syvitski and kettner 2011 wang et al 2016 allison et al 2017 but they miss the part of sediment change from sand mining sand mining has induced problems such as the breaking of river banks and riverbeds an increase of geological disasters and invasion of farmland therefore the artificial sediment transport ratio astr was developed to compare river sediment discharge with sediment discharge by sand mining in a river system it represents the ability of sediment transport through human activities compared to the hydrological process it was calculated by the equation below 10 astr m st where m is a quantity of sand mining and transport and st is a quantity of sediment transport of suspended load and bedloadthrough river flow in general the range of astr is 0 the sediment transport of river system could be mainly driven by water flow astr 0 1 or sand mining astr 1 10 integrated river structure impact index to improve the practicability of these indicators during practice operation the nine aforementioned indicators were normalized y atan x 2 π and integrated into one index the integrated river structure impact index irsii was calculated by the equation below 11 irsii 2 π i 1 n w i a t a n r i 1 n w i where r is one of aforementioned indicator and wi denote the weighting coefficient of the i th indicator n is the number of r the range of irsii is 0 1 since the normalized function was computed according to the comparison of outcomes of anthropogenic vs natural forces each r could be classified into four categories nature strong control 0 0 5 nature control 0 5 1 artificial control 1 2 artificial strong control greater than 2 correspondingly the range values of irsii were computed into four categories nature strong control 0 0 29 nature control 0 29 0 48 artificial control 0 48 0 61 artificial strong control 0 61 1 2 2 study area the nanliu river basin is located in the southeast of china s guangxi zhuang autonomous region guangxi with an approximate main stream length of 285 km and a drainage area of 9232 km2 fig 1 the basin elevation ranges from sea level to 1244 m with an average of 620 m the mean annual rainfall in this basin is between 1400 and 1760 mm tong et al 2018 according to 2016 statistics the total population of the nanliu river basin is 4 06 million and the corresponding population density is 435 persons per square kilometer which is 3 04 times the national average in china 143 persons per square kilometer in 2013 for the gdp in the nanliu river basin it is 93 33 billion yuan accounting for 5 09 of the guangxi gdp compared to 3 90 of the total basin land area therefore the nanliu river basin has been drastically changed by various human activities fig 2 shows the population and economic development in each sub basin the 20 sub basins were categorized into two groups according to the gdp values per area and population density dingchuan qingwan rendong shasheng shatian beiliu fumian and fumian bobai sub basins are in a group with large populations and high economic pressure while the rest of sub basins belong to the other group 2 3 data sources and processing remote sensing images of the nanliu river basin were acquired from the map world of guangxi http www mapgx com ime gx with spatial resolutions of 0 8 2 m to visually interpret and map river structure and human activities as vector polygons e g natural river networks lakes ponds reservoirs mining sand areas and reservoir vector polylines e g ditches aqueducts channelization levee artificial cutoffs and road networks and vector points e g gate dams and pump stations in arcgis 10 1 correspondingly their attributes such as locations areas or lengths were derived and assigned to these vector objects the kappa coefficient was then used to evaluate the accuracy of extracted information a kappa greater than 0 75 was considered good enough for further analysis a field trip was conducted to validate the interpreted sand mining areas and investigate the sand mining condition in 2018 dems with 30 m spatial resolutions were downloaded from geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn natural river network was initially delineated base on above dems and represented by vector polylines then delineated the 20 sub basins using arcgis 10 1 the 1 50 000 digital line graphic dlg dataset was collected from the guangxi bureauof surveying mapping and geoinformation to correct the interpreted vector polygons and delineated vector polylines river network as a result the total length and area of natural river network in the nanliu river basin is 3210 26 km and 83 55 km2 respectively annual sediment discharge data at changle station were collected from the guangxi coastal hydrology and water resources bureau to calculate the quantity of sediment transport 3 results 3 1 mapping and quantification of human activities all kinds of projects were found using the rs interpretation and then mapped fig 3 there were 345 reservoirs and 4 728 ponds and their areas are 192 24 km2 and 54 74 km2 respectively there were 977 gate dams and 40 pump stations and 219 aqueducts with the length of 1740 85 km these aqueducts ditches are too narrow to consider polygon objects most levees were distributed along main stream with a total length of 183 49 km channelization was largely made in city areas and total length is 181 83 km table 2 on average there were approximately 0 68 projects per square kilometer and 0 04 reservoirs per square kilometer fig 3 presents five representative sub basins to show that the projects were very crowded in this basin and that the projects in the upper and lower basins were denser furthermore water projects in the upper basin are densely dispersed over the region while water projects in lower basin are gathered along the river the road network 1288 84 km was built within 50 m buffer area of natural river system the road types ranked by their lengths along the river system are township road county road provincial road national road accommodation highway fig 4 the length of the township road was the longest sand mining was widely found in the nanliu river basin the area 429 95 104 m2 of sand mining was mapped and the volume 3139 60 104 m3 was estimated table 3 sand mining was found to spread from downstream to middle stream and from main streams to tributaries sand mining sites were mostly located in the main stream of the nanliu river wuli river and zhanghuang river sub basins especially in the conjunctions of these rivers 3 2 impact of human activities on the river structure through comparison between the natural and anthropogenic forces 3 2 1 nanliu river basin as a whole the artificial water surface area in the whole basin was 2 96 times the natural water surface area awsr 2 96 and up to 2 66 of the total basin area awsdr 0 97 the artificial water surface area was mainly formed by 345 reservoirs and then by 4 728 ponds these indicated that the area of water surface in nanliu river basin is mainly controlled by anthropogenic force e g excavation rather than natural force on average there were 41 18 human made buildings in the flow stream per 100 km river length dlcr 68 63 these buildings mainly include reservoirs gate dams and some ponds in the flow stream the river length formed by artificial force is greater than half of the natural river length arr 0 54 although channelized river channel is relatively small in whole nanliu river basin cr 0 06 but it is highly concentrated in city areas artificial levee length accounts for 5 72 of the total natural river length alr 0 06 in addition we clearly found that road network in whole basin is closelyconnected with river network with a high rarr value 0 38 primarily due to the contribution of township roads this suggested that approximate 38 28 of natural river length was closely attached by roads a total of 19 artificial cutoff projects were found in the upper basin yulin city and beiliu city and middle basin bobai county in fig 5 eighteen man made cutoff projects were built in high sinuosity reaches and these river channel lengths were sharply shortened after project construction fig 5 the sac values of these projects range from 1 33 to 9 99 and the average is 2 67 which means that 18 31 km of 30 79 km of the total length of natural sinuous reaches were eliminated by these projects it was also found that most artificial cutoff projects were located in the main stream and in the upper basin in yulin city including yuzhou and fumian districts a relatively well developed city with a large population the period 2000 2016 is said as goldenyears for sand mining in nanliu river basin li et al 2017 sand mining was conservativelyestimated to 4395 40 mt based on its volume 3139 60 104 m3 and density 1 4 ton m 3 cumulative sediment discharge at changle station during 2000 2016 was approximately 1250 66 mt that adds 10 of suspended load discharge fig 6 as bed load discharge wang 1986 the sediment from human mining was estimated as 2 51 times that of river transport astr 2 51 which implied that anthropogenic force became the dominant force in sand transport fig 7 shows the results of the impact of human activity in the whole nanliu river basin clearly there is a large gap in the nine index values the values of awsr dlcr sac and astr are high while the remaining indices belong to the other group with low values according to equation 11 with an equal weight the value of irsii is 0 49 that belongs to artificial control degree which suggests that anthropogenic force instead of natural force became a controlling power of change of river structure in the nanliu river system 3 2 2 sub basin situations table 4 and fig 8 show the influence of different human activities on river structure in the sub basins it is clear that awsr awsdr dlcr and rarr form a group with dense high values in most sub basins and that other indicators arr cr and alr are a separate group with few high values these findings imply that artificial water bodies interaction between roads and rivers and disruption of longitudinalconnectivity were big issues for entire basin while other issues were only relevant for a few sub basins in general the largest influence on river structure resides in the upper basin relatively developed area and lower basin estuary region specifically qingwan dingchuan rendong beiliu fumian and li river sub basins in the upper basin and yama river and zhou river sub basins in the lower basin comprise a typical high cluster region for the 7 indicator values fig 8 from the viewpoint of awsr the ma river and the hongchaojiang sub basins were at the maximum 22 63 and 21 95 and the minimum was the estuary sub basin 0 41 there are large gaps between these sub basins which is mainly due to the impact of some large reservoirs for example the two large reservoirs hongchaojiang reservoir 7 14 108 m3 and hepu reservoir 12 47 108 m3 of the nanliu river basin are located in the ma river sub basin and hongchaojiang sub basin therefore the awsdr values of these basins are highest other dams and ponds built in tributaries were relatively small although these projects created small water surface they have greatly changed the river structure on a small scale all sub basins had a very high dlcr values including 70 of sub basins with more than 50 times of the ideal condition in another word all sub basins in the nanliu river basin were in very bad condition regarding longitudinal connectivity this was probably the result of using irrigation in the service of agriculture livestock breeding and the jeans industry and in providing hydropower for example li river basin was highlighted with an inconceivable value dlcr 159 10 that is mainly attributed to the pig industry a traditional small family business most artificial channels are located in upper basins such as the rendong basin arr 2 30 qingwan sub basin arr 1 99 li river sub basin arr 1 55 and fumian bobai sub basin arr 1 26 artificial channel lengths in these basins are greater than their natural river lengths table 4 flood banks and river channelization were usually built in urban areas with dense populations and affluence such as the urban area in the yuzhou district pubei county and hepu county fig 9 most channelized channels were intensivelybuilt in qingwan cr 0 36 estuary cr 0 29 and beiliu fumian cr 0 16 sub basins while cr values of the rest of sub basins are less than 0 06 all sub basins have big differences in alr values between the maximum 0 44 and minimum 0 the zhou river and estuary sub basins both are located in the estuary area of the nanliu river basin where there are multiple channels obviously the alr values of these two sub basins were up to 0 44 and 0 38 respectively and much higher than other sub basins because more flood bank construction are very necessary for these areas the situation of the road network along the river system is very common in all sub basins of the study area the rarr range is from 0 74 to 0 15 with an average of 0 38 this finding is mostly observed because the nanliu river basin is densely populated and most people live along the river system in addition reservoirs dams and farmland need roads for access 4 discussion to our knowledge this is the first study to develop an indicator system to assess human impacts on river structure from the viewpoint of a comparison between anthropogenic and natural forces the proposed indicator system similar to landscape indicators such as forest cover detenbeck et al 1993 could provide a direct measure of human alteration in a basin evaluating the change in river structure offers new insights into the influence of human activity on river systems compared to traditional indicator systems such as chemical biotic hydrological and habitat the river structure viewpoint is more direct simpler and more visible simple metrics proposed in this study may be most useful gergel et al 2002 rinaldi et al 2013 due to its easiness to connect public interests and management weber and ringold 2019 for example no 16 project in fig 5 sac 9 9 showed that the sinuous channel was replaced by only 10 straight channel 0 28 km of the original length 2 78 km thus a flood could quickly pour through yulin city which is easy to calculate understand and explain to the public and management even without backgroundknowledge furthermore the proposed indicator system in this study has been designed to compare the accumulative outcomes of natural and anthropogenic forces until a given time thus this method does not need to set a reference condition to compare which enhances its practicality because the reference conditions historical or natural always limits many methods e g riv pacs mqi with the same assessment conducted in different time periods this method can be used to detect the change of river structure and change of its natural and anthropogenic forces in other words this method could track the impact of human activities on river structure this assessment indicator system spans a broad spatial extent with adequate resolution and accuracy that are fundamentally scientific these indices focus on the surface characteristics of river structures that are more easily and more economically acquired by rs and gis techniques than other methods e g ibi riv pacs and iha on a large scale some free platforms for data sources such as google earth map world of guangxi the united states geological survey the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc provide free access to data this method needed this is very helpful for wide applications of the method we believe that the proposed indicators and methods can be applied in multiple ways because they could be simple straightforward effectively and easily understood by different people including scientists planners managers and the general public our findings in nanliu river basin have implied that river functions have been degraded because of high modification of river structure for example the decrease of transporting function of sediment entering the sea is due to human activities such as hydraulic engineering and forest conservation li et al 2017 the basin management strategy should focus on river restoration in the future according to the highlighted high values of dlcr rarr awsr arr and astr for the whole basin prioritizing stream restoration actions in the nanliu river basin probably is 1 to remove migration barriers corresponding to the dlcr 2 to restore watershed processes such as instream flows sediment reduction and riparian areas corresponding to the dlcr astr awsr and rarr and 3 to enhance instream habitats corresponding to the dlcr and arr these are consistent with the recommended strategies and citations from beechie et al 2008 accordingly the priority areas for restoration are the seven sub basins qingwan rendong dingchuan beiliu fumian li river yama river and zhou river which have high values of the abovementioned indices fig 8 the qingwan rendong dingchuan beiliu fumian and li river basins are relatively developed areas fig 2 and are under high pressure from population density and economic development prioritization for the removal of artificial in stream structures to enhance river connectivity to activate river vigor in a cost effective way o hanley 2011 is probably a viable solution for the nanliu river basin for example the removal of these dams is a growing movement in the united states to restore rivers roy et al 2018 this is because these dams aging or problem infrastructures roy et al 2018 which have lost their original functions have negative ecological or indigenous impacts or are expensive to maintain roy et al 2018 according to the astr value 2 51 for the whole basin we realized that sand mining in the study area far exceeded the natural process illegal sand mining in downstream of the nanliu river has been reported many times and has attracted the attention of government officials and the public because it caused a series of direct problems such as intrusion of farmland and banks induction of social contradictions destruction of riverbeds as well as some indirect problems li et al 2017 for example the riverbed width of a reach of the main stream in shiwan town hepo county was expanded from the original 100 m to 500 m due to illegal sand mining astr value can assist water managers in realizing the seriousness of the problem and help them make the decision to stop sand mining instead of only against illegal sand mining the high values of awsr awsdr arr and dlcr in fig 8 indicate that the demand of irrigation water usage is large it can also be seen in table 2 that irrigation is the main purposes of water projects agriculture is the basis for human survival in this basin consuming up to 65 5 guangxi water resources bulletin in 2016 of total water use to feed approximately 4 06 million people however the efficiency coefficient of irrigation water usage in the nanliu river basin approximately 0 47 is much smaller than the national level 0 54 and smaller than the level in guangxi 0 48 thus the efficiency of irrigation water use should be improved through agronomic techniques irrigation systems engineering and demand based irrigation scheduling in general the proposed indicator system in this study performed well in the nanliu river basin because it has captured its major issues of ecologicalenvironment and provided suitable management strategy and key regions for the nanliu river basin this assessment indicator system could identify the changes of river structure and functions and help river restoration thus it could be attempted to integrate with the river restoration method based on fluvial geomorphology river structure such as the river style framework brierley and fryirs 2000 brierley et al 2011 brierley and fryirs 2016 to develop a flexible simplified and cost effective management programme for chinese river restoration for instance the reform restoring rivers for effective catchment management that provided an open ended hydromorphology framework to support cost effective implementation of restoration measures in restoring river ecosystems in europe was built heavily on the river style framework gurnell et al 2016 three limitations of this study should be noted first the accuracyof the data may be not very high for example some instream structures might be missed because of the lower resolution of remote sensing images second we did not take into account the effect of multicollinearityamong these indicators third more cases should be conducted to validate the applicability of this indicator system 5 conclusions we developed an indicator system that included 9 indicators awsr awsdr dlcr arr sac cr alr rarr and astr and an integrated river structure impact index irsii to assess the influence of human activities on river system structure the natural and anthropogenic forces within a river system were compared through measuring changes in the structures with gis and rs techniques the case study of the nanliu river basin showed that the river has become an artificialriver according to irsii 0 49 which suggest that anthropogenic forces are large than natural forces in general specifically the artificialwater surface area and length are both larger than the natural ones the artificialsediment discharge is 2 51 times that of the natural process astr 2 51 furthermore an average of 41 18 human made buildings was installed in a 100 km river channel the road and river networks interact considerably and 38 28 of total natural river network is side by side with the road network we noticed that sub basins with high values are the qingwan dingchuan beiliu fumian rendong li river yama river and zhou river sub basins in future the restoration strategy of the nanliu river basin should focus on river

5844,the impact of human activities on river systems has reached a state in which they can no longer be considered to be controlled only by natural processes of the earth but also by anthropogenic forces in many regions of world however most approaches for assessing the impact still consider human activities to be an external influence in the study of feedback mechanisms between human activities and river systems and they are usually complicated and specialized this paper aims to develop an indicator system that includes the artificial water surface ratio awsr artificial water surface density ratio awsdr disruption of longitudinal connectivity ratio dlcr artificial river ratio arr sinuosity of artificial cutoff sac channelization ratio cr artificial levee ratio alr road along river ratio rarr artificial sediment transport ratio astr and the integrated river structure impact index irsii to quantitatively assess the impact of human activities on river structure by comparing natural and anthropogenic forces in a river system the nanliu river basin under the dramatic impact of human activities was selected to validate the indicator system the case results showed the nanliu river has become an anthropogenic river according to its high irsii value greater than 0 49 the artificialwater surface area and artificialsediment discharge were 2 96 awsr 2 96 and 2 51 astr 2 51 times of the outcome of natural process the river was dramatically blocked by human made buildings dlcr 68 63 and artificialchannel accounts for 54 23 of total length of natural river arr 0 54 within the river basin upper and lower sub basins in areas with a higher economic level were more affected by human activities future management of the nanliu river basin should focus on restoration of river connectivity sand mining and irrigation issues unlike most previous assessment methods the approach developed in this study is simple and readily comprehensible by the public and decision makers cost effective for long term monitoring and not subject to the reference condition keywords river structure human activity natural force anthropogenic force assessment indicator system nanliu river basin 1 introduction rivers are of immense importance geologically hydrologically biologically historically and culturally sponseller et al 2013 poff 2014 rivers have been used by humans in support of economic development activities for the past several decades approximately 45 000 large dams greater than 15 m in height have been built to retain approximately 15 of the world s total runoff 40 000 km3y 1 nilsson et al 2005 approximately 54 of geographically accessible global runoff is currently being used to supply human related services postel et al 1996 the estimated amount of sediment that has been deliberately shifted by humans 57 000 mt around the world is 2 59 times the amount naturally moved by river systems from the land to the oceans douglas and lawson 2000 price et al 2011 only 23 of flow was uninterrupted to the ocean grill et al 2019 major river systems such as the ganges river yellowriver indus river and colorado river are severely fragmented and have ceased to flow to the sea from time to time sear and newson 2003 found that over 60 of the river channel structure around the world have been changed or altered because of urbanization the impact of human activities on river systems has now reached a state in which the river systems can no longer be considered to be controlled solely by earth system processes and also influenced by increasing anthropogenic forces turner et al 1990 messerli et al 2000 meybeck 2003 due to the combined effects of increasing human population efficient technology and the ability to pay for its deployment haff 2002 thus an assessment of the impact of human activities on river systems is needed to understand the evolution of rivers drivenby these two forces in order to maintain their function and support sustainable management practices indicators are recognized as valuable tools that provide signals of change and a valuable means of communication dale and beyeler 2001 del et al 2016 many indicators based on chemical biotic hydrological morphological habitat e g the river habitat survey rapid assessment protocols and index of stream condition and landscape aspects have been developed to quantify human impact on river systems singh et al 2009 chemical indices require laborious field monitoring and experimentation and water quality always changes due to seasonal variation biotic indicators such as the index of biotic integrity karr 1981 and the river invertebrate prediction and classification system riv pacs rely on a reference condition as a benchmark i e a non impacted or less impacted river system but we all know that it is a considerable challenge to find this reference condition especially in the anthropocene morphological indicators such as the morphological quality index mqi also need reference conditions against which the deviation of present geomorphic reach conditions is measured rinaldi et al 2013 hydrological indicators such as the index of hydrologic alteration richter et al 1996 and hydraulic flow methods do not directly link to habitat in addition these historic and long term flow data are not always readily available landscape indicators such as average buffer width weller et al 1998 mostly focus on the terrestrial system and miss the river channel in general these traditional approaches cannot directly quantify human impact from a simple and visual angle compared to these chemical biotic hydrological morphological habitat and landscape indicators gergel et al 2002 river structure may be a good visual angle from which to evaluate human impact on river systems because 1 river structure controls its functions according to the law of structure and function of systematicism wei and zeng 1995 2 river structure is directly changed by human activities ranging from engineering related to rivers e g dams weirs floodgates pipelines canals ponds dredging sand mining roads buildings revetment gabion riprap protection refuse dump and pump station to engineering induced disasters such as landslides invasion by exotic species destruction or degradation of habitat döll et al 2009 and is usually dominated by these activities over a long term ji et al 2014 3 many parameters of river structure on a broad scale reach and basin can be acquired through remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis which are easy to measure and visual several single river structure indicators have been developed for example drainage density water surface ratio complexity of river stability of river and storage capacity ji et al 2014 however these indicators are not sufficiently comprehensive to assess the impact of human activities from a system perspective the nanliu river basin located in the northern part of beibu gulf is the largest river in the southwest china with theriseof beibu gulf economiczoneforchina s nationalstrategy the nanliu river basin is experiencing rapid changes the river system has increasingly been impacted by human activities and caused environmental issues growing literatures have researched the nanliu river in many fields li et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 tong et al 2018 yang et al 2018 liang et al 2019 lin et al 2019 but no similar study related to assessment the impact of human activities on river system has been carried out given this background our paper aims to develop an indicator system to assess the impact of human activities on river structures by comparing the natural and anthropogenic forces that act on the river systems using gis and rs techniques in which the nanliu river basin is used as an example 2 methods and data 2 1 development of a river structure assessment indicator system based on the principles that indicators should be simple practical and visual this paper proposed the following 9 indicators to assess human impact on river structures by comparing outcomes of two forces anthropogenic vs natural forces within a river system table 1 finally these indicators were normalized and integrated into an index for easy practice operation 1 artificial water surface ratio water surface area is a very visual parameter in quantifying human alterations and plays an important role in explaining a change in ecological conditions compared to natural water surface artificial water bodies are widely distributed in the world for example at least 2 6 million small artificial water bodies e g ponds dot the landscape of the united states and account for approximately 20 of its standing water area smith et al 2002 these artificial water bodies have impacted on hydrology sedimentology geochemistry and ecology in their area smith et al 2002 fairchild and velinsky 2006 similar to the widely used index of water surface ratio ji et al 2014 we proposed an artificial water surface ratio that was calculated as below 1 awsr aws area nws area nws area 0 where awsr is the area ratio of artificial water surface to natural water surface on a basin scale that indicates how many man made water bodies are inserted into fnatural river systems awsarea is the area of artificial water bodies created by all kinds of water conservancy facilities such as reservoirs and artificial ponds nwsarea is the area of natural water surface from natural rivers and lakes in general the range of awsr is 0 a higher value of awsr indicates a higher anthropogenic force on the river system awsr 1 indicate that these two forces are at equilibrium from the perspective of water surface area the water surface area is mainly controlled by anthropogenic force when awsr is greater than 1 2 artificial water surface density ratio artificial water bodies have increased the ratio of water surfacearea to total basin area in a river basin this variation could result in habitat alteration degradation ofwater quality change of groundwater recharge and connectivity of the river basin especially in agriculture regions tarolli and sofia 2016 artificial water surface density is the ratio of awsarea to the whole basin area basinarea that represents the degree to which land surface has been modified to water surface by human activities we assume that global mean land water ratio 2 73 is a natural background value cao et al 2014 artificial water surface density ratio awsdr was designed to compare with this natural background as below 2 awsdr 100 a ws area 2 73 basin area in general the value range of awsdr is 0 a higher awsdr value indicates that more artificial water area was built and more land surface was covered by artificial water bodies in a basin the river system was controlled by anthropogenic force from the viewpoint of water surface density when awsdr is greater than 1 3 disruption of longitudinal connectivity ratio longitudinal connectivity from a hydrologic viewpoint is considered as a water mediated transfer of matter energy or organisms within or between elements of the hydrological cycle it is important in river ecology due to its relation to the community structure and biodiversity patterns in river channels and its role as a transport pathway for species migration and organic inorganic matter into the downstream wohl et al 2019 however river longitudinal connectivity is presently disrupted the river fragmentation index grill et al 2015 the river connectivity index grill et al 2014 and degree of fragmentation grill et al 2019 are three indicators that evaluate the effect of river fragmentation by reservoirs or dams on structural connectivity per basin or sub basin these indicators represent the ratio of the controlled river volume in a basin in an attempt to directly capture the obstruction of the river structure in a river channel liermann et al 2012 used the longest undammed river length to derive the percentage of unobstructed watercourse to reflect the connectivity which is direct simple and useful we were inspired to develop the longitudinal connectivity dlc index that is defined as below 3 dlc n l 4 dlcr dlc 0 6 where dlc is the disruption of longitudinal connectivity of a river that indicates the frequency intensity and level of blockage to water flow sediment transport and fish migration by man made buildings the dlc is usually represented as the number of buildings per 100 km channel length n is the number of the buildings such as dams gates and weirs l is the river length and its unit is 100 km natural barriers e g waterfalls or some artificial barriers with something like fish passages are assumed not to have any negative impact on river connectivity o hanley 2011 an ideal dlc value of a natural river is small 0 6 buildings 100 km water resources and hydropower planning and design general institute 2010 dlcr was designed to compare with this ideal dlc condition and indicate the degree of river channel blockage by human made buildings dlcr is dimensionlessand its range is 0 a high dlcr value means the river system is more blocked 4 artificial river ratio natural river length is always a basic parameter in the assessment of river structure in the anthropocene the artificial river such as irrigation canals ditches and aqueducts becomes part of the river network an artificial river plays different roles in landscape ecology and water quality thus the artificial river ratio was proposed to compare the channels made by natural and anthropogenic forces in length and was calculated as below 5 arr al l where arr is the artificial river ratio and equals the length ratio of an artificial channel al and natural river l artificial channels indicate the force of human activity cast on the river structure in general the value range of arr is 0 high arr values reflect a low degree of naturalness of the whole river system the river channel is mainly created by anthropogenic force when arr is greater than 1 whereas by natural force 5 sinuosity of artificial cutoff cutoff is a physical evolution process of a meandering channel li and gao 2019 however artificial cutoff is a man made process of straightening a sinuous channel for the purpose of flood control infrastructure protection or navigation which is a major measure of channel realignment smith and winkley 1996 the morphological complexity hydrodynamic process and length of meandering river were reduced after artificial cutoffs li and gao 2019 artificial cutoff projects are widely distributed around the world for example 16 artificial cutoffs had been constructed and shortened the channel by 243 km in lower mississippi river as early asfrom 1929 to 1945 smith and winkley 1996 the most obvious change of each cutoff is its sinuosity river sinuosity reflects the capacity of a river for horizontal movement zhao and ding 2016 thus the sinuosity of artificial cutoff sac was proposed as an indicator to compare channel lengths between sinuous channels derived by the hydrologic process and straight channel derived by anthropogenic force it can be calculated as below 6 sac sl ll where sl is the length of the sinuosity reach of a cut and ll is the length of a new man made line reach in general the range of cr is 1 high sac values reflect a highly shortened degree of river system 6 channelization ratio channelization is a group of engineering practices to ensure river navigation flood protection and increasing the sediment transport capacity scorpio et al 2018 channelization basically fixes the evolutionary trajectory of channel and limited horizontal movement of rivers in europe channelization has been planned since the 18th century and now they seem to beeverywhere around world channelization in most cases has resulted in channel narrowing bed level lowering simplification of channel morphology and ecological degradation oscoz et al 2005 zawiejska and wyżga 2010 scorpio et al 2018 to evaluate the impact of these modified channels the channelization ratio cr was designed and calculated as below 7 cr c l where c is the length of the channelization channel and l is the length of the natural river the range of cr is 0 river channels are mainly created by natural force cr 0 1 or anthropogenic force cr 1 7 artificial levee ratio in natural conditions valley floor width indicates the maximum lateral extent of river movement and the degree to which the river is confined within its valley polvi et al 2011 zhao and ding 2016 zhao et al 2019 the lateral dimension of a river expresses the link between riverine systems and wetlands and floodplains nowadays most river channels could not freely laterally move within the valley floor because they are directly limited by an artificial levee i e artificial levees provide a smaller space than the valley floor for river lateral movement therefore interactions between rivers and their levees will be more violent during a flood thus the artificial levee ratio was designed to compare artificial confined channel with natural confined channel it can be calculated as below 8 alr lel l where alr is the artificial levee ratio lel is the length of the artificial levee and l is the length of the natural river in general the range of alr is 0 lateral movement extent of river system is mainly defined by natural force alr 0 1 or anthropogenic force alr 1 8 road along river ratio many road networks are parallelly distributed along river systems compared to natural river system exclusiveof irrigation canals ditches and aqueducts these roads are so close to a river in a giver buffer area which seems to be a part of the river system these two networks have many types of interaction jones et al 2000 roads can affect the manner in which incoming precipitation is routed through a basin to produce a flood jones grant 1996 water carried by roads will be delivered to streams to coincide with the flood peak they also indirectly change river structure disrupt the lateral connectivity from floodplains and longitudinal connectivity at intersections with streams in particular culverts grill et al 2019 road construction would induce landslides and increase the crushed zone that could persistently modify the river structure road drainage systems a portion of the road network have the potential to act as extensions of the river drainage network wemple et al 1996 roads also provide opportunities for humans to reach and impact the river structure in addition road transport is a main source of water pollution the road density was used as a dominant pressure indicator to assess river connectivity status grill et al 2019 here we assumed that road and natural river networks are products of anthropogenic and natural forces in a given buffer area along river systems receptively these two products were compared and calculated as follows 9 rarr r l where rarr is the ratio of roads along a river system r is a length of road along a river system and less than a given distance e g 50 m to near channels and l is total length of natural river system in general the range of rarr is 0 rarr approximately indicates the percentage of the length of natural river was attached by roads 9 artificial sediment transport ratio sediment transport is a basic function of a natural river system sediment is a gift for the ocean and the fundamental material that forms a delta in addition it is a very important building material therefore legal and illegal sand mining is very popular thus sediment discharge change resulted from human impact are often considered as an index fan et al 2006 syvitski and kettner 2011 wang et al 2016 allison et al 2017 but they miss the part of sediment change from sand mining sand mining has induced problems such as the breaking of river banks and riverbeds an increase of geological disasters and invasion of farmland therefore the artificial sediment transport ratio astr was developed to compare river sediment discharge with sediment discharge by sand mining in a river system it represents the ability of sediment transport through human activities compared to the hydrological process it was calculated by the equation below 10 astr m st where m is a quantity of sand mining and transport and st is a quantity of sediment transport of suspended load and bedloadthrough river flow in general the range of astr is 0 the sediment transport of river system could be mainly driven by water flow astr 0 1 or sand mining astr 1 10 integrated river structure impact index to improve the practicability of these indicators during practice operation the nine aforementioned indicators were normalized y atan x 2 π and integrated into one index the integrated river structure impact index irsii was calculated by the equation below 11 irsii 2 π i 1 n w i a t a n r i 1 n w i where r is one of aforementioned indicator and wi denote the weighting coefficient of the i th indicator n is the number of r the range of irsii is 0 1 since the normalized function was computed according to the comparison of outcomes of anthropogenic vs natural forces each r could be classified into four categories nature strong control 0 0 5 nature control 0 5 1 artificial control 1 2 artificial strong control greater than 2 correspondingly the range values of irsii were computed into four categories nature strong control 0 0 29 nature control 0 29 0 48 artificial control 0 48 0 61 artificial strong control 0 61 1 2 2 study area the nanliu river basin is located in the southeast of china s guangxi zhuang autonomous region guangxi with an approximate main stream length of 285 km and a drainage area of 9232 km2 fig 1 the basin elevation ranges from sea level to 1244 m with an average of 620 m the mean annual rainfall in this basin is between 1400 and 1760 mm tong et al 2018 according to 2016 statistics the total population of the nanliu river basin is 4 06 million and the corresponding population density is 435 persons per square kilometer which is 3 04 times the national average in china 143 persons per square kilometer in 2013 for the gdp in the nanliu river basin it is 93 33 billion yuan accounting for 5 09 of the guangxi gdp compared to 3 90 of the total basin land area therefore the nanliu river basin has been drastically changed by various human activities fig 2 shows the population and economic development in each sub basin the 20 sub basins were categorized into two groups according to the gdp values per area and population density dingchuan qingwan rendong shasheng shatian beiliu fumian and fumian bobai sub basins are in a group with large populations and high economic pressure while the rest of sub basins belong to the other group 2 3 data sources and processing remote sensing images of the nanliu river basin were acquired from the map world of guangxi http www mapgx com ime gx with spatial resolutions of 0 8 2 m to visually interpret and map river structure and human activities as vector polygons e g natural river networks lakes ponds reservoirs mining sand areas and reservoir vector polylines e g ditches aqueducts channelization levee artificial cutoffs and road networks and vector points e g gate dams and pump stations in arcgis 10 1 correspondingly their attributes such as locations areas or lengths were derived and assigned to these vector objects the kappa coefficient was then used to evaluate the accuracy of extracted information a kappa greater than 0 75 was considered good enough for further analysis a field trip was conducted to validate the interpreted sand mining areas and investigate the sand mining condition in 2018 dems with 30 m spatial resolutions were downloaded from geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn natural river network was initially delineated base on above dems and represented by vector polylines then delineated the 20 sub basins using arcgis 10 1 the 1 50 000 digital line graphic dlg dataset was collected from the guangxi bureauof surveying mapping and geoinformation to correct the interpreted vector polygons and delineated vector polylines river network as a result the total length and area of natural river network in the nanliu river basin is 3210 26 km and 83 55 km2 respectively annual sediment discharge data at changle station were collected from the guangxi coastal hydrology and water resources bureau to calculate the quantity of sediment transport 3 results 3 1 mapping and quantification of human activities all kinds of projects were found using the rs interpretation and then mapped fig 3 there were 345 reservoirs and 4 728 ponds and their areas are 192 24 km2 and 54 74 km2 respectively there were 977 gate dams and 40 pump stations and 219 aqueducts with the length of 1740 85 km these aqueducts ditches are too narrow to consider polygon objects most levees were distributed along main stream with a total length of 183 49 km channelization was largely made in city areas and total length is 181 83 km table 2 on average there were approximately 0 68 projects per square kilometer and 0 04 reservoirs per square kilometer fig 3 presents five representative sub basins to show that the projects were very crowded in this basin and that the projects in the upper and lower basins were denser furthermore water projects in the upper basin are densely dispersed over the region while water projects in lower basin are gathered along the river the road network 1288 84 km was built within 50 m buffer area of natural river system the road types ranked by their lengths along the river system are township road county road provincial road national road accommodation highway fig 4 the length of the township road was the longest sand mining was widely found in the nanliu river basin the area 429 95 104 m2 of sand mining was mapped and the volume 3139 60 104 m3 was estimated table 3 sand mining was found to spread from downstream to middle stream and from main streams to tributaries sand mining sites were mostly located in the main stream of the nanliu river wuli river and zhanghuang river sub basins especially in the conjunctions of these rivers 3 2 impact of human activities on the river structure through comparison between the natural and anthropogenic forces 3 2 1 nanliu river basin as a whole the artificial water surface area in the whole basin was 2 96 times the natural water surface area awsr 2 96 and up to 2 66 of the total basin area awsdr 0 97 the artificial water surface area was mainly formed by 345 reservoirs and then by 4 728 ponds these indicated that the area of water surface in nanliu river basin is mainly controlled by anthropogenic force e g excavation rather than natural force on average there were 41 18 human made buildings in the flow stream per 100 km river length dlcr 68 63 these buildings mainly include reservoirs gate dams and some ponds in the flow stream the river length formed by artificial force is greater than half of the natural river length arr 0 54 although channelized river channel is relatively small in whole nanliu river basin cr 0 06 but it is highly concentrated in city areas artificial levee length accounts for 5 72 of the total natural river length alr 0 06 in addition we clearly found that road network in whole basin is closelyconnected with river network with a high rarr value 0 38 primarily due to the contribution of township roads this suggested that approximate 38 28 of natural river length was closely attached by roads a total of 19 artificial cutoff projects were found in the upper basin yulin city and beiliu city and middle basin bobai county in fig 5 eighteen man made cutoff projects were built in high sinuosity reaches and these river channel lengths were sharply shortened after project construction fig 5 the sac values of these projects range from 1 33 to 9 99 and the average is 2 67 which means that 18 31 km of 30 79 km of the total length of natural sinuous reaches were eliminated by these projects it was also found that most artificial cutoff projects were located in the main stream and in the upper basin in yulin city including yuzhou and fumian districts a relatively well developed city with a large population the period 2000 2016 is said as goldenyears for sand mining in nanliu river basin li et al 2017 sand mining was conservativelyestimated to 4395 40 mt based on its volume 3139 60 104 m3 and density 1 4 ton m 3 cumulative sediment discharge at changle station during 2000 2016 was approximately 1250 66 mt that adds 10 of suspended load discharge fig 6 as bed load discharge wang 1986 the sediment from human mining was estimated as 2 51 times that of river transport astr 2 51 which implied that anthropogenic force became the dominant force in sand transport fig 7 shows the results of the impact of human activity in the whole nanliu river basin clearly there is a large gap in the nine index values the values of awsr dlcr sac and astr are high while the remaining indices belong to the other group with low values according to equation 11 with an equal weight the value of irsii is 0 49 that belongs to artificial control degree which suggests that anthropogenic force instead of natural force became a controlling power of change of river structure in the nanliu river system 3 2 2 sub basin situations table 4 and fig 8 show the influence of different human activities on river structure in the sub basins it is clear that awsr awsdr dlcr and rarr form a group with dense high values in most sub basins and that other indicators arr cr and alr are a separate group with few high values these findings imply that artificial water bodies interaction between roads and rivers and disruption of longitudinalconnectivity were big issues for entire basin while other issues were only relevant for a few sub basins in general the largest influence on river structure resides in the upper basin relatively developed area and lower basin estuary region specifically qingwan dingchuan rendong beiliu fumian and li river sub basins in the upper basin and yama river and zhou river sub basins in the lower basin comprise a typical high cluster region for the 7 indicator values fig 8 from the viewpoint of awsr the ma river and the hongchaojiang sub basins were at the maximum 22 63 and 21 95 and the minimum was the estuary sub basin 0 41 there are large gaps between these sub basins which is mainly due to the impact of some large reservoirs for example the two large reservoirs hongchaojiang reservoir 7 14 108 m3 and hepu reservoir 12 47 108 m3 of the nanliu river basin are located in the ma river sub basin and hongchaojiang sub basin therefore the awsdr values of these basins are highest other dams and ponds built in tributaries were relatively small although these projects created small water surface they have greatly changed the river structure on a small scale all sub basins had a very high dlcr values including 70 of sub basins with more than 50 times of the ideal condition in another word all sub basins in the nanliu river basin were in very bad condition regarding longitudinal connectivity this was probably the result of using irrigation in the service of agriculture livestock breeding and the jeans industry and in providing hydropower for example li river basin was highlighted with an inconceivable value dlcr 159 10 that is mainly attributed to the pig industry a traditional small family business most artificial channels are located in upper basins such as the rendong basin arr 2 30 qingwan sub basin arr 1 99 li river sub basin arr 1 55 and fumian bobai sub basin arr 1 26 artificial channel lengths in these basins are greater than their natural river lengths table 4 flood banks and river channelization were usually built in urban areas with dense populations and affluence such as the urban area in the yuzhou district pubei county and hepu county fig 9 most channelized channels were intensivelybuilt in qingwan cr 0 36 estuary cr 0 29 and beiliu fumian cr 0 16 sub basins while cr values of the rest of sub basins are less than 0 06 all sub basins have big differences in alr values between the maximum 0 44 and minimum 0 the zhou river and estuary sub basins both are located in the estuary area of the nanliu river basin where there are multiple channels obviously the alr values of these two sub basins were up to 0 44 and 0 38 respectively and much higher than other sub basins because more flood bank construction are very necessary for these areas the situation of the road network along the river system is very common in all sub basins of the study area the rarr range is from 0 74 to 0 15 with an average of 0 38 this finding is mostly observed because the nanliu river basin is densely populated and most people live along the river system in addition reservoirs dams and farmland need roads for access 4 discussion to our knowledge this is the first study to develop an indicator system to assess human impacts on river structure from the viewpoint of a comparison between anthropogenic and natural forces the proposed indicator system similar to landscape indicators such as forest cover detenbeck et al 1993 could provide a direct measure of human alteration in a basin evaluating the change in river structure offers new insights into the influence of human activity on river systems compared to traditional indicator systems such as chemical biotic hydrological and habitat the river structure viewpoint is more direct simpler and more visible simple metrics proposed in this study may be most useful gergel et al 2002 rinaldi et al 2013 due to its easiness to connect public interests and management weber and ringold 2019 for example no 16 project in fig 5 sac 9 9 showed that the sinuous channel was replaced by only 10 straight channel 0 28 km of the original length 2 78 km thus a flood could quickly pour through yulin city which is easy to calculate understand and explain to the public and management even without backgroundknowledge furthermore the proposed indicator system in this study has been designed to compare the accumulative outcomes of natural and anthropogenic forces until a given time thus this method does not need to set a reference condition to compare which enhances its practicality because the reference conditions historical or natural always limits many methods e g riv pacs mqi with the same assessment conducted in different time periods this method can be used to detect the change of river structure and change of its natural and anthropogenic forces in other words this method could track the impact of human activities on river structure this assessment indicator system spans a broad spatial extent with adequate resolution and accuracy that are fundamentally scientific these indices focus on the surface characteristics of river structures that are more easily and more economically acquired by rs and gis techniques than other methods e g ibi riv pacs and iha on a large scale some free platforms for data sources such as google earth map world of guangxi the united states geological survey the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc provide free access to data this method needed this is very helpful for wide applications of the method we believe that the proposed indicators and methods can be applied in multiple ways because they could be simple straightforward effectively and easily understood by different people including scientists planners managers and the general public our findings in nanliu river basin have implied that river functions have been degraded because of high modification of river structure for example the decrease of transporting function of sediment entering the sea is due to human activities such as hydraulic engineering and forest conservation li et al 2017 the basin management strategy should focus on river restoration in the future according to the highlighted high values of dlcr rarr awsr arr and astr for the whole basin prioritizing stream restoration actions in the nanliu river basin probably is 1 to remove migration barriers corresponding to the dlcr 2 to restore watershed processes such as instream flows sediment reduction and riparian areas corresponding to the dlcr astr awsr and rarr and 3 to enhance instream habitats corresponding to the dlcr and arr these are consistent with the recommended strategies and citations from beechie et al 2008 accordingly the priority areas for restoration are the seven sub basins qingwan rendong dingchuan beiliu fumian li river yama river and zhou river which have high values of the abovementioned indices fig 8 the qingwan rendong dingchuan beiliu fumian and li river basins are relatively developed areas fig 2 and are under high pressure from population density and economic development prioritization for the removal of artificial in stream structures to enhance river connectivity to activate river vigor in a cost effective way o hanley 2011 is probably a viable solution for the nanliu river basin for example the removal of these dams is a growing movement in the united states to restore rivers roy et al 2018 this is because these dams aging or problem infrastructures roy et al 2018 which have lost their original functions have negative ecological or indigenous impacts or are expensive to maintain roy et al 2018 according to the astr value 2 51 for the whole basin we realized that sand mining in the study area far exceeded the natural process illegal sand mining in downstream of the nanliu river has been reported many times and has attracted the attention of government officials and the public because it caused a series of direct problems such as intrusion of farmland and banks induction of social contradictions destruction of riverbeds as well as some indirect problems li et al 2017 for example the riverbed width of a reach of the main stream in shiwan town hepo county was expanded from the original 100 m to 500 m due to illegal sand mining astr value can assist water managers in realizing the seriousness of the problem and help them make the decision to stop sand mining instead of only against illegal sand mining the high values of awsr awsdr arr and dlcr in fig 8 indicate that the demand of irrigation water usage is large it can also be seen in table 2 that irrigation is the main purposes of water projects agriculture is the basis for human survival in this basin consuming up to 65 5 guangxi water resources bulletin in 2016 of total water use to feed approximately 4 06 million people however the efficiency coefficient of irrigation water usage in the nanliu river basin approximately 0 47 is much smaller than the national level 0 54 and smaller than the level in guangxi 0 48 thus the efficiency of irrigation water use should be improved through agronomic techniques irrigation systems engineering and demand based irrigation scheduling in general the proposed indicator system in this study performed well in the nanliu river basin because it has captured its major issues of ecologicalenvironment and provided suitable management strategy and key regions for the nanliu river basin this assessment indicator system could identify the changes of river structure and functions and help river restoration thus it could be attempted to integrate with the river restoration method based on fluvial geomorphology river structure such as the river style framework brierley and fryirs 2000 brierley et al 2011 brierley and fryirs 2016 to develop a flexible simplified and cost effective management programme for chinese river restoration for instance the reform restoring rivers for effective catchment management that provided an open ended hydromorphology framework to support cost effective implementation of restoration measures in restoring river ecosystems in europe was built heavily on the river style framework gurnell et al 2016 three limitations of this study should be noted first the accuracyof the data may be not very high for example some instream structures might be missed because of the lower resolution of remote sensing images second we did not take into account the effect of multicollinearityamong these indicators third more cases should be conducted to validate the applicability of this indicator system 5 conclusions we developed an indicator system that included 9 indicators awsr awsdr dlcr arr sac cr alr rarr and astr and an integrated river structure impact index irsii to assess the influence of human activities on river system structure the natural and anthropogenic forces within a river system were compared through measuring changes in the structures with gis and rs techniques the case study of the nanliu river basin showed that the river has become an artificialriver according to irsii 0 49 which suggest that anthropogenic forces are large than natural forces in general specifically the artificialwater surface area and length are both larger than the natural ones the artificialsediment discharge is 2 51 times that of the natural process astr 2 51 furthermore an average of 41 18 human made buildings was installed in a 100 km river channel the road and river networks interact considerably and 38 28 of total natural river network is side by side with the road network we noticed that sub basins with high values are the qingwan dingchuan beiliu fumian rendong li river yama river and zhou river sub basins in future the restoration strategy of the nanliu river basin should focus on river connectivity sand mining and irrigation issues author contributions all authors contributed significantly to this work yinjun zhao designed the framework and wrote the manuscript lan zeng junming liu
