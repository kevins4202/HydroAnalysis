155,nitrate contamination of aquifers is threatening the sustainability of water resource production around the globe denitrification is an ubiquitous process in groundwater systems and needs to be represented in managerial and predictive efforts yet fully understanding the temporal and spatial dynamics of all biogeochemical and physical properties controlling nitrate reduction at the basin scale remains a challenging task conceptual simplifications such as homogenization are used but their implications on model performance are often not well assessed this paper 1 analyzes the importance of denitrification spatial variability on the fate of non point source nitrate contamination and 2 assesses the performance of upscaled denitrification rate coefficient values heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity of a typical unconsolidated alluvial aquifer system and its associated uncertainty is systematically represented in our 3d numerical simulations of flow and transport the spatial variability in the nitrate reduction capacities of the aquifer is accounted for by 3 different conceptual models a positive and a negative correlation with the aquifer hydraulic properties and a uniform random distribution our results indicate that heterogeneity in the denitrification rate coefficient as well as the model describing spatial variability has a significant impact on concentration statistics observed at a series of extraction wells however we also show that under the modeling setting used in this study e g stationarity of reactivity upscaled values of denitrification rate coefficients allow a virtually perfect reproduction of nitrate concentration statistics a promising outcome for employing parameter estimation calibration of effective rate coefficients of denitrification a detailed description of the spatial variability of the nitrate reduction capacity of the alluvial aquifer is not necessary yet these homogeneous upscaled denitrification rate coefficients result from a complex interaction between the biochemistry and the physics of the aquifer which makes their direct estimation a challenging task graphical abstract

variability in local conditions of controlling parameters however cause denitrification to be spatially variable both within and among aquifers a large body of studies have highlighted the spatial variability in dissolved oxygen concentrations schroth et al 1998 in bacteria growth and activity sandrin et al 2004 and of denitrification rates landon et al 2011 green et al 2016 2018 understanding aquifer systems contaminated by nitrate is further challenged by the spatial variability in the physical properties of aquifers dagan and nguyen 1989 this heterogeneity renders the prediction of the fate and transport of nps contaminants complex guo et al 2019 and uncertain hua and harter 2006 henri and harter 2019 physical heterogeneity can also trigger a series of linked processes controlling the reduction of nitrate e g ben maamar et al 2015 for instance it has been shown that changes in the lithology can cause a significant increase in the supply of electron donors tesoriero and puckett 2011 and can generate localized denitrification at a redox interface hansen et al 2014 koch et al 2019 denitrification capacities of an aquifer are strongly influenced by rock type lindsey et al 2003 show that denitrification is more likely to occur in unconsolidated rocks sandstone shale and siltstone than in crystalline and carbonate rocks present in the same basins denitrification has also been linked to groundwater age with observation of greater nitrate reduction for older water lindsey et al 2003 tesoriero et al 2007 yet clearly identifying the major controlling factors of the spatial variability in denitrification remains challenging and its impact on nitrate concentration dynamics is not well understood different approaches have been used to simulate biodegradation in aquifers for example loschko et al 2016 introduce a methodology to simplify aquifer scale nonlinear reactive transport and apply the method to model denitrification following michaelis menten kinetics at the sub regional scale the authors develop the concept of cumulative relative reactivity by disregarding dispersion and integrating groundwater age and reactivity along water parcel trajectories in order to improve the model efficiency yet the conceptual complexity of concentration controlled enzymatic reactions described by the michaelis menten model are in many applications replaced with simpler linear first order kinetics even though key processes are well understood the associated spatial variability of the system suggests the need to derive upscaled homogenized degradation rate coefficients for more efficient modeling assessments green et al 2010 these upscaled effective rate coefficients would need to integrate the spatial variability of but also the potential interactions between flow paths and biogeochemical conditions few studies e g miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996 harter 2002 henri and fernàndez garcia 2014 looked at the impact of spatial variability in both the hydraulic conductivity and in first order reaction rate coefficients on transport these studies focused on hypothetical contamination cases using a semi analytical approach e g low degree of heterogeneity point source no extraction however the degree to which heterogeneous reaction rate coefficients and related effective coefficients impact predictions of management metrics e g travel times nitrate concentration has not yet been reported in a realistic setting in this study we analyze the potential implication of spatial variability in denitrification rate coefficients within a heterogeneous unconsolidated alluvial aquifer at the subregional scale nitrate contamination from nonpoint sources typically affects pollution in a large number of production wells different conceptual models are considered regarding the relationship between denitrification rate coefficient and aquifer structure we consider positive correlation between denitrification rate coefficients and hydraulic conductivity a negative correlation with hydraulic conductivity and a random uniform distribution of denitrification rate coefficients uncorrelated to aquifer hydraulic conductivity following this comparative analysis the use of effective uniform denitrification rate coefficients is tested evaluated and discussed 2 methods we focus on a synthetic case of an agriculture related nitrate contamination in a heterogeneous unconsolidated alluvial aquifer using here the central valley ca usa as a case study the climate is semi arid mediterranean characterized by dry summer and winter precipitation mostly on the surrounding mountain range central valley s aquifers are extensively exploited to sustain an intensive irrigated agricultural industry under natural conditions mountain front recharge and thalweg discharge to streams drive mostly lateral flow within the aquifer system but eight decades of increasing pumping and irrigation has added a significant vertical component to the mean flow today a significant portion of recharge occurs from the irrigated landscape faunt 2009 recharge water typically caries high amounts of agricultural nps pollutants such as nitrate no 3 baram et al 2016 no 3 is transferred into groundwater and denitrification occurs along the solute path toward extraction wells early geochemical characterization of the central valley aquifer system distinguished between a generally oxidized zone comprising the upper tens to few hundred meters of the aquifer system and a reduced zone below often associated with the location of the so called e clay croft 1972 the oxidized zone of this aquifer system also has the least salinity most production occurs within this 150 m 300 m thick zone faunt 2009 subsequent studies of the oxidized region of the aquifer system highlighted the great local spatial variability in redox conditions landon et al 2011 green et al 2016 and identified zones of denitrification green et al 2010 liao et al 2012 as well as zones of near zero nitrate reduction jurgens et al 2008 the rate of nitrate reduction in this oxidized zone is therefore assumed to vary spatially it is this oxidized zone that is the focus of this work within the lower reduced zone denitrification is generally assumed to be rapid although croft 1972 identifies some oxidized horizons buried below sometimes tens of meters of reducing sediments in this study we consider steady state flow conditions utilizing long term average recharge nitrate loading and pumping conditions bastani and harter 2020 in a previous study henri et al 2020 10 year representative time series of recharge and nitrate loading rates were estimated through a series of hydrus simulations temporal averages over these time series are used here while short term temporal variation in the flow field e g seasonal changes pumping schedule is unlikely to significantly impact well concentration signals bastani and harter 2020 the potential effect of longer trends e g climate change land use is not accounted for in this study the following paragraphs detail the rationale and approach adopted to represent the spatial variability and uncertainty in the aquifer hydraulic conductivity and nitrate reduction capacity to solve the flow and transport equations and to homogenize denitrification rate coefficients 2 1 hydraulic conductivity spatial variability the spatial distribution of the aquifer hydraulic conductivity k presents uncertainty that is accounted for by means of a geostatistical model rubin 2003 weissmann and fogg 1999a a series of equally probable realizations of the hydrofacies field are generated using tprogs a geostatistical approach based on the transition probability markov chain method carle 1999 the aquifer is conceptualized by a rectangular prism with length l x 19200 0 m width l y 6000 0 m and thickness l z 250 0 m table 1 the geostatistical parameters mean lengths facies proportions facies to facies transition probability rates are set to be representative of a central valley aquifer weissmann and fogg 1999a b and are given in tables 2 and 3 a random realization of the resulting k field is displayed in fig 1 a total of 50 realizations are generated which has been shown to be sufficient for the convergence of the k fields the mean velocities basic statistics mean and variance and the concentration statistics henri et al 2020 2 2 denitrification spatial variability models in this study the denitrification process is assumed to follow first order dynamics which is valid when contaminant concentrations are relatively low below the michaelis half saturation constant cunningham and mendoza sanchez 2006 the natural capacity of the aquifer to degrade nitrate is furthermore assumed to vary spatially given the range of interactions between major physical and biogeochemical factors controlling the reduction of no 3 three different spatial variability models of the first order denitrification rate coefficient k are considered k log k positive correlation in this scenario greater denitrification rate coefficients are expected in coarse material cozzarelli et al 1999 cunningham and fadel 2007 such observation could be made when clayed materials decrease the bioavailability of nutrients and electron acceptors while coarser materials favor the availability and activity of biomass lien et al 2014 the denitrification rate coefficient are then related to the local k values as 1 k x a b log k x k log k negative correlation negative correlations have been previously studied under idealized conditions miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996 cunningham and fadel 2007 henri and fernàndez garcia 2015 in unconsolidated sediments fine grained and poorly conductive material e g clay is commonly associated with an increased presence of electron donors such as organic matter and pyrite which favors reducing conditions and high denitrification rate coefficients in this scenario the denitrification rate coefficient is estimated by adapting the factors a and b in eq 1 k random distribution given the frequent lack of information on the spatial variability of aquifer denitrification capacities a uniform random distribution of the denitrification rate coefficient at a small spatial scale is considered this case does not consider any correlation with hydraulic aquifer properties the scenario is also representative of conditions where facies contrasts in denitrification rate coefficients are negligible when compared to intra facies variability of denitrification rate coefficients in this case k is independent from the local k values and is estimated as 2 k x k m i n r k m a x k m i n where r is a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1 assigned to individual simulation cells table 1 for all spatial variability models the minimum and maximum values of k are set to 10 6 d 1 and 10 4 d 1 respectively in case of positive correlation the parameters a and b in eq 1 are given by 3 b k m a x k m i n log k m a x log k m i n a k m i n b log k m i n where k m a x k m i n k m a x k m i n are the minimum and maximum values of denitrification rate coefficient and hydraulic conductivity respectively in case of negative correlation the same parameters are given by 4 b k m a x k m i n log k m i n log k m a x a k m i n b log k m a x the range of first order denitrification rate coefficient is inspired by the work of green et al 2010 who estimated apparent k values in an aquifer in the eastern san joaquin valley central valley ca using inverse modeling the sensitivity of concentration statistics to the denitrification rate coefficient is illustrated in appendix a this range of values results in average k values over all realizations of about 5 10 5 d 1 for all scenarios for a given spatial variability model the spatially averaged denitrification rate coefficient does not significantly differ among realizations highlighting ergodic conditions see histograms in supplementary information figures s1 the nature of the correlation between the denitrification rate coefficient and the hydraulic conductivity remains uncertain to qualify in a theoretical study one may correlate k to the log k as we decided to do inspired by the work of miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996 yet it could also be considered to correlate k values to k or log k to log k an imperfect correlation could also be contemplated by adding a noise in the relation in eq 1 a series of alternative scenarios is presented and analyzed in the supplementary information to ascertain that the conclusive remarks presented here remain valid for other correlation structures for all simulations the geostatistical representation of denitrification is assumed to be stationary from the water table to the bottom of the aquifer thus our simulation does not consider a vertical gradient of the aquifer reactivity which may be caused by depletion of electron donors in the aquifer matrix e g loschko et al 2018 kolbe et al 2019 the large thickness of the oxidized aquifer system and depth of the pumping wells area of interest may minimize the impact of variable redox conditions in this zone future work is needed to further determine the long term transient behavior of aquifer denitrification which is neglected in the following analysis 2 3 source terms both the recharge and the nitrate leaching rates are soil type and crop dependent and are therefore spatially variable for each realization the soil map is assumed to be identical to the top layer of the geostatistically described hydrofacies field the spatial distribution of 6 predominant crops in the central valley landscapes almond citrus corn cotton grain and grapes is randomly generated uniform distribution once and is therefore identical in all realizations for each soil type crop combination the effective recharge and nitrate leaching rates are estimated through a hydrus šimunek et al 2016 simulation of 1d unsaturated flow and transport simulations more details are provided by henri et al 2020 2 4 flow and transport flow for each of the 50 realizations flow and transport are numerically solved the hydraulic head field is computed by solving the steady state groundwater flow equation 5 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z q s 0 where q s is the volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources and sinks of water d 1 and h m is the hydraulic head groundwater fluxes are described by darcy s law 6 q x k x h x where q m d 1 is the specific discharge the heterogeneous flow field is solved using modflow harbaugh et al 2000 the model includes three extraction wells located on a transect near the downstream edge of the domain we fix the extraction rate of each well q o u t to 3000 0 m 3 d 1 and the depth of the top of the screens to 100 0 m the length of the well screens depends on the vertical distribution of highly conductive material 10 cumulative feet 3 05 m of gravel and sand are needed for every 100 gallon per minute 545 m 3 d 1 of pumping the flow is in part controlled by a longitudinal gradient of 1 1 0 3 additionally recharge mostly from irrigation applies a significant vertical gradient that is further accentuated by a downward flux imposed at the bottom of the domain representing additional extractions near and below the bottom of the simulation domain transport in this study the reactive transport of nitrate in the aquifer is calculated by 7 ϕ c k t q c k k ϕ c k s x y t where c k is the solute concentration g m 3 ϕ is the porosity k is the first order denitrification rate coefficient and s x y t g m 3 d 1 is the source term describing the rate coefficient of contaminant mass released from the nonpoint source located in any x and y at the top of the domain we account for advection only i e grid scale dispersion and diffusion is considered negligible this assumption has been extensively used to simplify the mathematical framework of reactive transport e g tartakovsky et al 2009 broyda et al 2010 loschko et al 2016 in our model setting the dominant role of macro dispersion is explicitly simulated by resolving the heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity field at fine resolution leading to representative plume spreading previously weissmann et al 2002 used a similar modeling setup geostatistics flow discretization showing that grid scale dispersivities have a minimal impact on the reproduction of groundwater ages obtained by radiometric dating data similarly henri et al 2020 which presents the model used in this study shows that even larger dispersivity values 1 5 m have a insignificant impact on transport and mass arrival to exploitation wells we simulate a pulse injection of nitrate mass representing a single year of nitrate loading concentration breakthrough curves are evaluated at the three explicitly simulated extraction wells c k t the superposition principle can then be used to predict concentration signals in each well from a constant and continuous release of mass from the source as 8 c k t 0 t c k t τ reactive transport is solved using rw3d a lagrangian tracking code using transition probabilities to simulate coupled transport and first order decay networks fernàndez garcia et al 2005 henri and fernàndez garcia 2014 2015 for comparison purpose we conduct two sets of stochastic simulation modeling a conservative solute to evaluate c k 0 t and c k 0 t at each extraction well and modeling a reactive nitrate plume to evaluate c k t and c k t 2 5 homogenization of denitrification rate coefficients concentration btcs resulting from nitrate transport in an aquifer with spatially homogeneous decay rate coefficients k can be directly computed from conservative solute transport simulations 9 c k t exp k t c k 0 t where c k 0 is the concentration resulting from a pulse release of a conservative solute at the source all mass injected at t 0 in this study we estimate the effective decay rate coefficient k as being the equivalent homogeneous decay rate coefficient that leads to a total breakthrough mass approximately equal to the total mass from the heterogeneous simulations i e 10 lim k k t 0 c k τ c k τ d τ 0 where c k is obtained using 9 a similar approach allowing the determination of effective decay rate coefficients could be adopted using concentration signals from a continuous mass injection c k obtained using eq 8 this is done for each recorded breakthrough curve i e each well of each realization 3 results and discussion a total of 150 50 realizations 3 wells values of equally probable nitrate concentration simulated in extracted groundwater can be obtained from the stochastic analysis statistics of relevant metrics revealing the uncertainty due to heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity can then be analyzed here we present and discuss the implications of different models of the spatial variability in denitrification rate coefficients on concentration percentiles and travel time statistics henceforth the 10th etc concentration percentile p10 etc shall refer to the concentration exceeded in 10 etc of the monte carlo realizations the 5th percentile etc arrival time p5 etc shall refer to the arrival time of the first 5 etc of all simulated solute particles that break through at the well screen the 10th percentile etc of the breakthrough curve concentration shall refer to the concentration exceeded by 10 etc of wells 3 1 spatial variability of denitrification rate coefficients concentration percentiles denitrification results in a reduction of nitrate concentration of 50 to 65 depending on the spatial variability model fig 2 the uniformly distributed random denitrification rate coefficient and the negatively correlated model yields a similar reduction of no 3 when denitrification rate coefficients are positively correlated with hydraulic conductivity overall nitrate removal is larger than when denitrification rate coefficients are negatively correlated with hydraulic conductivity this difference is less pronounced for the concentrations 10th percentile p 10 when compared to the 50th median and 90th percentiles fig 2a the overall lower no 3 removal in simulations with negative k k correlation relative to those with positive k k correlation contrasts with the spatial mean k values being slightly 2 higher for the negative k k correlation figure sm1 to explain this apparent discrepancy it is important to recall that the travel paths for solutes are identical regardless of whether k values are positively or negatively correlated to k values the fact that overall no 3 removal is larger in the simulation with a positive k log k correlation indicates that the solute that arrives at the extraction well is likely to travel preferentially in the higher conductivity coarser facies despite the relatively smaller volumetric fraction of coarser facies in the negatively correlated k log k model the solute would similarly spent a relatively larger fraction of its travel time in the coarse high conductivity facies when that facies is associated with the lowest denitrification rate coefficient k that leads to the overall lower no 3 removal understanding this potential interplay between aquifer heterogeneity and no 3 reducing potential is therefore a key aspect to be characterized to effectively manage such large scale nitrate contamination as shown in supplementary information figures s2 s4 this difference in effective denitrification potential resulting from a positive and negative k log k correlation is also observed in case of similar correlations between k and k and between log k log k with and without noise the impact of the k k correlation on concentration statistics across a well network while significant are relatively small a compared to the overall decline in concentration due to denitrification i e when considering the difference to the conservative tracer for the p10 p50 and p90 btcs in fig 2 and b compared to the much wider range of concentration across a large number of production wells i e the difference in the p10 p50 and p90 btcs at any given time in fig 2 the latter is the result of the heterogeneous k within the aquifer system that said the spatially variable denitrification further adds to the variability of concentrations across a large set of regional wells and analogously adds significantly to the relative uncertainty about concentration at any one well in fig 2 this is reflected by the relatively larger decline in concentration relative to the conservative tracer for breakthrough curves of increasing exceedance probability arrival times next we analyze the probability density functions of the time required for a given fraction of the total mass recorded to reach an extraction well e g t 50 is the time required for 50 of the total mass observed in a well to be extracted results display a significant shift to earlier arrivals under denitrification conditions when compared to a conservative solute fig 3 such earlier arrival times can be for example associated to a quicker effective outcome of management actions for reactive transport the choice of denitrification model has no discernable impact on the early arrival statistics fig 3a however the different denitrification correlation models differ slightly in their later arrival times fig 3c a randomly distributed k or a negative k log k correlation leads to overall earlier arrivals the positive k log k correlation produces slightly later late arrival times fig 3c than a negative k k correlation uncertainty in late arrival times is significantly reduced by removal of nitrate through denitrification when compared to a conservative solute fig 3c the reduction in overall travel time when denitrification affects no 3 transport is due to the fact that no 3 along the slowest longest travel paths to the extraction wells is subject to the longest period of denitrification with correspondingly higher probability of complete denitrification prior to arrival thus denitrification suppresses late arrivals increasing the relative probability of earlier arrivals when compared to conservative solute transport however a positive k log k correlation produces less denitrification in low k i e low velocity areas allowing for some of the longer travel times to be less affected by denitrification than nitrate in faster flow paths along the high conductivity zone this provides for more viable late nitrate arrivals than in case of a negative k log k correlation for the latter reactive mass experiencing low velocities is also experiencing the highest degradation rate and is therefore more likely to be degraded before having the potential to produce late arrival times the large uncertainty in late arrival times that characterizes the transport of a conservative solute is due to the non negligible probability of long residence times in low velocity zones this behavior produces tailing in the travel time p d f s e g haggerty et al 2000 gouze et al 2008 nitrate in these low velocity zones is likely to be reduced under denitrification conditions burnell et al 2014 which decreases the tailing behavior in travel time p d f s and therefore reduces uncertainty about late time concentrations henri and fernàndez garcia 2014 for the alternative correlation models we tested k k and log k log k with and without noise we observe similar behavior supplementary information figures s5 s7 3 2 homogeneous effective denitrification rate coefficient performance the temporal evolution of well concentrations using an effective homogeneous denitrification rate coefficient k is semi analytically evaluated for each realization separately for each denitrification spatial variability model using eq 9 for further comparison concentration statistics are also computed for breakthrough curves that use two alternative homogenizations of the denitrification rate a the realization specific spatially average aquifer denitrification rate coefficient k and b the realization specific flux weighted average over the entire domain denitrification rate coefficient k f w for a positive k log k correlation utilizing a spatially averaged denitrification rate coefficient slightly overestimates all concentration fig 4 left panels for a negative k log k correlation using the spatially averaged k leads to a good representation of p 50 an underestimation of the highest concentrations p 10 and a slight overestimation of the lowest concentrations p 90 fig 4 middle panels for the uniformly distributed model using k in the transport model overestimates lowest concentration p 50 and p 90 but reproduces the highest concentrations p 10 reasonably well fig 4 right panels using k f w partially improves predictions of all concentration statistics for the two k log k correlation models concentration percentiles produced for a randomly distributed k remains unchanged compared to simulations using k as the effective homogeneous denitrification rate coefficient on the other hand simulations using k generate almost identical concentration statistics when compared to the heterogeneous rate monte carlo simulation results whatever the k spatial variability model fig 4 importantly the homogenization predicts accurate concentration statistics across the entire breakthrough period including the early onset of breakthrough and the late time behavior in case of negative k log k correlation a simple spatial averaging of k over the domain k will misrepresent the fact that a significant portion of the transport occurs in high k i e low k paths leading to an overestimation of nitrate reduction most prominently observed on the highest concentrations p 10 a flux weighted average k f w as an effective homogeneous denitrification rate coefficient partially corrects this approximation the opposite phenomenon is observed in case of a positive k log k correlation the under representation of highly denitrifying high k areas by using k leads to an underestimation of effective denitrification and to slightly higher concentration statistics nevertheless this slight overestimation of concentrations remains a conservative estimate for contamination management employing a spatially averaged denitrification rate coefficient in a forward simulation approach with homogeneous denitrification provides a reasonable simulation option that reproduces highest concentrations that is often the only range of interest in case of nitrate contamination if a positive k log k correlation or a random distribution of k values can be assumed however this approach would require local measurements of denitrification rates across sites or aquifers of interest these data are typically not available while use of k f w would be preferable we are not aware of field methods to determine k f w for such small reaction rate coefficients the most promising and accurate approach to representing spatially variable denitrification rate coefficients with an effective homogeneous rate coefficient is to instead obtain k by calibration against measured nitrate concentration breakthrough curves given known water table nitrate input at the regional scale simulating denitrification as a homogeneous process a calibrated effective denitrification rate coefficient k provides a reliable tool to predict future nitrate concentration even under conditions of spatially variable denitrification rate coefficients similar conclusions can be drawn while using a k k and a log k log k with and without noise correlation supplementary information figures s8 s10 reaction based mixing index to better understand how heterogeneity and the interaction between geologic texture and geochemical processes influences nitrate reduction we calculate the ratio between k the effective denitrification rate coefficient and k the spatially averaged denitrification rate coefficient as well as the ratio between k and k f w the flux weighted averaged denitrification rate coefficient for each realization and for each spatial variability model these ratios can be interpreted as a reaction based mixing index indicating a system fully mixed when k k 1 a ratio k k lower than 1 is associated with transport that favors zones of low reduction potential and vice versa for k k 1 the reaction based mixing index is estimated for each well and each realization 150 values and we here present the associated pdfs a random uncorrelated distribution of k is characterized by a very high probability of an effective denitrification rate coefficient equal to the average denitrification rate coefficient fig 5 the pdf also displays a positive tailing indicating a low but non negligible probability for k to be larger than k this further illustrates the overestimation of concentrations when a spatially averaged k is used a positive k log k correlation generates a pdf of k k 1 that is positively skewed and with a peak slightly exceeding 1 fig 5 on the other hand a negative k k correlation leads to slightly lower k k ratios and limits the pdf s positive skewness by considering flux weighted averaged denitrification rate coefficients the ratios k k f w for a positive k log k correlation are more aligned with those for a negative k log k correlation with a peak of probability nearer to 1 0 when transport occurs in highly connected channels as often observed in heterogeneous formations associating high denitrification rate coefficients to high k areas positive correlation would favor nitrate reduction which increases the probability to observe effective rate coefficients higher than mean rate coefficients inversely when relatively low denitrification is associated with the high k areas negative correlation lower effective denitrification rate coefficients are observed in this sense the results highlight the potential interplay between effective reactivity and aquifer heterogeneity similarly a spatially averaged k underestimates effective reaction rate coefficients when denitrification rate coefficients are uniformly distributed in this setting particles are degraded before convergence toward the mean due to transport through high k area in this situation the effective denitrification rate coefficient will be higher than the spatially averaged rate coefficient lowest concentration due to increased reduction will be overestimated as shown in fig 4 previously miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996 stochastically analyzed the impact of k log k correlations on effective reaction rate coefficients and transport parameters mainly the authors found effective decay rate coefficients to be less than the mean independently of the k log k correlation model which differs from our results a series of differences in the modeling settings can explain this first we do not use the perturbation theory to represent the spatial variability of k as does miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996 but account for it without limits to the size of perturbation using monte carlo flow and transport simulation furthermore the heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity is conceptualized differently in miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996 it is described using a perturbation function leading to a σ ln k 0 29 this study uses a hydrogeologic facies based geostatistical model leading to a much larger σ ln k 14 8 in our case solute may preferentially be transported to the well screen through one or two facies with either a large or small denitrification rate coefficient this will generate effective k values that can be either smaller or larger than the mean k values controlling factors for practical application it us useful to further consider what drives the magnitude of the effective denitrification rate coefficient and whether the relationship between k and log k is reflected in measurable outcomes at wells the analysis of potential correlations between the effective denitrification rate coefficient and arrival times t 5 or t 95 indicates weak but significant trends k tends to increase with arrival times in case of a positive k log k correlation with a low correlation factor r 2 0 1 and 0 03 for a correlation with t 5 and t 95 respectively in contrast k tends to decrease with arrival times for a negative correlation with a even lower correlation factor r 2 0 02 and 0 15 for a correlation with t 5 and t 95 respectively fig 6 this suggests that understanding nitrate travel time for nitrate relative to conservative tracers and considering the relationship to effective calibrated denitrification rates may provide some insights on the aquifer k log k relationship early arrivals reflect transport occurring favorably in connected high k paths characterized by high k values in case of a positive k log k correlation increasing the effective denitrification rate coefficient the opposite would happen in case of a negative k log k correlation transport in paths of low k values decreasing k yet this relationship between arrival times and effective denitrification remains weak and imperfect fig 6 analyzing transport indicators only does not provide sufficient predictive information about the effective denitrification rate coefficient the effective denitrification rate coefficient instead reflects the more complex cross interaction between physical heterogeneity controlling transport patterns and the spatial variability of denitrification rate coefficients globally nps are characterized by a higher degree of mixing within wells capturing a large volume of aquifer and making connected paths of high k or low k values depending on the correlation model a relatively less important controlling factor than would be expected for point source pollution this increased mixing 1 explains the only minor differences observed between the different models of spatial variability in denitrification fig 2 2 allows a good performance of spatially averaged denitrification rates fig 4 to reproduce concentration statistics and 3 explains the weak correlation between effective denitrification rate coefficients and travel times fig 6 4 conclusions denitrification is a key process that needs to be well represented to accurately assess the long term impacts of nitrate non point source contamination on production wells or receiving streams the spatial variability in nitrate reduction within an aquifer is particularly challenging to describe given the large scale of nps contamination and the diversity and the complexity of the biogeochemical and physical processes within the underlying large aquifer system this work investigates the relevance of an explicit description of the spatial variability in denitrification rate coefficient when nitrate concentration in extraction wells located in a large 3d unconsolidated alluvial aquifer system is of concern the heterogeneity in denitrification is described as a stationary process over the entire aquifer i e no vertical gradient in reactivity or explicitly defined geochemical zones uncorrelated to aquifer facies variability are considered under such conditions our results conclude that the spatial variability in the denitrification rate coefficient described at the scale of aquifer structural heterogeneity or at an even finer scale has a moderate but significant impact on concentration statistics recorded for an ensemble of extraction wells the conceptualization of the heterogeneity in the aquifer denitrification rate coefficients and its relationship to hydraulic properties can significantly control concentration behavior across the ensemble of production wells on the other hand we demonstrate that even for these highly variable denitrification rate coefficients accurate simulation results can be obtained without explicitly considering spatial variability in denitrification a homogenized effective rate coefficient k reproduces virtually perfect nitrate concentration statistics regardless of the particular structure of the heterogeneity in the denitrification rate coefficient this is an important finding given the practical difficulties to characterize the spatial distribution of biogeochemical conditions over a groundwater basin at sufficiently fine resolution the estimation of the effective denitrification rate k coefficient is feasible where nitrate measurements in wells are available and source concentrations are known otherwise a spatially averaged denitrification rate coefficient provides a potential albeit less accurate alternative especially if the least denitrification is expected to occur in the most permeable facies effective parameter estimation through calibration therefore provides a practical approach to simulating denitrification more detailed in situ characterization of k remains a challenging task since the parameter integrates complex interactions between aquifer physics and biochemistry along the solute path credit authorship

155,nitrate contamination of aquifers is threatening the sustainability of water resource production around the globe denitrification is an ubiquitous process in groundwater systems and needs to be represented in managerial and predictive efforts yet fully understanding the temporal and spatial dynamics of all biogeochemical and physical properties controlling nitrate reduction at the basin scale remains a challenging task conceptual simplifications such as homogenization are used but their implications on model performance are often not well assessed this paper 1 analyzes the importance of denitrification spatial variability on the fate of non point source nitrate contamination and 2 assesses the performance of upscaled denitrification rate coefficient values heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity of a typical unconsolidated alluvial aquifer system and its associated uncertainty is systematically represented in our 3d numerical simulations of flow and transport the spatial variability in the nitrate reduction capacities of the aquifer is accounted for by 3 different conceptual models a positive and a negative correlation with the aquifer hydraulic properties and a uniform random distribution our results indicate that heterogeneity in the denitrification rate coefficient as well as the model describing spatial variability has a significant impact on concentration statistics observed at a series of extraction wells however we also show that under the modeling setting used in this study e g stationarity of reactivity upscaled values of denitrification rate coefficients allow a virtually perfect reproduction of nitrate concentration statistics a promising outcome for employing parameter estimation calibration of effective rate coefficients of denitrification a detailed description of the spatial variability of the nitrate reduction capacity of the alluvial aquifer is not necessary yet these homogeneous upscaled denitrification rate coefficients result from a complex interaction between the biochemistry and the physics of the aquifer which makes their direct estimation a challenging task graphical abstract

et al 2018 excessive amounts of nitrate no 3 have been leaching from agricultural lands for decades this non point source nps contamination has lead to the long term deterioration of groundwater quality in many basins across the globe commission 1991 harter et al 2012 the fate of nitrate in groundwater depends largely on the biodegradation capacity of aquifers e g hiscock et al 1991 ransom et al 2017 no 3 can be naturally reduced by microorganisms under anaerobic conditions martens 2005 this biodegradation of nitrate into inert nitrogen gas requires specific conditions such as low or no o

variability in local conditions of controlling parameters however cause denitrification to be spatially variable both within and among aquifers a large body of studies have highlighted the spatial variability in dissolved oxygen concentrations schroth et al 1998 in bacteria growth and activity sandrin et al 2004 and of denitrification rates landon et al 2011 green et al 2016 2018 understanding aquifer systems contaminated by nitrate is further challenged by the spatial variability in the physical properties of aquifers dagan and nguyen 1989 this heterogeneity renders the prediction of the fate and transport of nps contaminants complex guo et al 2019 and uncertain hua and harter 2006 henri and harter 2019 physical heterogeneity can also trigger a series of linked processes controlling the reduction of nitrate e g ben maamar et al 2015 for instance it has been shown that changes in the lithology can cause a significant increase in the supply of electron donors tesoriero and puckett 2011 and can generate localized denitrification at a redox interface hansen et al 2014 koch et al 2019 denitrification capacities of an aquifer are strongly influenced by rock type lindsey et al 2003 show that denitrification is more likely to occur in unconsolidated rocks sandstone shale and siltstone than in crystalline and carbonate rocks present in the same basins denitrification has also been linked to groundwater age with observation of greater nitrate reduction for older water lindsey et al 2003 tesoriero et al 2007 yet clearly identifying the major controlling factors of the spatial variability in denitrification remains challenging and its impact on nitrate concentration dynamics is not well understood different approaches have been used to simulate biodegradation in aquifers for example loschko et al 2016 introduce a methodology to simplify aquifer scale nonlinear reactive transport and apply the method to model denitrification following michaelis menten kinetics at the sub regional scale the authors develop the concept of cumulative relative reactivity by disregarding dispersion and integrating groundwater age and reactivity along water parcel trajectories in order to improve the model efficiency yet the conceptual complexity of concentration controlled enzymatic reactions described by the michaelis menten model are in many applications replaced with simpler linear first order kinetics even though key processes are well understood the associated spatial variability of the system suggests the need to derive upscaled homogenized degradation rate coefficients for more efficient modeling assessments green et al 2010 these upscaled effective rate coefficients would need to integrate the spatial variability of but also the potential interactions between flow paths and biogeochemical conditions few studies e g miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996 harter 2002 henri and fernàndez garcia 2014 looked at the impact of spatial variability in both the hydraulic conductivity and in first order reaction rate coefficients on transport these studies focused on hypothetical contamination cases using a semi analytical approach e g low degree of heterogeneity point source no extraction however the degree to which heterogeneous reaction rate coefficients and related effective coefficients impact predictions of management metrics e g travel times nitrate concentration has not yet been reported in a realistic setting in this study we analyze the potential implication of spatial variability in denitrification rate coefficients within a heterogeneous unconsolidated alluvial aquifer at the subregional scale nitrate contamination from nonpoint sources typically affects pollution in a large number of production wells different conceptual models are considered regarding the relationship between denitrification rate coefficient and aquifer structure we consider positive correlation between denitrification rate coefficients and hydraulic conductivity a negative correlation with hydraulic conductivity and a random uniform distribution of denitrification rate coefficients uncorrelated to aquifer hydraulic conductivity following this comparative analysis the use of effective uniform denitrification rate coefficients is tested evaluated and discussed 2 methods we focus on a synthetic case of an agriculture related nitrate contamination in a heterogeneous unconsolidated alluvial aquifer using here the central valley ca usa as a case study the climate is semi arid mediterranean characterized by dry summer and winter precipitation mostly on the surrounding mountain range central valley s aquifers are extensively exploited to sustain an intensive irrigated agricultural industry under natural conditions mountain front recharge and thalweg discharge to streams drive mostly lateral flow within the aquifer system but eight decades of increasing pumping and irrigation has added a significant vertical component to the mean flow today a significant portion of recharge occurs from the irrigated landscape faunt 2009 recharge water typically caries high amounts of agricultural nps pollutants such as nitrate no 3 baram et al 2016 no 3 is transferred into groundwater and denitrification occurs along the solute path toward extraction wells early geochemical characterization of the central valley aquifer system distinguished between a generally oxidized zone comprising the upper tens to few hundred meters of the aquifer system and a reduced zone below often associated with the location of the so called e clay croft 1972 the oxidized zone of this aquifer system also has the least salinity most production occurs within this 150 m 300 m thick zone faunt 2009 subsequent studies of the oxidized region of the aquifer system highlighted the great local spatial variability in redox conditions landon et al 2011 green et al 2016 and identified zones of denitrification green et al 2010 liao et al 2012 as well as zones of near zero nitrate reduction jurgens et al 2008 the rate of nitrate reduction in this oxidized zone is therefore assumed to vary spatially it is this oxidized zone that is the focus of this work within the lower reduced zone denitrification is generally assumed to be rapid although croft 1972 identifies some oxidized horizons buried below sometimes tens of meters of reducing sediments in this study we consider steady state flow conditions utilizing long term average recharge nitrate loading and pumping conditions bastani and harter 2020 in a previous study henri et al 2020 10 year representative time series of recharge and nitrate loading rates were estimated through a series of hydrus simulations temporal averages over these time series are used here while short term temporal variation in the flow field e g seasonal changes pumping schedule is unlikely to significantly impact well concentration signals bastani and harter 2020 the potential effect of longer trends e g climate change land use is not accounted for in this study the following paragraphs detail the rationale and approach adopted to represent the spatial variability and uncertainty in the aquifer hydraulic conductivity and nitrate reduction capacity to solve the flow and transport equations and to homogenize denitrification rate coefficients 2 1 hydraulic conductivity spatial variability the spatial distribution of the aquifer hydraulic conductivity k presents uncertainty that is accounted for by means of a geostatistical model rubin 2003 weissmann and fogg 1999a a series of equally probable realizations of the hydrofacies field are generated using tprogs a geostatistical approach based on the transition probability markov chain method carle 1999 the aquifer is conceptualized by a rectangular prism with length l x 19200 0 m width l y 6000 0 m and thickness l z 250 0 m table 1 the geostatistical parameters mean lengths facies proportions facies to facies transition probability rates are set to be representative of a central valley aquifer weissmann and fogg 1999a b and are given in tables 2 and 3 a random realization of the resulting k field is displayed in fig 1 a total of 50 realizations are generated which has been shown to be sufficient for the convergence of the k fields the mean velocities basic statistics mean and variance and the concentration statistics henri et al 2020 2 2 denitrification spatial variability models in this study the denitrification process is assumed to follow first order dynamics which is valid when contaminant concentrations are relatively low below the michaelis half saturation constant cunningham and mendoza sanchez 2006 the natural capacity of the aquifer to degrade nitrate is furthermore assumed to vary spatially given the range of interactions between major physical and biogeochemical factors controlling the reduction of no 3 three different spatial variability models of the first order denitrification rate coefficient k are considered k log k positive correlation in this scenario greater denitrification rate coefficients are expected in coarse material cozzarelli et al 1999 cunningham and fadel 2007 such observation could be made when clayed materials decrease the bioavailability of nutrients and electron acceptors while coarser materials favor the availability and activity of biomass lien et al 2014 the denitrification rate coefficient are then related to the local k values as 1 k x a b log k x k log k negative correlation negative correlations have been previously studied under idealized conditions miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996 cunningham and fadel 2007 henri and fernàndez garcia 2015 in unconsolidated sediments fine grained and poorly conductive material e g clay is commonly associated with an increased presence of electron donors such as organic matter and pyrite which favors reducing conditions and high denitrification rate coefficients in this scenario the denitrification rate coefficient is estimated by adapting the factors a and b in eq 1 k random distribution given the frequent lack of information on the spatial variability of aquifer denitrification capacities a uniform random distribution of the denitrification rate coefficient at a small spatial scale is considered this case does not consider any correlation with hydraulic aquifer properties the scenario is also representative of conditions where facies contrasts in denitrification rate coefficients are negligible when compared to intra facies variability of denitrification rate coefficients in this case k is independent from the local k values and is estimated as 2 k x k m i n r k m a x k m i n where r is a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1 assigned to individual simulation cells table 1 for all spatial variability models the minimum and maximum values of k are set to 10 6 d 1 and 10 4 d 1 respectively in case of positive correlation the parameters a and b in eq 1 are given by 3 b k m a x k m i n log k m a x log k m i n a k m i n b log k m i n where k m a x k m i n k m a x k m i n are the minimum and maximum values of denitrification rate coefficient and hydraulic conductivity respectively in case of negative correlation the same parameters are given by 4 b k m a x k m i n log k m i n log k m a x a k m i n b log k m a x the range of first order denitrification rate coefficient is inspired by the work of green et al 2010 who estimated apparent k values in an aquifer in the eastern san joaquin valley central valley ca using inverse modeling the sensitivity of concentration statistics to the denitrification rate coefficient is illustrated in appendix a this range of values results in average k values over all realizations of about 5 10 5 d 1 for all scenarios for a given spatial variability model the spatially averaged denitrification rate coefficient does not significantly differ among realizations highlighting ergodic conditions see histograms in supplementary information figures s1 the nature of the correlation between the denitrification rate coefficient and the hydraulic conductivity remains uncertain to qualify in a theoretical study one may correlate k to the log k as we decided to do inspired by the work of miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996 yet it could also be considered to correlate k values to k or log k to log k an imperfect correlation could also be contemplated by adding a noise in the relation in eq 1 a series of alternative scenarios is presented and analyzed in the supplementary information to ascertain that the conclusive remarks presented here remain valid for other correlation structures for all simulations the geostatistical representation of denitrification is assumed to be stationary from the water table to the bottom of the aquifer thus our simulation does not consider a vertical gradient of the aquifer reactivity which may be caused by depletion of electron donors in the aquifer matrix e g loschko et al 2018 kolbe et al 2019 the large thickness of the oxidized aquifer system and depth of the pumping wells area of interest may minimize the impact of variable redox conditions in this zone future work is needed to further determine the long term transient behavior of aquifer denitrification which is neglected in the following analysis 2 3 source terms both the recharge and the nitrate leaching rates are soil type and crop dependent and are therefore spatially variable for each realization the soil map is assumed to be identical to the top layer of the geostatistically described hydrofacies field the spatial distribution of 6 predominant crops in the central valley landscapes almond citrus corn cotton grain and grapes is randomly generated uniform distribution once and is therefore identical in all realizations for each soil type crop combination the effective recharge and nitrate leaching rates are estimated through a hydrus šimunek et al 2016 simulation of 1d unsaturated flow and transport simulations more details are provided by henri et al 2020 2 4 flow and transport flow for each of the 50 realizations flow and transport are numerically solved the hydraulic head field is computed by solving the steady state groundwater flow equation 5 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z q s 0 where q s is the volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources and sinks of water d 1 and h m is the hydraulic head groundwater fluxes are described by darcy s law 6 q x k x h x where q m d 1 is the specific discharge the heterogeneous flow field is solved using modflow harbaugh et al 2000 the model includes three extraction wells located on a transect near the downstream edge of the domain we fix the extraction rate of each well q o u t to 3000 0 m 3 d 1 and the depth of the top of the screens to 100 0 m the length of the well screens depends on the vertical distribution of highly conductive material 10 cumulative feet 3 05 m of gravel and sand are needed for every 100 gallon per minute 545 m 3 d 1 of pumping the flow is in part controlled by a longitudinal gradient of 1 1 0 3 additionally recharge mostly from irrigation applies a significant vertical gradient that is further accentuated by a downward flux imposed at the bottom of the domain representing additional extractions near and below the bottom of the simulation domain transport in this study the reactive transport of nitrate in the aquifer is calculated by 7 ϕ c k t q c k k ϕ c k s x y t where c k is the solute concentration g m 3 ϕ is the porosity k is the first order denitrification rate coefficient and s x y t g m 3 d 1 is the source term describing the rate coefficient of contaminant mass released from the nonpoint source located in any x and y at the top of the domain we account for advection only i e grid scale dispersion and diffusion is considered negligible this assumption has been extensively used to simplify the mathematical framework of reactive transport e g tartakovsky et al 2009 broyda et al 2010 loschko et al 2016 in our model setting the dominant role of macro dispersion is explicitly simulated by resolving the heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity field at fine resolution leading to representative plume spreading previously weissmann et al 2002 used a similar modeling setup geostatistics flow discretization showing that grid scale dispersivities have a minimal impact on the reproduction of groundwater ages obtained by radiometric dating data similarly henri et al 2020 which presents the model used in this study shows that even larger dispersivity values 1 5 m have a insignificant impact on transport and mass arrival to exploitation wells we simulate a pulse injection of nitrate mass representing a single year of nitrate loading concentration breakthrough curves are evaluated at the three explicitly simulated extraction wells c k t the superposition principle can then be used to predict concentration signals in each well from a constant and continuous release of mass from the source as 8 c k t 0 t c k t τ reactive transport is solved using rw3d a lagrangian tracking code using transition probabilities to simulate coupled transport and first order decay networks fernàndez garcia et al 2005 henri and fernàndez garcia 2014 2015 for comparison purpose we conduct two sets of stochastic simulation modeling a conservative solute to evaluate c k 0 t and c k 0 t at each extraction well and modeling a reactive nitrate plume to evaluate c k t and c k t 2 5 homogenization of denitrification rate coefficients concentration btcs resulting from nitrate transport in an aquifer with spatially homogeneous decay rate coefficients k can be directly computed from conservative solute transport simulations 9 c k t exp k t c k 0 t where c k 0 is the concentration resulting from a pulse release of a conservative solute at the source all mass injected at t 0 in this study we estimate the effective decay rate coefficient k as being the equivalent homogeneous decay rate coefficient that leads to a total breakthrough mass approximately equal to the total mass from the heterogeneous simulations i e 10 lim k k t 0 c k τ c k τ d τ 0 where c k is obtained using 9 a similar approach allowing the determination of effective decay rate coefficients could be adopted using concentration signals from a continuous mass injection c k obtained using eq 8 this is done for each recorded breakthrough curve i e each well of each realization 3 results and discussion a total of 150 50 realizations 3 wells values of equally probable nitrate concentration simulated in extracted groundwater can be obtained from the stochastic analysis statistics of relevant metrics revealing the uncertainty due to heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity can then be analyzed here we present and discuss the implications of different models of the spatial variability in denitrification rate coefficients on concentration percentiles and travel time statistics henceforth the 10th etc concentration percentile p10 etc shall refer to the concentration exceeded in 10 etc of the monte carlo realizations the 5th percentile etc arrival time p5 etc shall refer to the arrival time of the first 5 etc of all simulated solute particles that break through at the well screen the 10th percentile etc of the breakthrough curve concentration shall refer to the concentration exceeded by 10 etc of wells 3 1 spatial variability of denitrification rate coefficients concentration percentiles denitrification results in a reduction of nitrate concentration of 50 to 65 depending on the spatial variability model fig 2 the uniformly distributed random denitrification rate coefficient and the negatively correlated model yields a similar reduction of no 3 when denitrification rate coefficients are positively correlated with hydraulic conductivity overall nitrate removal is larger than when denitrification rate coefficients are negatively correlated with hydraulic conductivity this difference is less pronounced for the concentrations 10th percentile p 10 when compared to the 50th median and 90th percentiles fig 2a the overall lower no 3 removal in simulations with negative k k correlation relative to those with positive k k correlation contrasts with the spatial mean k values being slightly 2 higher for the negative k k correlation figure sm1 to explain this apparent discrepancy it is important to recall that the travel paths for solutes are identical regardless of whether k values are positively or negatively correlated to k values the fact that overall no 3 removal is larger in the simulation with a positive k log k correlation indicates that the solute that arrives at the extraction well is likely to travel preferentially in the higher conductivity coarser facies despite the relatively smaller volumetric fraction of coarser facies in the negatively correlated k log k model the solute would similarly spent a relatively larger fraction of its travel time in the coarse high conductivity facies when that facies is associated with the lowest denitrification rate coefficient k that leads to the overall lower no 3 removal understanding this potential interplay between aquifer heterogeneity and no 3 reducing potential is therefore a key aspect to be characterized to effectively manage such large scale nitrate contamination as shown in supplementary information figures s2 s4 this difference in effective denitrification potential resulting from a positive and negative k log k correlation is also observed in case of similar correlations between k and k and between log k log k with and without noise the impact of the k k correlation on concentration statistics across a well network while significant are relatively small a compared to the overall decline in concentration due to denitrification i e when considering the difference to the conservative tracer for the p10 p50 and p90 btcs in fig 2 and b compared to the much wider range of concentration across a large number of production wells i e the difference in the p10 p50 and p90 btcs at any given time in fig 2 the latter is the result of the heterogeneous k within the aquifer system that said the spatially variable denitrification further adds to the variability of concentrations across a large set of regional wells and analogously adds significantly to the relative uncertainty about concentration at any one well in fig 2 this is reflected by the relatively larger decline in concentration relative to the conservative tracer for breakthrough curves of increasing exceedance probability arrival times next we analyze the probability density functions of the time required for a given fraction of the total mass recorded to reach an extraction well e g t 50 is the time required for 50 of the total mass observed in a well to be extracted results display a significant shift to earlier arrivals under denitrification conditions when compared to a conservative solute fig 3 such earlier arrival times can be for example associated to a quicker effective outcome of management actions for reactive transport the choice of denitrification model has no discernable impact on the early arrival statistics fig 3a however the different denitrification correlation models differ slightly in their later arrival times fig 3c a randomly distributed k or a negative k log k correlation leads to overall earlier arrivals the positive k log k correlation produces slightly later late arrival times fig 3c than a negative k k correlation uncertainty in late arrival times is significantly reduced by removal of nitrate through denitrification when compared to a conservative solute fig 3c the reduction in overall travel time when denitrification affects no 3 transport is due to the fact that no 3 along the slowest longest travel paths to the extraction wells is subject to the longest period of denitrification with correspondingly higher probability of complete denitrification prior to arrival thus denitrification suppresses late arrivals increasing the relative probability of earlier arrivals when compared to conservative solute transport however a positive k log k correlation produces less denitrification in low k i e low velocity areas allowing for some of the longer travel times to be less affected by denitrification than nitrate in faster flow paths along the high conductivity zone this provides for more viable late nitrate arrivals than in case of a negative k log k correlation for the latter reactive mass experiencing low velocities is also experiencing the highest degradation rate and is therefore more likely to be degraded before having the potential to produce late arrival times the large uncertainty in late arrival times that characterizes the transport of a conservative solute is due to the non negligible probability of long residence times in low velocity zones this behavior produces tailing in the travel time p d f s e g haggerty et al 2000 gouze et al 2008 nitrate in these low velocity zones is likely to be reduced under denitrification conditions burnell et al 2014 which decreases the tailing behavior in travel time p d f s and therefore reduces uncertainty about late time concentrations henri and fernàndez garcia 2014 for the alternative correlation models we tested k k and log k log k with and without noise we observe similar behavior supplementary information figures s5 s7 3 2 homogeneous effective denitrification rate coefficient performance the temporal evolution of well concentrations using an effective homogeneous denitrification rate coefficient k is semi analytically evaluated for each realization separately for each denitrification spatial variability model using eq 9 for further comparison concentration statistics are also computed for breakthrough curves that use two alternative homogenizations of the denitrification rate a the realization specific spatially average aquifer denitrification rate coefficient k and b the realization specific flux weighted average over the entire domain denitrification rate coefficient k f w for a positive k log k correlation utilizing a spatially averaged denitrification rate coefficient slightly overestimates all concentration fig 4 left panels for a negative k log k correlation using the spatially averaged k leads to a good representation of p 50 an underestimation of the highest concentrations p 10 and a slight overestimation of the lowest concentrations p 90 fig 4 middle panels for the uniformly distributed model using k in the transport model overestimates lowest concentration p 50 and p 90 but reproduces the highest concentrations p 10 reasonably well fig 4 right panels using k f w partially improves predictions of all concentration statistics for the two k log k correlation models concentration percentiles produced for a randomly distributed k remains unchanged compared to simulations using k as the effective homogeneous denitrification rate coefficient on the other hand simulations using k generate almost identical concentration statistics when compared to the heterogeneous rate monte carlo simulation results whatever the k spatial variability model fig 4 importantly the homogenization predicts accurate concentration statistics across the entire breakthrough period including the early onset of breakthrough and the late time behavior in case of negative k log k correlation a simple spatial averaging of k over the domain k will misrepresent the fact that a significant portion of the transport occurs in high k i e low k paths leading to an overestimation of nitrate reduction most prominently observed on the highest concentrations p 10 a flux weighted average k f w as an effective homogeneous denitrification rate coefficient partially corrects this approximation the opposite phenomenon is observed in case of a positive k log k correlation the under representation of highly denitrifying high k areas by using k leads to an underestimation of effective denitrification and to slightly higher concentration statistics nevertheless this slight overestimation of concentrations remains a conservative estimate for contamination management employing a spatially averaged denitrification rate coefficient in a forward simulation approach with homogeneous denitrification provides a reasonable simulation option that reproduces highest concentrations that is often the only range of interest in case of nitrate contamination if a positive k log k correlation or a random distribution of k values can be assumed however this approach would require local measurements of denitrification rates across sites or aquifers of interest these data are typically not available while use of k f w would be preferable we are not aware of field methods to determine k f w for such small reaction rate coefficients the most promising and accurate approach to representing spatially variable denitrification rate coefficients with an effective homogeneous rate coefficient is to instead obtain k by calibration against measured nitrate concentration breakthrough curves given known water table nitrate input at the regional scale simulating denitrification as a homogeneous process a calibrated effective denitrification rate coefficient k provides a reliable tool to predict future nitrate concentration even under conditions of spatially variable denitrification rate coefficients similar conclusions can be drawn while using a k k and a log k log k with and without noise correlation supplementary information figures s8 s10 reaction based mixing index to better understand how heterogeneity and the interaction between geologic texture and geochemical processes influences nitrate reduction we calculate the ratio between k the effective denitrification rate coefficient and k the spatially averaged denitrification rate coefficient as well as the ratio between k and k f w the flux weighted averaged denitrification rate coefficient for each realization and for each spatial variability model these ratios can be interpreted as a reaction based mixing index indicating a system fully mixed when k k 1 a ratio k k lower than 1 is associated with transport that favors zones of low reduction potential and vice versa for k k 1 the reaction based mixing index is estimated for each well and each realization 150 values and we here present the associated pdfs a random uncorrelated distribution of k is characterized by a very high probability of an effective denitrification rate coefficient equal to the average denitrification rate coefficient fig 5 the pdf also displays a positive tailing indicating a low but non negligible probability for k to be larger than k this further illustrates the overestimation of concentrations when a spatially averaged k is used a positive k log k correlation generates a pdf of k k 1 that is positively skewed and with a peak slightly exceeding 1 fig 5 on the other hand a negative k k correlation leads to slightly lower k k ratios and limits the pdf s positive skewness by considering flux weighted averaged denitrification rate coefficients the ratios k k f w for a positive k log k correlation are more aligned with those for a negative k log k correlation with a peak of probability nearer to 1 0 when transport occurs in highly connected channels as often observed in heterogeneous formations associating high denitrification rate coefficients to high k areas positive correlation would favor nitrate reduction which increases the probability to observe effective rate coefficients higher than mean rate coefficients inversely when relatively low denitrification is associated with the high k areas negative correlation lower effective denitrification rate coefficients are observed in this sense the results highlight the potential interplay between effective reactivity and aquifer heterogeneity similarly a spatially averaged k underestimates effective reaction rate coefficients when denitrification rate coefficients are uniformly distributed in this setting particles are degraded before convergence toward the mean due to transport through high k area in this situation the effective denitrification rate coefficient will be higher than the spatially averaged rate coefficient lowest concentration due to increased reduction will be overestimated as shown in fig 4 previously miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996 stochastically analyzed the impact of k log k correlations on effective reaction rate coefficients and transport parameters mainly the authors found effective decay rate coefficients to be less than the mean independently of the k log k correlation model which differs from our results a series of differences in the modeling settings can explain this first we do not use the perturbation theory to represent the spatial variability of k as does miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996 but account for it without limits to the size of perturbation using monte carlo flow and transport simulation furthermore the heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity is conceptualized differently in miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996 it is described using a perturbation function leading to a σ ln k 0 29 this study uses a hydrogeologic facies based geostatistical model leading to a much larger σ ln k 14 8 in our case solute may preferentially be transported to the well screen through one or two facies with either a large or small denitrification rate coefficient this will generate effective k values that can be either smaller or larger than the mean k values controlling factors for practical application it us useful to further consider what drives the magnitude of the effective denitrification rate coefficient and whether the relationship between k and log k is reflected in measurable outcomes at wells the analysis of potential correlations between the effective denitrification rate coefficient and arrival times t 5 or t 95 indicates weak but significant trends k tends to increase with arrival times in case of a positive k log k correlation with a low correlation factor r 2 0 1 and 0 03 for a correlation with t 5 and t 95 respectively in contrast k tends to decrease with arrival times for a negative correlation with a even lower correlation factor r 2 0 02 and 0 15 for a correlation with t 5 and t 95 respectively fig 6 this suggests that understanding nitrate travel time for nitrate relative to conservative tracers and considering the relationship to effective calibrated denitrification rates may provide some insights on the aquifer k log k relationship early arrivals reflect transport occurring favorably in connected high k paths characterized by high k values in case of a positive k log k correlation increasing the effective denitrification rate coefficient the opposite would happen in case of a negative k log k correlation transport in paths of low k values decreasing k yet this relationship between arrival times and effective denitrification remains weak and imperfect fig 6 analyzing transport indicators only does not provide sufficient predictive information about the effective denitrification rate coefficient the effective denitrification rate coefficient instead reflects the more complex cross interaction between physical heterogeneity controlling transport patterns and the spatial variability of denitrification rate coefficients globally nps are characterized by a higher degree of mixing within wells capturing a large volume of aquifer and making connected paths of high k or low k values depending on the correlation model a relatively less important controlling factor than would be expected for point source pollution this increased mixing 1 explains the only minor differences observed between the different models of spatial variability in denitrification fig 2 2 allows a good performance of spatially averaged denitrification rates fig 4 to reproduce concentration statistics and 3 explains the weak correlation between effective denitrification rate coefficients and travel times fig 6 4 conclusions denitrification is a key process that needs to be well represented to accurately assess the long term impacts of nitrate non point source contamination on production wells or receiving streams the spatial variability in nitrate reduction within an aquifer is particularly challenging to describe given the large scale of nps contamination and the diversity and the complexity of the biogeochemical and physical processes within the underlying large aquifer system this work investigates the relevance of an explicit description of the spatial variability in denitrification rate coefficient when nitrate concentration in extraction wells located in a large 3d unconsolidated alluvial aquifer system is of concern the heterogeneity in denitrification is described as a stationary process over the entire aquifer i e no vertical gradient in reactivity or explicitly defined geochemical zones uncorrelated to aquifer facies variability are considered under such conditions our results conclude that the spatial variability in the denitrification rate coefficient described at the scale of aquifer structural heterogeneity or at an even finer scale has a moderate but significant impact on concentration statistics recorded for an ensemble of extraction wells the conceptualization of the heterogeneity in the aquifer denitrification rate coefficients and its relationship to hydraulic properties can significantly control concentration behavior across the ensemble of production wells on the other hand we demonstrate that even for these highly variable denitrification rate coefficients accurate simulation results can be obtained without explicitly considering spatial variability in denitrification a homogenized effective rate coefficient k reproduces virtually perfect nitrate concentration statistics regardless of the particular structure of the heterogeneity in the denitrification rate coefficient this is an important finding given the practical difficulties to characterize the spatial distribution of biogeochemical conditions over a groundwater basin at sufficiently fine resolution the estimation of the effective denitrification rate k coefficient is feasible where nitrate measurements in wells are available and source concentrations are known otherwise a spatially averaged denitrification rate coefficient provides a potential albeit less accurate alternative especially if the least denitrification is expected to occur in the most permeable facies effective parameter estimation through calibration therefore provides a practical approach to simulating denitrification more detailed in situ characterization of k remains a challenging task since the parameter integrates complex interactions between aquifer physics and biochemistry along the solute path credit authorship

156,we use a generalized pore network model in combination with image based experiments to understand the parameters that control upscaled flow properties the study is focued on water flooding through a reservoir sandstone under water wet and mixed wet conditions a set of sensitivity studies is presented to quantify the role of wettability pore geometry initial and boundary conditions as well as a selection of model parameters used in the computation of fluid volumes curvatures and flow and electrical conductivities we quantify the uncertainty in the model predictions which match the measured relative permeability and capillary pressure within the uncertainty of the experiments our results show that contact angle initial saturation image quality and image processing algorithm are amongst

challenges in the energy sector groundwater resource management and environmental science as well as in industrial applications that rely on flow through granular and fibrous media examples of the macroscopic properties upscaled representation of molecular to pore scale forces are relative permeability k r øren et al 1998 valvatne and blunt 2004 capillary pressure p c moss et al 1999 resistivity index r i archie 1942 glover 2016 dispersion coefficient sahimi 2011 bijeljic et al 2011 and reaction rates white and brantley 2003 al khulaifi et al 2019 these properties in particular p c k r and r i are functions of fluid saturation displacement scenario as well as fluid and solid properties such as wettability and pore geometry morrow 1970 armstrong et al 2012 furthermore predictions of these properties may be subject to high natural measurement or simulation uncertainty dicarlo et al 2000 reynolds and krevor 2015 ramstad et al 2020 zahasky et al 2020 traditionally the macroscopic flow properties of porous media have been estimated by matching empirical or numerical models to experimental measurements of pressures and average saturation oak 1988 dicarlo et al 2000 reynolds and krevor 2015 moghadasi et al 2016 a quantification of the uncertainty in these measurements however has rarely been presented this poses a challenge for modelling studies for a statistically valid comparison of predicted properties with experiment the values should be similar to within the range of uncertainty in both the experiment and model itself without a proper evaluation of experimental uncertainty this comparison is of a somewhat subjective nature particularly when these uncertainties are large several different methods have been developed over the past decades to predict the macroscopic properties of porous media including pore network models øren et al 1998 valvatne and blunt 2004 gostick et al 2016 regaieg and moncorgé 2017 raeini et al 2018 and numerical models that simulate flow directly on images of the pore space tartakovsky and meakin 2006 raeini et al 2014 pereira nunes et al 2016 alpak et al 2016 akai et al 2019a gago et al 2021 direct simulations are computationally expensive for many practical applications that require running sensitivity studies and uncertainty quantification on relatively large flow domains regaieg et al 2021 pore network models on the other hand require extensive validation to be considered reliable for the prediction of macroscopic flow properties recent advances in direct numerical simulations and experimental pore scale measurements have provided the necessary data for their validation and refinement andrew et al 2014a yang et al 2017 singh et al 2017 gao et al 2020 pore network models in turn are efficient tools for understanding and optimizing decision variables that influence the pore scale physics of the industrial or environmental processes under consideration similarly experimental techniques together with imaging of fluid phases in porous media have been used to investigate two phase flow mechanisms in micro model experiments keller et al 1997 chapman et al 2013 yang et al 2017 and in x ray imaging experiments on natural or synthetic porous media wildenschild and sheppard 2013 andrew et al 2014a fogden et al 2015 scanziani et al 2017 the data generated experimentally have been used to investigate wettability characteristics of porous media andrew et al 2014a alhammadi et al 2017 rucker et al 2020 and displacement parameters such as the effect of flow rate zhang et al 2021 spurin et al 2019 furthermore the results have been used to evaluate the accuracy of direct simulations akai et al 2019a as well as pore network models bultreys et al 2018 raeini et al 2019 foroughi et al 2021 this work uses the experimental data by gao et al 2020 who simultaneously measured the pressure difference across a reservoir sandstone sample while imaging the rock and fluids within it the experiments were steady state injection of brine and oil into the same reservoir sandstone sample under two wettability conditions before and after exposing the sample to a crude oil at high temperature their application of pore space imaging allowed measurements of both capillary pressure and relative permeability from the same experiment another advantage of this type of data for validation of network models compared to core scale measurements is the quantification of contact angles in situ at different stages of the displacement process in this paper we first quantify the uncertainty in the experimental data generated by gao et al 2020 and then use this data to validate the upscaled flow properties predicted using the generalized pore network model gnm raeini et al 2018 finally the generated x ray images of the pore space are used to build different digital realizations of the pore space using the gnm and to study the effect of various pore scale parameters on the macroscopic two phase flow properties this work complements our previous study on water wet porous media raeini et al 2019 where we quantified uncertainty in the average fluid occupancy to be typically less than 5 between pairs of repeated unsteady state experiments by andrew et al 2014b while the local pore by pore occupancy uncertainty was of the order of 5 20 the discrepancy between the gnm and experiments was less than 10 for the average saturation and occupancy and between 20 30 in their local pore by pore counterparts note that these differences even for repeat experiments on exactly the same sample are sizeable the implication is that the uncertainty in both the measurement and modelling of pore scale processes need to be quantified carefully this is the focus of this paper in the following section we discuss the workflows used in this paper then in section 3 we present an evaluation of the uncertainty in the experimental data which is principally due to ambiguities in image segmentation to find saturation and the measurement of pressure difference afterwards in section 4 we show a comparison between the gnm results and the experimental data while taking into account the effect of uncertainty in input contact angle and initial water saturation on network model predictions in section 5 the contribution of various input parameters describing the sample wettability pore geometry and initial and boundary conditions as well as the approximations used in the gnm are quantified through sensitivity studies the results are used to draw conclusions on relative importance of these parameters for further refinement of experimental protocols and pore network models 2 methodology this study aims to move towards integrating our experimental and modelling tools to better understand the mechanisms controlling two phase flow through porous media and to reduce uncertainty in measuring or predicting them as illustrated in fig 1 2 1 image based special core analysis scal the experimental data used in this paper are discussed in detail in gao et al 2020 who performed steady state co injection of oil and brine into a reservoir sandstone at several steps of increasing water fractional flows while recording the pressure difference between the injecting and receiving pumps during each fractional flow experiment micro ct images of the whole sample 32 mm in length and 6 mm in diameter were taken at a voxel size of 6 35 μ m as well as zoomed in scans of the middle part at a voxel size of 3 58 μ m the experiments were repeated after exposing the sample to a crude oil at a high pressure and temperature to alter its wettability from water wet to mixed wet additionally images of the sample in dry and fully brine saturated states were taken by gao et al 2020 which are used in this study to obtain different representations of the pore space for network extraction the zoomed in images of the sample during oil brine flow were further analysed by gao et al 2020 to obtain capillary pressure and contact angles the contact angles were computed using an automatic algorithm alratrout et al 2017 and using energy balance blunt et al 2019 in this work we have re evaluated the uncertainty in the estimations of fluid saturations relative permeability and capillary pressure which is discussed below the saturations used in this paper were computed by applying differential imaging to the experimental images the differential imaging technique and the assessment of the uncertainty in the measured saturations are discussed in appendix a this involves first rescaling the grey scale intensity values to have the same values for the voxels of the tubing sample holder and the impermeable parts of the solid matrix then individual images were subtracted from the brine saturated image and the intensity values of the brine and oil phases were sampled at different locations along the sample whose standard deviation is used to estimate the range of saturations as described in appendix a the pressure difference was measured between the fluid injection and receiving pumps which account for the pressure drop across the sample δ p assumed to be the same in both phases as well as the pressure drop in the tubing gao et al 2020 these measurements have a low uncertainty themselves the issue is the pressure difference in the tubing connecting the pumps to the sample during two phase flow which was comparable to the pressure drop across the rock itself and was estimated in separate experiments performed without the sample present we assume that the pressure difference across the sample has an uncertainty of the same magnitude as the tubing pressure drop see appendix b which are converted to uncertainty ranges in relative permeability using the multiphase darcy law 1 q k abs k r a μ δ p l where q represents the flow rate of each phase and k r is the phase relative permeability finally k abs a and l are respectively single phase permeability cross sectional area and length of the sample the capillary pressures p c were computed by gao et al 2020 from the curvature of imaged fluid fluid interfaces 2 p c σ k c where k c 2 is the mean interface curvature and σ is the interfacial tension 0 051 n m in this study however the uncertainty range in the measured p c is re estimated in this work based on the analysis by akai et al 2019b the average uncertainty in the water wet case capillary pressure was estimated to be 820 pa 30 of measured average capillary pressure and is assumed to be the same for all fractional flows for both water wet and mixed wet experiments a more accurate quantification of uncertainty and how to minimize it however is subject to future work the estimated uncertainties in the experimental p c and k r curves are presented in section 3 2 2 direct simulations on images of fluid phases we have presented an analysis of single phase flow conductivities using direct numerical simulations dns in appendix e 1 these results show that both image resolution and segmentation algorithm can affect the quantification of single phase flow properties additionally in appendix e 1 we show that introducing surface roughness is necessary for the direct simulations to match the measured porosity and permeability of the sample simultaneously it also is possible to estimate relative permeability using dns on the images of individual fluid phases obtained during the two phase flow experiments hussain et al 2014 berg et al 2016 however due to the high sensitivity of conductances to the inscribed radii of flow paths this approach requires high resolution and sharp images of the fluid fluid and fluid solid boundaries therefore we expect the errors associated with this approach to be higher compared to the conductivities obtained directly from pressure drop measurements or from direct two phase flow simulation that considers viscous coupling between the phases nevertheless this approach is presented in appendix e 2 to provide an alternative estimation of upscaled properties which can be used to evaluate the effect of imaging artefacts and the segmentation of the images into different fluid and rock labels 2 3 generalized network modelling of two phase flow the third approach in fig 1 is to use the generalized network model gnm to predict capillary pressure and relative permeability the gnm incorporates a rich representation of geometry extracted from the micro ct images while simulating pore scale phenomena such as layer flow contact angle hysteresis snap off and cooperative pore body filling see raeini et al 2017 2018 for details of the gnm algorithm here we mainly focus on studying its inputs and the main parameters that describe the approximations used in this model to extract a network of the pore space images should be first segmented the segmentation algorithm and thresholds can affect the properties of the extracted network and flow simulation results to account for the effect of the segmentation we run the network on i the segmentation reported in the original work gao et al 2020 ii a segmentation of the pore space using a multi label clustering algorithm described in appendix c iii a representation of the pore space obtained using the clustering algorithm but with an altered surface morphology to account for sub resolution surface features that can be missed after image reconstruction and segmentation schlüter et al 2014 and finally iv an image called rock a provided by totalenergies of another sample drilled from the same sandstone core at a higher resolution of 1 5 μ m the measured contact angles can be uncertain and affected by the image processing steps contact angles computed geometrically alratrout et al 2017 correspond to interfaces that are stable and hence may take any value between their advancing and receding values furthermore despite the detailed images of fluid phases at several snapshots during the experiment the time resolution of the micro ct images is limited and we can only obtain average measures of the contact angle distribution therefore here we do not adjust contact angles on a pore by pore basis but instead assign them statistically based on the analysis by gao et al 2020 using the thermodynamic approach blunt et al 2019 as it measures the overall behaviour of the system during displacement in the generalized network model gnm we use geometrical approximations to compute interfacial curvatures and fluid saturations and correlations to compute fluid conductivities these are further explained in raeini et al 2018 where the development of the model has been guided through analytical approximations and direct two phase flow simulations on synthetic geometries furthermore a description of the conductivity correlations are given in appendix d the aim of this study is to evaluate the reliability of the correlations used in the gnm using micro ct based experimental data find potential areas for future improvement and more importantly to quantify the role of important parameters that control two phase flow through porous media all gnm simulation results presented in this work correspond to water flooding cycle after primary drainage oil injection during primary oil injection the rock is assumed to be water wet receding contact angles of zero but its end point initial condition for the water flooding cycle is considered to be uncertain and is investigated through the sensitivity studies as a base case we run the primary drainage cycle up to a capillary pressure of 20 kpa 2 4 sensitivity studies on network model predictions the uncertainty in the gnm predictions originate both from the uncertainty in the model inputs and from the approximations used in the model the sensitivity to contact angle is performed by varying the mean value or spread standard deviation of the measured distribution for other parameters which we have not quantified based on experimental data such as wettability spatial correlation length corner connectivity and surface morphology we simply choose a plausible range and compute the change in the upscaled properties compared to the base case values the base case is a simulation where all parameters are kept as close as possible to experimental data as discussed in section 4 except for the parameter for which the sensitivity study is being performed whose base value is set to the mid value between its lower and upper bounds discussed in section 5 the uncertainties are presented in terms of mean signed deviation δ and mean absolute deviation δ from the base case values 3 δ φ φ upper φ lower 2 n 4 δ φ φ upper φ base φ upper φ base 2 n where φ base is the base case results of an upscaled property capillary pressure p c porosity ϕ saturation s w absolute k abs or relative k r w and k r o permeabilities formation factor f f or resistivity index r i φ upper and φ lower are the upscaled property values corresponding to the upper and lower bounds of the parameter for which the sensitivity analysis is being performed e g contact angle initial water saturation see section 5 finally the summations are performed over n which is equal to the number of times the sensitivity analysis is repeated multiplied by the number of data points describing each property all sensitivity studies presented in this paper are repeated for the four different representations of the void space discussed in the previous section therefore n 4 for single phase properties φ ϕ k abs or f f which are described using one data point per simulation for saturation dependent data φ p c k r w k r o or r i n 40 since we sample them at ten equally distanced saturation intervals for each simulation the differences are computed in linear space for the sake of simplicity which implies that larger relative permeability values contribute more to the reported differences nevertheless this analysis leads to a quantification of the relative importance of the input or model parameters for predicting the upscaled flow properties which are presented as bar charts in section 5 3 experimental results fig 2 presents the experimental results by gao et al 2020 with our evaluation of fluid saturations and uncertainty in capillary pressure and relative permeability as discussed in section 2 1 the fluid saturations presented in fig 2 are obtained using differential imaging see appendix a in this experiment a 3 5 solution of potassium iodide was used to improve the water brine phase x ray attenuation and increase its contrast with the oil the uncertainty in the differential imaging analysis can be reduced by increasing the contrast between the brine and oil phase however this needs to be optimized to firstly ensure a linear relationship between the phase contrast and fluid saturation and secondly to avoid image blur due to excessive blockage of the x ray signal by the contrast agent the uncertainty in relative permeability can also be further reduced by a more accurate quantification of the pressure difference across the sample and the tubing which can be substantial when using viscous fluids in the experiment nevertheless a similar level of uncertainty can be deduced from experimental data obtained using traditional core scale experiments dicarlo et al 2000 reynolds and krevor 2015 potentially due to the impact of core scale heterogeneity on flow at low capillary numbers the effect of various descriptors of the model and its inputs on the predicted macroscopic two phase flow properties are investigated using the gnm in the following sections 4 generalized network flow simulations in this section we demonstrate the sensitivity of the gnm predictions on contact angle on initial capillary pressure at the beginning of water flooding and on the image segmentation algorithm which were three of the most important input parameters of the gnm model the gnm results are compared with their experimental counterparts in fig 3 as described previously the range of contact angles used in the gnm simulations are chosen based on the experimentally measured values using the energy balance approach 20 80 for the water wet ww case and 40 120 for the mixed wet mw case gao et al 2020 fig 8c the contact angles assigned to pores are chosen from this range assuming a normal distribution with a standard deviation equal to 25 of the contact angle range 50 1 5 for the ww and 80 1 5 for the mw case and using a spatial correlation length of 2 1 pores alratrout et al 2018 the spatial correlation is achieved by clustering adjacent pores into groups of 2 1 pores and assigning a single contact angle to all pores in a cluster the range of uncertainty in the upscaled flow properties in fig 3 are obtained by shifting the mean of the contact angle distribution by 20 the simulations are presented on the four segmentations of the pore space discussed in the previous section the sandstone used in this study is considered a clean sandstone predominantly made of quartz grains our segmentation of the clay phase from the micro ct images indicated that only 0 3 of the bulk volume is made of clay minerals therefore in the simulations we assume that clay accounts for 1 5 of the pore volume 0 3 of total volume which contains immobile water this however is considered uncertain and hence is included in the uncertainty studies presented in section 5 the initial condition for the water flooding simulation is obtained by running a primary drainage simulation down to a specific water saturation or capillary pressure the initial capillary pressure of the experiment cannot be quantified from curvature measurements due to the limited resolution of the x ray images the initial water saturation is estimated using differential imaging to be 12 8 similarly in this work we run the drainage simulation down to water saturations of 12 8 to investigate the effect of initial condition on the predicted capillary pressure and relative permeability the gnm and experimental results overlap albeit with considerable uncertainty ranges the differences between the experiment and model in many cases can be attributed to the finite resolution of the 3d images of the pore space and the network model the differences in the wettability of the simulations and the experiment and also to the differences in the treatment of boundary and initial condition at the beginning of water flooding in the following section we present a more detailed quantification of the uncertainties introduced due to different descriptors of wettability pore geometry initial and boundary conditions as well as an assessment of a selection of the model parameters used in the correlations and approximations of capillary entry pressures fluid volumes and conductivities these sensitivity studies together with further comparisons with more experimental data and with high resolution direct two phase flow simulations on benchmark geometries are necessary to quantify these discrepancies and further improve our pore scale experimental and modelling workflows 5 uncertainties in gnm predictions in this section to have a more comprehensive but compact quantification of the sensitivity we average the uncertainty ranges of each upscaled property s w k r w k r o r i k abs f f to obtain a single value for the impact of various input or model parameters on the upscaled flow property the results of sensitivity studies are further averaged over the simulations that have been performed over the four representations of the void space discussed in section 2 3 and are presented as bar charts the input and model parameters are divided into i descriptors of wettability distribution ii pore geometry iii initial and boundary conditions and iv model approximations 5 1 wettability fig 4 shows the effect of uncertainty in the input parameters describing the wettability of the sample advancing contact angle the effect of advancing contact angle is analysed by shifting the mean of the contact angle distribution by 2 0 compared to the base case values discussed in the previous section advancing contact angle range the effect of the range of contact angle is analysed by shrinking and expanding the contact angle range twice the standard deviations by 1 0 while keeping its mean value same as the base case contact angle radius correlation in this sensitivity study the radius correlation for contact angles is changed from uncorrelated to rank correlation coefficients of 1 with the inscribed radius wettability spatial correlation the wettability spatial correlation of contact angle is varied by a factor of two from a lower range of 1 2 pores to a mid case of 2 4 pores and a higher range of 4 8 pores the spatial correlation is implemented by clustering adjacent pores to randomly selected seed pores until all pores are selected the spatial correlation length represents the number of pores in the clusters the contact angle assigned to each cluster is chosen from a normal distribution with mean and standard deviations of 50 1 5 for the water wet ww simulations and 80 1 5 for the mixed wet mw case same as the base case the results in fig 4 indicate that the contact angle values and their distribution over the network play an important role in determining the upscaled flow properties hence indicating further research in this field is needed to better quantify them for various porous media types and fluids while we can assign a reliable average contact angle from energy balance we cannot at present determine precisely pore by pore values 5 2 pore space geometry fig 5 shows the effect of uncertainty in the input parameters describing the pore space geometry which are described below corner connectivity number corner elements in our model are assumed to be connected to 0 1 or 2 other corners from each side this is assigned based on proximity of corners and is not currently extracted directly from the underlying image we only allow two corners to be connected if their medial axes make an angle less than 90 to study the impact of this parameter here we further restrict the connectivity of some of the corners at random to account for potentially lower connectivity in the underlying image with probabilities of 0 base case 16 6 and 33 this means that the probability that a corner is connected to another corner from each side will be reduced from 1 to 0 834 and 0 67 respectively sub resolution water sub resolution water accounts for water absorbed in clay minerals or residing in small pores and crevices not resolved in the micro ct image these pores are assumed to have high capillary entry pressures and therefore remain water filled during the experiment and do not have a major contribution to flow conductivity due to their small size however they do contribute to water saturation and electrical conductivity the results in fig 5 are obtained from simulations where volume fractions of 0 1 5 base case and 3 of void space 0 0 3 and 0 6 of total volume respectively are assigned to these sub resolution pores the sandstone used in this study is a clean sandstone containing a small clay fraction compared to many sandstones found in hydrocarbon reservoirs therefore the sensitivity study presented here can underestimate the uncertainty in such cases voxel size the effect of voxel size is studied using the image of the rock a sandstone which was drilled from the same rock formation used in the rest of our analysis but was scanned at a smaller voxel size of 1 5 μ m by totalenergies it is then coarsened by factors of 1 2 and 3 to study the effect of voxel size 1 5 3 and 4 5 μ m respectively note that this analysis does not account for imaging artefacts when scanning the image at coarser resolutions where other factors such as image blur and signal to noise ratio can play a role too it solely accounts for the role of the image resolution used in the network extraction and its impact on flow simulations surface morphology micro ct images often have a degree of image artefacts such as a blur between the grey scale values of the pore space fluids and the minerals consequently their segmentation can lead to images of the pore surfaces that are smoother than the actual geometry to study the effect of surface morphologies that can be removed during the image processing we alter the voxels on either side of grain walls with a probability of 25 iteratively for 0 2 and 4 iterations these images are then used in the network extraction and flow model to predict the impact of surface morphologies at the scale of the voxel size on the network model predictions the results in fig 5 show that voxel size and surface morphology play an important role in the accuracy of single phase flow simulation of formation factor and absolute permeability additionally voxel size and corner connectivity number have a significant impact on two phase flow properties 5 3 initial and boundary conditions fig 6 shows the results of our sensitivity analysis on the input parameters that describe the initial condition at the beginning of the water flooding simulation and the boundary conditions that control the flow rates and contribution of viscous pressure in the displacement process viscous pressure drop in this analysis both phase viscous pressure drops were equal and set to δ p w δ p o 32 320 and 3200 pa 6 2 62 and 620 kpa m which partially covers the range of pressure gradients recorded in the experiment 62 1680 kpa m water viscous pressure drop here the oil phase pressure drop is kept at 1 pa while the water phase viscous pressure drop is varied from δ p w 1 to 500 and 1000 pa therefore the simulation results represent the effect of capillary pressure gradient for example due to boundary effects which can lead to a different pressure gradient in the two fluid phases oil viscous pressure drop similar to the case of water phase pressure drop here the oil non wetting phase viscous pressure drop is set to δ p o 1 500 and 1000 pa while the water phase viscous pressure drop is kept at 1 pa upscaling bounds the boundaries of the domain for which the flow properties are computed were set to 20 90 25 75 and 5 95 of the length of the images which are cylindrical domains of length 1400 and diameter 1600 voxels in this paper note this parameter relates to heterogeneity of the displacement process and can behave differently depending on the physical scale of the flow domain and the relative importance of viscous forces initial saturation the capillary pressure at the end of drainage initial condition for water flooding determines how much water is left in corners of the pore space or in small pores and throats these water filled elements in turn affect the capillary entry pressure computations and lead to a more water wet behaviour compared to the case where water is drained down to a high capillary pressure as stated in section 4 we run the drainage simulation down to water saturations of 12 8 to investigate the effect of initial condition on the computed flow properties using the gnm the results in fig 6 show that initial saturation capillary pressure plays a major role in controlling the displacement behaviour during water flooding the initial occupancy of brine has an impact on the whole displacement sequence it is necessary to reproduce the starting state of the water flood as accurately as possible bultreys et al 2020 the viscous pressure drop and the size of the network used in the computation of upscaling properties have a smaller impact this is to be expected as the experiments were run in the capillary controlled regime where viscous effects are small and the network itself is sufficiently large to encompass a representative elementary volume mostaghimi et al 2012 5 4 model parameters in fig 7 we investigate the effect of a set of the gnm parameters that were found to have the largest impact on the prediction of upscaled flow properties these parameters are not input parameters and hence the objective is not to quantify uncertainties but to better understand the model and find where further refinement of the model can be the most effective in improving its predictive power piston like curvature contribution to s w this coefficient is used as a first order correction for computation of fluid saturations in piston like configurations the volume of the phase toward the pore centre non wetting phase is set to that computed using linear interpolation of corner level volumes raeini et al 2018 minus this factor times the contact angle normalized by π this factor is set to 1 0 5 in the analysis presented here this feature has not been implemented in our previous work see raeini et al 2018 eqn 22 pore sagittal curvature coefficient similarly we modify the equation used for calculation of layer sagittal curvatures at pore centres raeini et al 2018 eq 13 by multiplying it with a constant factor of 0 1 base case and 1 33 corner sagittal curvatures in this analysis represent the interfacial curvature along the corner medial axis which is subtracted from the total curvature to obtain the curvature in axial cross sections of the corners and in turn to obtain the snap off threshold pressures and the volume fraction of the water phase in the layers see raeini et al 2018 for more details conductance coefficient c 1 this coefficient is introduced to further investigate and calibrate the correlations used to compute flow conductivities of the corner levels eq d 3 in appendix d here we chose c 1 0 1 0 05 piston like conductivity coefficient this is a correction factor multiplied by the interpolated conductivity of fluids under a piston like configuration its values are chosen as 0 55 0 45 in this analysis fig 7 shows that the conductance coefficient has a major effect on the single phase permeability and formation factor but has a smaller impact on the relative permeability another important observation is that the parameters used to approximate the volume of fluids in piston like configurations have a relatively high impact on the saturation computations in comparison the sagittal curvature has a moderate impact on the upscaled flow properties although the impact of these parameters is lower compared to the impact of uncertainties in the inputs in particular contact angle distributions it is important to further calibrate the model using direct simulations so that it can be used as a complementary tool to better understand the experimental results and to perform more accurate case studies to optimize the microscopic performance of the two phase flow processes of interest overall this section has shown that the wettability voxel size image resolution and initial conditions are the three most sensitive inputs to pore scale models even though high resolution imaging can resolve most of the pore space detailed features such as pore wall roughness cannot be captured furthermore while energy balance does provide a good average estimate of contact angle it cannot yet be applied with sufficient precision to assign pore by pore values the result is that there is a significant range of uncertainty in model predictions which is mirrored by uncertainties in the experiments themselves again related to image quality and the measurement of pressure differential future improvements in experimental protocols and imaging facilities should be able to reduce these uncertainties and to increase the predictive power and applicability of this imaging and modelling workflow to a wider range of samples 6 conclusions in this paper we have presented an overview of the uncertainty in micro ct based experimental data and compared the results with network model predictions considering the range of uncertainties in network model parameters that are used to compute fluid volumes and threshold curvatures as well as flow and electrical conductivities our results demonstrate that the generalized network model predictions are close to the range of the experimental data and hence the model can be used to study and optimize two phase flow processes at the pore scale nevertheless the complexities of two phase flow through porous media introduces significant uncertainties in our experimental data and in the description of our pore scale model inputs which implies that a more integrated experimental and modelling approach is needed we have presented several sensitivity studies that show the potential of pore scale models and reveal the pore scale parameters that play an important role in displacement processes these sensitivity analyses indicate that parameters such as wettability pore geometry and surface morphology have a large impact on the upscaled flow properties minimizing the uncertainties these parameters introduce in our workflow however requires collecting more high quality experimental data with lower uncertainty ranges as well as performing high fidelity direct simulations to further improve our understanding of two phase flow such data can be used to improve the network model predictions both in terms of local pore by pore parameters as well as upscaled flow properties credit authorship

can be estimated based on variations on grey scale intensity i of different phases assuming that they scale linearly with the volume fraction of each phase the porosity can be estimated based on the intensity of the phases in the images a 1 i i s 1 ϕ ϕ i a a 2 ϕ i i s i a i s where subscripts a and s stand for air and solid phase respectively and i stands for the average intensity of the whole image similarly fluid saturations can be estimated based on the intensity of the phases in partially saturated images containing oil o brine b and solid s a 3 i i s 1 ϕ i o ϕ s o i w ϕ 1 s o a 4 s o i i w ϕ 1 ϕ i s ϕ i o i w here i is the average intensity of the partially saturated image differential imaging can be used to both simplify the equations and reduce the uncertainty in the measured porosity and saturations when subtracting brine saturated image from the dry image the solid phase intensities cancel out i s 0 and air and brine intensities are subtracted from each other i a w therefore eq a 1 can be written as a 5 ϕ i i a w similarly when subtracting the partially saturated image from the brine saturated image brine and solid phase intensities cancel out and calling the subtracted oil and brine phase intensity i o w eq a 3 yields a 6 s o i ϕ i o w therefore in differential imaging the remaining sources of uncertainty are the intensity values for the void space in the differential image i a w and the differential value of the oil invaded regions i o w additionally increasing the contrast between the water and oil x ray attenuations will lead to lower uncertainties however there is a trade off as making one phase too opaque to x ray leads to lower image quality and increased image blur which makes image segmentation less accurate appendix b experimental saturation and pressure difference table b 1 shows the re evaluation of the uncertainty in the water saturations measured based on differential imaging discussed in appendix a and in the measured pressure difference along the sample which is assumed to be the same as the measured pressure drop in the tubing connecting the sample holder to the injecting and receiving pumps described by gao et al 2020 appendix c image segmentation our current flow simulation model uses for simplicity a segmented image for the description of the geometry typical micro ct images have a blur of few voxels across the boundary between fluid and solid phases and where the exact boundary is chosen during the image segmentation can affect the hydraulic radii of pore throats and fluid images this in turn can have a major impact on the computed flow transmissibility which scales with the radius to the fourth power although there has been previous research on different image segmentation approaches schlüter et al 2014 for analysing micro ct images of porous media our understanding of the effect of image processing steps and the segmentation algorithm on the predicted single and multiphase flow properties is incomplete global thresholding algorithms such as the otsu algorithm rely only on the grey scale intensity histograms and do not perform well for 3d geometries and for multi label segmentation other commonly used segmentation algorithms are watershed and weka machine learning which has been investigated in garfi et al 2020 for their impact on image statistics and single phase flow properties supervised weka machine learning incorporates the spatial distribution of the grey scale intensities into account for selection of its local thresholds however it requires human input to set its internal parameters and its performance cannot be quantified separate from those inputs watershed segmentation uses the image intensity gradient to choose its thresholds to separate different regions of the image in particular it can avoid the segmentation of image blur ring effects into fluid layers however it cannot be used without extensive filtering if the image does not have relatively sharp boundaries between different regions or does not have high signal to noise ratio moreover the location of maximum gradient may not necessarily be the optimal value for separating different image regions with varying sizes the algorithm presented in this section combines local and global thresholding approaches to have a relatively simple but flexible algorithm that aims to avoid the misclassification of image blur as an intermediate phase and yet allows small fluid layers to be identified this however requires further investigation using a data driven approach to choose the parameters of the algorithm and of the image enhancement algorithm such as the number of iterations and kernel sizes in this work these parameters are simply chosen by visually inspecting the resulting segmentation of the image and comparing it with the grey scale image we first filter the images using a bilateral mean with simultaneous bounded sharpening algorithm where each voxel value is recursively altered based on weighted averages of its adjacent voxels as follows c 1 δ v b l w b δ v j w b w b 1 1 δ v j 2 σ v 2 d x i j 2 σ l 2 c 2 δ v s h w s δ v j w s w s min δ v j 2 σ v 2 ε d x i j 2 σ l 2 c 3 δ v min w m δ v j w m w m step δ v j 0 c 4 δ v max w x δ v j w x w x step δ v j 0 c 5 v i f i l t v i min max δ v min δ v b l 1 f s h f s h δ v s h δ v max where δ v b l δ v s h δ v min and δ v max are changes to voxel values v i using weighted bilateral unsharp max and min algorithms which differ only in the choices of the weighting factors w as shown in the equations above δ v j represents the difference between an adjacent j voxel intensity and the intensity of the voxel itself v i to segment the image we first select an initial guess for different threshold values that separate the image into different labels by visually inspecting the grey scale slices and their histograms this initial guess is used to assign the seeds for a clustering algorithm a voxel is chosen as a seed if it falls within 25 75 percentile of the threshold values for each region voxels that have adjacent voxels assigned to one or more of the segmentation regions are assigned to the region g with the lowest rank f i g which is computed for each voxel v i and region pair c 6 f i g v i v j g 1 f g f g v i med v g c σ min 1 c s m f g f c a p where med stands for median value of all voxels in the region f g is a weighting factor which when set to a value closer to one moves the algorithm toward a global thresholding algorithm v j g is the average of adjacent voxels belonging to region g and f g w j g w j is a measure of the fraction of the adjacent voxels belonging to region g having a larger value for f g implies that small scale features whose segmentation purely based on the grey scale values has a high uncertainty are assigned to the label of the adjacent voxels with the highest frequency the image filtering and segmentation algorithms discussed above and the image blur artefacts effectively lead to a smoother representation of the solid surfaces compared to the actual pore geometry this can be compensated by reintroducing roughness to the pore wall surface by iteratively changing the voxels on either side of the void solid boundary with a given probability the resulting image with altered surface morphology is used as the fourth representation of the void space in our network extraction and flow modelling in this work fig c 8 shows a slice at the middle of the segmentation of the dry image by gao et al 2020 and the differential image difference between dry and the fully brine saturated images using the algorithm presented above a screenshot showing the qualitative difference of the two segmentations is also presented which highlight potential sources of uncertainty in direct simulation and pore network modelling results both segmentations presented in fig c 8 under predict the porosity while over predicting the permeability compared to the experimentally measured value see table e 3 this problem can be addressed by altering the surface morphology as shown in table e 4 further research is needed to have a reliable workflow for predicting these properties for different levels of imaging artefacts and different rock types appendix d corner conductivity correlations in the generalized network model the pore space is divided into corner elements and each corner is further discretized into three sub elements whose conductivities are in this work obtained using the correlations presented below the corner level 1 represents single phase flow corner levels 2 and 3 represent scenarios where voxels inside inscribed spheres larger than respectively 1 and 0 7 times the throat radius are filled with a different fluid than those deeper in the corner edge further details on how these correlations are used in the generalized network model are discussed in raeini et al 2018 the corner electrical and flow conductivities g i e and g i q respectively at discretization levels i 2 and 3 are obtained using the following equations d 1 g i e τ c a i l i i 2 3 d 2 g i q τ c 2 0 168 0 036 γ i r i 2 g i e i 2 3 where r i is the inscribed radius corresponding to the corner discretization level a i is its cross sectional area l i is its length and τ c is a tortuosity factor set to 0 95 in this study to estimate the conductivity of corner centres we first estimate them using the corner parameters at the throat surface d 3 g 1 e a 1 c 1 g a 2 l 1 d 4 g 1 q r 2 2 g 1 e 8 4 a 2 a 1 where c 1 g is a coefficient used to perform sensitivity study and calibrate the conductivity correlations in fig 7 the conductivities above are corrected for the effect of expansion of the half throat cross sectional area between the throat surface and the adjacent pore centres d 5 g 1 e g 1 e r p t d 6 g 1 q g 1 q r p t 3 1 δ r p t δ r p t 2 3 where r p t r p r t and δ r p t r p r t r t are the expansion ratio and the relative expansion of the maximal sphere radius from the throat centre to the pore centre finally the corner conductivities at level i 2 are added to these conductivities to obtain the level 1 single phase flow conductivities d 7 g 1 e g 1 e g 2 e d 8 g 1 q g 1 q g 2 q further details on these correlations and their incorporation in the gnm is discussed in raeini et al 2017 2018 appendix e direct flow simulations on pore space and fluid images e 1 single phase flow properties this section presents the results of direct single phase flow simulations dns using the openfoam finite volume library we use the same formulation as in raeini et al 2012 but for single phase flow only the finite volume mesh is generated directly from the micro ct image of the pore space without smoothing the voxelization artefacts on the solid boundaries the rationale behind using dns instead of gnm is that gnm can predict dns simulation results exactly if its flow conductivities are obtained from upscaling of the dns results and can reproduce them closely when the conductivities are obtained using correlations raeini et al 2017 furthermore the focus of this section is to study imaging and image processing artefacts while excluding any approximations which might be introduced during the network modelling workflow we have presented sensitivity studies for the effect of voxel size in table e 2 for the effect of segmentation algorithm in e 3 and for the effect of surface morphology at the scale of the voxel sizes 3 58 μ m in table e 4 the results in table e 2 show that voxel size plays an important role in the prediction of single phase flow properties from micro ct images despite its minor role in the two phase flow results presented in section 5 2 the sensitivity of the single phase flow properties to different segmentations of the void space in table e 3 is also significant finally surface morphology plays an important role both in prediction of single phase flow properties table e 4 as well as in the prediction of two phase flow properties using the gnm formulation see fig 5 further investigation is needed to have a predictive workflow to obtain single phase flow properties without input from experimental data e 2 direct flow simulations on micro ct images of individual fluids in order to have an assessment of imaging and image processing artefacts we have performed direct single phase flow simulations on voxels assigned to each fluid phase in the images hussain et al 2014 berg et al 2016 and plotted the simulation results in fig e 9 we have performed the simulations using both slip and no slip boundary conditions on the fluid fluid interface for the segmentation of fluid phases by gao et al 2020 the slip boundary condition simulates a case where there is no viscous drag force on the fluid fluid interface while a no slip boundary condition represents a high resistive drag force either of these scenarios can occur during two phase flow depending on the fluid viscosity and relative velocity furthermore in this figure we have presented simulations on an alternative segmentation of the pore space and fluid phases using the clustering algorithm presented in appendix c to have an assessment of the effect of image segmentation on the predicted flow conductivities the simulation results in fig e 9 using the slip and no slip boundary conditions are similar a difference of 13 on average however the results in this figure for the two segmentations of the fluid phases show that segmentation can have a major effect on the quantification of the flow conductivities and that higher resolution images are required to accurately quantify conductivities of the imaged fluid phases using direct single phase flow simulations regardless of the segmentation and boundary conditions chosen the predictions of relative permeability are poor with a tendency to over predict the flow conductance this suggests that simply applying dns on pore space images unless run on very high resolution images is not necessarily a reliable method to assess flow properties the reason for this is that dns cannot accurately capture flow in thin wetting layers in pore space corners nor can it account for the effect of sub resolution roughness while pore network models simplify the pore space geometry they can empirically account for these effects to provide robust predictions appendix f supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can be found online at https doi org 10 1016 j advwatres 2022 104194 this includes

156,we use a generalized pore network model in combination with image based experiments to understand the parameters that control upscaled flow properties the study is focued on water flooding through a reservoir sandstone under water wet and mixed wet conditions a set of sensitivity studies is presented to quantify the role of wettability pore geometry initial and boundary conditions as well as a selection of model parameters used in the computation of fluid volumes curvatures and flow and electrical conductivities we quantify the uncertainty in the model predictions which match the measured relative permeability and capillary pressure within the uncertainty of the experiments our results show that contact angle initial saturation image quality and image processing algorithm are amongst

challenges in the energy sector groundwater resource management and environmental science as well as in industrial applications that rely on flow through granular and fibrous media examples of the

resistivity index r i archie 1942 glover 2016 dispersion coefficient sahimi 2011 bijeljic et al 2011 and reaction rates white and brantley 2003 al khulaifi et al 2019 these properties in particular p c k r and r i are functions of fluid saturation displacement scenario as well as fluid and solid properties such as wettability and pore geometry morrow 1970 armstrong et al 2012 furthermore predictions of these properties may be subject to high natural measurement or simulation uncertainty dicarlo et al 2000 reynolds and krevor 2015 ramstad et al 2020 zahasky et al 2020 traditionally the macroscopic flow properties of porous media have been estimated by matching empirical or numerical models to experimental measurements of pressures and average saturation oak 1988 dicarlo et al 2000 reynolds and krevor 2015 moghadasi et al 2016 a quantification of the uncertainty in these measurements however has rarely been presented this poses a challenge for modelling studies for a statistically valid comparison of predicted properties with experiment the values should be similar to within the range of uncertainty in both the experiment and model itself without a proper evaluation of experimental uncertainty this comparison is of a somewhat subjective nature particularly when these uncertainties are large several different methods have been developed over the past decades to predict the macroscopic properties of porous media including pore network models øren et al 1998 valvatne and blunt 2004 gostick et al 2016 regaieg and moncorgé 2017 raeini et al 2018 and numerical models that simulate flow directly on images of the pore space tartakovsky and meakin 2006 raeini et al 2014 pereira nunes et al 2016 alpak et al 2016 akai et al 2019a gago et al 2021 direct simulations are computationally expensive for many practical applications that require running sensitivity studies and uncertainty quantification on relatively large flow domains regaieg et al 2021 pore network models on the other hand require extensive validation to be considered reliable for the prediction of macroscopic flow properties recent advances in direct numerical simulations and experimental pore scale measurements have provided the necessary data for their validation and refinement andrew et al 2014a yang et al 2017 singh et al 2017 gao et al 2020 pore network models in turn are efficient tools for understanding and optimizing decision variables that influence the pore scale physics of the industrial or environmental processes under consideration similarly experimental techniques together with imaging of fluid phases in porous media have been used to investigate two phase flow mechanisms in micro model experiments keller et al 1997 chapman et al 2013 yang et al 2017 and in x ray imaging experiments on natural or synthetic porous media wildenschild and sheppard 2013 andrew et al 2014a fogden et al 2015 scanziani et al 2017 the data generated experimentally have been used to investigate wettability characteristics of porous media andrew et al 2014a alhammadi et al 2017 rucker et al 2020 and displacement parameters such as the effect of flow rate zhang et al 2021 spurin et al 2019 furthermore the results have been used to evaluate the accuracy of direct simulations akai et al 2019a as well as pore network models bultreys et al 2018 raeini et al 2019 foroughi et al 2021 this work uses the experimental data by gao et al 2020 who simultaneously measured the pressure difference across a reservoir sandstone sample while imaging the rock and fluids within it the experiments were steady state injection of brine and oil into the same reservoir sandstone sample under two wettability conditions before and after exposing the sample to a crude oil at high temperature their application of pore space imaging allowed measurements of both capillary pressure and relative permeability from the same experiment another advantage of this type of data for validation of network models compared to core scale measurements is the quantification of contact angles in situ at different stages of the displacement process in this paper we first quantify the uncertainty in the experimental data generated by gao et al 2020 and then use this data to validate the upscaled flow properties predicted using the generalized pore network model gnm raeini et al 2018 finally the generated x ray images of the pore space are used to build different digital realizations of the pore space using the gnm and to study the effect of various pore scale parameters on the macroscopic two phase flow properties this work complements our previous study on water wet porous media raeini et al 2019 where we quantified uncertainty in the average fluid occupancy to be typically less than 5 between pairs of repeated unsteady state experiments by andrew et al 2014b while the local pore by pore occupancy uncertainty was of the order of 5 20 the discrepancy between the gnm and experiments was less than 10 for the average saturation and occupancy and between 20 30 in their local pore by pore counterparts note that these differences even for repeat experiments on exactly the same sample are sizeable the implication is that the uncertainty in both the measurement and modelling of pore scale processes need to be quantified carefully this is the focus of this paper in the following section we discuss the workflows used in this paper then in section 3 we present an evaluation of the uncertainty in the experimental data which is principally due to ambiguities in image segmentation to find saturation and the measurement of pressure difference afterwards in section 4 we show a comparison between the gnm results and the experimental data while taking into account the effect of uncertainty in input contact angle and initial water saturation on network model predictions in section 5 the contribution of various input parameters describing the sample wettability pore geometry and initial and boundary conditions as well as the approximations used in the gnm are quantified through sensitivity studies the results are used to draw conclusions on relative importance of these parameters for further refinement of experimental protocols and pore network models 2 methodology this study aims to move towards integrating our experimental and modelling tools to better understand the mechanisms controlling two phase flow through porous media and to reduce uncertainty in measuring or predicting them as illustrated in fig 1 2 1 image based special core analysis scal the experimental data used in this paper are discussed in detail in gao et al 2020 who performed steady state co injection of oil and brine into a reservoir sandstone at several steps of increasing water fractional flows while recording the pressure difference between the injecting and receiving pumps during each fractional flow experiment micro ct images of the whole sample 32 mm in length and 6 mm in diameter were taken at a voxel size of 6 35 μ m as well as zoomed in scans of the middle part at a voxel size of 3 58 μ m the experiments were repeated after exposing the sample to a crude oil at a high pressure and temperature to alter its wettability from water wet to mixed wet additionally images of the sample in dry and fully brine saturated states were taken by gao et al 2020 which are used in this study to obtain different representations of the pore space for network extraction the zoomed in images of the sample during oil brine flow were further analysed by gao et al 2020 to obtain capillary pressure and contact angles the contact angles were computed using an automatic algorithm alratrout et al 2017 and using energy balance blunt et al 2019 in this work we have re evaluated the uncertainty in the estimations of fluid saturations relative permeability and capillary pressure which is discussed below the saturations used in this paper were computed by applying differential imaging to the experimental images the differential imaging technique and the assessment of the uncertainty in the measured saturations are discussed in appendix a this involves first rescaling the grey scale intensity values to have the same values for the voxels of the tubing sample holder and the impermeable parts of the solid matrix then individual images were subtracted from the brine saturated image and the intensity values of the brine and oil phases were sampled at different locations along the sample whose standard deviation is used to estimate the range of saturations as described in appendix a the pressure difference was measured between the fluid injection and receiving pumps which account for the pressure drop across the sample δ p assumed to be the same in both phases as well as the pressure drop in the tubing gao et al 2020 these measurements have a low uncertainty themselves the issue is the pressure difference in the tubing connecting the pumps to the sample during two phase flow which was comparable to the pressure drop across the rock itself and was estimated in separate experiments performed without the sample present we assume that the pressure difference across the sample has an uncertainty of the same magnitude as the tubing pressure drop see appendix b which are converted to uncertainty ranges in relative permeability using the multiphase darcy law 1 q k abs k r a μ δ p l where q represents the flow rate of each phase and k r is the phase relative permeability finally k abs a and l are respectively single phase permeability cross sectional area and length of the sample the capillary pressures p c were computed by gao et al 2020 from the curvature of imaged fluid fluid interfaces 2 p c σ k c where k c 2 is the mean interface curvature and σ is the interfacial tension 0 051 n m in this study however the uncertainty range in the measured p c is re estimated in this work based on the analysis by akai et al 2019b the average uncertainty in the water wet case capillary pressure was estimated to be 820 pa 30 of measured average capillary pressure and is assumed to be the same for all fractional flows for both water wet and mixed wet experiments a more accurate quantification of uncertainty and how to minimize it however is subject to future work the estimated uncertainties in the experimental p c and k r curves are presented in section 3 2 2 direct simulations on images of fluid phases we have presented an analysis of single phase flow conductivities using direct numerical simulations dns in appendix e 1 these results show that both image resolution and segmentation algorithm can affect the quantification of single phase flow properties additionally in appendix e 1 we show that introducing surface roughness is necessary for the direct simulations to match the measured porosity and permeability of the sample simultaneously it also is possible to estimate relative permeability using dns on the images of individual fluid phases obtained during the two phase flow experiments hussain et al 2014 berg et al 2016 however due to the high sensitivity of conductances to the inscribed radii of flow paths this approach requires high resolution and sharp images of the fluid fluid and fluid solid boundaries therefore we expect the errors associated with this approach to be higher compared to the conductivities obtained directly from pressure drop measurements or from direct two phase flow simulation that considers viscous coupling between the phases nevertheless this approach is presented in appendix e 2 to provide an alternative estimation of upscaled properties which can be used to evaluate the effect of imaging artefacts and the segmentation of the images into different fluid and rock labels 2 3 generalized network modelling of two phase flow the third approach in fig 1 is to use the generalized network model gnm to predict capillary pressure and relative permeability the gnm incorporates a rich representation of geometry extracted from the micro ct images while simulating pore scale phenomena such as layer flow contact angle hysteresis snap off and cooperative pore body filling see raeini et al 2017 2018 for details of the gnm algorithm here we mainly focus on studying its inputs and the main parameters that describe the approximations used in this model to extract a network of the pore space images should be first segmented the segmentation algorithm and thresholds can affect the properties of the extracted network and flow simulation results to account for the effect of the segmentation we run the network on i the segmentation reported in the original work gao et al 2020 ii a segmentation of the pore space using a multi label clustering algorithm described in appendix c iii a representation of the pore space obtained using the clustering algorithm but with an altered surface morphology to account for sub resolution surface features that can be missed after image reconstruction and segmentation schlüter et al 2014 and finally iv an image called rock a provided by totalenergies of another sample drilled from the same sandstone core at a higher resolution of 1 5 μ m the measured contact angles can be uncertain and affected by the image processing steps contact angles computed geometrically alratrout et al 2017 correspond to interfaces that are stable and hence may take any value between their advancing and receding values furthermore despite the detailed images of fluid phases at several snapshots during the experiment the time resolution of the micro ct images is limited and we can only obtain average measures of the contact angle distribution therefore here we do not adjust contact angles on a pore by pore basis but instead assign them statistically based on the analysis by gao et al 2020 using the thermodynamic approach blunt et al 2019 as it measures the overall behaviour of the system during displacement in the generalized network model gnm we use geometrical approximations to compute interfacial curvatures and fluid saturations and correlations to compute fluid conductivities these are further explained in raeini et al 2018 where the development of the model has been guided through analytical approximations and direct two phase flow simulations on synthetic geometries furthermore a description of the conductivity correlations are given in appendix d the aim of this study is to evaluate the reliability of the correlations used in the gnm using micro ct based experimental data find potential areas for future improvement and more importantly to quantify the role of important parameters that control two phase flow through porous media all gnm simulation results presented in this work correspond to water flooding cycle after primary drainage oil injection during primary oil injection the rock is assumed to be water wet receding contact angles of zero but its end point initial condition for the water flooding cycle is considered to be uncertain and is investigated through the sensitivity studies as a base case we run the primary drainage cycle up to a capillary pressure of 20 kpa 2 4 sensitivity studies on network model predictions the uncertainty in the gnm predictions originate both from the uncertainty in the model inputs and from the approximations used in the model the sensitivity to contact angle is performed by varying the mean value or spread standard deviation of the measured distribution for other parameters which we have not quantified based on experimental data such as wettability spatial correlation length corner connectivity and surface morphology we simply choose a plausible range and compute the change in the upscaled properties compared to the base case values the base case is a simulation where all parameters are kept as close as possible to experimental data as discussed in section 4 except for the parameter for which the sensitivity study is being performed whose base value is set to the mid value between its lower and upper bounds discussed in section 5 the uncertainties are presented in terms of mean signed deviation δ and mean absolute deviation δ from the base case values 3 δ φ φ upper φ lower 2 n 4 δ φ φ upper φ base φ upper φ base 2 n where φ base is the base case results of an upscaled property capillary pressure p c porosity ϕ saturation s w absolute k abs or relative k r w and k r o permeabilities formation factor f f or resistivity index r i φ upper and φ lower are the upscaled property values corresponding to the upper and lower bounds of the parameter for which the sensitivity analysis is being performed e g contact angle initial water saturation see section 5 finally the summations are performed over n which is equal to the number of times the sensitivity analysis is repeated multiplied by the number of data points describing each property all sensitivity studies presented in this paper are repeated for the four different representations of the void space discussed in the previous section therefore n 4 for single phase properties φ ϕ k abs or f f which are described using one data point per simulation for saturation dependent data φ p c k r w k r o or r i n 40 since we sample them at ten equally distanced saturation intervals for each simulation the differences are computed in linear space for the sake of simplicity which implies that larger relative permeability values contribute more to the reported differences nevertheless this analysis leads to a quantification of the relative importance of the input or model parameters for predicting the upscaled flow properties which are presented as bar charts in section 5 3 experimental results fig 2 presents the experimental results by gao et al 2020 with our evaluation of fluid saturations and uncertainty in capillary pressure and relative permeability as discussed in section 2 1 the fluid saturations presented in fig 2 are obtained using differential imaging see appendix a in this experiment a 3 5 solution of potassium iodide was used to improve the water brine phase x ray attenuation and increase its contrast with the oil the uncertainty in the differential imaging analysis can be reduced by increasing the contrast between the brine and oil phase however this needs to be optimized to firstly ensure a linear relationship between the phase contrast and fluid saturation and secondly to avoid image blur due to excessive blockage of the x ray signal by the contrast agent the uncertainty in relative permeability can also be further reduced by a more accurate quantification of the pressure difference across the sample and the tubing which can be substantial when using viscous fluids in the experiment nevertheless a similar level of uncertainty can be deduced from experimental data obtained using traditional core scale experiments dicarlo et al 2000 reynolds and krevor 2015 potentially due to the impact of core scale heterogeneity on flow at low capillary numbers the effect of various descriptors of the model and its inputs on the predicted macroscopic two phase flow properties are investigated using the gnm in the following sections 4 generalized network flow simulations in this section we demonstrate the sensitivity of the gnm predictions on contact angle on initial capillary pressure at the beginning of water flooding and on the image segmentation algorithm which were three of the most important input parameters of the gnm model the gnm results are compared with their experimental counterparts in fig 3 as described previously the range of contact angles used in the gnm simulations are chosen based on the experimentally measured values using the energy balance approach 20 80 for the water wet ww case and 40 120 for the mixed wet mw case gao et al 2020 fig 8c the contact angles assigned to pores are chosen from this range assuming a normal distribution with a standard deviation equal to 25 of the contact angle range 50 1 5 for the ww and 80 1 5 for the mw case and using a spatial correlation length of 2 1 pores alratrout et al 2018 the spatial correlation is achieved by clustering adjacent pores into groups of 2 1 pores and assigning a single contact angle to all pores in a cluster the range of uncertainty in the upscaled flow properties in fig 3 are obtained by shifting the mean of the contact angle distribution by 20 the simulations are presented on the four segmentations of the pore space discussed in the previous section the sandstone used in this study is considered a clean sandstone predominantly made of quartz grains our segmentation of the clay phase from the micro ct images indicated that only 0 3 of the bulk volume is made of clay minerals therefore in the simulations we assume that clay accounts for 1 5 of the pore volume 0 3 of total volume which contains immobile water this however is considered uncertain and hence is included in the uncertainty studies presented in section 5 the initial condition for the water flooding simulation is obtained by running a primary drainage simulation down to a specific water saturation or capillary pressure the initial capillary pressure of the experiment cannot be quantified from curvature measurements due to the limited resolution of the x ray images the initial water saturation is estimated using differential imaging to be 12 8 similarly in this work we run the drainage simulation down to water saturations of 12 8 to investigate the effect of initial condition on the predicted capillary pressure and relative permeability the gnm and experimental results overlap albeit with considerable uncertainty ranges the differences between the experiment and model in many cases can be attributed to the finite resolution of the 3d images of the pore space and the network model the differences in the wettability of the simulations and the experiment and also to the differences in the treatment of boundary and initial condition at the beginning of water flooding in the following section we present a more detailed quantification of the uncertainties introduced due to different descriptors of wettability pore geometry initial and boundary conditions as well as an assessment of a selection of the model parameters used in the correlations and approximations of capillary entry pressures fluid volumes and conductivities these sensitivity studies together with further comparisons with more experimental data and with high resolution direct two phase flow simulations on benchmark geometries are necessary to quantify these discrepancies and further improve our pore scale experimental and modelling workflows 5 uncertainties in gnm predictions in this section to have a more comprehensive but compact quantification of the sensitivity we average the uncertainty ranges of each upscaled property s w k r w k r o r i k abs f f to obtain a single value for the impact of various input or model parameters on the upscaled flow property the results of sensitivity studies are further averaged over the simulations that have been performed over the four representations of the void space discussed in section 2 3 and are presented as bar charts the input and model parameters are divided into i descriptors of wettability distribution ii pore geometry iii initial and boundary conditions and iv model approximations 5 1 wettability fig 4 shows the effect of uncertainty in the input parameters describing the wettability of the sample advancing contact angle the effect of advancing contact angle is analysed by shifting the mean of the contact angle distribution by 2 0 compared to the base case values discussed in the previous section advancing contact angle range the effect of the range of contact angle is analysed by shrinking and expanding the contact angle range twice the standard deviations by 1 0 while keeping its mean value same as the base case contact angle radius correlation in this sensitivity study the radius correlation for contact angles is changed from uncorrelated to rank correlation coefficients of 1 with the inscribed radius wettability spatial correlation the wettability spatial correlation of contact angle is varied by a factor of two from a lower range of 1 2 pores to a mid case of 2 4 pores and a higher range of 4 8 pores the spatial correlation is implemented by clustering adjacent pores to randomly selected seed pores until all pores are selected the spatial correlation length represents the number of pores in the clusters the contact angle assigned to each cluster is chosen from a normal distribution with mean and standard deviations of 50 1 5 for the water wet ww simulations and 80 1 5 for the mixed wet mw case same as the base case the results in fig 4 indicate that the contact angle values and their distribution over the network play an important role in determining the upscaled flow properties hence indicating further research in this field is needed to better quantify them for various porous media types and fluids while we can assign a reliable average contact angle from energy balance we cannot at present determine precisely pore by pore values 5 2 pore space geometry fig 5 shows the effect of uncertainty in the input parameters describing the pore space geometry which are described below corner connectivity number corner elements in our model are assumed to be connected to 0 1 or 2 other corners from each side this is assigned based on proximity of corners and is not currently extracted directly from the underlying image we only allow two corners to be connected if their medial axes make an angle less than 90 to study the impact of this parameter here we further restrict the connectivity of some of the corners at random to account for potentially lower connectivity in the underlying image with probabilities of 0 base case 16 6 and 33 this means that the probability that a corner is connected to another corner from each side will be reduced from 1 to 0 834 and 0 67 respectively sub resolution water sub resolution water accounts for water absorbed in clay minerals or residing in small pores and crevices not resolved in the micro ct image these pores are assumed to have high capillary entry pressures and therefore remain water filled during the experiment and do not have a major contribution to flow conductivity due to their small size however they do contribute to water saturation and electrical conductivity the results in fig 5 are obtained from simulations where volume fractions of 0 1 5 base case and 3 of void space 0 0 3 and 0 6 of total volume respectively are assigned to these sub resolution pores the sandstone used in this study is a clean sandstone containing a small clay fraction compared to many sandstones found in hydrocarbon reservoirs therefore the sensitivity study presented here can underestimate the uncertainty in such cases voxel size the effect of voxel size is studied using the image of the rock a sandstone which was drilled from the same rock formation used in the rest of our analysis but was scanned at a smaller voxel size of 1 5 μ m by totalenergies it is then coarsened by factors of 1 2 and 3 to study the effect of voxel size 1 5 3 and 4 5 μ m respectively note that this analysis does not account for imaging artefacts when scanning the image at coarser resolutions where other factors such as image blur and signal to noise ratio can play a role too it solely accounts for the role of the image resolution used in the network extraction and its impact on flow simulations surface morphology micro ct images often have a degree of image artefacts such as a blur between the grey scale values of the pore space fluids and the minerals consequently their segmentation can lead to images of the pore surfaces that are smoother than the actual geometry to study the effect of surface morphologies that can be removed during the image processing we alter the voxels on either side of grain walls with a probability of 25 iteratively for 0 2 and 4 iterations these images are then used in the network extraction and flow model to predict the impact of surface morphologies at the scale of the voxel size on the network model predictions the results in fig 5 show that voxel size and surface morphology play an important role in the accuracy of single phase flow simulation of formation factor and absolute permeability additionally voxel size and corner connectivity number have a significant impact on two phase flow properties 5 3 initial and boundary conditions fig 6 shows the results of our sensitivity analysis on the input parameters that describe the initial condition at the beginning of the water flooding simulation and the boundary conditions that control the flow rates and contribution of viscous pressure in the displacement process viscous pressure drop in this analysis both phase viscous pressure drops were equal and set to δ p w δ p o 32 320 and 3200 pa 6 2 62 and 620 kpa m which partially covers the range of pressure gradients recorded in the experiment 62 1680 kpa m water viscous pressure drop here the oil phase pressure drop is kept at 1 pa while the water phase viscous pressure drop is varied from δ p w 1 to 500 and 1000 pa therefore the simulation results represent the effect of capillary pressure gradient for example due to boundary effects which can lead to a different pressure gradient in the two fluid phases oil viscous pressure drop similar to the case of water phase pressure drop here the oil non wetting phase viscous pressure drop is set to δ p o 1 500 and 1000 pa while the water phase viscous pressure drop is kept at 1 pa upscaling bounds the boundaries of the domain for which the flow properties are computed were set to 20 90 25 75 and 5 95 of the length of the images which are cylindrical domains of length 1400 and diameter 1600 voxels in this paper note this parameter relates to heterogeneity of the displacement process and can behave differently depending on the physical scale of the flow domain and the relative importance of viscous forces initial saturation the capillary pressure at the end of drainage initial condition for water flooding determines how much water is left in corners of the pore space or in small pores and throats these water filled elements in turn affect the capillary entry pressure computations and lead to a more water wet behaviour compared to the case where water is drained down to a high capillary pressure as stated in section 4 we run the drainage simulation down to water saturations of 12 8 to investigate the effect of initial condition on the computed flow properties using the gnm the results in fig 6 show that initial saturation capillary pressure plays a major role in controlling the displacement behaviour during water flooding the initial occupancy of brine has an impact on the whole displacement sequence it is necessary to reproduce the starting state of the water flood as accurately as possible bultreys et al 2020 the viscous pressure drop and the size of the network used in the computation of upscaling properties have a smaller impact this is to be expected as the experiments were run in the capillary controlled regime where viscous effects are small and the network itself is sufficiently large to encompass a representative elementary volume mostaghimi et al 2012 5 4 model parameters in fig 7 we investigate the effect of a set of the gnm parameters that were found to have the largest impact on the prediction of upscaled flow properties these parameters are not input parameters and hence the objective is not to quantify uncertainties but to better understand the model and find where further refinement of the model can be the most effective in improving its predictive power piston like curvature contribution to s w this coefficient is used as a first order correction for computation of fluid saturations in piston like configurations the volume of the phase toward the pore centre non wetting phase is set to that computed using linear interpolation of corner level volumes raeini et al 2018 minus this factor times the contact angle normalized by π this factor is set to 1 0 5 in the analysis presented here this feature has not been implemented in our previous work see raeini et al 2018 eqn 22 pore sagittal curvature coefficient similarly we modify the equation used for calculation of layer sagittal curvatures at pore centres raeini et al 2018 eq 13 by multiplying it with a constant factor of 0 1 base case and 1 33 corner sagittal curvatures in this analysis represent the interfacial curvature along the corner medial axis which is subtracted from the total curvature to obtain the curvature in axial cross sections of the corners and in turn to obtain the snap off threshold pressures and the volume fraction of the water phase in the layers see raeini et al 2018 for more details conductance coefficient c 1 this coefficient is introduced to further investigate and calibrate the correlations used to compute flow conductivities of the corner levels eq d 3 in appendix d here we chose c 1 0 1 0 05 piston like conductivity coefficient this is a correction factor multiplied by the interpolated conductivity of fluids under a piston like configuration its values are chosen as 0 55 0 45 in this analysis fig 7 shows that the conductance coefficient has a major effect on the single phase permeability and formation factor but has a smaller impact on the relative permeability another important observation is that the parameters used to approximate the volume of fluids in piston like configurations have a relatively high impact on the saturation computations in comparison the sagittal curvature has a moderate impact on the upscaled flow properties although the impact of these parameters is lower compared to the impact of uncertainties in the inputs in particular contact angle distributions it is important to further calibrate the model using direct simulations so that it can be used as a complementary tool to better understand the experimental results and to perform more accurate case studies to optimize the microscopic performance of the two phase flow processes of interest overall this section has shown that the wettability voxel size image resolution and initial conditions are the three most sensitive inputs to pore scale models even though high resolution imaging can resolve most of the pore space detailed features such as pore wall roughness cannot be captured furthermore while energy balance does provide a good average estimate of contact angle it cannot yet be applied with sufficient precision to assign pore by pore values the result is that there is a significant range of uncertainty in model predictions which is mirrored by uncertainties in the experiments themselves again related to image quality and the measurement of pressure differential future improvements in experimental protocols and imaging facilities should be able to reduce these uncertainties and to increase the predictive power and applicability of this imaging and modelling workflow to a wider range of samples 6 conclusions in this paper we have presented an overview of the uncertainty in micro ct based experimental data and compared the results with network model predictions considering the range of uncertainties in network model parameters that are used to compute fluid volumes and threshold curvatures as well as flow and electrical conductivities our results demonstrate that the generalized network model predictions are close to the range of the experimental data and hence the model can be used to study and optimize two phase flow processes at the pore scale nevertheless the complexities of two phase flow through porous media introduces significant uncertainties in our experimental data and in the description of our pore scale model inputs which implies that a more integrated experimental and modelling approach is needed we have presented several sensitivity studies that show the potential of pore scale models and reveal the pore scale parameters that play an important role in displacement processes these sensitivity analyses indicate that parameters such as wettability pore geometry and surface morphology have a large impact on the upscaled flow properties minimizing the uncertainties these parameters introduce in our workflow however requires collecting more high quality experimental data with lower uncertainty ranges as well as performing high fidelity direct simulations to further improve our understanding of two phase flow such data can be used to improve the network model predictions both in terms of local pore by pore parameters as well as upscaled flow properties credit authorship

can be estimated based on variations on grey scale intensity i of different phases assuming that they scale linearly with the volume fraction of each phase the porosity can be estimated based on the intensity of the phases in the images a 1 i i s 1 ϕ ϕ i a a 2 ϕ i i s i a i s where subscripts a and s stand for air and solid phase respectively and i stands for the average intensity of the whole image similarly fluid saturations can be estimated based on the intensity of the phases in partially saturated images containing oil o brine b and solid s a 3 i i s 1 ϕ i o ϕ s o i w ϕ 1 s o a 4 s o i i w ϕ 1 ϕ i s ϕ i o i w here i is the average intensity of the partially saturated image differential imaging can be used to both simplify the equations and reduce the uncertainty in the measured porosity and saturations when subtracting brine saturated image from the dry image the solid phase intensities cancel out i s 0 and air and brine intensities are subtracted from each other i a w therefore eq a 1 can be written as a 5 ϕ i i a w similarly when subtracting the partially saturated image from the brine saturated image brine and solid phase intensities cancel out and calling the subtracted oil and brine phase intensity i o w eq a 3 yields a 6 s o i ϕ i o w therefore in differential imaging the remaining sources of uncertainty are the intensity values for the void space in the differential image i a w and the differential value of the oil invaded regions i o w additionally increasing the contrast between the water and oil x ray attenuations will lead to lower uncertainties however there is a trade off as making one phase too opaque to x ray leads to lower image quality and increased image blur which makes image segmentation less accurate appendix b experimental saturation and pressure difference table b 1 shows the re evaluation of the uncertainty in the water saturations measured based on differential imaging discussed in appendix a and in the measured pressure difference along the sample which is assumed to be the same as the measured pressure drop in the tubing connecting the sample holder to the injecting and receiving pumps described by gao et al 2020 appendix c image segmentation our current flow simulation model uses for simplicity a segmented image for the description of the geometry typical micro ct images have a blur of few voxels across the boundary between fluid and solid phases and where the exact boundary is chosen during the image segmentation can affect the hydraulic radii of pore throats and fluid images this in turn can have a major impact on the computed flow transmissibility which scales with the radius to the fourth power although there has been previous research on different image segmentation approaches schlüter et al 2014 for analysing micro ct images of porous media our understanding of the effect of image processing steps and the segmentation algorithm on the predicted single and multiphase flow properties is incomplete global thresholding algorithms such as the otsu algorithm rely only on the grey scale intensity histograms and do not perform well for 3d geometries and for multi label segmentation other commonly used segmentation algorithms are watershed and weka machine learning which has been investigated in garfi et al 2020 for their impact on image statistics and single phase flow properties supervised weka machine learning incorporates the spatial distribution of the grey scale intensities into account for selection of its local thresholds however it requires human input to set its internal parameters and its performance cannot be quantified separate from those inputs watershed segmentation uses the image intensity gradient to choose its thresholds to separate different regions of the image in particular it can avoid the segmentation of image blur ring effects into fluid layers however it cannot be used without extensive filtering if the image does not have relatively sharp boundaries between different regions or does not have high signal to noise ratio moreover the location of maximum gradient may not necessarily be the optimal value for separating different image regions with varying sizes the algorithm presented in this section combines local and global thresholding approaches to have a relatively simple but flexible algorithm that aims to avoid the misclassification of image blur as an intermediate phase and yet allows small fluid layers to be identified this however requires further investigation using a data driven approach to choose the parameters of the algorithm and of the image enhancement algorithm such as the number of iterations and kernel sizes in this work these parameters are simply chosen by visually inspecting the resulting segmentation of the image and comparing it with the grey scale image we first filter the images using a bilateral mean with simultaneous bounded sharpening algorithm where each voxel value is recursively altered based on weighted averages of its adjacent voxels as follows c 1 δ v b l w b δ v j w b w b 1 1 δ v j 2 σ v 2 d x i j 2 σ l 2 c 2 δ v s h w s δ v j w s w s min δ v j 2 σ v 2 ε d x i j 2 σ l 2 c 3 δ v min w m δ v j w m w m step δ v j 0 c 4 δ v max w x δ v j w x w x step δ v j 0 c 5 v i f i l t v i min max δ v min δ v b l 1 f s h f s h δ v s h δ v max where δ v b l δ v s h δ v min and δ v max are changes to voxel values v i using weighted bilateral unsharp max and min algorithms which differ only in the choices of the weighting factors w as shown in the equations above δ v j represents the difference between an adjacent j voxel intensity and the intensity of the voxel itself v i to segment the image we first select an initial guess for different threshold values that separate the image into different labels by visually inspecting the grey scale slices and their histograms this initial guess is used to assign the seeds for a clustering algorithm a voxel is chosen as a seed if it falls within 25 75 percentile of the threshold values for each region voxels that have adjacent voxels assigned to one or more of the segmentation regions are assigned to the region g with the lowest rank f i g which is computed for each voxel v i and region pair c 6 f i g v i v j g 1 f g f g v i med v g c σ min 1 c s m f g f c a p where med stands for median value of all voxels in the region f g is a weighting factor which when set to a value closer to one moves the algorithm toward a global thresholding algorithm v j g is the average of adjacent voxels belonging to region g and f g w j g w j is a measure of the fraction of the adjacent voxels belonging to region g having a larger value for f g implies that small scale features whose segmentation purely based on the grey scale values has a high uncertainty are assigned to the label of the adjacent voxels with the highest frequency the image filtering and segmentation algorithms discussed above and the image blur artefacts effectively lead to a smoother representation of the solid surfaces compared to the actual pore geometry this can be compensated by reintroducing roughness to the pore wall surface by iteratively changing the voxels on either side of the void solid boundary with a given probability the resulting image with altered surface morphology is used as the fourth representation of the void space in our network extraction and flow modelling in this work fig c 8 shows a slice at the middle of the segmentation of the dry image by gao et al 2020 and the differential image difference between dry and the fully brine saturated images using the algorithm presented above a screenshot showing the qualitative difference of the two segmentations is also presented which highlight potential sources of uncertainty in direct simulation and pore network modelling results both segmentations presented in fig c 8 under predict the porosity while over predicting the permeability compared to the experimentally measured value see table e 3 this problem can be addressed by altering the surface morphology as shown in table e 4 further research is needed to have a reliable workflow for predicting these properties for different levels of imaging artefacts and different rock types appendix d corner conductivity correlations in the generalized network model the pore space is divided into corner elements and each corner is further discretized into three sub elements whose conductivities are in this work obtained using the correlations presented below the corner level 1 represents single phase flow corner levels 2 and 3 represent scenarios where voxels inside inscribed spheres larger than respectively 1 and 0 7 times the throat radius are filled with a different fluid than those deeper in the corner edge further details on how these correlations are used in the generalized network model are discussed in raeini et al 2018 the corner electrical and flow conductivities g i e and g i q respectively at discretization levels i 2 and 3 are obtained using the following equations d 1 g i e τ c a i l i i 2 3 d 2 g i q τ c 2 0 168 0 036 γ i r i 2 g i e i 2 3 where r i is the inscribed radius corresponding to the corner discretization level a i is its cross sectional area l i is its length and τ c is a tortuosity factor set to 0 95 in this study to estimate the conductivity of corner centres we first estimate them using the corner parameters at the throat surface d 3 g 1 e a 1 c 1 g a 2 l 1 d 4 g 1 q r 2 2 g 1 e 8 4 a 2 a 1 where c 1 g is a coefficient used to perform sensitivity study and calibrate the conductivity correlations in fig 7 the conductivities above are corrected for the effect of expansion of the half throat cross sectional area between the throat surface and the adjacent pore centres d 5 g 1 e g 1 e r p t d 6 g 1 q g 1 q r p t 3 1 δ r p t δ r p t 2 3 where r p t r p r t and δ r p t r p r t r t are the expansion ratio and the relative expansion of the maximal sphere radius from the throat centre to the pore centre finally the corner conductivities at level i 2 are added to these conductivities to obtain the level 1 single phase flow conductivities d 7 g 1 e g 1 e g 2 e d 8 g 1 q g 1 q g 2 q further details on these correlations and their incorporation in the gnm is discussed in raeini et al 2017 2018 appendix e direct flow simulations on pore space and fluid images e 1 single phase flow properties this section presents the results of direct single phase flow simulations dns using the openfoam finite volume library we use the same formulation as in raeini et al 2012 but for single phase flow only the finite volume mesh is generated directly from the micro ct image of the pore space without smoothing the voxelization artefacts on the solid boundaries the rationale behind using dns instead of gnm is that gnm can predict dns simulation results exactly if its flow conductivities are obtained from upscaling of the dns results and can reproduce them closely when the conductivities are obtained using correlations raeini et al 2017 furthermore the focus of this section is to study imaging and image processing artefacts while excluding any approximations which might be introduced during the network modelling workflow we have presented sensitivity studies for the effect of voxel size in table e 2 for the effect of segmentation algorithm in e 3 and for the effect of surface morphology at the scale of the voxel sizes 3 58 μ m in table e 4 the results in table e 2 show that voxel size plays an important role in the prediction of single phase flow properties from micro ct images despite its minor role in the two phase flow results presented in section 5 2 the sensitivity of the single phase flow properties to different segmentations of the void space in table e 3 is also significant finally surface morphology plays an important role both in prediction of single phase flow properties table e 4 as well as in the prediction of two phase flow properties using the gnm formulation see fig 5 further investigation is needed to have a predictive workflow to obtain single phase flow properties without input from experimental data e 2 direct flow simulations on micro ct images of individual fluids in order to have an assessment of imaging and image processing artefacts we have performed direct single phase flow simulations on voxels assigned to each fluid phase in the images hussain et al 2014 berg et al 2016 and plotted the simulation results in fig e 9 we have performed the simulations using both slip and no slip boundary conditions on the fluid fluid interface for the segmentation of fluid phases by gao et al 2020 the slip boundary condition simulates a case where there is no viscous drag force on the fluid fluid interface while a no slip boundary condition represents a high resistive drag force either of these scenarios can occur during two phase flow depending on the fluid viscosity and relative velocity furthermore in this figure we have presented simulations on an alternative segmentation of the pore space and fluid phases using the clustering algorithm presented in appendix c to have an assessment of the effect of image segmentation on the predicted flow conductivities the simulation results in fig e 9 using the slip and no slip boundary conditions are similar a difference of 13 on average however the results in this figure for the two segmentations of the fluid phases show that segmentation can have a major effect on the quantification of the flow conductivities and that higher resolution images are required to accurately quantify conductivities of the imaged fluid phases using direct single phase flow simulations regardless of the segmentation and boundary conditions chosen the predictions of relative permeability are poor with a tendency to over predict the flow conductance this suggests that simply applying dns on pore space images unless run on very high resolution images is not necessarily a reliable method to assess flow properties the reason for this is that dns cannot accurately capture flow in thin wetting layers in pore space corners nor can it account for the effect of sub resolution roughness while pore network models simplify the pore space geometry they can empirically account for these effects to provide robust predictions appendix f supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can be found online at https doi org 10 1016 j advwatres 2022 104194 this includes

157,coreflooding experiments with computed tomography imaging are becoming common practice they allow to investigate the sub core scale properties such as relative permeability k r and capillary pressure p c and to construct multiphase flow models that not only capture the core average flow but also the flow on the sub core millimeter scale this work presents two phase flow models of imbibition coreflooding in two heterogeneous core samples which underwent drainage and imbibition experiments as part of a previous investigation the models incorporate hysteresis in two approaches global and sub core the latter includes unique p c and k r for each grid block of the core depending on the turning point and residual saturations measured in the experiments the simulation output of grid block sub core saturation distribution is compared to the experimental data results show that the sub core hysteresis model matches the experiments more accurately than the global model this is particularly important for the core with a higher degree of heterogeneity in which the global hysteresis model shows large errors while the model incorporating sub core hysteresis is significantly

density of phase p 1 introduction coreflooding experiments are a common practice in the scientific community and in the industry they are conducted to investigate multiphase flow in porous media and to characterize reservoir flow properties typically the core samples are assumed to be homogeneous thus simplifying the characterization process and only requiring estimation of a single overall core value of permeability k relative permeability curves k r and capillary pressure function p c however many core samples exhibit heterogeneity which can impact the flow on larger scales in recent years characterizing sub core properties on the millimeter scale has been a topic of increasing interest this is important for a number of reasons discussed below in particular it is necessary for accurate coreflood modeling while a number of studies have been published on modeling of drainage experiments only very few previous studies discuss modeling imbibition with sub core scale properties in this work we present a new modeling approach for imbibition coreflood modeling using sub core hysteretic k r and p c modeling coreflooding on the sub core level is important for a number of reasons first it allows to investigate the impact of sub core heterogeneity on the core scale flow and to characterize trapping yortsos and chang 1990 perrin and benson 2010 krevor et al 2011 ruprecht et al 2014 wei et al 2014 kuo and benson 2015 krevor et al 2015 ni et al 2019 furthermore accurate numerical simulations of core flow kong et al 2013 krause and benson 2015 can be used to replace expensive and cumbersome experiments finally the relation between fine scale sub core and equivalent core scale properties can be studied and used to develop upscaling methods ataie ashtiani et al 2002 krause 2012 rabinovich et al 2015 2016 jackson and krevor 2020 when using computed tomography ct visualization during coreflooding experiments e g see table 1 in sun et al 2016 detailed data is obtained which allows to compare experimental results to model output on each and every grid block this is important for evaluating darcy scale flow numerical models and understanding their limitations moreno and rabinovich 2021a modeling drainage and imbibition coreflooding using various models with homogeneous permeability and a single set of k r and p c curves representing the entire core is quite common however to accurately match experimental 3d saturation distribution in heterogeneous cores permeability spatial distribution and capillary heterogeneity must be incorporated in the models for drainage coreflooding this was carried out by krause et al 2011 2013 rabinovich et al 2019 in which a capillary pressure permeability relationship is assumed as given by the leverett j function leverett 1941 and permeability distribution is estimated by inversion of this relationship an iterative procedure is applied until the correct k x y z is found which leads to an accurate match of the simulations with the experimental results a similar approach is taken by jackson et al 2018 wenck et al 2021 with the main difference that k is taken to be constant and only p c curves are spatially varying imbibition coreflooding is generally more challenging to model due to hysteresis in shi et al 2011 an attempt was made to model imbibition incorporating sub core scale properties however only a comparison of slice averaged saturation was presented rather than grid block saturation furthermore permeability was weakly estimated assuming an empirical relationship with porosity while rock properties were obtained by history matching most other studies regarding imbibition modeling considering sub core heterogeneity focused on evaluating the residual trapping akbarabadi and piri 2013 ruprecht et al 2014 krevor et al 2017 pini and benson 2017 ni et al 2019 while they offer important methods and insight for estimating k r and p c from imbibition experiments they do not construct full coreflooding models and perform simulations to compare with the experiments the only work we are aware of involving sub core modeling of imbibition coreflooding with a detailed comparison between simulation and experiment is by jackson and krevor 2019 in their model k is homogeneous while heterogeneity is expressed by the p c scaling factor without considering sub core scale hysteresis in this work we present a new approach to modeling imbibition coreflooding considering sub core scale hysteresis i e each grid block has a unique k r and p c curve based on hysteresis parameters turning point saturation residual saturation and land coefficient the approach is implemented to model experiments conducted on two rock samples with 3d heterogeneity promising results are observed in which saturation estimation is significantly improved in comparison to a conventional model with a global core hysteresis description we note that the topic of the current paper applies to general multiphase flows however the most pertinent field of application is co2 geological storage indeed most of the literature above as well as the experiments in this work considers co2 brine two phase flow the plan of the paper is as follows in section 2 we present the experiments and data analysis which were conducted in previous work and have already been published in section 3 we detail the methods implemented in this work for modeling the core properties and used as input for the numerical models in particular the novel sub core hysteresis approach in section 4 we present the simulation results for both global hysteresis and sub core hysteresis methods compare them to the experimental data and discuss them finally section 5 presents a summary of this work and the main conclusions 2 experimental data and previous analysis a series of multistage steady state drainage and imbibition coreflooding experiments were conducted on two sandstone samples known as bentheimer and shezaf rock samples all experiments were conducted at the stanford university coreflooding lab and previously reported in ni et al 2019 detailed information on the rock properties used in this study are shown in table 1 the mineralogy of the core samples were analyzed and found to be predominately quartz dominant and strongly water wet coreflooding experiments were conducted using a medical ct at a temperature of 50 c injection pressure of 1300 psia 9 mpa and confining pressure of 1500 psia 10 mpa supercritical co2 and deionized water were used as fluid pairs in all experiments and were pre equilibrated with each other to prevent dissolution of co2 in water at the reported experimental conditions the water and co2 viscosities were 5 48 1 0 4 and 2 3 1 0 5 pa s respectively lemmon et al 2002 the co2 water interfacial tension is 35 mn m the densities of water and co2 are 986 95 and 429 90 kg m 3 respectively the contact angle between co2 and water is 40 three dimensional porosity and steady state co2 saturation maps were obtained using a medical ct scanner by the procedure of akin and kovscek 2003 the former denoted ϕ ct is presented for both cores in figs 1a d in the first stage of the coreflooding routine drainage experiments co2 and water were co injected incrementally with co2 fractional flows of 50 80 90 95 and 100 into initially fully water saturated cores fractional flow ff is defined here as the co2 injection rate divided by the total injection rate three dimensional co2 saturation maps s c o 2 ct were obtained at steady state conditions determined by pressure stabilization for each ff and results for drainage experiments were previously presented in ni et al 2019 anto darkwah et al 2021 the second stage of the coreflooding experiments imbibition experiments which is the focus of this study consisted of decreasing ff order of 97 94 88 70 30 and 0 ct scans were taken at steady state conditions for all fractional flows the porosity turning point 100 ff and residual 0 ff co2 saturation maps at steady state are shown in fig 1 for bentheimer upper plots and shezaf lower plots sandstone rocks effective relative permeability curves for both rock samples were calculated using darcy s law for multiphase flow substituting the experimental steady state average pressure drop and average saturations computed from the 3d saturation maps a point is obtained for each ff leading to 5 points representing each of the 4 curves see figs 4a d water drainage k r w d and imbibition k r w i curves figs 4a c and co2 drainage k r c o 2 d and imbibition k r c o 2 i curves figs 4b d drainage capillary pressure curves p c d were obtained by mercury porosimetry using small samples of each rock see fig 5 more details on the drainage capillary pressure measurements are detailed in ni et al 2019 the curves are assumed to represent the entire core and can therefore be referred to as effective curves as opposed to sub core curves this is a common assumption however strictly speaking the porosimetry measured p c d are not necessarily effective properties as they were obtained from a sample smaller than the core itself effective imbibition capillary pressure curves p c i were calculated based on trapped non wetting phase models of land 1968 and pini and benson 2017 which includes grid block scaling to represent sub core curves the details on theory and calculation of imbibition capillary pressure curves are presented in section 3 2 1 permeability estimation in our previous work anto darkwah et al 2021 we detailed an improved procedure of the krause et al 2013 method for simultaneous estimation of permeability maps k x y z and characteristic relative permeability k r char considering drainage coreflooding experiments k r char curves are defined here as the curves of the millimeter scale i e the curves assigned to the grid blocks in the simulation and these are also referred to in previous literature as intrinsic relative permeability or rock curves k r char is a sub core property and it may be different than the effective k r measured in the experiments due to capillary effects also known as rate dependent k r huppler 1970 krause 2012 more information on the importance of rate dependent properties which can impact the flow modeling on larger scales can be found in rabinovich et al 2015 krause and benson 2015 rabinovich 2018 in this section we will briefly describe the k x y z and k r char estimation procedure from drainage experiments which was implemented in anto darkwah et al 2021 to obtain the k maps of the two core samples the same k maps were used in this work for modeling imbibition coreflooding using the porosity and co2 saturation maps obtained from ct scans the initial voxel level permeability can be obtained by inversion of the capillary pressure permeability relationship assumed to be the well known leverett j function scaling 1 p c s w k ϕ σ cos θ ϕ k j s w where σ is the interfacial tension and θ is contact angle between co2 and water taken to be uniform throughout the core sample furthermore capillary pressure saturation relationship is assumed to take the common form of brooks corey given by 2 p c s w p e s w 1 λ where p e and λ are fitting parameters and 3 s w s w s w i r 1 s w i r where s w i r is the irreducible water saturation we adopt an approximation in which eq 1 holds both at the sub core scale and at the core scale where k and ϕ are replaced by their core average values k ef and ϕ respectively krause et al 2013 as a result eqs 1 and 2 can be equated to obtain the j function term j s w as follows 4 j s w p e σ cos θ k ef ϕ s w 1 λ applying eq 1 to any voxel j with properties k j ϕ j p c j and s w j substituting eq 4 in eq 1 and rearranging leads to an expression for pointwise voxel permeability 5 k j κ ϕ j p c j 2 k ef ϕ p e s w j 1 λ 2 where κ is a scaling factor to ensure that the estimated effective permeability k x y z from single phase simulations matches that of experimentally determined permeability for the first estimate of k x y z capillary equilibrium is assumed in each slice of the core meaning that capillary pressure is roughly uniform and therefore the slice average p c can be used for all voxels in that slice i e p c i p c in eq 5 calculating p c by substituting slice average experimental saturation measurements s w ct in eq 2 and substituting in eq 5 we arrive at the initial estimation of k x y z this is the first step of the procedure the next step in the procedure is to estimate the characteristic relative permeability this is done using the method detailed in rabinovich et al 2019 which is briefly described here the governing equation for two phase immiscible flow with incompressible rock and fluid is given as 6 ϕ s p t k r p c h a r μ p k p p ρ p g z 0 where ϕ is the porosity of the rock k r p c h a r is the characteristic relative permeability to phase p p w or n w s p is the saturation of the phase p μ p is the phase viscosity p p is the phase pressure ρ p is the phase density g is the acceleration due to gravity and z is the vertical coordinate we apply the constraint s w s n w 1 and the phase pressures are related by 7 p c s w p n w p w the two phase flow equation can be split into two single phase equations by substitution of the steady state experimental saturation s co 2 ct into eq 6 to arrive at 8a k w x y z μ w p w ρ w g z 0 8b k co 2 x y z μ co 2 p co 2 ρ co 2 g z 0 the phase permeability k p is given by 9 k p x y z k x y z k r p char s w ct x y z the characteristic relative permeability k r p char is assumed uniform in the core and of the form given by 10a k r w c h a r s w n w 10b k r co 2 c h a r k r co 2 max 1 s w n co 2 we can substitute eqs 10 a b into eqs 8 a b respectively and solve them separately for pressures by using single phase simulations the effective permeability from a single phase flow equation can be calculated as 11 k p e f q p inj μ p l a c p p i n p p o u t where q inj is the injection flow rate i n denotes averaging over the core inlet and o u t denotes averaging over the outlet the effective relative permeability can therefore be obtained by 12 k r p e f k p e f k e f we conduct single phase flow simulations with varying parameters n w char and n co 2 char which lead to a point on the respective effective relative permeability curve k r w e f for the former and k r co 2 e f for the latter via eqs 11 12 the estimation of k r p c h a r is an optimization problem which searches for characteristic powers n w char and n co 2 char in eqs 10 a b that minimize the objective functions ff k r w ef ff k r w ff 2 and ff k r co 2 ef ff k r co 2 ff 2 respectively the estimated characteristic curves can then be used in a two phase simulation with the initial guess of k from eq 5 in order to accurately simulate and predict the experimental saturations using a two phase simulator the core outlet capillary pressure must be modeled correctly previous investigators richardson et al 1952 batycky et al 1981 have described the existence of capillary pressure discontinuity at the core outlet where fluids exit to account for this phenomenon also known as the end effect in coreflooding analysis the outer boundary p c is posed as zero berg et al 2013 jackson et al 2018 however this leads to significant underestimation of non wetting phase saturation near the core outlet recently moreno and rabinovich 2021b have shown that the end effects could impact large portions of the core and therefore can lead to erroneous non wetting phase numerical prediction therefore we take the approach of krause et al 2013 to impose a capillary pressure value p c o u t such that the average saturation in the outlet slice from numerical simulations matches that obtained by experimental saturation the p c o u t value is unique for different fractional flows of injected fluids and it is used in our methodology for accurate modeling of experiments the next step is to conduct a two phase simulation using initially estimated k k r c h a r and p c o u t the accuracy of estimated properties is determined by comparison of simulated output saturation s co 2 sim with experimental saturation s co 2 ct this is quantified by a simple equation 13 e r r 1 n j s co 2 j sim s co 2 j ct where j denotes a grid block cell i e voxel and n is the total number of grid blocks when the error is less than a threshold value the procedure is terminated and the estimated k and k r c h a r are obtained however if the error remains higher than the threshold value a new k is estimated using the inverse capillary pressure permeability relationship with simulation p c as input then k r c h a r and p c o u t are updated accordingly and new two phase simulations are conducted with the newly estimated properties this iterative procedure is repeated until eq 13 is less than the threshold each experimental saturation will lead to a different k x y z estimation and therefore the final result is obtained by geometric averaging k maps obtained from different experiments with varying ff for the two rocks considered here the probability density function of the final estimated k is presented in fig 2 it can be seen that the bentheimer rock has a k distribution which is approximately lognormal with a low variance of σ ln k 2 0 15 indicating weak heterogeneity the shezaf rock on the other hand is seen to have a more complicated k structure thought to be related to a low permeability horizontal steak in the core observed in fig 1e as a low saturation streak it is also a much more heterogeneous rock with σ ln k 2 1 68 3 method the interactions between injected co2 water and porous media are represented in numerical simulators by the use of relative permeability and capillary pressure models the increase in nonwetting phase saturation during co2 injection drainage and the subsequent increase in wetting phase saturation during high water fraction injection imbibition leads to dependence of k r and p c curves on the history of the local saturation this history dependence leads to trapping of the non wetting phase in regions that are predominantly invaded by co2 doughty 2007 to be able to numerically predict the co2 saturations during the imbibition experiments correct hysteric functions must be used in numerical simulators the following is a detailed description of the two hysteretic models used in this work the first which we refer to as a global hysteresis model is the conventional model in which hysteresis is expressed uniformly for the entire core the second which we address as a sub core hysteresis model allows for different hysteresis parameters for each grid block of the core 3 1 global hysteresis the trapping model of land 1968 is a popular model used in the literature to determine the non wetting phase trapping parameters 14 s n w r s n w i 1 c l s n w i where c l is the land trapping coefficient s n w r is the residual non wetting phase saturation below which gas is immobile and s n w i is the non wetting phase initial or turning point saturation at which core flow changes from drainage to imbibition we note that in our experiment s w i 1 s n w i is the saturation after 100 co2 injection this is always higher than the irreducible saturation s w i r which was calculated based on fitting the capillary pressure data as explained in detail in anto darkwah et al 2021 fig 3 presents initial residual ir plots for both bentheimer and shezaf rocks where s n w i and s n w r were obtained from the saturation maps of 100 figs 1b e and 0 ff figs 1c f both block saturations and core slice averages are plotted the heterogeneity of the shezaf sandstone can be observed through the large variation of the points in fig 3b and it is apparent that some blocks are above the 100 trapping line indicating that they undergo drainage rather than imbibition for a more detailed analysis of the trapping characteristics of these rocks we refer the readers to ni et al 2019 the land coefficient is obtained in two different ways the first is by fitting the model of eq 14 to the data points of slice averaged saturations leading to the yellow dashed curves presented in fig 3 the second is by substituting overall core average s n w r and s n w i in the equation 15 c l 1 s n w r 1 s n w i which is obtained simply by rearranging eq 14 the result is represented by the solid blue curve in the plots both calculations lead to very similar c l values as seen by the overlapping curves in the figures the final values of c l are presented in table 1 calculated via eq 15 and can be compared to c l 1 19 and 1 60 when calculated by fitting eq 14 to the data points due to the impact of experimental boundary effects it is common to use only the data in the central part of the core for determining c l we therefore plot in figs 3a b the data corresponding to the central region in green circles and calculate the land coefficient based only on this data for the shezaf rock results show that data points from the central end and front of the core all pretty much overlap indicating that the boundary effects are not significant this is consistent with the average saturation along the core see figs 10 11 which does not show any particular trend on the other hand the bentheimer results fig 3a show significant boundary effects in particular in the front of the core and this is consistent with the trend of decreasing average co2 saturation see figs 8 9 however in both cases the c l calculated with only data from the central part of the core c l 1 04 and 1 58 is almost the same as that calculated with the entire core c l 1 19 and 1 60 the global hysteresis model calls for relative permeability curves which are uniform in the core we begin by assuming that the effective curves are approximately the same as the characteristic curves therefore we seek k r that matches the measured experimental data points and these will represent both effective and sub core k r the wetting phase experimental data k r w presented in figs 4a c shows that the drainage and imbibition points are fitted by two very similar curves this is typical of the wetting phase curves which usually do not exhibit significant hysteresis therefore we model both curves with the same function k r w d k r w i given by eq 10 a with the fitting parameters n w 3 79 and n w 9 10 for the bentheimer and shezaf rocks respectively the k r c o 2 experimental data on the other hand is hysteretic and fitted by the dury et al 1999 model as applied by ruprecht et al 2014 the drainage curve is given by 16a k r c o 2 d 1 s w c 1 s w a b 16b s w s w s w i r 1 s w i r 1 s w 1 c l 1 s w and the imbibition curve by 17a k r c o 2 i 1 s w c 1 s w a b 17b s w s w s w i r 1 s w i r s n w i 1 c l s n w i where a b and c are fitting parameters it can be seen that at the turning point saturation s w s w i eqs 16 and 17 are equal i e k r c o 2 d s w i k r c o 2 i s w i as expected this applies to any turning point we consider on the drainage curve however we are interested in modeling the specific hysteresis of the experiment therefore both drainage and imbibition experimental data points are fitted simultaneously by eqs 16 and 17 to obtain the a b and c parameters values presented in table 1 the curves for both rocks are plotted in figs 4b d and the experimental turning points are marked in black circles in the plots the capillary pressure curve also requires a hysteresis model the experimental p c drainage data are denoted by p c d s w and are fitted by eq 2 as discussed in section 2 1 where fitting parameters p e entry pressure constant and λ are given in table 1 we then adopt the approach of pini and benson 2017 for the core imbibition hysteretic p c 18 p c i s w p c i s w m 1 λ 1 s w i s w m 1 where s w i is the normalized wetting phase saturation at the turning point defined in a similar manner to eq 3 by s w i s w i s w i r 1 s w i r p c i is obtained by the equivalence of the drainage and imbibition curves at the turning point i e the condition p c d s w i p c i s w i it can be expressed by combining and rearranging eqs 2 and 18 as 19 p c i p e 1 s w i 1 λ 1 s w m in eq 18 is the effective mobile wetting phase saturation related to the mobile nonwetting phase saturation by s w m 1 s n w m and the latter is defined by 20 s n w m 0 5 s n w s n w r s n w s n w r 2 4 c l s n w s n w r where s n w 1 s w the normalized land coefficient relates between normalized turning point and residual saturations as follows 21 c l 1 s n w r 1 s n w i and s w r s w r s w i r 1 s w i r 1 s n w r fig 5 presents the experimental data points for drainage p c as well as the fit obtained using eq 2 three imbibition curves can be seen obtained using eqs 18 21 two of which represent arbitrary choices of turning points s w i 0 7 0 8 in fig 5a and s w i 0 4 0 8 in fig 5b the third turning point s w i 0 44 in fig 5a and s w i 0 59 in fig 5b marked with a black circle is that pertaining to the experimental data and therefore the imbibition curve plotted in a thick black curve will be the ones used to model the experiment we note that the imbibition model for p c is based mostly on the drainage porosimetry data and imbibition data is only expressed by the land coefficient in eq 20 as opposed to the k r model which was fitted to imbibition experimental data the core effective p c curves plotted in fig 5 do not allow for capillary heterogeneity flow effects which are expected in our experiments therefore we will further adopt the p c model in pini and benson 2017 by incorporating capillary heterogeneity considering a leverett scaling term leverett 1941 thus the entry pressure is now varying with grid block such that p c for block j is given by 22 p c j d s w k j ϕ j p e ϕ j k ef ϕ k j s w 1 λ for drainage and 23 p c j i s w k j ϕ j p e ϕ j k ef ϕ k j s w m 1 λ 1 1 s w i 1 λ for imbibition where ϕ is the core average porosity and k ef is the core effective permeability 3 2 sub core hysteresis hysteresis is an expression of pore scale phenomena jerauld and salter 1990 joekar niasar et al 2013 and therefore we expect that even our experimental grid blocks being representative elementary volumes that fulfill darcy s law exhibit hysteresis as a result a logical extension of our coreflood models is to incorporate hysteresis on the grid block level attributing to each block j its own unique hysteretic parameters land coefficient c l j turning point s n w i j and residual saturation s n w r j the turning point and residual saturations for each block are obtained directly from the ct scan data of the 100 and 0 ff experiments respectively the grid block land coefficient is then obtained in a straightforward manner by substituting s n w i j and s n w r i j in eq 15 relative permeability with grid block hysteresis is assumed to take the form of eqs 16 17 where the grid block values of s n w i j and c l j replace the global values of s n w i and c l appearing in the equations the parameters a b and c in the equations are obtained by matching the experimental measurement points as explained below we can no longer match the k r model directly to the experimental k r as done in the global hysteresis model since now each grid block has a unique curve in addition the measured curves are effective and therefore flow rate dependent due to capillary effects see huppler 1970 krause 2012 while the grid block curves are characteristic we continue by seeking the sub core characteristic relative permeability in a similar approach to anto darkwah et al 2021 the steps for finding the parameters a b and c are as follows i we assume that the parameters are the same for each grid block therefore we seek only a single set ii an initial guess of parameters is chosen taken to be the global values presented in table 1 iii the phase permeability of each grid block is calculated by the formula 24a k c o 2 j d k j k r co 2 d s w j 24b k c o 2 j i k j k r co 2 i s w j where k c o 2 j d and k c o 2 j i are phase permeabilities of block j for drainage and imbibition respectively k j is the permeability of block j discussed in section 2 1 k r co 2 d s w j is grid block drainage relative permeability given by eq 16 a with 25 s w j s w j s w i r 1 s w i r 1 s w j 1 c l j 1 s w j and k r co 2 i s w j is grid block imbibition relative permeability given by eq 17 a with 26 s w j s w j s w i r 1 s w i r s n w i j 1 c l j s n w i j s w j is the wetting phase saturation at block j iv after phase permeability is calculated for each grid block via eqs 24 26 the effective phase permeability k c o 2 d ef and k c o 2 i ef are calculated by simulating single phase flow in the core and using darcy s law v the calculated k c o 2 d ef and k c o 2 i ef are then used to calculate effective relative permeability by the relationships 27a k r c o 2 d k c o 2 d ef k e f 27b k r c o 2 i k c o 2 i ef k e f similar to eq 12 vi steps iii v are repeated for the different experiments with varying ff each experiment has a different saturation map s w j in eqs 25 26 and therefore relative permeability points are also unique for each ff k r c o 2 d ff k r c o 2 i ff the following objective function is calculated 28 o b j ff k r co 2 d ff k r co 2 d ff exp 2 ff k r co 2 i ff k r co 2 i ff exp 2 vii steps iii vi are repeated for different values of a b and c until eq 28 is minimized this step is carried out using the fminunc function in matlab a nonlinear solver that finds the minimum of an unconstrained multivariable function using the quasi newton algorithm based on finite differences to approximate the hessian the termination tolerance for the fminunc function is 1e 6 results for co2 relative permeability obtained following the above procedure are plotted in figs 6b d for three arbitrary grid blocks it can be seen that the turning points and residual saturations are different for each block as expected the drainage curves also slightly vary between grid block as the k r model used here ties between drainage and imbibition curves however we focus on modeling the imbibition experiments and therefore the drainage curves are not implemented in any simulations in this work the water relative permeability curves are plotted in figs 6a c here there is no hysteresis and therefore the curves are global and not related to a specific grid block nevertheless the curves are effective and therefore we apply the method of anto darkwah et al 2021 to calculate the characteristic curves which are associated with flow under viscous limit conditions the results are plotted in dashed lines and the effective curves denoted k r w i fit also plotted in figs 4a c are also plotted for comparison it can be seen in fig 6a that for the bentheimer rock the water characteristic curve nearly coincides with the effective curve this is expected due to the low heterogeneity of the rock which leads to minor capillary heterogeneity effects and thus less trapping it was also observed for drainage and discussed in anto darkwah et al 2021 however the shezaf rock is much more heterogeneous and drainage modeling showed a significant deviation of the characteristic curve from the effective one it is therefore interesting that the imbibition characteristic curve in fig 6c presents only slight deviation from the effective one though more so than the bentheimer rock as expected comparing characteristic k r w i to the characteristic k r w d curve from anto darkwah et al 2021 it is apparent that they are not the same despite that there is no hysteresis observed in the water effective curve i e k r w i k r w d in fig 4c it appears as though during imbibition the hysteresis of the co2 and capillary pressure curves is impacting the characteristic k r w i causing it to differ from characteristic k r w d overall we see less rate dependence of the imbibition effective water curve in comparison to the drainage one we continue to discuss the sub core hysteresis by considering the capillary pressure the approach for modeling p c with sub core hysteresis is rather straightforward the grid block drainage curve remains the same as the global curve given by eq 22 for all grid blocks the imbibition curve has now an additional block variation in addition to the leverett scaling as each grid block s turning point residual saturation and land coefficient are substituted in eqs 20 21 and 23 to arrive at the formula given by 29 s n w m j 0 5 s n w s n w r j s n w s n w r j 2 4 c l j s n w s n w r j and 30 p c j i s w k j ϕ j p e ϕ j k ef ϕ k j s w m j 1 λ 1 1 s w i j 1 λ fig 7 presents the p c curves for the two rocks considering three arbitrary grid blocks it can be seen that the drainage curve does not vary with grid block while imbibition curves change with each different turning point residual saturation and land coefficient 4 results the relative permeability and capillary pressure models discussed previously were incorporated in a numerical coreflooding model to simulate the imbibition experiments simulations were carried out using stanford s general purpose research simulator gprs cao 2002 the implemented numerical model is fully implicit using the black oil module and assigning co2 properties to the oil phase and water properties to water phase this allows to simulate two phase immiscible flow as presented mathematically by eq 6 incompressible rock and fluid are also incorporated in the numerical model the grid resolution was taken to be the same as that of the saturation and porosity maps from the ct scans with additional inlet and outlet slices to implement the required boundary conditions ensuring uniform injection and outlet capillary pressure of p c o u t therefore the simulation grid is 49 21 21 and 27 21 21 for bentheimer and shezaf rocks respectively while the experimental ct grid is 47 21 21 and 25 21 21 respectively the inlet slice was assigned constant permeability and given both co2 and water injection wells at each block to model the uniform experimental injection the outlet slice blocks were assigned with constant p c o u t and given production wells at a constant pressure the cylindrical geometry was constructed by implementing cells with zero porosity in the cuboid domain porosity for each grid block is given by the porosity maps from the ct scans figs 1a d and permeability is that of the estimated maps from the drainage experiments discussed in section 2 1 the simulation input parameters were those specified in section 2 and table 1 each simulation was conducted until steady state was reached requiring a typical running time of 2 2 and 3 h for bentheimer and shezaf rocks respectively below are the results of the simulations presented separately for the global and sub core hysteresis approaches for modeling k r and p c 4 1 global hysteresis figs 8 11 present a comparison between the experimental and simulation results where simulations incorporate the global hysteresis k r and p c as described in section 3 1 see figs 4 5 in each figure the top plots present the co2 saturation averaged over core slices as a function of the core length represented by the slice number from slice 1 at the inlet to slice 47 for bentheimer rock or 25 for shezaf rock at the outlet the simulation inlet and outlet slices are removed as they are not part of the physical domain while for the experiment all slices are plotted the bottom plots present the simulation vs experimental co2 saturation for each grid block blocks in which the simulation s co 2 matches the experimental value will be shown in the figure by a circle located on the red diagonal line denoted perfect match the bottom plots also include inset plots which present histograms of the absolute grid block saturation error s c o 2 j sim s c o 2 j ct figs 8 9 present results for the bentheimer core where it can be seen that at high co2 ff figs 8a c the average saturation is matched quite well however at lower ff figs 9a b a mismatch in the average saturation is seen with a much larger saturation gradient in the experiment in comparison to the simulation the sudden decrease in simulation saturation at the outlet is due to the parameter p c o u t chosen such that the outlet saturation matches the experimental one the block by block saturation comparison figs 8d f shows more pronounced errors in particular for the lower ff experiments figs 9c d it can be seen that the experimental block saturations vary much more widely in comparison to the simulation ones for example in fig 9d the experimental range is 0 s co 2 0 6 while the simulation range is seen to be in a narrow band of 0 2 s co 2 0 4 since the bentheimer rock is weakly heterogeneous this difference is likely attributed to the saturation gradient of higher to lower saturation from the inlet to the outlet observed in the experiment the gradient is typical of a capillary end effect see anto darkwah et al 2021 and it could be the case here in particular for the lower ff experiments however errors are visible even in the larger ff cases figs 8d e where the experimental gradient is moderate figs 10 11 present results for the shezaf core where it can be seen that there is a significant mismatch between experimental and simulation average saturation figs 10a c and 11a b the experimental average saturation in this case does not have a gradient as seen in the bentheimer core and capillary end effects are not suspected to dominate here however variations are clearly seen along the core in particular a high saturation region between slices 12 and 18 especially noticeable in fig 10a these variations are expected due to the heterogeneity of the shezaf core for example the high saturation region discussed above is related to a corresponding region with higher permeability as seen in the inset of fig 10b see high permeability in region between slices 12 and 18 as indicated by eq 22 for the same capillary pressure values higher permeability implies higher co2 saturation the simulation average saturation does not follow the experimental variations and is generally less variable and more monotonic the block by block saturation comparison presented in figs 10d f and 11c d also show significant errors between simulation and experimental results here the experimental saturation is seen to vary widely for all ff values especially in comparison to the bentheimer results this is due to the heterogeneity of the shezaf rock which is known to lead to increased saturation variability in comparison to a homogeneous core moreno and rabinovich 2021b the mismatch between simulation saturation s co 2 sim and experiment saturation s co 2 ct is quantified by an overall error calculation defined as the number of grid blocks with a saturation difference larger than 0 05 divided by the total number of grid blocks i e e n n t n where n t j 1 n n j and n j 1 if s c o 2 j sim s c o 2 j ct 0 05 or 0 otherwise n is the total number of grid blocks this measure will be referred to as the error e n of the simulation and represents the agreement with experimental results the value of 0 05 was arbitrarily chosen as we feel errors larger than this are unacceptable however choosing a different value will not change the conclusions discussed in the following the error is indicated in the bottom plots of figs 8 11 and it can be seen that it is much larger for the shezaf rock e n 0 45 0 52 in comparison to the bentheimer rock e n 0 11 0 21 for reference the drainage simulations conducted in anto darkwah et al 2021 produced errors of e n 0 07 0 15 for bentheimer and e n 0 12 0 16 for shezaf i e errors were much smaller in the drainage models especially for the shezaf core we note that in jackson and krevor 2019 it is suggested to assign the residual capillary pressure some finite value since previous experimental data has provided evidence for a nonzero residual we test this approach by altering the p c imbibition curves plotted in fig 5 so that at the residual saturation the capillary pressure is half of the entry pressure i e p c i s w r p e 2 the arbitrary choice of p e 2 follows the method in jackson and krevor 2019 we found no significant improvement in the simulations in terms of agreement with the experiment so this approach was not further explored overall the simulations conducted with the global hysteresis were not sufficiently accurate while for the bentheimer rock the model results can be considered reasonable particularly considering high ff of injection for the shezaf sample the models are simply inadequate as mentioned above the saturation distribution is strongly influenced by heterogeneity and in particular capillary heterogeneity since simulation results show less saturation variability it can be assumed that the model inaccuracy is related to the heterogeneity however our model takes into account capillary heterogeneity by the p c scaling factor in eq 23 it is therefore concluded that despite the accurate capillary entry pressure modeling turning point and residual saturations are also varying widely in the core and this has to be modeled in a separate manner i e using the sub core hysteresis model 4 2 sub core hysteresis we now conduct the imbibition simulations with p c and k r calculated using the sub core hysteresis model described in section 3 2 figs 12 13 present results for the bentheimer core where it can be seen that the average saturation curve is now able to follow the experimental curve quite closely figs 12a c and 13a b the block by block comparison presented in figs 12d f and 13c d shows that the points are scattered mostly along the perfect match line comparison of any of the plots in figs 12 13 to the corresponding ones for the global hysteresis model figs 8 9 shows that the simulations with sub core hysteresis always match the experiments with better accuracy this is also expressed in the errors which are lower in the sub core hysteresis model for all cases considered e n 0 09 0 14 and in the same range as the errors observed in anto darkwah et al 2021 for drainage experiments in addition to the saturation comparison we present in fig 13e the imbibition effective relative permeability calculated from the simulations the calculation is carried out in the same manner as that done for the experiment i e relative permeability is obtained via the extended darcy s law and coupled with the average core saturation to generate a point on the curve the simulation calculation simply uses the core average pressure drop and saturation from the numerical output rather than the experimentally measured values this is compared to the curves obtained by fitting experimental imbibition data previously presented in fig 4 it can be seen in the figure that for bentheimer the simulation effective k r i points are in excellent agreement with the curve fitted to experimental data results for the shezaf core are presented in figs 14 15 where a dramatic improvement can be seen in terms of the average saturation in each slice figs 14a c and 15a b the simulation average saturation curve matches the experimental one and is also seen to follow the variations along the core indicating accurate representation of heterogeneity impacts in the model the block by block comparison is presented in figs 14d f and 15c d where a significant improvement can be seen in comparison to the corresponding simulations with global hysteresis figs 10d f and 11c d the errors are also substantially lower with values of e n 0 24 0 27 in comparison to e n 0 45 0 52 seen for the global hysteresis model fig 15e presents the effective k r i curves calculated from the simulations in comparison to the curve fitted to the experimental data some mismatch can be seen particularly for the water curve indicating errors in the simulation pressure drop during the calculation of sub core relative permeability curves detailed in section 3 2 we seek characteristic sub core k r i that leads to a match between simulation and experiment effective k r i by minimizing the objective function in eq 28 however despite this constraint we find that for shezaf there is some error in the simulation for the effective k r i points 5 summary and conclusions this work presented models of imbibition coreflooding in two rock types and compared results with experimental data first data from drainage and imbibition experiments for the bentheimer and shezaf rocks was collected considering various co2 fractional flows of injection then porosity and permeability 3d maps were obtained from previous analyses of the drainage experiments next capillary pressure and relative permeability hysteretic curves were constructed towards modeling the imbibition coreflooding finally numerical simulations were conducted incorporating the porosity permeability and hysteretic curves these were compared with the experiment results to assess the model accuracy two models for hysteretic p c and k r curves were considered the first is the global hysteresis model section 3 1 which is the conventional approach previously discussed in the literature here hysteresis is represented by a single turning point saturation land coefficient and residual saturation for the entire core despite that hysteresis is global and k r curves are uniform for the core we consider p c curves that vary as a function of porosity and permeability following the leverett scaling approach the second hysteresis model is a novel one allowing for each sub core grid block to have a different s w i s w r and c l section 3 2 using ct images we can obtain s w i and s w r from 100 and 0 co2 ff injection for each grid block then c l is calculated for each block according to these values for p c the sub core hysteretic parameters are incorporated in similar formulation as the global model eqs 29 30 for k r the sub core parameters are also incorporated in the global model eqs 16 a 17 a 25 and 26 however we implement an iterative procedure similar to anto darkwah et al 2021 to correct the curves for rate dependence effects i e we find the characteristic curves this procedure does not fit the curves themselves to any measured values but rather implies that the core effective curves resulting from flow with the sub core characteristic curves as input parameters match those measured in the experiments results are presented for both hysteresis models by comparing simulation and experiment saturation distributions for the weakly heterogeneous bentheimer core sample σ ln k 2 0 15 we show that there is a reasonable agreement between simulations and experiment using the global hysteresis model however simulations are improved when using the sub core hysteresis model this is expressed in a number of measures among those are the overall error e n which reduces from e n 0 11 0 21 for global hysteresis to e n 0 09 0 14 considering sub core hysteresis for the heterogeneous shezaf core sample σ ln k 2 1 68 we find that the global hysteresis simulations are not adequate for modeling the experiments with large errors of e n 0 45 0 52 the simulations are significantly improved when using the sub core model with errors reducing to e n 0 24 0 27 a conclusion arising from these results is that the sub core capillary pressure scaling which is believed to be sufficient for modeling drainage coreflooding in heterogeneous cores is not sufficient for imbibition coreflooding this appears to be a result of large variations in the hysteresis behavior in particular large changes in turning point saturations from block to block the sub core model is found to be a promising approach to dealing with this challenge an additional finding reported in this work which deserves more attention in future work is related to rate dependence of the relative permeability it was found that the k r w characteristic curves did not change significantly from the effective curves during imbibition even for the heterogeneous shezaf rock this is despite a more pronounced change observed during drainage modeling future work should investigate whether this is a physical phenomenon or related to the modeling approach e g by conducting imbibition coreflooding at high and low flow rates to observe changes in measured k r furthermore we note that dissolution was not taken into consideration in our model while efforts were made to reduce this effect in the experiments e g by pre equilibrating the co2 and water it is still believed to have some effect on saturation distribution in particular at the core inlet niu et al 2015 ni et al 2019 overall we believe this work contributes to improving our understanding of sub core effects in imbibition coreflooding and also to improving coreflood modeling accurate modeling of imbibition in coreflooding can be used by practitioners to replace experiments for example in characterizing rate dependent properties it can also be used to test and validate numerical simulators moreover while grid block hysteresis may have limited use in reservoir scale flow it could help develop more accurate upscaling methods for use in large scale modeling credit authorship contribution statement evans anto darkwah draft preparation

157,coreflooding experiments with computed tomography imaging are becoming common practice they allow to investigate the sub core scale properties such as relative permeability k r and capillary pressure p c and to construct multiphase flow models that not only capture the core average flow but also the flow on the sub core millimeter scale this work presents two phase flow models of imbibition coreflooding in two heterogeneous core samples which underwent drainage and imbibition experiments as part of a previous investigation the models incorporate hysteresis in two approaches global and sub core the latter includes unique p c and k r for each grid block of the core depending on the turning point and residual saturations measured in the experiments the simulation output of grid block sub core saturation distribution is compared to the experimental data results show that the sub core hysteresis model matches the experiments more accurately than the global model this is particularly important for the core with a higher degree of heterogeneity in which the global hysteresis model shows large errors while the model incorporating sub core hysteresis is significantly

density of phase p 1 introduction coreflooding experiments are a common practice in the scientific community and in the industry they are conducted to investigate multiphase flow in porous media and to characterize reservoir flow properties typically the core samples are assumed to be homogeneous thus simplifying the characterization process and only requiring estimation of a single overall core value of permeability k relative permeability curves k r and capillary pressure function p c however many core samples exhibit heterogeneity which can impact the flow on larger scales in recent years characterizing sub core properties on the millimeter scale has been a topic of increasing interest this is important for a number of reasons discussed below in particular it is necessary for accurate coreflood modeling while a number of studies have been published on modeling of drainage experiments only very few previous studies discuss modeling imbibition with sub core scale properties in this work we present a new modeling approach for imbibition coreflood modeling using sub core hysteretic k r and p c modeling coreflooding on the sub core level is important for a number of reasons first it allows to investigate the impact of sub core heterogeneity on the core scale flow and to characterize trapping yortsos and chang 1990 perrin and benson 2010 krevor et al 2011 ruprecht et al 2014 wei et al 2014 kuo and benson 2015 krevor et al 2015 ni et al 2019 furthermore accurate numerical simulations of core flow kong et al 2013 krause and benson 2015 can be used to replace expensive and cumbersome experiments finally the relation between fine scale sub core and equivalent core scale properties can be studied and used to develop upscaling methods ataie ashtiani et al 2002 krause 2012 rabinovich et al 2015 2016 jackson and krevor 2020 when using computed tomography ct visualization during coreflooding experiments e g see table 1 in sun et al 2016 detailed data is obtained which allows to compare experimental results to model output on each and every grid block this is important for evaluating darcy scale flow numerical models and understanding their limitations moreno and rabinovich 2021a modeling drainage and imbibition coreflooding using various models with homogeneous permeability and a single set of k r and p c curves representing the entire core is quite common however to accurately match experimental 3d saturation distribution in heterogeneous cores permeability spatial distribution and capillary heterogeneity must be incorporated in the models for drainage coreflooding this was carried out by krause et al 2011 2013 rabinovich et al 2019 in which a capillary pressure permeability relationship is assumed as given by the leverett j function leverett 1941 and permeability distribution is estimated by inversion of this relationship an iterative procedure is applied until the correct k x y z is found which leads to an accurate match of the simulations with the experimental results a similar approach is taken by jackson et al 2018 wenck et al 2021 with the main difference that k is taken to be constant and only p c curves are spatially varying imbibition coreflooding is generally more challenging to model due to hysteresis in shi et al 2011 an attempt was made to model imbibition incorporating sub core scale properties however only a comparison of slice averaged saturation was presented rather than grid block saturation furthermore permeability was weakly estimated assuming an empirical relationship with porosity while rock properties were obtained by history matching most other studies regarding imbibition modeling considering sub core heterogeneity focused on evaluating the residual trapping akbarabadi and piri 2013 ruprecht et al 2014 krevor et al 2017 pini and benson 2017 ni et al 2019 while they offer important methods and insight for estimating k r and p c from imbibition experiments they do not construct full coreflooding models and perform simulations to compare with the experiments the only work we are aware of involving sub core modeling of imbibition coreflooding with a detailed comparison between simulation and experiment is by jackson and krevor 2019 in their model k is homogeneous while heterogeneity is expressed by the p c scaling factor without considering sub core scale hysteresis in this work we present a new approach to modeling imbibition coreflooding considering sub core scale hysteresis i e each grid block has a unique k r and p c curve based on hysteresis parameters turning point saturation residual saturation and land coefficient the approach is implemented to model experiments conducted on two rock samples with 3d heterogeneity promising results are observed in which saturation estimation is significantly improved in comparison to a conventional model with a global core hysteresis description we note that the topic of the current paper applies to general multiphase flows however the most pertinent field of application is co2 geological storage indeed most of the literature above as well as the experiments in this work considers co2 brine two phase flow the plan of the paper is as follows in section 2 we present the experiments and data analysis which were conducted in previous work and have already been published in section 3 we detail the methods implemented in this work for modeling the core properties and used as input for the numerical models in particular the novel sub core hysteresis approach in section 4 we present the simulation results for both global hysteresis and sub core hysteresis methods compare them to the experimental data and discuss them finally section 5 presents a summary of this work and the main conclusions 2 experimental data and previous analysis a series of multistage steady state drainage and imbibition coreflooding experiments were conducted on two sandstone samples known as bentheimer and shezaf rock samples all experiments were conducted at the stanford university coreflooding lab and previously reported in ni et al 2019 detailed information on the rock properties used in this study are shown in table 1 the mineralogy of the core samples were analyzed and found to be predominately quartz dominant and strongly water wet coreflooding experiments were conducted using a medical ct at a temperature of 50 c injection pressure of 1300 psia 9 mpa and confining pressure of 1500 psia 10 mpa supercritical co2 and deionized water were used as fluid pairs in all experiments and were pre equilibrated with each other to prevent dissolution of co2 in water at the reported experimental conditions the water and co2 viscosities were 5 48 1 0 4 and 2 3 1 0 5 pa s respectively lemmon et al 2002 the co2 water interfacial tension is 35 mn m the densities of water and co2 are 986 95 and 429 90 kg m 3 respectively the contact angle between co2 and water is 40 three dimensional porosity and steady state co2 saturation maps were obtained using a medical ct scanner by the procedure of akin and kovscek 2003 the former denoted ϕ ct is presented for both cores in figs 1a d in the first stage of the coreflooding routine drainage experiments co2 and water were co injected incrementally with co2 fractional flows of 50 80 90 95 and 100 into initially fully water saturated cores fractional flow ff is defined here as the co2 injection rate divided by the total injection rate three dimensional co2 saturation maps s c o 2 ct were obtained at steady state conditions determined by pressure stabilization for each ff and results for drainage experiments were previously presented in ni et al 2019 anto darkwah et al 2021 the second stage of the coreflooding experiments imbibition experiments which is the focus of this study consisted of decreasing ff order of 97 94 88 70 30 and 0 ct scans were taken at steady state conditions for all fractional flows the porosity turning point 100 ff and residual 0 ff co2 saturation maps at steady state are shown in fig 1 for bentheimer upper plots and shezaf lower plots sandstone rocks effective relative permeability curves for both rock samples were calculated using darcy s law for multiphase flow substituting the experimental steady state average pressure drop and average saturations computed from the 3d saturation maps a point is obtained for each ff leading to 5 points representing each of the 4 curves see figs 4a d water drainage k r w d and imbibition k r w i curves figs 4a c and co2 drainage k r c o 2 d and imbibition k r c o 2 i curves figs 4b d drainage capillary pressure curves p c d were obtained by mercury porosimetry using small samples of each rock see fig 5 more details on the drainage capillary pressure measurements are detailed in ni et al 2019 the curves are assumed to represent the entire core and can therefore be referred to as effective curves as opposed to sub core curves this is a common assumption however strictly speaking the porosimetry measured p c d are not necessarily effective properties as they were obtained from a sample smaller than the core itself effective imbibition capillary pressure curves p c i were calculated based on trapped non wetting phase models of land 1968 and pini and benson 2017 which includes grid block scaling to represent sub core curves the details on theory and calculation of imbibition capillary pressure curves are presented in section 3 2 1 permeability estimation in our previous work anto darkwah et al 2021 we detailed an improved procedure of the krause et al 2013 method for simultaneous estimation of permeability maps k x y z and characteristic relative permeability k r char considering drainage coreflooding experiments k r char curves are defined here as the curves of the millimeter scale i e the curves assigned to the grid blocks in the simulation and these are also referred to in previous literature as intrinsic relative permeability or rock curves k r char is a sub core property and it may be different than the effective k r measured in the experiments due to capillary effects also known as rate dependent k r huppler 1970 krause 2012 more information on the importance of rate dependent properties which can impact the flow modeling on larger scales can be found in rabinovich et al 2015 krause and benson 2015 rabinovich 2018 in this section we will briefly describe the k x y z and k r char estimation procedure from drainage experiments which was implemented in anto darkwah et al 2021 to obtain the k maps of the two core samples the same k maps were used in this work for modeling imbibition coreflooding using the porosity and co2 saturation maps obtained from ct scans the initial voxel level permeability can be obtained by inversion of the capillary pressure permeability relationship assumed to be the well known leverett j function scaling 1 p c s w k ϕ σ cos θ ϕ k j s w where σ is the interfacial tension and θ is contact angle between co2 and water taken to be uniform throughout the core sample furthermore capillary pressure saturation relationship is assumed to take the common form of brooks corey given by 2 p c s w p e s w 1 λ where p e and λ are fitting parameters and 3 s w s w s w i r 1 s w i r where s w i r is the irreducible water saturation we adopt an approximation in which eq 1 holds both at the sub core scale and at the core scale where k and ϕ are replaced by their core average values k ef and ϕ respectively krause et al 2013 as a result eqs 1 and 2 can be equated to obtain the j function term j s w as follows 4 j s w p e σ cos θ k ef ϕ s w 1 λ applying eq 1 to any voxel j with properties k j ϕ j p c j and s w j substituting eq 4 in eq 1 and rearranging leads to an expression for pointwise voxel permeability 5 k j κ ϕ j p c j 2 k ef ϕ p e s w j 1 λ 2 where κ is a scaling factor to ensure that the estimated effective permeability k x y z from single phase simulations matches that of experimentally determined permeability for the first estimate of k x y z capillary equilibrium is assumed in each slice of the core meaning that capillary pressure is roughly uniform and therefore the slice average p c can be used for all voxels in that slice i e p c i p c in eq 5 calculating p c by substituting slice average experimental saturation measurements s w ct in eq 2 and substituting in eq 5 we arrive at the initial estimation of k x y z this is the first step of the procedure the next step in the procedure is to estimate the characteristic relative permeability this is done using the method detailed in rabinovich et al 2019 which is briefly described here the governing equation for two phase immiscible flow with incompressible rock and fluid is given as 6 ϕ s p t k r p c h a r μ p k p p ρ p g z 0 where ϕ is the porosity of the rock k r p c h a r is the characteristic relative permeability to phase p p w or n w s p is the saturation of the phase p μ p is the phase viscosity p p is the phase pressure ρ p is the phase density g is the acceleration due to gravity and z is the vertical coordinate we apply the constraint s w s n w 1 and the phase pressures are related by 7 p c s w p n w p w the two phase flow equation can be split into two single phase equations by substitution of the steady state experimental saturation s co 2 ct into eq 6 to arrive at 8a k w x y z μ w p w ρ w g z 0 8b k co 2 x y z μ co 2 p co 2 ρ co 2 g z 0 the phase permeability k p is given by 9 k p x y z k x y z k r p char s w ct x y z the characteristic relative permeability k r p char is assumed uniform in the core and of the form given by 10a k r w c h a r s w n w 10b k r co 2 c h a r k r co 2 max 1 s w n co 2 we can substitute eqs 10 a b into eqs 8 a b respectively and solve them separately for pressures by using single phase simulations the effective permeability from a single phase flow equation can be calculated as 11 k p e f q p inj μ p l a c p p i n p p o u t where q inj is the injection flow rate i n denotes averaging over the core inlet and o u t denotes averaging over the outlet the effective relative permeability can therefore be obtained by 12 k r p e f k p e f k e f we conduct single phase flow simulations with varying parameters n w char and n co 2 char which lead to a point on the respective effective relative permeability curve k r w e f for the former and k r co 2 e f for the latter via eqs 11 12 the estimation of k r p c h a r is an optimization problem which searches for characteristic powers n w char and n co 2 char in eqs 10 a b that minimize the objective functions ff k r w ef ff k r w ff 2 and ff k r co 2 ef ff k r co 2 ff 2 respectively the estimated characteristic curves can then be used in a two phase simulation with the initial guess of k from eq 5 in order to accurately simulate and predict the experimental saturations using a two phase simulator the core outlet capillary pressure must be modeled correctly previous investigators richardson et al 1952 batycky et al 1981 have described the existence of capillary pressure discontinuity at the core outlet where fluids exit to account for this phenomenon also known as the end effect in coreflooding analysis the outer boundary p c is posed as zero berg et al 2013 jackson et al 2018 however this leads to significant underestimation of non wetting phase saturation near the core outlet recently moreno and rabinovich 2021b have shown that the end effects could impact large portions of the core and therefore can lead to erroneous non wetting phase numerical prediction therefore we take the approach of krause et al 2013 to impose a capillary pressure value p c o u t such that the average saturation in the outlet slice from numerical simulations matches that obtained by experimental saturation the p c o u t value is unique for different fractional flows of injected fluids and it is used in our methodology for accurate modeling of experiments the next step is to conduct a two phase simulation using initially estimated k k r c h a r and p c o u t the accuracy of estimated properties is determined by comparison of simulated output saturation s co 2 sim with experimental saturation s co 2 ct this is quantified by a simple equation 13 e r r 1 n j s co 2 j sim s co 2 j ct where j denotes a grid block cell i e voxel and n is the total number of grid blocks when the error is less than a threshold value the procedure is terminated and the estimated k and k r c h a r are obtained however if the error remains higher than the threshold value a new k is estimated using the inverse capillary pressure permeability relationship with simulation p c as input then k r c h a r and p c o u t are updated accordingly and new two phase simulations are conducted with the newly estimated properties this iterative procedure is repeated until eq 13 is less than the threshold each experimental saturation will lead to a different k x y z estimation and therefore the final result is obtained by geometric averaging k maps obtained from different experiments with varying ff for the two rocks considered here the probability density function of the final estimated k is presented in fig 2 it can be seen that the bentheimer rock has a k distribution which is approximately lognormal with a low variance of σ ln k 2 0 15 indicating weak heterogeneity the shezaf rock on the other hand is seen to have a more complicated k structure thought to be related to a low permeability horizontal steak in the core observed in fig 1e as a low saturation streak it is also a much more heterogeneous rock with σ ln k 2 1 68 3 method the interactions between injected co2 water and porous media are represented in numerical simulators by the use of relative permeability and capillary pressure models the increase in nonwetting phase saturation during co2 injection drainage and the subsequent increase in wetting phase saturation during high water fraction injection imbibition leads to dependence of k r and p c curves on the history of the local saturation this history dependence leads to trapping of the non wetting phase in regions that are predominantly invaded by co2 doughty 2007 to be able to numerically predict the co2 saturations during the imbibition experiments correct hysteric functions must be used in numerical simulators the following is a detailed description of the two hysteretic models used in this work the first which we refer to as a global hysteresis model is the conventional model in which hysteresis is expressed uniformly for the entire core the second which we address as a sub core hysteresis model allows for different hysteresis parameters for each grid block of the core 3 1 global hysteresis the trapping model of land 1968 is a popular model used in the literature to determine the non wetting phase trapping parameters 14 s n w r s n w i 1 c l s n w i where c l is the land trapping coefficient s n w r is the residual non wetting phase saturation below which gas is immobile and s n w i is the non wetting phase initial or turning point saturation at which core flow changes from drainage to imbibition we note that in our experiment s w i 1 s n w i is the saturation after 100 co2 injection this is always higher than the irreducible saturation s w i r which was calculated based on fitting the capillary pressure data as explained in detail in anto darkwah et al 2021 fig 3 presents initial residual ir plots for both bentheimer and shezaf rocks where s n w i and s n w r were obtained from the saturation maps of 100 figs 1b e and 0 ff figs 1c f both block saturations and core slice averages are plotted the heterogeneity of the shezaf sandstone can be observed through the large variation of the points in fig 3b and it is apparent that some blocks are above the 100 trapping line indicating that they undergo drainage rather than imbibition for a more detailed analysis of the trapping characteristics of these rocks we refer the readers to ni et al 2019 the land coefficient is obtained in two different ways the first is by fitting the model of eq 14 to the data points of slice averaged saturations leading to the yellow dashed curves presented in fig 3 the second is by substituting overall core average s n w r and s n w i in the equation 15 c l 1 s n w r 1 s n w i which is obtained simply by rearranging eq 14 the result is represented by the solid blue curve in the plots both calculations lead to very similar c l values as seen by the overlapping curves in the figures the final values of c l are presented in table 1 calculated via eq 15 and can be compared to c l 1 19 and 1 60 when calculated by fitting eq 14 to the data points due to the impact of experimental boundary effects it is common to use only the data in the central part of the core for determining c l we therefore plot in figs 3a b the data corresponding to the central region in green circles and calculate the land coefficient based only on this data for the shezaf rock results show that data points from the central end and front of the core all pretty much overlap indicating that the boundary effects are not significant this is consistent with the average saturation along the core see figs 10 11 which does not show any particular trend on the other hand the bentheimer results fig 3a show significant boundary effects in particular in the front of the core and this is consistent with the trend of decreasing average co2 saturation see figs 8 9 however in both cases the c l calculated with only data from the central part of the core c l 1 04 and 1 58 is almost the same as that calculated with the entire core c l 1 19 and 1 60 the global hysteresis model calls for relative permeability curves which are uniform in the core we begin by assuming that the effective curves are approximately the same as the characteristic curves therefore we seek k r that matches the measured experimental data points and these will represent both effective and sub core k r the wetting phase experimental data k r w presented in figs 4a c shows that the drainage and imbibition points are fitted by two very similar curves this is typical of the wetting phase curves which usually do not exhibit significant hysteresis therefore we model both curves with the same function k r w d k r w i given by eq 10 a with the fitting parameters n w 3 79 and n w 9 10 for the bentheimer and shezaf rocks respectively the k r c o 2 experimental data on the other hand is hysteretic and fitted by the dury et al 1999 model as applied by ruprecht et al 2014 the drainage curve is given by 16a k r c o 2 d 1 s w c 1 s w a b 16b s w s w s w i r 1 s w i r 1 s w 1 c l 1 s w and the imbibition curve by 17a k r c o 2 i 1 s w c 1 s w a b 17b s w s w s w i r 1 s w i r s n w i 1 c l s n w i where a b and c are fitting parameters it can be seen that at the turning point saturation s w s w i eqs 16 and 17 are equal i e k r c o 2 d s w i k r c o 2 i s w i as expected this applies to any turning point we consider on the drainage curve however we are interested in modeling the specific hysteresis of the experiment therefore both drainage and imbibition experimental data points are fitted simultaneously by eqs 16 and 17 to obtain the a b and c parameters values presented in table 1 the curves for both rocks are plotted in figs 4b d and the experimental turning points are marked in black circles in the plots the capillary pressure curve also requires a hysteresis model the experimental p c drainage data are denoted by p c d s w and are fitted by eq 2 as discussed in section 2 1 where fitting parameters p e entry pressure constant and λ are given in table 1 we then adopt the approach of pini and benson 2017 for the core imbibition hysteretic p c 18 p c i s w p c i s w m 1 λ 1 s w i s w m 1 where s w i is the normalized wetting phase saturation at the turning point defined in a similar manner to eq 3 by s w i s w i s w i r 1 s w i r p c i is obtained by the equivalence of the drainage and imbibition curves at the turning point i e the condition p c d s w i p c i s w i it can be expressed by combining and rearranging eqs 2 and 18 as 19 p c i p e 1 s w i 1 λ 1 s w m in eq 18 is the effective mobile wetting phase saturation related to the mobile nonwetting phase saturation by s w m 1 s n w m and the latter is defined by 20 s n w m 0 5 s n w s n w r s n w s n w r 2 4 c l s n w s n w r where s n w 1 s w the normalized land coefficient relates between normalized turning point and residual saturations as follows 21 c l 1 s n w r 1 s n w i and s w r s w r s w i r 1 s w i r 1 s n w r fig 5 presents the experimental data points for drainage p c as well as the fit obtained using eq 2 three imbibition curves can be seen obtained using eqs 18 21 two of which represent arbitrary choices of turning points s w i 0 7 0 8 in fig 5a and s w i 0 4 0 8 in fig 5b the third turning point s w i 0 44 in fig 5a and s w i 0 59 in fig 5b marked with a black circle is that pertaining to the experimental data and therefore the imbibition curve plotted in a thick black curve will be the ones used to model the experiment we note that the imbibition model for p c is based mostly on the drainage porosimetry data and imbibition data is only expressed by the land coefficient in eq 20 as opposed to the k r model which was fitted to imbibition experimental data the core effective p c curves plotted in fig 5 do not allow for capillary heterogeneity flow effects which are expected in our experiments therefore we will further adopt the p c model in pini and benson 2017 by incorporating capillary heterogeneity considering a leverett scaling term leverett 1941 thus the entry pressure is now varying with grid block such that p c for block j is given by 22 p c j d s w k j ϕ j p e ϕ j k ef ϕ k j s w 1 λ for drainage and 23 p c j i s w k j ϕ j p e ϕ j k ef ϕ k j s w m 1 λ 1 1 s w i 1 λ for imbibition where ϕ is the core average porosity and k ef is the core effective permeability 3 2 sub core hysteresis hysteresis is an expression of pore scale phenomena jerauld and salter 1990 joekar niasar et al 2013 and therefore we expect that even our experimental grid blocks being representative elementary volumes that fulfill darcy s law exhibit hysteresis as a result a logical extension of our coreflood models is to incorporate hysteresis on the grid block level attributing to each block j its own unique hysteretic parameters land coefficient c l j turning point s n w i j and residual saturation s n w r j the turning point and residual saturations for each block are obtained directly from the ct scan data of the 100 and 0 ff experiments respectively the grid block land coefficient is then obtained in a straightforward manner by substituting s n w i j and s n w r i j in eq 15 relative permeability with grid block hysteresis is assumed to take the form of eqs 16 17 where the grid block values of s n w i j and c l j replace the global values of s n w i and c l appearing in the equations the parameters a b and c in the equations are obtained by matching the experimental measurement points as explained below we can no longer match the k r model directly to the experimental k r as done in the global hysteresis model since now each grid block has a unique curve in addition the measured curves are effective and therefore flow rate dependent due to capillary effects see huppler 1970 krause 2012 while the grid block curves are characteristic we continue by seeking the sub core characteristic relative permeability in a similar approach to anto darkwah et al 2021 the steps for finding the parameters a b and c are as follows i we assume that the parameters are the same for each grid block therefore we seek only a single set ii an initial guess of parameters is chosen taken to be the global values presented in table 1 iii the phase permeability of each grid block is calculated by the formula 24a k c o 2 j d k j k r co 2 d s w j 24b k c o 2 j i k j k r co 2 i s w j where k c o 2 j d and k c o 2 j i are phase permeabilities of block j for drainage and imbibition respectively k j is the permeability of block j discussed in section 2 1 k r co 2 d s w j is grid block drainage relative permeability given by eq 16 a with 25 s w j s w j s w i r 1 s w i r 1 s w j 1 c l j 1 s w j and k r co 2 i s w j is grid block imbibition relative permeability given by eq 17 a with 26 s w j s w j s w i r 1 s w i r s n w i j 1 c l j s n w i j s w j is the wetting phase saturation at block j iv after phase permeability is calculated for each grid block via eqs 24 26 the effective phase permeability k c o 2 d ef and k c o 2 i ef are calculated by simulating single phase flow in the core and using darcy s law v the calculated k c o 2 d ef and k c o 2 i ef are then used to calculate effective relative permeability by the relationships 27a k r c o 2 d k c o 2 d ef k e f 27b k r c o 2 i k c o 2 i ef k e f similar to eq 12 vi steps iii v are repeated for the different experiments with varying ff each experiment has a different saturation map s w j in eqs 25 26 and therefore relative permeability points are also unique for each ff k r c o 2 d ff k r c o 2 i ff the following objective function is calculated 28 o b j ff k r co 2 d ff k r co 2 d ff exp 2 ff k r co 2 i ff k r co 2 i ff exp 2 vii steps iii vi are repeated for different values of a b and c until eq 28 is minimized this step is carried out using the fminunc function in matlab a nonlinear solver that finds the minimum of an unconstrained multivariable function using the quasi newton algorithm based on finite differences to approximate the hessian the termination tolerance for the fminunc function is 1e 6 results for co2 relative permeability obtained following the above procedure are plotted in figs 6b d for three arbitrary grid blocks it can be seen that the turning points and residual saturations are different for each block as expected the drainage curves also slightly vary between grid block as the k r model used here ties between drainage and imbibition curves however we focus on modeling the imbibition experiments and therefore the drainage curves are not implemented in any simulations in this work the water relative permeability curves are plotted in figs 6a c here there is no hysteresis and therefore the curves are global and not related to a specific grid block nevertheless the curves are effective and therefore we apply the method of anto darkwah et al 2021 to calculate the characteristic curves which are associated with flow under viscous limit conditions the results are plotted in dashed lines and the effective curves denoted k r w i fit also plotted in figs 4a c are also plotted for comparison it can be seen in fig 6a that for the bentheimer rock the water characteristic curve nearly coincides with the effective curve this is expected due to the low heterogeneity of the rock which leads to minor capillary heterogeneity effects and thus less trapping it was also observed for drainage and discussed in anto darkwah et al 2021 however the shezaf rock is much more heterogeneous and drainage modeling showed a significant deviation of the characteristic curve from the effective one it is therefore interesting that the imbibition characteristic curve in fig 6c presents only slight deviation from the effective one though more so than the bentheimer rock as expected comparing characteristic k r w i to the characteristic k r w d curve from anto darkwah et al 2021 it is apparent that they are not the same despite that there is no hysteresis observed in the water effective curve i e k r w i k r w d in fig 4c it appears as though during imbibition the hysteresis of the co2 and capillary pressure curves is impacting the characteristic k r w i causing it to differ from characteristic k r w d overall we see less rate dependence of the imbibition effective water curve in comparison to the drainage one we continue to discuss the sub core hysteresis by considering the capillary pressure the approach for modeling p c with sub core hysteresis is rather straightforward the grid block drainage curve remains the same as the global curve given by eq 22 for all grid blocks the imbibition curve has now an additional block variation in addition to the leverett scaling as each grid block s turning point residual saturation and land coefficient are substituted in eqs 20 21 and 23 to arrive at the formula given by 29 s n w m j 0 5 s n w s n w r j s n w s n w r j 2 4 c l j s n w s n w r j and 30 p c j i s w k j ϕ j p e ϕ j k ef ϕ k j s w m j 1 λ 1 1 s w i j 1 λ fig 7 presents the p c curves for the two rocks considering three arbitrary grid blocks it can be seen that the drainage curve does not vary with grid block while imbibition curves change with each different turning point residual saturation and land coefficient 4 results the relative permeability and capillary pressure models discussed previously were incorporated in a numerical coreflooding model to simulate the imbibition experiments simulations were carried out using stanford s general purpose research simulator gprs cao 2002 the implemented numerical model is fully implicit using the black oil module and assigning co2 properties to the oil phase and water properties to water phase this allows to simulate two phase immiscible flow as presented mathematically by eq 6 incompressible rock and fluid are also incorporated in the numerical model the grid resolution was taken to be the same as that of the saturation and porosity maps from the ct scans with additional inlet and outlet slices to implement the required boundary conditions ensuring uniform injection and outlet capillary pressure of p c o u t therefore the simulation grid is 49 21 21 and 27 21 21 for bentheimer and shezaf rocks respectively while the experimental ct grid is 47 21 21 and 25 21 21 respectively the inlet slice was assigned constant permeability and given both co2 and water injection wells at each block to model the uniform experimental injection the outlet slice blocks were assigned with constant p c o u t and given production wells at a constant pressure the cylindrical geometry was constructed by implementing cells with zero porosity in the cuboid domain porosity for each grid block is given by the porosity maps from the ct scans figs 1a d and permeability is that of the estimated maps from the drainage experiments discussed in section 2 1 the simulation input parameters were those specified in section 2 and table 1 each simulation was conducted until steady state was reached requiring a typical running time of 2 2 and 3 h for bentheimer and shezaf rocks respectively below are the results of the simulations presented separately for the global and sub core hysteresis approaches for modeling k r and p c 4 1 global hysteresis figs 8 11 present a comparison between the experimental and simulation results where simulations incorporate the global hysteresis k r and p c as described in section 3 1 see figs 4 5 in each figure the top plots present the co2 saturation averaged over core slices as a function of the core length represented by the slice number from slice 1 at the inlet to slice 47 for bentheimer rock or 25 for shezaf rock at the outlet the simulation inlet and outlet slices are removed as they are not part of the physical domain while for the experiment all slices are plotted the bottom plots present the simulation vs experimental co2 saturation for each grid block blocks in which the simulation s co 2 matches the experimental value will be shown in the figure by a circle located on the red diagonal line denoted perfect match the bottom plots also include inset plots which present histograms of the absolute grid block saturation error s c o 2 j sim s c o 2 j ct figs 8 9 present results for the bentheimer core where it can be seen that at high co2 ff figs 8a c the average saturation is matched quite well however at lower ff figs 9a b a mismatch in the average saturation is seen with a much larger saturation gradient in the experiment in comparison to the simulation the sudden decrease in simulation saturation at the outlet is due to the parameter p c o u t chosen such that the outlet saturation matches the experimental one the block by block saturation comparison figs 8d f shows more pronounced errors in particular for the lower ff experiments figs 9c d it can be seen that the experimental block saturations vary much more widely in comparison to the simulation ones for example in fig 9d the experimental range is 0 s co 2 0 6 while the simulation range is seen to be in a narrow band of 0 2 s co 2 0 4 since the bentheimer rock is weakly heterogeneous this difference is likely attributed to the saturation gradient of higher to lower saturation from the inlet to the outlet observed in the experiment the gradient is typical of a capillary end effect see anto darkwah et al 2021 and it could be the case here in particular for the lower ff experiments however errors are visible even in the larger ff cases figs 8d e where the experimental gradient is moderate figs 10 11 present results for the shezaf core where it can be seen that there is a significant mismatch between experimental and simulation average saturation figs 10a c and 11a b the experimental average saturation in this case does not have a gradient as seen in the bentheimer core and capillary end effects are not suspected to dominate here however variations are clearly seen along the core in particular a high saturation region between slices 12 and 18 especially noticeable in fig 10a these variations are expected due to the heterogeneity of the shezaf core for example the high saturation region discussed above is related to a corresponding region with higher permeability as seen in the inset of fig 10b see high permeability in region between slices 12 and 18 as indicated by eq 22 for the same capillary pressure values higher permeability implies higher co2 saturation the simulation average saturation does not follow the experimental variations and is generally less variable and more monotonic the block by block saturation comparison presented in figs 10d f and 11c d also show significant errors between simulation and experimental results here the experimental saturation is seen to vary widely for all ff values especially in comparison to the bentheimer results this is due to the heterogeneity of the shezaf rock which is known to lead to increased saturation variability in comparison to a homogeneous core moreno and rabinovich 2021b the mismatch between simulation saturation s co 2 sim and experiment saturation s co 2 ct is quantified by an overall error calculation defined as the number of grid blocks with a saturation difference larger than 0 05 divided by the total number of grid blocks i e e n n t n where n t j 1 n n j and n j 1 if s c o 2 j sim s c o 2 j ct 0 05 or 0 otherwise n is the total number of grid blocks this measure will be referred to as the error e n of the simulation and represents the agreement with experimental results the value of 0 05 was arbitrarily chosen as we feel errors larger than this are unacceptable however choosing a different value will not change the conclusions discussed in the following the error is indicated in the bottom plots of figs 8 11 and it can be seen that it is much larger for the shezaf rock e n 0 45 0 52 in comparison to the bentheimer rock e n 0 11 0 21 for reference the drainage simulations conducted in anto darkwah et al 2021 produced errors of e n 0 07 0 15 for bentheimer and e n 0 12 0 16 for shezaf i e errors were much smaller in the drainage models especially for the shezaf core we note that in jackson and krevor 2019 it is suggested to assign the residual capillary pressure some finite value since previous experimental data has provided evidence for a nonzero residual we test this approach by altering the p c imbibition curves plotted in fig 5 so that at the residual saturation the capillary pressure is half of the entry pressure i e p c i s w r p e 2 the arbitrary choice of p e 2 follows the method in jackson and krevor 2019 we found no significant improvement in the simulations in terms of agreement with the experiment so this approach was not further explored overall the simulations conducted with the global hysteresis were not sufficiently accurate while for the bentheimer rock the model results can be considered reasonable particularly considering high ff of injection for the shezaf sample the models are simply inadequate as mentioned above the saturation distribution is strongly influenced by heterogeneity and in particular capillary heterogeneity since simulation results show less saturation variability it can be assumed that the model inaccuracy is related to the heterogeneity however our model takes into account capillary heterogeneity by the p c scaling factor in eq 23 it is therefore concluded that despite the accurate capillary entry pressure modeling turning point and residual saturations are also varying widely in the core and this has to be modeled in a separate manner i e using the sub core hysteresis model 4 2 sub core hysteresis we now conduct the imbibition simulations with p c and k r calculated using the sub core hysteresis model described in section 3 2 figs 12 13 present results for the bentheimer core where it can be seen that the average saturation curve is now able to follow the experimental curve quite closely figs 12a c and 13a b the block by block comparison presented in figs 12d f and 13c d shows that the points are scattered mostly along the perfect match line comparison of any of the plots in figs 12 13 to the corresponding ones for the global hysteresis model figs 8 9 shows that the simulations with sub core hysteresis always match the experiments with better accuracy this is also expressed in the errors which are lower in the sub core hysteresis model for all cases considered e n 0 09 0 14 and in the same range as the errors observed in anto darkwah et al 2021 for drainage experiments in addition to the saturation comparison we present in fig 13e the imbibition effective relative permeability calculated from the simulations the calculation is carried out in the same manner as that done for the experiment i e relative permeability is obtained via the extended darcy s law and coupled with the average core saturation to generate a point on the curve the simulation calculation simply uses the core average pressure drop and saturation from the numerical output rather than the experimentally measured values this is compared to the curves obtained by fitting experimental imbibition data previously presented in fig 4 it can be seen in the figure that for bentheimer the simulation effective k r i points are in excellent agreement with the curve fitted to experimental data results for the shezaf core are presented in figs 14 15 where a dramatic improvement can be seen in terms of the average saturation in each slice figs 14a c and 15a b the simulation average saturation curve matches the experimental one and is also seen to follow the variations along the core indicating accurate representation of heterogeneity impacts in the model the block by block comparison is presented in figs 14d f and 15c d where a significant improvement can be seen in comparison to the corresponding simulations with global hysteresis figs 10d f and 11c d the errors are also substantially lower with values of e n 0 24 0 27 in comparison to e n 0 45 0 52 seen for the global hysteresis model fig 15e presents the effective k r i curves calculated from the simulations in comparison to the curve fitted to the experimental data some mismatch can be seen particularly for the water curve indicating errors in the simulation pressure drop during the calculation of sub core relative permeability curves detailed in section 3 2 we seek characteristic sub core k r i that leads to a match between simulation and experiment effective k r i by minimizing the objective function in eq 28 however despite this constraint we find that for shezaf there is some error in the simulation for the effective k r i points 5 summary and conclusions this work presented models of imbibition coreflooding in two rock types and compared results with experimental data first data from drainage and imbibition experiments for the bentheimer and shezaf rocks was collected considering various co2 fractional flows of injection then porosity and permeability 3d maps were obtained from previous analyses of the drainage experiments next capillary pressure and relative permeability hysteretic curves were constructed towards modeling the imbibition coreflooding finally numerical simulations were conducted incorporating the porosity permeability and hysteretic curves these were compared with the experiment results to assess the model accuracy two models for hysteretic p c and k r curves were considered the first is the global hysteresis model section 3 1 which is the conventional approach previously discussed in the literature here hysteresis is represented by a single turning point saturation land coefficient and residual saturation for the entire core despite that hysteresis is global and k r curves are uniform for the core we consider p c curves that vary as a function of porosity and permeability following the leverett scaling approach the second hysteresis model is a novel one allowing for each sub core grid block to have a different s w i s w r and c l section 3 2 using ct images we can obtain s w i and s w r from 100 and 0 co2 ff injection for each grid block then c l is calculated for each block according to these values for p c the sub core hysteretic parameters are incorporated in similar formulation as the global model eqs 29 30 for k r the sub core parameters are also incorporated in the global model eqs 16 a 17 a 25 and 26 however we implement an iterative procedure similar to anto darkwah et al 2021 to correct the curves for rate dependence effects i e we find the characteristic curves this procedure does not fit the curves themselves to any measured values but rather implies that the core effective curves resulting from flow with the sub core characteristic curves as input parameters match those measured in the experiments results are presented for both hysteresis models by comparing simulation and experiment saturation distributions for the weakly heterogeneous bentheimer core sample σ ln k 2 0 15 we show that there is a reasonable agreement between simulations and experiment using the global hysteresis model however simulations are improved when using the sub core hysteresis model this is expressed in a number of measures among those are the overall error e n which reduces from e n 0 11 0 21 for global hysteresis to e n 0 09 0 14 considering sub core hysteresis for the heterogeneous shezaf core sample σ ln k 2 1 68 we find that the global hysteresis simulations are not adequate for modeling the experiments with large errors of e n 0 45 0 52 the simulations are significantly improved when using the sub core model with errors reducing to e n 0 24 0 27 a conclusion arising from these results is that the sub core capillary pressure scaling which is believed to be sufficient for modeling drainage coreflooding in heterogeneous cores is not sufficient for imbibition coreflooding this appears to be a result of large variations in the hysteresis behavior in particular large changes in turning point saturations from block to block the sub core model is found to be a promising approach to dealing with this challenge an additional finding reported in this work which deserves more attention in future work is related to rate dependence of the relative permeability it was found that the k r w characteristic curves did not change significantly from the effective curves during imbibition even for the heterogeneous shezaf rock this is despite a more pronounced change observed during drainage modeling future work should investigate whether this is a physical phenomenon or related to the modeling approach e g by conducting imbibition coreflooding at high and low flow rates to observe changes in measured k r furthermore we note that dissolution was not taken into consideration in our model while efforts were made to reduce this effect in the experiments e g by pre equilibrating the co2 and water it is still believed to have some effect on saturation distribution in particular at the core inlet niu et al 2015 ni et al 2019 overall we believe this work contributes to improving our understanding of sub core effects in imbibition coreflooding and also to improving coreflood modeling accurate modeling of imbibition in coreflooding can be used by practitioners to replace experiments for example in characterizing rate dependent properties it can also be used to test and validate numerical simulators moreover while grid block hysteresis may have limited use in reservoir scale flow it could help develop more accurate upscaling methods for use in large scale modeling credit authorship contribution statement evans anto darkwah draft preparation

158,the dynamic and quasi static spatiotemporal responses of pore water induced by fluid mass sources in unsaturated porous media are determined and compared an explicit fundamental solution for pore water pressure is derived using the known green s function of dynamic poroelasticity based on the order of the low frequency approximations for the source impulsive time function different physical regimes are identified describing the transition from diffusion to wave propagation the diffusive regime bears only two diffusions equivalent to diffusive slow p2 and p3 waves non dispersion diffusion and dispersion diffusion regimes where p1 waves and diffusions coexist are present the similarity and diversity of induced pore water pressures owing to diffusive slow waves and fast waves may depend on the fluid loading rate e g fluid injection in contrast to the critical frequencies of a partially saturated porous medium the short term fluctuation in the injection rate may create very similar slow diffusive p2 waves along with a fast compressional p1 wave by low impulsive frequencies and various slow p2 modes with transmitted radiation to the p1 wave by the comparatively high impulsive frequencies in different regimes the results indicate that the diffusion and wave processes may generate uniform dynamic and quasi static responses in partially saturated media for hydraulic tests and induced microseismic analysis keywords poroelasticity unsaturated porous media diffusion wave pore pressure fluid injection 1 introduction the dynamic response of porous media may produce time dependent poroelastic behaviour reflecting the influences of solid fluid coupling in the deformation and fluid flow of a medium and vice versa wang 2000 rubin and hubbard 2005 in recent decades several approaches for identifying the hydraulic properties of the earth s crust in multiscale spatiotemporal domains have been proposed talwani 2000 yeh and liu 2000 shapiro et al 2002 2005 karve and kallivokas 2015 these approaches exploit the phenomena of water distribution microseismicity and solute transportation small pore pressure or head perturbation in porous rocks responds to the variation in the hydraulic heterogeneities responsible for solute migration or the triggering of microearthquakes in a critically stressed earth crust the induced pore pressure is assumed to follow a low frequency wave or diffusion equation suggesting that diffusive waves are the carriers of pore pressure information the derivation of the wave or diffusion equation for pore pressure was proposed based on the one phase fluid saturation theory of quasi static poroelasticity rice and cleary 1976 rudnicki 1986 and dynamic poroelasticity biot 1962 dutta and odé 1979 and chandler and johnson 1981 confirmed the equivalence between the quasi static flow and biot s slow wave in the zero frequency limit by neglecting the inertial terms in a dynamic poroelastic equation such that no fast wave modes existed therefore the spatiotemporal evolution of the induced pore pressure may be derived and analysed based on the fundamental solution of a dynamic poroelastic equation obtained by using integral transforms and other techniques burridge and vargas 1979 norris 1985 boutin 1991 schanz and pryl 2004 although the diffusion approximation for the pore pressure in a fluid saturated medium has been obtained in many ways the diffusive properties of the pore pressure spatiotemporal representation have not been validated for a partially saturated porous medium based on the extended biot theory the mathematical basis for interpreting the travelling waves of the p1 p2 and p3 modes in porous media is the field equation describing the media contain multiphase immiscible fluids resulting from the coupling between solid deformation and fluid flows santos et al 1990 lo et al 2005 lo and sposito 2013 zhang and ping 2020 this implies that two slow compressional waves p2 and p3 propagate in a partially saturated medium owing to capillary pressure fluctuations and show diffusive properties in complete analogy with the biot theory in this study the pore pressure evolution by the diffusion approximation caused by time dependent fluid injection is derived and the observed diffusions in hydraulic tomography and hydraulic fracturing stimulation are presented holzhausen and gooch 1985 cardiff and barrash 2011 the connection between the pore pressure evolution in the dynamic and quasi static poroelasticity based on green s functions in partially saturated porous media is further clarified the scenarios in which diffusive slow and fast wave modes coexist are elaborated the pore pressure perturbations travel in oscillatory waves or static diffusion with different velocities and magnitudes however the difference between the two physical processes for different modes is unknown the different works performed at the source location will affect the energy translation into the wave or diffusion field with a certain distribution among the modes zhang and ping 2020 beyond the eigenmode orthogonality of field equations lo et al 2010 the effective dynamic shear viscosity over the sum of the relative mobilities for two fluid phases is a set of wave equations with second time derivative inertial terms in the spatiotemporal representation berryman et al 1988 lo et al 2007b similar to that of diffusion equations with solely first order time derivatives showing two diffusive features in nature at low frequencies a concern in this context is whether the dynamic flow in the pore space further leads to the recurrence of the time elapsed hydraulic properties and exerts the dynamic triggering of microearthquakes therefore whether low frequency e g seismic frequency wave induced pore pressure that behaves like diffusion accounts for spatiotemporal hydraulic behaviour and pore fracturing of microseismicity needs to be investigated to answer the aforementioned questions the full green s tensor in partially saturated media at different frequencies according to zhang and ping 2020 is further analysed where solid displacement u 0 relative fluid increments wj j 1 2 and pore pressures pj j 1 2 are used as field variables the rewritten formulation is more expedient for studying the spatiotemporal evolution of pore pressure compared with green s tensors derived using solid displacement u 0 and fluid displacements uj j 1 2 as field variables the effect of the time dependent fluid injection source is considered the pore pressure evolution is restricted to a point fluid source implying spherical symmetry and thus uncoupled from variations in the solid stress field different regimes are defined to present explicit results for the pore pressure evolution in the time domain the resulting expressions are straightforward and may provide immediate insights into the connection between quasi static and dynamic poroelasticity in partially saturated porous media the remainder of this paper is organised as follows in section 2 a rewritten form of the mathematical derivation of the field equation in partially saturated porous media is provided in section 3 the revised poroelastic green s tensor is further considered to obtain the temporal response owing to time dependent fluid injection beginning from the lowest frequency approximation different regimes of pore pressure perturbations are defined and degenerated green s functions of quasi static poroelasticity are obtained in section 4 certain typical spatiotemporal pore pressure evolutions are analysed and compared in section 5 the results are discussed in terms of the aforementioned questions concerning the pore pressure wave and diffusion posed and conclusions are presented 2 field equations 2 1

at low frequencies of diffusion approximation no oscillatory fast compressional wave exists the solutions represent the diffusion df regime for pore pressure propagation in a partially saturated porous medium according to the characteristic biot frequency the partial saturation characteristic frequencies are written as 78 f c j ϕ η j 2 π κ ρ j j 1 2 for frequencies below fcj j 1 2 k 2 3 k 1 always suffices however fast waves and slow diffusions may coexist across frequencies 3 3 wave and diffusion regimes the aforementioned solutions for dynamic and quasi static poroelasticity correspond to the wa and df regimes if the wavenumbers eqs 53 55 are approximated by using expressions including terms to different frequency orders there may exist transition regimes where a fast wave and slow diffusion coexist a regime is identified if the wavenumbers include the terms up to o ω k2 and k3 are given by eqs 67 and 68 respectively representing pure diffusions while the fast compressional wave mode now exists and the real wavenumber is 79 k 1 ω v 10 therefore the fast wave propagation is equivalent to the undrained compressional wave without any dispersion and intrinsic attenuations as in elastic media the approximated wavenumbers eqs 67 68 and 79 are substituted into green s functions eqs 28 and 29 indicating that the medium has two physical processes two diffusions and one non dispersion fast wave in this non dispersion diffusion ndd regime the pore pressures have a disturbance with fast compressional p1 wave velocity and are induced by diffusion with diffusivities the same as those in the df regime a further propagation regime is identified if the wavenumbers eqs 53 55 include the terms up to o ω2 as 80 k 1 ω v 10 i ρ ω 2 2 b 1 b 2 c 11 c 33 b 1 c 11 c 22 b 2 c 13 2 b 1

dependence zhang et al 2011 2012 zhang and ping 2020 the wavenumber approximations eqs 67 and 68 are adopted this indicates that at low frequencies k 2 and k 3 with higher order o ω3 2 terms do not affect the diffusive characteristics of pore pressure the fast p1 wave propagates with dispersive velocities aligned with two diffusions in this dispersion diffusion dd regime the approximated wavenumbers eqs 67 68 and 80 are substituted into green s function indicating that the two physical processes can be restated as a transition regime between the wa and df regimes 4 numerical comparison of dynamic and quasi static responses of pore fluid the pore pressure disturbances induced by a fluid volume injection are described as wave diffusion or a combination of both an impulse water volume source f t f 0 1 2 π 2 f 0 2 t 2 exp π 2 f 0 2 t 2 is selected as the ricker wavelet with dominant frequency f 0 50 hz and amplitude f 0 1000 the medium is selected as unconsolidated sand table 1 rawls et al 1992 lo et al 2007a lo and lee 2015 figs 1 4 illustrate the pore pressures of water p2 on the basis of green s functions eqs 28 29 71 and 72 in the df ndd dd and wa regimes at different distances the p3 mode disturbances are omitted in these plots because they tend to be trapped at the source zone and are difficult to observe zhang and ping 2020 the top panels show the fast p1 wave disturbances in the ndd dd and wa regimes but not in the df regime the induced p1 waves are very similar in the ndd dd and wa regimes because f c1 1 91 105 hz and f c2 1 17 104 hz the p1 wave approaches its static limit whose frequency dependent property is not demonstrated at close observation ranges fig 5 a the p2 modes diffusion and waves in the different regimes are shown in the bottom panels and represented in the nearly coincident time series under a low injection rate compared with fcj j 1 2 the wavenumber of the p2 wave is in the f 1 2 frequency dependent domain zhang et al 2011 and exhibits strong diffusive characteristics equivalent to those of the pure diffusions in the df ndd and dd regimes fig 5b the p1 waves and diffusive p2 modes are clearly separated when they propagate away from the sources comparing the time scales between a and b in figs 1 4 owing to the different phase velocities in the induced frequency band around f0 50 hz namely v 1 171 m s and v 2 2 43 m s for the p1 and p2 modes respectively fig 5 zhang and ping 2020 the initial induced p2 amplitudes of the diffusion like p2 modes are much larger than those of the p1 waves fig 1 but are damped more significantly figs 3 and 4 indicating unbalanced energy dissipation in the coexisting diffusion and wave processes the p1 waves may be regarded as dynamic responses whereas the diffusive p2 modes may be regarded as pure water flows in the connected pore space with saturation s 2 0 9 coussy 2004 a comparison of the p2 modes in the ndd dd and df regimes with those in the wa regime reveals that the p1 wave propagation is an independent process that does not perturb the diffusion in the low frequency band in unconsolidated sand the stiff wetting water may bear the dominant volume strain by the oscillatory water injections to induce these wave and diffusion two diverse physical processes zhang and ping 2020 static limit velocity v 10 and water diffusivity d 2 represent the two pressure disturbances convolving in pore water to further elucidate the possible interactions between the observable wave and diffusion the conditions are estimated where the two processes remain around the critical frequencies f c1 and f c2 for a weaker viscous coupling between fluids and a solid biot darcy coupling coefficient bj j 1 2 is 10 3 the amount of the aforementioned case f c1 191 hz and f c2 11 7 hz are located in the frequency band of the injection of peak frequency f 0 50 hz i e a relatively high frequency range in figs 6 9 pore pressure p 2 in the different regimes is plotted in this case the phase velocities of the p1 and p2 waves overlap in this frequency band whereas v 1 remains at 171 m s in the low frequency ndd and dd regimes but varies to 180 m s in the wa regime at 150 hz and v 2 varies from 0 m s at the static limit to approximately 133 m s for diffusion and 101 m s for a wave at 150 hz fig 10 in figs 6 and 7 the p 2 disturbances are mainly dominated by the slow p2 modes indicating the early arrival time in the df regime fig 7 because the p2 diffusion propagates in the fluid with a total f 1 2 frequency dependent on the entire frequency band moreover the p2 wave propagates with a no flow limit at high frequencies zhang and ping 2018 and causes the phase velocity of the wave to be slower than that of diffusion fig 10b in the ndd and dd regimes although the p2 behaves as the diffusions owing to the p1 waves radiation occurs between the two processes of wave and diffusion and alters the velocities and amplitudes of the entire disturbance packets p1 and p2 modes propagate as coexisting waves in the wa regime at larger distances the p 2 disturbances are dominated by the fast p1 wave figs 8a and 9a in the wa ndd and dd regimes while the p2 diffusions become weaker in amplitude figs 8b and 9b in the wa regime the p1 wave propagates more quickly owing to its normal dispersion away from the static limit fig 10a zhang and ping 2018 the p1 wave in the ndd regime shows the largest amplitude owing to non dispersion and non dissipation however the p1 wave in the dd regime shows a small amplitude which may have been co attenuated by the wave and diffusion resonance around f 1 2 5 discussion and conclusions recent hydrological aquifer tests have shown the natural and man made head fluctuations in pore pressure p 2 with large space scales kümpel et al 1999 vasco et al 2000 during fluid injection or pumping experiments over several days the constant and transient flow rate is regarded as a frequency range for which the diffusion approximation works very well shapiro 2015 the time dependent pore pressure data are gathered to invert hydraulic heterogeneity in a manner similar to that for the earthquake location and tomography approaches applied in seismology however diffusion approximating fluid flow over time scales particularly for transient fluctuations is unrealistic therefore the oscillatory perturbations in the flow rate may temporarily violate the assumptions that lead to the diffusion approximation and motivate the use of the ndd dd or even wa regimes in a heterogeneous porous medium the pore pressure perturbations induced by conversion scattering at the pore boundary of fast seismic waves into biot s slow waves may confirm the existence of the propagation to diffusion transition zhang et al 2012 this process leads to frequency dependent energy redistribution in fast and slow waves in a relatively low frequency range the time response deviation is identified from the df approximation to the wa and indicates the transition of diffusion to wave propagation pore pressure variations permit the two processes to coexist and induce a transient pore fluid response for hydraulic heterogeneity and microearthquakes the combination of quasi static and dynamic responses of pore water enables the observation and utilisation of fast and slow signals in a uniform framework assimilating hydraulic and seismic tests at relatively high frequencies the diffusion approximation may further break out because of the alteration in the behaviours of the fast and slow waves the deviation of the time dependent pore pressure p 2 may contradict the pure diffusion assumption in a laboratory scale hydraulic tests vogler and chrysikopoulos 2002 elkhoury et al 2011 candela et al 2015 hasanov et al 2019 evidence suggests that both quasi static deformation and transient deformation that is seismic waves fast and slow waves may influence hydraulic properties and trigger earthquakes gomberg et al 1998 a dynamic description is employed to interpret this failure condition beyond the quasi static mohr coulomb criterion e g beeler et al 2000 this may explain the occurrence of related hydraulic phenomena and demonstrate that the joint consideration of the df and wa regimes as well as the ndd and dd transition behaviour may facilitate a better understanding of the interaction between solids and fluids in conclusion based on the rewritten compact green s function for partially saturated porous media simple expressions are derived for the head fluctuations in pore pressure p 2 induced by a fluid volume injection the transition of a wave to diffusion is further depicted by the identified low frequency regimes in the lowest frequency order the pore pressures obey a coupled diffusion equation with two diffusivities for the two fluid phases no pore pressure wave is present at such low frequencies without inertial coupling when the wavenumbers eqs 53 55 are extended into a higher frequency order ndd and dd regimes exist wherein the fast p1 wave and the slow p2 and p3 diffusions approximated from the original slow p2 and p3 waves coexist these p2 and p3 modes are still diffusive and have two diffusivities eqs 65 and 66 equal to those in the df regime when the critical frequencies of a partially saturated porous medium are higher than the injection rate the magnitudes of pore pressure p 2 are similar however when the critical frequencies are comparable to the injection rate the magnitudes and arrival times of p 2 are different for most observations the magnitude of p 2 in the df regime is smaller than that in the regimes where fast waves coexist furthermore the shapes of the impulse time series are dominated by the fast waves in the far field and are different from those in pure diffusion a dispersive pressure perturbation exists in the wa and dd regimes and a nondispersive pressure perturbation is present in the ndd regime propagating with the velocity of p1 waves with large magnitudes however the near field is controlled by the p2 diffusion in the df regime and the diffusive wave or transition between the p1 and p2 modes of different phases in other regimes this indicates that an impulsive fluid injection creates pressure perturbations at different spatial scales with different wave and diffusion modes in fluid injection experiments the variation in the injection rate is responsible for the temporal switching of hydro mechanical properties from diffusion to wave propagation in partially saturated porous media particularly in the case of a weak solid and fluid coupling small biot darcy coupling coefficients or high impulsive frequencies these switches vary the spatiotemporal evolution of pore water pressure p 2 and may further alter the estimation of hydraulic heterogeneity and the probability of triggering microearthquakes therefore a reasonable combined consideration of dynamic and quasi static processes may further improve the hydraulic test

158,the dynamic and quasi static spatiotemporal responses of pore water induced by fluid mass sources in unsaturated porous media are determined and compared an explicit fundamental solution for pore water pressure is derived using the known green s function of dynamic poroelasticity based on the order of the low frequency approximations for the source impulsive time function different physical regimes are identified describing the transition from diffusion to wave propagation the diffusive regime bears only two diffusions equivalent to diffusive slow p2 and p3 waves non dispersion diffusion and dispersion diffusion regimes where p1 waves and diffusions coexist are present the similarity and diversity of induced pore water pressures owing to diffusive slow waves and fast waves may depend on the fluid loading rate e g fluid injection in contrast to the critical frequencies of a partially saturated porous medium the short term fluctuation in the injection rate may create very similar slow diffusive p2 waves along with a fast compressional p1 wave by low impulsive frequencies and various slow p2 modes with transmitted radiation to the p1 wave by the comparatively high impulsive frequencies in different regimes the results indicate that the diffusion and wave processes may generate uniform dynamic and quasi static responses in partially saturated media for hydraulic tests and induced microseismic analysis keywords poroelasticity unsaturated porous media diffusion wave pore pressure fluid injection 1 introduction the dynamic response of porous media may produce time dependent poroelastic behaviour reflecting the influences of solid fluid coupling in the deformation and fluid flow of a medium and vice versa wang 2000 rubin and hubbard 2005 in recent decades several approaches for identifying the hydraulic properties of the earth s crust in multiscale spatiotemporal domains have been proposed talwani 2000 yeh and liu 2000 shapiro et al 2002 2005 karve and kallivokas 2015 these approaches exploit the phenomena of water distribution microseismicity and solute transportation small pore pressure or head perturbation in porous rocks responds to the variation in the hydraulic heterogeneities responsible for solute migration or the triggering of microearthquakes in a critically stressed earth crust the induced pore pressure is assumed to follow a low frequency wave or diffusion equation suggesting that diffusive waves are the carriers of pore pressure information the derivation of the wave or diffusion equation for pore pressure was proposed based on the one phase fluid saturation theory of quasi static poroelasticity rice and cleary 1976 rudnicki 1986 and dynamic poroelasticity biot 1962 dutta and odé 1979 and chandler and johnson 1981 confirmed the equivalence between the quasi static flow and biot s slow wave in the zero frequency limit by neglecting the inertial terms in a dynamic poroelastic equation such that no fast wave modes existed therefore the spatiotemporal evolution of the induced pore pressure may be derived and analysed based on the fundamental solution of a dynamic poroelastic equation obtained by using integral transforms and other techniques burridge and vargas 1979 norris 1985 boutin 1991 schanz and pryl 2004 although the diffusion approximation for the pore pressure in a fluid saturated medium has been obtained in many ways the diffusive properties of the pore pressure spatiotemporal representation have not been validated for a partially saturated porous medium based on the extended biot theory the mathematical basis for interpreting the travelling waves of the p1 p2 and p3 modes in porous media is the field equation describing the media contain multiphase immiscible fluids resulting from the coupling between solid deformation and fluid flows santos et al 1990 lo et al 2005 lo and sposito 2013 zhang and ping 2020 this implies that two slow compressional waves p2 and p3 propagate in a partially saturated medium owing to capillary pressure fluctuations and show diffusive properties in complete analogy with the biot theory in this study the pore pressure evolution by the diffusion approximation caused by time dependent fluid injection is derived and the observed diffusions in hydraulic tomography and hydraulic fracturing stimulation are presented holzhausen and gooch 1985 cardiff and barrash 2011 the connection between the pore pressure evolution in the dynamic and quasi static poroelasticity based on green s functions in partially saturated porous media is further clarified the scenarios in which diffusive slow and fast wave modes coexist are elaborated the pore pressure perturbations travel in oscillatory waves or static diffusion with different velocities and magnitudes however the difference between the two physical processes for different modes is unknown the different works performed at the source location will affect the energy translation into the wave or diffusion field with a certain distribution among the modes zhang and ping 2020 beyond the eigenmode orthogonality of field equations lo et al 2010 the effective dynamic shear viscosity over the sum of the relative mobilities for two fluid phases is a set of wave equations with second time derivative inertial terms in the spatiotemporal representation berryman et al 1988 lo et al 2007b similar to that of diffusion equations with solely first order time derivatives showing two diffusive features in nature at low frequencies a concern in this context is whether the dynamic flow in the pore space further leads to the recurrence of the time elapsed hydraulic properties and exerts the dynamic triggering of microearthquakes therefore whether low frequency e g seismic frequency wave induced pore pressure that behaves like diffusion accounts for spatiotemporal hydraulic behaviour and pore fracturing of microseismicity needs to be investigated to answer the aforementioned questions the full green s tensor in partially saturated media at different frequencies according to zhang and ping 2020 is further analysed where solid displacement u 0 relative fluid increments wj j 1 2 and pore pressures pj j 1 2 are used as field variables the rewritten formulation is more expedient for studying the spatiotemporal evolution of pore pressure compared with green s tensors derived using solid displacement u 0 and fluid displacements uj j 1 2 as field variables the effect of the time dependent fluid injection source is considered the pore pressure evolution is restricted to a point fluid source implying spherical symmetry and thus uncoupled from variations in the solid stress field different regimes are defined to present explicit results for the pore pressure evolution in the time domain the resulting expressions are straightforward and may provide immediate insights into the connection between quasi static and dynamic poroelasticity in partially saturated porous media the remainder of this paper is organised as follows in section 2 a rewritten form of the mathematical derivation of the field equation in partially saturated porous media is provided in section 3 the revised poroelastic green s tensor is further considered to obtain the temporal response owing to time dependent fluid injection beginning from the lowest frequency approximation different regimes of pore pressure perturbations are defined and degenerated green s functions of quasi static poroelasticity are obtained in section 4 certain typical spatiotemporal pore pressure evolutions are analysed and compared in section 5 the results are discussed in terms of the aforementioned questions concerning the pore pressure wave and diffusion posed and conclusions are presented 2 field equations 2 1

green s functions in quasi static poroelasticity in the diffusion approximation only slow modes exist which are equivalent to diffusivities no fast waves propagate which implies k 1 0 furthermore the derivation is simpler than that in the time domain approach rudnicki 1986 and connection to the frequency response is more transparent see 67 and 68 therefore green s functions are simplified as 71 g

at low frequencies of diffusion approximation no oscillatory fast compressional wave exists the solutions represent the diffusion df regime for pore pressure propagation in a partially saturated porous medium according to the characteristic biot frequency the partial saturation characteristic frequencies are written as 78 f c j ϕ η j 2 π κ ρ j j 1 2 for frequencies below fcj j 1 2 k 2 3 k 1 always suffices however fast waves and slow diffusions may coexist across frequencies 3 3 wave and diffusion regimes the aforementioned solutions for dynamic and quasi static poroelasticity correspond to the wa and df regimes if the wavenumbers eqs 53 55 are approximated by using expressions including terms to different frequency orders there may exist transition regimes where a fast wave and slow diffusion coexist a regime is identified if the wavenumbers include the terms up to o ω k2 and k3 are given by eqs 67 and 68 respectively representing pure diffusions while the fast compressional wave mode now exists and the real wavenumber is 79 k 1 ω v 10 therefore the fast wave propagation is equivalent to the undrained compressional wave without any dispersion and intrinsic attenuations as in elastic media the approximated wavenumbers eqs 67 68 and 79 are substituted into green s functions eqs 28 and 29 indicating that the medium has two physical processes two diffusions and one non dispersion fast wave in this non dispersion diffusion ndd regime the pore pressures have a disturbance with fast compressional p1 wave velocity and are induced by diffusion with diffusivities the same as those in the df regime a further propagation regime is identified if the wavenumbers eqs 53 55 include the terms up to o ω2 as 80 k 1 ω v 10 i ρ ω 2 2 b 1 b 2 c 11 c 33 b 1 c 11 c 22 b 2 c 13 2 b 1

dependence zhang et al 2011 2012 zhang and ping 2020 the wavenumber approximations eqs 67 and 68 are adopted this indicates that at low frequencies k 2 and k 3 with higher order o ω3 2 terms do not affect the diffusive characteristics of pore pressure the fast p1 wave propagates with dispersive velocities aligned with two diffusions in this dispersion diffusion dd regime the approximated wavenumbers eqs 67 68 and 80 are substituted into green s function indicating that the two physical processes can be restated as a transition regime between the wa and df regimes 4 numerical

table 1 rawls et al 1992 lo et al 2007a lo and lee 2015 figs 1 4 illustrate the pore pressures of water p2 on the basis of green s functions eqs 28 29 71 and 72 in the df ndd dd and wa regimes at different distances the p3 mode disturbances are omitted in these plots because they tend to be trapped at the source zone and are difficult to observe zhang and ping 2020 the top panels show the fast p1 wave disturbances in the ndd dd and wa regimes but not in the df regime the induced p1 waves are very similar in the ndd dd and wa regimes because f c1 1 91 105 hz and f c2 1 17 104 hz the p1 wave approaches its static limit whose frequency dependent property is not demonstrated at close observation ranges fig 5 a the p2 modes diffusion and waves in the different regimes are shown in the bottom panels and represented in the nearly coincident time series under a low injection rate compared with fcj j 1 2 the wavenumber of the p2 wave is in the f 1 2 frequency dependent domain zhang et al 2011 and exhibits strong diffusive characteristics equivalent to those of the pure diffusions in the df ndd and dd regimes fig 5b the p1 waves and diffusive p2 modes are clearly separated when they propagate away from the sources comparing the time scales between a and b in figs 1 4 owing to the different phase velocities in the induced frequency band around f0 50 hz namely v 1 171 m s and v 2 2 43 m s for the p1 and p2 modes respectively fig 5 zhang and ping 2020 the initial induced p2 amplitudes of the diffusion like p2 modes are much larger than those of the p1 waves fig 1 but are damped more significantly figs 3 and 4 indicating unbalanced energy dissipation in the coexisting diffusion and wave processes the p1 waves may be regarded as dynamic responses whereas the diffusive p2 modes may be regarded as pure water flows in the connected pore space with saturation s 2 0 9 coussy 2004 a comparison of the p2 modes in the ndd dd and df regimes with those in the wa regime reveals that the p1 wave propagation is an independent process that does not perturb the diffusion in the low frequency band in unconsolidated sand the stiff wetting water may bear the dominant volume strain by the oscillatory water injections to induce these wave and diffusion two diverse physical processes zhang and ping 2020 static limit velocity v 10 and water diffusivity d 2 represent the two pressure disturbances convolving in pore water to further elucidate the possible interactions between the observable wave and diffusion the conditions are estimated where the two processes remain around the critical frequencies f c1 and f c2 for a weaker viscous coupling between fluids and a solid biot darcy coupling coefficient bj j 1 2 is 10 3 the amount of the aforementioned case f c1 191 hz and f c2 11 7 hz are located in the frequency band of the injection of peak frequency f 0 50 hz i e a relatively high frequency range in figs 6 9 pore pressure p 2 in the different regimes is plotted in this case the phase velocities of the p1 and p2 waves overlap in this frequency band whereas v 1 remains at 171 m s in the low frequency ndd and dd regimes but varies to 180 m s in the wa regime at 150 hz and v 2 varies from 0 m s at the static limit to approximately 133 m s for diffusion and 101 m s for a wave at 150 hz fig 10 in figs 6 and 7 the p 2 disturbances are mainly dominated by the slow p2 modes indicating the early arrival time in the df regime fig 7 because the p2 diffusion propagates in the fluid with a total f 1 2 frequency dependent on the entire frequency band moreover the p2 wave propagates with a no flow limit at high frequencies zhang and ping 2018 and causes the phase velocity of the wave to be slower than that of diffusion fig 10b in the ndd and dd regimes although the p2 behaves as the diffusions owing to the p1 waves radiation occurs between the two processes of wave and diffusion and alters the velocities and amplitudes of the entire disturbance packets p1 and p2 modes propagate as coexisting waves in the wa regime at larger distances the p 2 disturbances are dominated by the fast p1 wave figs 8a and 9a in the wa ndd and dd regimes while the p2 diffusions become weaker in amplitude figs 8b and 9b in the wa regime the p1 wave propagates more quickly owing to its normal dispersion away from the static limit fig 10a zhang and ping 2018 the p1 wave in the ndd regime shows the largest amplitude owing to non dispersion and non dissipation however the p1 wave in the dd regime shows a small amplitude which may have been co attenuated by the wave and diffusion resonance around f 1 2 5 discussion and conclusions recent hydrological aquifer tests have shown the natural and man made head fluctuations in pore pressure p 2 with large space scales kümpel et al 1999 vasco et al 2000 during fluid injection or pumping experiments over several days the constant and transient flow rate is regarded as a frequency range for which the diffusion approximation works very well shapiro 2015 the time dependent pore pressure data are gathered to invert hydraulic heterogeneity in a manner similar to that for the earthquake location and tomography approaches applied in seismology however diffusion approximating fluid flow over time scales particularly for transient fluctuations is unrealistic therefore the oscillatory perturbations in the flow rate may temporarily violate the assumptions that lead to the diffusion approximation and motivate the use of the ndd dd or even wa regimes in a heterogeneous porous medium the pore pressure perturbations induced by conversion scattering at the pore boundary of fast seismic waves into biot s slow waves may confirm the existence of the propagation to diffusion transition zhang et al 2012 this process leads to frequency dependent energy redistribution in fast and slow waves in a relatively low frequency range the time response deviation is identified from the df approximation to the wa and indicates the transition of diffusion to wave propagation pore pressure variations permit the two processes to coexist and induce a transient pore fluid response for hydraulic heterogeneity and microearthquakes the combination of quasi static and dynamic responses of pore water enables the observation and utilisation of fast and slow signals in a uniform framework assimilating hydraulic and seismic tests at relatively high frequencies the diffusion approximation may further break out because of the alteration in the behaviours of the fast and slow waves the deviation of the time dependent pore pressure p 2 may contradict the pure diffusion assumption in a laboratory scale hydraulic tests vogler and chrysikopoulos 2002 elkhoury et al 2011 candela et al 2015 hasanov et al 2019 evidence suggests that both quasi static deformation and transient deformation that is seismic waves fast and slow waves may influence hydraulic properties and trigger earthquakes gomberg et al 1998 a dynamic description is employed to interpret this failure condition beyond the quasi static mohr coulomb criterion e g beeler et al 2000 this may explain the occurrence of related hydraulic phenomena and demonstrate that the joint consideration of the df and wa regimes as well as the ndd and dd transition behaviour may facilitate a better understanding of the interaction between solids and fluids in conclusion based on the rewritten compact green s function for partially saturated porous media simple expressions are derived for the head fluctuations in pore pressure p 2 induced by a fluid volume injection the transition of a wave to diffusion is further depicted by the identified low frequency regimes in the lowest frequency order the pore pressures obey a coupled diffusion equation with two diffusivities for the two fluid phases no pore pressure wave is present at such low frequencies without inertial coupling when the wavenumbers eqs 53 55 are extended into a higher frequency order ndd and dd regimes exist wherein the fast p1 wave and the slow p2 and p3 diffusions approximated from the original slow p2 and p3 waves coexist these p2 and p3 modes are still diffusive and have two diffusivities eqs 65 and 66 equal to those in the df regime when the critical frequencies of a partially saturated porous medium are higher than the injection rate the magnitudes of pore pressure p 2 are similar however when the critical frequencies are comparable to the injection rate the magnitudes and arrival times of p 2 are different for most observations the magnitude of p 2 in the df regime is smaller than that in the regimes where fast waves coexist furthermore the shapes of the impulse time series are dominated by the fast waves in the far field and are different from those in pure diffusion a dispersive pressure perturbation exists in the wa and dd regimes and a nondispersive pressure perturbation is present in the ndd regime propagating with the velocity of p1 waves with large magnitudes however the near field is controlled by the p2 diffusion in the df regime and the diffusive wave or transition between the p1 and p2 modes of different phases in other regimes this indicates that an impulsive fluid injection creates pressure perturbations at different spatial scales with different wave and diffusion modes in fluid injection experiments the variation in the injection rate is responsible for the temporal switching of hydro mechanical properties from diffusion to wave propagation in partially saturated porous media particularly in the case of a weak solid and fluid coupling small biot darcy coupling coefficients or high impulsive frequencies these switches vary the spatiotemporal evolution of pore water pressure p 2 and may further alter the estimation of hydraulic heterogeneity and the probability of triggering microearthquakes therefore a reasonable combined consideration of dynamic and quasi static processes may further improve the hydraulic test method our results support the further numerical design of a hydraulic head forward calculation and reveal that such an analysis is possible using approximated partial differential equations however

159,we present results from laboratory experiments of the downslope propagation of a finite volume released gravity current by means of combined piv plif measurements the experimental data were used to estimate the global characteristics of the current such as the propagation speed the lateral surface and the buoyancy revealing that thermal theory is a robust model that can predict such quantities properly especially the models of beghin et al 1981 maxworthy 2010 and the theoretical model of dai 2013a the collected data allowed also for the determination of the entrainment rates based on the turbulent fluxes instead using the variation of the volume flux and the regions of entrainment detrainment have been identified the results support previous observations of the mechanism responsible for the buoyancy loss of the cloud and its consequent deceleration down the slope as a large scale recirculation vortex at the back of the cloud a very complex interior structure of the cloud is observed with a large variety of turbulent processes taking place such as the large scale convectively unstable recirculation vortex at the scale of the current itself the small scale convectively unstable motions inside the head of the cloud and close to the bottom boundary and shear kelvin helmholtz instabilities at the boundary between the current and the ambient water the synoptic velocity and density measurements allowed also to test existent parametrizations of turbulent fluxes that have been quantified in 2d fields with a high spatial resolution results confirm that parametrization laws based on the assumption of a constant turbulent diffusivity or mixing length do not apply for buoyancy clouds due to their high spatial heterogeneity hence the parametrization of the turbulent diffusivities in such flows should be based on scalar quantities that avoid the problem of spatial heterogeneity and takes into account the different sources of turbulence production e g using energetic considerations that compare the terms having a definite exchange of energy and acts as a source or a sink keywords gravity currents mixing experiments sloping bottom internal structure 1 introduction variations in temperature salinity and or sediment concentration cause variations of fluid density in the vertical direction the resulting flow stratification which typically occurs in environmental and geophysical flows leads to qualitative and quantitative modifications of the flow patterns by buoyancy when buoyancy driven flows encounter topography a downslope dense current i e gravity current is created its motion is then sustained by buoyancy and deviated by the topographic slope gravity currents are key processes that affect ocean atmospheric and coastal circulation gravity currents can take on different forms depending on their source of supply of buoyancy being continuous britter and linden 1980 baines 2002 odier et al 2014 negretti et al 2017 martin et al 2019 or resulting from a finite volume release beghin et al 1981 examples of the first type are oceanic gravity currents baringer and price 2001 while examples of finite volume released gravity currents are avalanches hopfinger 1983 clément rastello 2001 rastello and hopfinger 2004 volcanic eruptions holyer and huppert 1980 or turbidity currents meiburg and kneller 2010 which contribute to the shaping of the continental surface and have a large impact on the geomorphological floor and the related ecosystems pohl et al 2020 bründl et al 2010 kostaschuk et al 2018 thorez et al 2021 katabatic winds are also an example of an intermittent gravity flow and are important to determine the local air circulation in several regions brun 2017 charrondiere et al 2020 this paper deals with finite volume released gravity currents over sloping boundaries for the terminology finite volume released gravity currents on a sloping boundary is more precisely described as a thermal cloud or density cloud simpson 1982 because the flow resembles more a cloud with some tail following the pioneering work on downslope propagating density clouds was made by beghin et al 1981 who studied the full range of slopes between 5 and 90 they showed that the current development includes a first quick accelerating phase of the density cloud followed by a decelerating phase if no buoyancy is entrained by the current as for gravity currents propagating over a sediment bed rastello and hopfinger 2004 further theoretical numerical and experimental studies followed giving important insights in the dynamics and the spatio temporal development of the current beghin et al 1981 beghin and brugnot 1983 hopfinger 1983 rastello and hopfinger 2004 dai et al 2011 adduce et al 2012 dai 2012 2013a 2014 2015 ottolenghi et al 2017 steenhauer et al 2017 zemach et al 2019 martin et al 2020 to describe the front velocity history of a lock released gravity current both a shallow water model approach webber et al 1993 tickle 1996 ross et al 2002 ungarish 2009 or thermal theory morton et al 1956 beghin et al 1981 have been adopted in the latter case the assumption of a constant buoyancy flux during the head propagation was made and despite the strong approximation this model has shown to give a good description of the evolution of both the first accelerating phase and the successive decelerating phase beghin et al 1981 a more sophisticated model has been proposed by maxworthy and nokes 2007 who argued that during the acceleration phase the head was being fed by a following current that increased its buoyancy as it propagated downstream maxworthy 2010 showed that after a propagation distance of the order of 5 10 h 0 where h 0 is the initial depth of the lock the inflow into the rear stopped and the head began to lose buoyancy containing fluid from its rear by the detachment of large weakly vortical structures their measurements have shown that the buoyancy in the current head increased during the acceleration phase and decreased during the deceleration phase dai 2012 2013b implemented a three dimensional direct numerical simulation of a lock released downslope gravity current they confirmed numerically that the maximum buoyancy in the head never reaches the total released buoyancy and a significant portion of heavy fluid is left in the tail current which is often detached from the head when the density cloud propagates over steep slopes see also dai 2013a c in accord with maxworthy 2010 for a long running length x 13 h they showed a disagreement between the thermal theory morton et al 1956 and the observed growth of the density cloud in the deceleration phase recently martin et al 2020 and zemach et al 2019 proposed a theoretical solution based on the shallow water model combined with a benjamin s type jump condition at the nose of the head and an empirical entrainment law respectively their solution is of relevance during the acceleration phase only taking into account the contribution of the tail to the buoyancy budget of the density cloud as reported by maxworthy and nokes 2007 however the model cannot predict the loss of buoyancy in the deceleration phase maxworthy 2010 dai 2012 2013a while previous studies mostly concentrated on the global properties of such density clouds propagating on horizontal or inclined boundaries their internal structure has started to receive attention only recently hopfinger and tochon danguy 1977 measured the velocity distribution within the density cloud by means of the hydrogen bubble technique combined with a conductivity probe measurement for the density three dimensional direct numerical simulations of a lock released gravity current were performed by étienne et al 2004 calgaro et al 2015 and steenhauer et al 2017 revealing a very turbulent structure of the buoyancy cloud nishimura and ito 1997 measured internal velocities of 50 m s 1 for a front velocity of about 10 m s 1 demonstrating that the head interior is characterized by a strong energetic circulation and a large variety of turbulent structures knowing the internal structure of density clouds may help to better predict the entrainment and dilution mechanisms which are directly related to the propagation speed and motion of such currents detailed velocity and or density measurements within the head of a density cloud propagating over a horizontal boundary using optical non intrusive measurements techniques such as particle image velocimetry piv have been performed only in few studies hallworth et al 1996 thomas et al 2003 martin and garcía 2009 pelmard et al 2021 hallworth et al 1996 and later martin and garcía 2009 observed the formation of persistent kelvin helmholtz type billows at the front of the density current causing entrainment of ambient fluid into the current at the interface current ambient here we performed experiments on finite volume released gravity currents over steep sloping boundaries with slope angles of 15 and 20 using simultaneous piv plif measurements techniques such measurements in unsteady and heterogeneous turbulent buoyancy flows are rare but are very useful since they allow to highly resolve both large scale and small scale flow motions and statistics which otherwise are very difficult to measure this also enables resolving turbulent fluxes and their spatial distribution which are impossible to quantify with other measurement techniques the recent studies performed by mukherjee and balasubramanian 2020 2021 and agrawal et al 2021 on horizontal lock released gravity currents focused on the slumping phase and their analysis was aimed at estimating the mixing efficiency at the interface between the cloud and the ambient fluid due to holmboe or kelvin helmholtz instabilities no study is known in the literature on downslope density clouds aimed at verifying the theories of the global characteristics governing the dynamics of such flows as the front propagation the buoyancy and the entrainment but also quantifying small scale processes and turbulent fluxes that characterize the internal structure of the density cloud based on highly resolved simultaneous measurements of both the velocity and the density fields by means of such detailed measurements the validity and limitations of the existent theories for both the global characteristics of the flow but also those related to the parametrization of the turbulent diffusivities have been tested revealing interesting insights on the small scale features of the internal structure of the head the global characteristics of the density cloud compared to the semi empirical thermal theory of beghin et al 1981 and escudier and maxworthy 1973 reveal a fairly good agreement with exception of the assumption of initial mass conservation in accord with maxworthy 2010 the predictions for the buoyancy loss of the gravity current during the decelerating phase are in better agreement with the theoretical model proposed by dai 2013a c while the model of maxworthy 2010 reveals to strongly overestimate it even if the trend of decrease is well represented by maxworthy 2010 s theory a very complex interior structure of the buoyancy cloud is observed with a variety of turbulent processes sources of mixing and dilution present these are large scale and small scale convective motions inside the cloud shear turbulence and related instabilities e g kelvin helmholtz and boundary layer instabilities at the boundaries with the ambient fluid and the bottom finally it is shown that classical mixing parametrizations of turbulent fluxes based on mixing length models are not appropriate for lock released buoyancy clouds due to their strong spatial and temporal heterogeneity the paper is organized as follows section 2 outlines the experimental set up and the measurement techniques section 3 gives the global characteristics of the buoyancy cloud while entrainment detrainment and mixing are presented in 4 and 5 respectively and compared to existent parametrizations section 6 summarizes the results and includes concluding remarks 2 experimental facility and measurement techniques 2 1

resulting reynolds numbers were re u h ν 1 2 1 0 4 where u and h are respectively the typical velocities and depths of the cloud in the measurement region and ν the kinematic viscosity two runs of experiments have been performed in the deceleration region 1 65 m x 2 5 m from the lock release see fig 1 the same initial conditions have been adopted for both runs with exception of the bottom slope which was set to 15 in the first run and 20 in the second run of experiments a third run of experiments has been conducted in the initial stage of the decelerating region within 0 7 m x 1 55 m from the lock release and same initial conditions as in the first run of the experiments the same experiment was repeated n 7 times to check for reproducibility and all calculated quantities have been averaged over the n experiments ensemble average the main parameters of the experimental runs are summarized in table 1 for all runs synoptic piv and plif measurements techniques have been used to capture simultaneously the velocity and density fields respectively essential details are given below and in the appendix 2 2 measurement technique the velocities and the density were determined using the optical non intrusive experimental techniques of particle image velocimetry piv and planar laser induced fluorescence plif respectively both piv only and combined piv plif experimental data are used in the following results sections essential details on the measurements techniques are given below while the detailed procedure for the plif calibration is given in the appendix the piv set up consisted of a light source light sheet optics seeding particles a camera and a pc equipped with a frame grabber and image acquisition software polyamide particles orgasol with a mean diameter of 60 μ m and a specific density of 1 016 g cm 3 were added in both the fresh water and the salt water in the initial release reservoir as tracer material for the piv measurements a 5 watt yag laser λ 532 nm has been used as continuous light source the beam was transmitted through mirrors to a spherical lens with an angle of 45 to generate a laser sheet with a length of approximately 1 m and a width of 5 mm positioned in the middle of the channel rhodamine 6g was used as fluorescent dye absorption peak at 530 nm and emission peak at 555 nm and uniformly mixed in the reservoir containing the dense fluid with initial concentration c 0 5 μ g l the dye and the salt have approximately the same diffusivity with a schmidt number s c ν κ 700 where κ is the mass transfer diffusion coefficient troy and koseff 2005 for the simultaneous piv plif measurements an interferometer bandpass 532 nm for piv and a high pass filter with cut off 550 nm for plif were used to separate the emitted wavelengths images of roughly 70 cm 55 cm were grabbed with a ccd camera flow master 1200 1600 pixels for piv and with a second ccd camera dalsa 1000 1000 pixels at a frame rate of 23 22 hz for plif the raw image pairs were then processed using a piv cross correlation algorithm software package davis lavision to compute the velocity fields starting with an interrogation window of 32 32 pixels and a final window size of 16 16 pixels with 50 overlap each vector of the resulting vector field represents an area of roughly 0 6 cm 0 6 cm given the velocities encountered in the experiments the error for the instantaneous velocity is approximately 4 the calibration procedure for the plif measurements is given in the appendix 3 experimental results 3 1 global characteristics of the density cloud fig 2 illustrates an instantaneous side view of a calibrated density field the cloud has the size of the present piv lif field of view hence present results are treated in terms of the vertical coordinate z and time t where time is converted in the streamwise space coordinate x by neglecting the time distortion of the cloud during the advective time t a at a given x position and assuming a constant advective velocity of the cloud over this time laps for each x position the density cloud is detected t z using a threshold of 0 99 δ ρ ρ m a x for the density as suggested by beghin et al 1981 and as evident from present visual observations the shape of the cloud can be fitted in time and vertical space t z assuming a semi elliptic shape cf also fig 5 that follows the following equation 1 z h 0 5 t a 0 5 t a 2 t t 0 2 1 2 where z is the vertical normal to the slope coordinate of the boundary of the density cloud with the ambient fluid h and 0 5 t a are the minor and major axis of the ellipse and t 0 is the time corresponding to a given position of the geometrical center of the ellipse x g from eq 1 h and the length l t a u of the density cloud can be estimated where u is the velocity of the geometric center of the ellipse defined as 2 u δ x δ t 0 fig 3a shows the non linear fit using eq 1 dashed line compared to experimental values solid line the streamwise coordinate corresponds to the dimensionless advective time t t 0 t a where t 0 has been determined using a power law fit beghin et al 1981 cf fig 3b using this procedure the velocity of the buoyancy cloud u its surface area a and its buoyancy flux b g u h have been determined fig 4a shows the normalized experimental velocity u g 0 h 0 solid line obtained from eq 2 clearly in the deceleration stage and in good accord with predictions of the thermal theory dashed line the normalized lateral surface a a 0 defined as a π 4 l h where l and h are estimated from eq 1 is shown in fig 4b beghin et al 1981 showed experimentally that the surface of the buoyancy cloud increases with the square of the along slope direction as a c x x 0 2 where c is a constant defined as c π 16 s 2 s 1 2 α 2 and x 0 is a virtual origin corresponding to a 0 i e x 0 4 s 1 s 2 α 1 a 0 π the shape factors s 1 and s 2 are estimated assuming a semi elliptical shape of the buoyancy cloud and α is an empirical entrainment coefficient see also eq 7 this model is represented by a dashed line in fig 4b revealing a good agreement with the experimental data in the initial accelerating stage at x l 0 sin θ 2 8 corresponding to x 34 h 0 the data suggests that the lateral surface stops increasing in accord with previous numerical observations dai 2012 2013b steenhauer et al 2017 in particular for a slope of 10 dai 2012 observed that the semi elliptical head experiences multiple sporadic reductions in its height as mentioned in the introduction maxworthy 2010 explained this behavior as the result of loss of volume and buoyancy that takes place during the descent induced by large scale vortical structures developing at the back of the gravity current head that has been also supported by dai 2013b a the numerical results from dai 2013b are also reported as symbols in figure fig 4b results are within the range of our data and the theoretical prediction of maxworthy 2010 however the lateral surface a increases monotonically and no decrease is observed fig 5 illustrates the density field at three different x positions in a at x g 2 2 m the buoyancy cloud is well fitted by the half elliptic shape with a very active back vortex incorporating ambient water at the back of the cloud on fig 5 b at x g 2 3 m a larger interfacial shear instability develops which begins to separate the back of the cloud as seen later in c there is clearly a loss of volume and mass at the back of the cloud this phenomenon is observed in all the experiments although with variable intensity and confirms the suggestion of maxworthy 2010 and dai 2013a to explain the observed decrease of buoyancy in the second stage of propagation of the cloud down the slope steenhauer et al 2017 observed a variation in the development of the lateral surface at x 35 h 0 for slopes larger than 30 they showed that for sufficiently large distances from the source the normalized sub volume containing mixed fluid which is linearly related to the lateral surface a starts decaying for any value of the slope θ related to a strong dilution of the sub volume defining a constant c 0 representing the ratio between mixed and unmixed fluid they observed that smaller values of c 0 corresponded to extended regions in which the lateral surface a increases linearly with x and trends in the variation of a with x are similar for any value of c 0 the buoyancy of the semi elliptical cloud is shown in fig 4c defined as 3 b u 0 t n t b g δ c d t d z where t n and t b are respectively the time at a given distance x at which the nose and the back of the ellipse appears respectively and δ c is the dirac function note that this definition of the buoyancy differs from that of maxworthy 2010 by a factor of 1 ρ 0 which is canceled out in fig 4c since it is normalized with the initial buoyancy from the figure it emerges that at x l 0 sin θ 2 2 the buoyancy of the cloud is about 60 of the initial buoyancy demonstrating that during the descent buoyancy has been left behind in the tail for this value of the buoyancy thermal theory predicts a velocity 84 of the predicted velocity which explains the lower velocity 88 reported in fig 4a for comparison we also report the conservation of buoyancy from beghin et al 1981 dashed line in fig 4c maxworthy and nokes 2007 and maxworthy 2010 showed that the buoyancy of the cloud is not conserved in the deceleration stage of the density cloud for a slope angle of 10 6 they showed that the buoyancy of the cloud reaches a maximum of about 43 b 0 for x 10 13 h 0 and decreases afterwards this is represented as a continuous line in fig 4c and we see that the descent of our data follows the trend of maxworthy 2010 the theoretical solution of maxworthy 2010 however underestimates our reported values 60 versus 43 which may be imputed by the different definition of the buoyancy threshold within the cloud or by the different quantities used for its estimation in our case the buoyancy has been obtained by instantaneous velocity and density measurements and not from dye concentration measurements dai 2013a derived a power law relationship which enables to estimate the fraction of heavy fluid in the lock that is contained within the head χ via χ k m k b 1 3 where k m is parameter which has been determined by several measurements in previous studies beghin et al 1981 hoult 1972 huppert and simpson 1980 marino et al 2005 whereas a theoretical derivation of k b is given in dai 2013a cf equation 1 7 therein the theoretical estimations of dai 2013a were also in good agreement with the measurements of beghin et al 1981 predicting values of 0 75 for slope angles below 5 and 0 82 for slope angles of 9 dai 2013c these values are much higher than those predicted by maxworthy 2010 and this difference was explained by erroneous estimations of the model constant k b and or a different definition of the head dye concentration threshold if we estimate the model constant with our values using equation 1 7 in dai 2013a we obtain k b 3 8 resulting in χ 0 63 for k m 2 45 beghin et al 1981 which is in good agreement with the reported values in fig 4c of 0 6 in order to assure that the results do not depend on the definition chosen to determine the buoyancy of the cloud it has also been estimated directly using the combined piv plif data as follows 4 b 0 t n t b u z t g δ c d t d z b u m u where u z t is the local velocity from the piv and u m the velocity of the center of mass of the buoyancy cloud the buoyancy b is shown in fig 4c as a green line revealing that both estimations for b and b give similar results the ensemble average of b is slightly smaller than that of b because the geometric velocity u overestimates the velocity of the center of mass of the cloud 3 2 interior structure fig 6 a b show the mean structure of the buoyancy cloud with the black arrows representing the velocity difference between the ensemble average of the instantaneous velocity u and the ensemble average of the velocity of the gravity center u b of the buoyancy cloud the density for δ ρ ρ i 5 1 0 3 in a and the mean vorticity ω y u z w x in b are highlighted by the colormaps clearly the density within the cloud is not homogeneous and at the back of the head a large scale vortex appears associated to a downward vertical velocity at the outer edge of the density cloud and an upward vertical velocity in the central area of the head with evident regions convectively unstable cf colormap in fig 6a such a large scale vortex structure has been already observed in the literature e g hampton 1972 beghin and brugnot 1983 dai 2013a this vortex is composed of much lighter water 4 g 0 as compared to the frontal part at the nose 12 g 0 entrained from the ambient the size of the large scale vortex is of the order of the maximum depth of the buoyancy cloud the averaged reduced gravity within the cloud is about 6 g 0 thus 60 of the initial value during the considered space time interval when observations were taken fig 6 b shows that the vorticity is negative at the interface between the buoyancy cloud and the ambient water and positive in the bottom boundary layer of the buoyancy cloud the high values of the vorticity on the back of the buoyancy cloud confirms the presence of the large scale vortex high positive vorticity is observed at the nose of the buoyancy cloud highlighting the presence of kelvin helmholtz like structures on the frontal part of the head martin and garcía 2009 and at the outer boundary of the large scale vortex within the buoyancy cloud induced by enhanced vertical shear generated by the vortex itself these results also highlight that a variety of different turbulent processes take place inside the density cloud the large scale and small scale convective motions which become locally unstable in the core of the cloud shear turbulence as kelvin helmholtz instabilities at the boundary with the ambient fluid as also observed and quantified by balasubramanian and zhong 2018 and boundary layer instabilities at the bottom boundaries which all concur to the dilution of the cloud 4 entrainment two phenomena responsible for entrainment can be distinguished cf fig 6 the first is induced by the large scale vortex of typical scale of the order of h that engulfs ambient water within the full cloud and the second is due to small scale shear instabilities of typical scale of the order of 1 cm that develop at the contours of the buoyancy cloud with the ambient water and entraining locally the conservation of mass for the buoyancy cloud can be expressed using the model of the thermal theory considering the temporal variation of the lateral surface a 5 d a d t α u γ where α w u is the entrainment coefficient w is the average entrainment velocity across the contour γ corresponding to the buoyancy cloud interface with the ambient water assuming a 2d flow this formulation neglects the variations of density that can be assumed valid for small δ ρ ρ more rigorously the conservation of mass across the control volume representing the density cloud can be expressed as 6 d d t s γ ρ d s s γ p ρ u d s s γ ρ y v d s where p u x u z w is the divergence of the velocity in the x z plane assuming the flow to be primarily two dimensional the last term on the right hand side of eq 6 can be neglected so that the local mass flux can be directly estimated across the interface between the buoyancy cloud and the surrounding ambient the entrainment coefficient α used in the thermal theory can be then written as 7 α 1 ρ 0 u γ ρ u n d l γ d l 1 ρ 0 u c γ ρ u n d l where the circulation integral in the latter equation can be replaced by the surface integral using the green s theorem 8 γ ρ u n d l s γ p ρ u d s fig 7 displays the entrainment coefficient deduced from eqs 7 and 8 the observed sign fluctuations of α in figure 7 are of the order of the spatial average cf dashed line in the figure and correspond to entrainment positive and detrainment negative for comparison the constant entrainment coefficient proposed by beghin et al 1981 is also reported continuous line odier et al 2012 suggested a quantitative measure of local entrainment and detrainment derived from observed conditional correlations of density fluxes to fluctuations of density ρ or of the vertical velocity w fig 8 shows the two dimensional probability density functions pdf of ρ versus ρ w for the initial development phase where the lateral surface of the buoyancy cloud increases a and for the second stage characterized by a decreasing lateral surface of the buoyancy cloud b the right part of the plots corresponds to the stabilizing return to neutral buoyancy while the top left quadrant corresponds to entrainment and the bottom left quadrant to detrainment it is evident comparing the two figures that most of the entrainment takes place in the initial development phase of the density cloud while detrainment is dominant during the second phase characterized by the detachment of the back of the cloud 5 turbulent fluxes the results in section 3 have shown that a variety of turbulent motions characterize the internal structure of the density cloud turbulent motions are usually not solved explicitly in numerical models and thus they need to be parameterized vertical turbulent fluxes are generally assumed to depend linearly on the gradients of large scale quantities the eddy viscosity ν t is used in the momentum equation to parameterize the reynolds stress such as 9 u w ν t u z a frequently used turbulence closure for mixing in ocean or atmospheric circulation models is to assume a linear relation between the vertical buoyancy flux and the density gradients this relation defines a diapycnal turbulent diffusivity k ρ that can be written as 10 ρ w k ρ ρ z maps of the turbulent diffusivities are shown in fig 9 with ν t in a and k ρ in b ν t and k ρ present the same order of magnitude with high values 1 0 4 m 2 s 1 within the large scale vortex and smaller values 1 0 5 m 2 s 1 close to the nose and at the bottom their spatial structure is however different turbulent diffusivities ν t are intensified at the edge of the large scale vortex and the ambient whereas diapycnal turbulent diffusivities k ρ present the largest values in the core of the large scale vortex these estimations show clearly that the usual hypothesis of a constant diffusivity for the entire density cloud does not apply with strong variations of one order of magnitude prandtl 1925 proposed a mixing length scale l u to relate the reynolds stress and the square of the mean velocity vertical shear 11 u w l u 2 u z 2 similarly for the buoyancy flux a buoyancy mixing length l ρ can be defined 12 ρ w l ρ 2 ρ z u z in fig 10 both parametrizations for the reynolds stress eqs 9 and 11 respectively a c and for the buoyancy turbulent fluxes as given in eqs 10 and 12 respectively b d are reported two dimensional histograms show the correlation between fluxes and gradients but no convergence for both models is found thorpe 1977 proposed a characteristic length scale related to a density profile in a mixed patch obtained by adiabatically re ordering the density profile in the unstable regions of the water column and estimating the vertical displacements δ z needed for a fluid particle to be moved from the synthetic stable profile to the observed profile a characteristic length scale for the mixing can then be introduced from the root mean square of the vertical displacements δ z over the vertical profile of the buoyancy cloud such as l t δ z 2 where corresponds to the vertical average operator dillon 1982 showed that this length scale can be related to the ozmidov scale l o as 13 l o 0 8 l t where the ozmidov scale l o is defined as l o ε 1 2 n 3 2 herein ε the dissipation rate and n the brunt väisälä frequency by combining eq 13 with the expression of l o given above the dissipation rate can be written as 14 ε 0 64 l t 2 n 3 osborn 1980 showed that the turbulent diffusivity is limited by the dissipation rate following the equation 15 k ρ w ρ z ρ 0 2 ε n 2 0 13 l t 2 n barry et al 2001 proposed also two equations to estimate the turbulent diffusivity depending of the buoyancy reynolds number r e b ε ν n 2 0 64 l t 2 n ν 16 k ρ 0 9 ν 2 k m o l 1 3 r e b for 10 r e b 300 24 ν 2 k m o l 1 3 r e b 1 3 for r e b 300 where k m o l is the molecular diffusivity of salt in water combining the eqs 14 and 16 leads to 17 k ρ 0 6 p r 1 3 l t 2 n for 10 r e b 300 21 l t 2 n ν 2 p r 1 3 for r e b 300 where p r ν k m o l is the prandtl number of the fluid fig 11a displays the turbulent diffusivity deduced using the thorpe scale l t the light gray dots are estimated following the osborn equation 15 and the red dashed line is the vertical running mean of these points with a window size of 0 05 z h the black dots are estimated following the barry et al 2001 eqs 17 and the red line is the vertical running mean of these points with a window size of 0 05 z h the vertical green line is the vertical average of the diapycnal turbulent diffusivity following barry et al 2001 in fig 11b the turbulent diffusivity is estimated using eq 10 black stars where the continuous vertical green line represents the vertical average both methods fig 11 a b give a similar distribution with the same order of magnitude these results suggest that neither the mixing model based on the prandtl scale l nor the model based on the thorpe scale l t deliver a reliable relation to parameterize turbulent fluxes 6 summary and conclusions an experimental investigation of finite volume gravity currents down a slope released from a lock has been performed using combined piv and plif measurement techniques to obtain two dimensional velocity and density fields experiments were focused on the deceleration region of the buoyancy cloud at a distance x 10 h 0 from the initial volume reservoir based on the high resolved simultaneous velocity density data it is verified that the existing theoretical models of beghin et al 1981 maxworthy 2010 and dai 2013a are suitable for predicting the global characteristics of the cloud propagation front propagation lateral surface and buoyancy with exception of the buoyancy variations that have to be corrected from maxworthy 2010 using the coefficients given in the theoretical model of dai 2013a the measurements showed the complex turbulent structure of the cloud with the back of the buoyancy cloud being hydrostatically unstable with the associated thorpe scale larger than at the front of the cloud large patches of ambient fluid are engulfed into the cloud especially at the back of the head due to a large scale recirculation vortex that causes convectively unstable small scale structures within the head and subsequent intense dilution smaller scale instabilities at the limiting edge between the head and the ambient fluid also contributes to local mixing and dilution such as kelvin helmholtz instabilities using the combined velocity and density data and by averaging the buoyancy cloud along its descent turbulent fluxes has been estimated revealing that the usual parametrization laws based on the assumption of a constant turbulent diffusivity or a constant turbulent mixing length do not work properly these results apply for lock release density clouds propagating down steep slopes and in particular for the head of the gravity current which present high spatial and temporal heterogeneity the tail behind the passage of the head in case of continuous supply or even some lock released gravity currents propagating on horizontal boundaries has shown to be rather stationary and homogeneous present self similarity and can be treated with a good approximation as a stratified shear layer as given by the measurements of odier et al 2012 2014 the turbulent closure models based on mixing length scales e g prandtl 1925 revealed to work reasonably well in such cases spatial heterogeneity has been also reported for spatially developing gravity currents negretti et al 2017 martin et al 2019 in this latter case however turbulent diffusivities can be defined distinctively in the defined spatial regions that can be identified using for example the internal froude number or the bulk richardson number a study is currently in progress on this aspect the high spatio temporal anisotropy of downslope density clouds over steep slopes makes it challenging to find a correct parametrization using closure models based on the turbulent viscosity ν t that depend on the spatial variables our results show clearly that none of the parametrizations proposed in the literature can properly represent turbulent diffusivities for downslope propagating density clouds the fact that in fig 10 the histograms show no correlation between the turbulent fluxes and a mixing length the strong vertical variations shown in fig 11 using the formulation of osborn 1980 and barry et al 2001 comes from the fact that for downslope propagating buoyancy clouds over steep slopes there are several characteristic scales which are set by the multiplicity of turbulent processes that take place along with their intermittency these are convective unstable processes inside the cloud kelvin helmholtz shear instabilities at the edge with the ambient fluid and lobes and clefts instabilities not observed in this study under these conditions mixing scales go from the small convectively unstable scales the kelvin helmholtz scales up to the large scale recirculation vortex which is of the same order of the size of the cloud itself as also highlighted in fig 9 the parametrization of the turbulent diffusivities should be based rather on scalar quantities that avoid the problem of spatial heterogeneity and takes into account the different sources of turbulence production this could be done for example using energetic considerations that compare the terms having a definite exchange of energy and acts as a source or a sink the shear production deriving its energy from the mean flow p k the buoyancy production representing the rate at which turbulent kinetic energy is consumed in mixing but also aliments the production of kinetic energy for downslope propagating currents p b and the viscous dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy ε governed by the balance p k p b ε each of these three terms can be represented by a characteristic length scale of shear l s of buoyancy as for example the monin obukhov or the ozmidov scales l o and a dissipation scale l ε as proposed earlier in bradshaw 1969 the use of the energy budget approach has also the advantage to permit extending the results to similarly spatially heterogeneous non conservative currents such as turbidity currents or katabatic flows where the additional source sink of buoyancy can be added following the suspension deposition of fluid particles in turbidity currents or the presence of a local thermal flux in katabatic flows additional investigations are needed to test the appropriate turbulent closure

environment require closely matching the refraction indices of the dense and light fluids this is generally achieved by the use of salt water for the heavy fluid and ethanol water mixture for the

159,we present results from laboratory experiments of the downslope propagation of a finite volume released gravity current by means of combined piv plif measurements the experimental data were used to estimate the global characteristics of the current such as the propagation speed the lateral surface and the buoyancy revealing that thermal theory is a robust model that can predict such quantities properly especially the models of beghin et al 1981 maxworthy 2010 and the theoretical model of dai 2013a the collected data allowed also for the determination of the entrainment rates based on the turbulent fluxes instead using the variation of the volume flux and the regions of entrainment detrainment have been identified the results support previous observations of the mechanism responsible for the buoyancy loss of the cloud and its consequent deceleration down the slope as a large scale recirculation vortex at the back of the cloud a very complex interior structure of the cloud is observed with a large variety of turbulent processes taking place such as the large scale convectively unstable recirculation vortex at the scale of the current itself the small scale convectively unstable motions inside the head of the cloud and close to the bottom boundary and shear kelvin helmholtz instabilities at the boundary between the current and the ambient water the synoptic velocity and density measurements allowed also to test existent parametrizations of turbulent fluxes that have been quantified in 2d fields with a high spatial resolution results confirm that parametrization laws based on the assumption of a constant turbulent diffusivity or mixing length do not apply for buoyancy clouds due to their high spatial heterogeneity hence the parametrization of the turbulent diffusivities in such flows should be based on scalar quantities that avoid the problem of spatial heterogeneity and takes into account the different sources of turbulence production e g

volume released gravity currents over sloping boundaries for the terminology finite volume released gravity currents on a sloping boundary is more precisely described as a thermal cloud or density cloud simpson 1982 because the flow resembles more a cloud with some tail following the pioneering work on downslope propagating density clouds was made by beghin et al 1981 who studied the full range of slopes between 5 and 90 they showed that the current development includes a first quick accelerating phase of the density cloud followed by a decelerating phase if no buoyancy is entrained by the current as for gravity currents propagating over a sediment bed rastello and hopfinger 2004 further theoretical numerical and experimental studies followed giving important insights in the dynamics and the spatio temporal development of the current beghin et al 1981 beghin and brugnot 1983 hopfinger 1983 rastello and hopfinger 2004 dai et al 2011 adduce et al 2012 dai 2012 2013a 2014 2015 ottolenghi et al 2017 steenhauer et al 2017 zemach et al 2019 martin et al 2020 to describe the front velocity history of a lock released gravity current both a shallow water model approach webber et al 1993 tickle 1996 ross et al 2002 ungarish 2009 or thermal theory morton et al 1956 beghin et al 1981 have been adopted in the latter case the assumption of a constant buoyancy flux during the head propagation was made and despite the strong approximation this model has shown to give a good description of the evolution of both the first accelerating phase and the successive decelerating phase beghin et al 1981 a more sophisticated model has been proposed by maxworthy and nokes 2007 who argued that during the acceleration phase the head was being fed by a following current that increased its buoyancy as it propagated downstream maxworthy 2010 showed that after a propagation distance of the order of 5 10 h 0 where h 0 is the initial depth of the lock the inflow into the rear stopped and the head began to lose buoyancy containing fluid from its rear by the detachment of large weakly vortical structures their measurements have shown that the buoyancy in the current head increased during the acceleration phase and decreased during the deceleration phase dai 2012 2013b implemented a three dimensional direct numerical simulation of a lock released downslope gravity current they confirmed numerically that the maximum buoyancy in the head never reaches the total released buoyancy and a significant portion of heavy fluid is left in the tail current which is often detached from the head when the density cloud propagates over steep slopes see also dai 2013a c in accord with maxworthy 2010 for a long running length x 13 h they showed a disagreement between the thermal theory morton et al 1956 and the observed growth of the density cloud in the deceleration phase recently martin et al 2020 and zemach et al 2019 proposed a theoretical solution based on the shallow water model combined with a benjamin s type jump condition at the nose of the head and an empirical entrainment law respectively their solution is of relevance during the acceleration phase only taking into account the contribution of the tail to the buoyancy budget of the density cloud as reported by maxworthy and nokes 2007 however the model cannot predict the loss of buoyancy in the deceleration phase maxworthy 2010 dai 2012 2013a while previous studies mostly concentrated on the global properties of such density clouds propagating on horizontal or inclined boundaries their internal structure has started to receive attention only recently hopfinger and tochon danguy 1977 measured the velocity distribution within the density cloud by means of the hydrogen bubble technique combined with a conductivity probe measurement for the density three dimensional direct numerical simulations of a lock released gravity current were performed by étienne et al 2004 calgaro et al 2015 and steenhauer et al 2017 revealing a very turbulent structure of the buoyancy cloud nishimura and ito 1997 measured internal velocities of 50 m s 1 for a front velocity of about 10 m s 1 demonstrating that the head interior is characterized by a strong energetic circulation and a large variety of turbulent structures knowing the internal structure of density clouds may help to better predict the entrainment and dilution mechanisms which are directly related to the propagation speed and motion of such currents detailed velocity and or density measurements within the head of a density cloud propagating over a horizontal boundary using optical non intrusive measurements techniques such as particle image velocimetry piv have been performed only in few studies hallworth et al 1996 thomas et al 2003 martin and garcía 2009 pelmard et al 2021 hallworth et al 1996 and later martin and garcía 2009 observed the formation of persistent kelvin helmholtz type billows at the front of the density current causing entrainment of ambient fluid into the current at the interface current ambient here we performed experiments on finite volume released gravity currents over steep sloping boundaries with slope angles of 15 and 20 using simultaneous piv plif measurements techniques such measurements in unsteady and heterogeneous turbulent buoyancy flows are rare but are very useful since they allow to highly resolve both large scale and small scale flow motions and statistics which otherwise are very difficult to measure this also enables resolving turbulent fluxes and their spatial distribution which are impossible to quantify with other measurement techniques the recent studies performed by mukherjee and balasubramanian 2020 2021 and agrawal et al 2021 on horizontal lock released gravity currents focused on the slumping phase and their analysis was aimed at estimating the mixing efficiency at the interface between the cloud and the ambient fluid due to holmboe or kelvin helmholtz instabilities no study is known in the literature on downslope density clouds aimed at verifying the theories of the global characteristics governing the dynamics of such flows as the front propagation the buoyancy and the entrainment but also quantifying small scale processes and turbulent fluxes that characterize the internal structure of the density cloud based on highly resolved simultaneous measurements of both the velocity and the density fields by means of such detailed measurements the validity and limitations of the existent theories for both the global characteristics of the flow but also those related to the parametrization of the turbulent diffusivities have been tested revealing interesting insights on the small scale features of the internal structure of the head the global characteristics of the density cloud compared to the semi empirical thermal theory of beghin et al 1981 and escudier and maxworthy 1973 reveal a fairly good agreement with exception of the assumption of initial mass conservation in accord with maxworthy 2010 the predictions for the buoyancy loss of the gravity current during the decelerating phase are in better agreement with the theoretical model proposed by dai 2013a c while the model of maxworthy 2010 reveals to strongly overestimate it even if the trend of decrease is well represented by maxworthy 2010 s theory a very complex interior structure of the buoyancy cloud is observed with a variety of turbulent processes sources of mixing and dilution present these are large scale and small scale convective motions inside the cloud shear turbulence and related instabilities e g kelvin helmholtz and boundary layer instabilities at the boundaries with the ambient fluid and the bottom finally it is shown that classical mixing parametrizations of turbulent fluxes based on mixing length models are not appropriate for lock released buoyancy clouds due to their strong spatial and temporal heterogeneity the paper is organized as follows section 2 outlines the experimental set up and the measurement techniques section 3 gives the global characteristics of the buoyancy cloud while entrainment detrainment and mixing are presented in 4 and 5 respectively and compared to existent parametrizations section 6 summarizes the results and includes concluding remarks 2 experimental facility and measurement techniques 2 1 experimental setup the experimental set up is shown schematically in fig 1a a plexiglass water channel 2 76 m long 20 cm wide and 38 cm deep was immersed in a larger water tank of dimensions 2 4 m 2 4 m 2 4 m the slope angle of the experimental channel was set to the desired angle the dense fluid was introduced in a reservoir l 0 20 cm long and 30 cm deep with a lock depth of h 0 6 25 cm located at the upper end of the channel and initially separated by a removable gate resulting in an initial lateral surface of a 0 l 0 h 0 125 cm 2 the initial reduced gravity was fixed to g 0 g δ ρ ρ a 5 cm s 2 and produced by saline solutions with δ ρ 5 1 0 1 kg m 3 and a constant temperature of 19 7 c 0 1 measured just before each experiment with a high precision 10 3 densimeter dma tm 35 anton paar the resulting reynolds numbers were re u h ν 1 2 1 0 4 where u and h are respectively the typical velocities and depths of the cloud in the measurement region and ν the kinematic viscosity two runs of experiments have been performed in the deceleration region 1 65 m x 2 5 m from the lock release see fig 1 the same initial conditions have been adopted for both runs with exception of the bottom slope which was set to 15 in the first run and 20 in the second run of experiments a third run of experiments has been conducted in the initial stage of the decelerating region within 0 7 m x 1 55 m from the lock release and same initial conditions as in the first run of the experiments the same experiment was repeated n 7 times to check for reproducibility and all calculated quantities have been averaged over the n experiments ensemble average the main parameters of the experimental runs are summarized in table 1 for all runs synoptic piv and plif measurements techniques have been used to capture simultaneously the velocity and density fields respectively essential details are given below and in the appendix 2 2 measurement technique the velocities and the density were determined using the optical non intrusive experimental techniques of particle image velocimetry piv and planar laser induced fluorescence plif respectively both piv only and combined piv plif experimental data are used in the following results sections essential details on the measurements techniques are given below while the detailed procedure for the plif calibration is given in the appendix the piv set up consisted of a light source light sheet optics seeding particles a camera and a pc equipped with a frame grabber and image acquisition software polyamide particles orgasol with a mean diameter of 60 μ m and a specific density of 1 016 g cm 3 were added in both the fresh water and the salt water in the initial release reservoir as tracer material for the piv measurements a 5 watt yag laser λ 532 nm has been used as continuous light source the beam was transmitted through mirrors to a spherical lens with an angle of 45 to generate a laser sheet with a length of approximately 1 m and a width of 5 mm positioned in the middle of the channel rhodamine 6g was used as fluorescent dye absorption peak at 530 nm and emission peak at 555 nm and uniformly mixed in the reservoir containing the dense fluid with initial concentration c 0 5 μ g l the dye and the salt have approximately the same diffusivity with a schmidt number s c ν κ 700 where κ is the mass transfer diffusion coefficient troy and koseff 2005 for the simultaneous piv plif measurements an interferometer bandpass 532 nm for piv and a high pass filter with cut off 550 nm for plif were used to separate the emitted wavelengths images of roughly 70 cm 55 cm were grabbed with a ccd camera flow master 1200 1600 pixels for piv and with a second ccd camera dalsa 1000 1000 pixels at a frame rate of 23 22 hz for plif the raw image pairs were then processed using a piv cross correlation algorithm software package davis lavision to compute the velocity fields starting with an interrogation window of 32 32 pixels and a final window size of 16 16 pixels with 50 overlap each vector of the resulting vector field represents an area of roughly 0 6 cm 0 6 cm given the velocities encountered in the experiments the error for the instantaneous velocity is approximately 4 the calibration procedure for the plif measurements is given in the appendix 3 experimental results 3 1 global characteristics of the density cloud fig 2 illustrates an instantaneous side view of a calibrated density field the cloud has the size of the present piv lif field of view hence present results are treated in terms of the vertical coordinate z and time t where time is converted in the streamwise space coordinate x by neglecting the time distortion of the cloud during the advective time t a at a given x position and assuming a constant advective velocity of the cloud over this time laps for each x position the density cloud is detected t z using a threshold of 0 99 δ ρ ρ m a x for the density as suggested by beghin et al 1981 and as evident from present visual observations the shape of the cloud can be fitted in time and vertical space t z assuming a semi elliptic shape cf also fig 5 that follows the following equation 1 z h 0 5 t a 0 5 t a 2 t t 0 2 1 2 where z is the vertical normal to the slope coordinate of the boundary of the density cloud with the ambient fluid h and 0 5 t a are the minor and major axis of the ellipse and t 0 is the time corresponding to a given position of the geometrical center of the ellipse x g from eq 1 h and the length l t a u of the density cloud can be estimated where u is the velocity of the geometric center of the ellipse defined as 2 u δ x δ t 0 fig 3a shows the non linear fit using eq 1 dashed line compared to experimental values solid line the streamwise coordinate corresponds to the dimensionless advective time t t 0 t a where t 0 has been determined using a power law fit beghin et al 1981 cf fig 3b using this procedure the velocity of the buoyancy cloud u its surface area a and its buoyancy flux b g u h have been determined fig 4a shows the normalized experimental velocity u g 0 h 0 solid line obtained from eq 2 clearly in the deceleration stage and in good accord with predictions of the thermal theory dashed line the normalized lateral surface a a 0 defined as a π 4 l h where l and h are estimated from eq 1 is shown in fig 4b beghin et al 1981 showed experimentally that the surface of the buoyancy cloud increases with the square of the along slope direction as a c x x 0 2 where c is a constant defined as c π 16 s 2 s 1 2 α 2 and x 0 is a virtual origin corresponding to a 0 i e x 0 4 s 1 s 2 α 1 a 0 π the shape factors s 1 and s 2 are estimated assuming a semi elliptical shape of the buoyancy cloud and α is an empirical entrainment coefficient see also eq 7 this model is represented by a dashed line in fig 4b revealing a good agreement with the experimental data in the initial accelerating stage at x l 0 sin θ 2 8 corresponding to x 34 h 0 the data suggests that the lateral surface stops increasing in accord with previous numerical observations dai 2012 2013b steenhauer et al 2017 in particular for a slope of 10 dai 2012 observed that the semi elliptical head experiences multiple sporadic reductions in its height as mentioned in the introduction maxworthy 2010 explained this behavior as the result of loss of volume and buoyancy that takes place during the descent induced by large scale vortical structures developing at the back of the gravity current head that has been also supported by dai 2013b a the numerical results from dai 2013b are also reported as symbols in figure fig 4b results are within the range of our data and the theoretical prediction of maxworthy 2010 however the lateral surface a increases monotonically and no decrease is observed fig 5 illustrates the density field at three different x positions in a at x g 2 2 m the buoyancy cloud is well fitted by the half elliptic shape with a very active back vortex incorporating ambient water at the back of the cloud on fig 5 b at x g 2 3 m a larger interfacial shear instability develops which begins to separate the back of the cloud as seen later in c there is clearly a loss of volume and mass at the back of the cloud this phenomenon is observed in all the experiments although with variable intensity and confirms the suggestion of maxworthy 2010 and dai 2013a to explain the observed decrease of buoyancy in the second stage of propagation of the cloud down the slope steenhauer et al 2017 observed a variation in the development of the lateral surface at x 35 h 0 for slopes larger than 30 they showed that for sufficiently large distances from the source the normalized sub volume containing mixed fluid which is linearly related to the lateral surface a starts decaying for any value of the slope θ related to a strong dilution of the sub volume defining a constant c 0 representing the ratio between mixed and unmixed fluid they observed that smaller values of c 0 corresponded to extended regions in which the lateral surface a increases linearly with x and trends in the variation of a with x are similar for any value of c 0 the buoyancy of the semi elliptical cloud is shown in fig 4c defined as 3 b u 0 t n t b g δ c d t d z where t n and t b are respectively the time at a given distance x at which the nose and the back of the ellipse appears respectively and δ c is the dirac function note that this definition of the buoyancy differs from that of maxworthy 2010 by a factor of 1 ρ 0 which is canceled out in fig 4c since it is normalized with the initial buoyancy from the figure it emerges that at x l 0 sin θ 2 2 the buoyancy of the cloud is about 60 of the initial buoyancy demonstrating that during the descent buoyancy has been left behind in the tail for this value of the buoyancy thermal theory predicts a velocity 84 of the predicted velocity which explains the lower velocity 88 reported in fig 4a for comparison we also report the conservation of buoyancy from beghin et al 1981 dashed line in fig 4c maxworthy and nokes 2007 and maxworthy 2010 showed that the buoyancy of the cloud is not conserved in the deceleration stage of the density cloud for a slope angle of 10 6 they showed that the buoyancy of the cloud reaches a maximum of about 43 b 0 for x 10 13 h 0 and decreases afterwards this is represented as a continuous line in fig 4c and we see that the descent of our data follows the trend of maxworthy 2010 the theoretical solution of maxworthy 2010 however underestimates our reported values 60 versus 43 which may be imputed by the different definition of the buoyancy threshold within the cloud or by the different quantities used for its estimation in our case the buoyancy has been obtained by instantaneous velocity and density measurements and not from dye concentration measurements dai 2013a derived a power law relationship which enables to estimate the fraction of heavy fluid in the lock that is contained within the head χ via χ k m k b 1 3 where k m is parameter which has been determined by several measurements in previous studies beghin et al 1981 hoult 1972 huppert and simpson 1980 marino et al 2005 whereas a theoretical derivation of k b is given in dai 2013a cf equation 1 7 therein the theoretical estimations of dai 2013a were also in good agreement with the measurements of beghin et al 1981 predicting values of 0 75 for slope angles below 5 and 0 82 for slope angles of 9 dai 2013c these values are much higher than those predicted by maxworthy 2010 and this difference was explained by erroneous estimations of the model constant k b and or a different definition of the head dye concentration threshold if we estimate the model constant with our values using equation 1 7 in dai 2013a we obtain k b 3 8 resulting in χ 0 63 for k m 2 45 beghin et al 1981 which is in good agreement with the reported values in fig 4c of 0 6 in order to assure that the results do not depend on the definition chosen to determine the buoyancy of the cloud it has also been estimated directly using the combined piv plif data as follows 4 b 0 t n t b u z t g δ c d t d z b u m u where u z t is the local velocity from the piv and u m the velocity of the center of mass of the buoyancy cloud the buoyancy b is shown in fig 4c as a green line revealing that both estimations for b and b give similar results the ensemble average of b is slightly smaller than that of b because the geometric velocity u overestimates the velocity of the center of mass of the cloud 3 2 interior structure fig 6 a b show the mean structure of the buoyancy cloud with the black arrows representing the velocity difference between the ensemble average of the instantaneous velocity u and the ensemble average of the velocity of the gravity center u b of the buoyancy cloud the density for δ ρ ρ i 5 1 0 3 in a and the mean vorticity ω y u z w x in b are highlighted by the colormaps clearly the density within the cloud is not homogeneous and at the back of the head a large scale vortex appears associated to a downward vertical velocity at the outer edge of the density cloud and an upward vertical velocity in the central area of the head with evident regions convectively unstable cf colormap in fig 6a such a large scale vortex structure has been already observed in the literature e g hampton 1972 beghin and brugnot 1983 dai 2013a this vortex is composed of much lighter water 4 g 0 as compared to the frontal part at the nose 12 g 0 entrained from the ambient the size of the large scale vortex is of the order of the maximum depth of the buoyancy cloud the averaged reduced gravity within the cloud is about 6 g 0 thus 60 of the initial value during the considered space time interval when observations were taken fig 6 b shows that the vorticity is negative at the interface between the buoyancy cloud and the ambient water and positive in the bottom boundary layer of the buoyancy cloud the high values of the vorticity on the back of the buoyancy cloud confirms the presence of the large scale vortex high positive vorticity is observed at the nose of the buoyancy cloud highlighting the presence of kelvin helmholtz like structures on the frontal part of the head martin and garcía 2009 and at the outer boundary of the large scale vortex within the buoyancy cloud induced by enhanced vertical shear generated by the vortex itself these results also highlight that a variety of different turbulent processes take place inside the density cloud the large scale and small scale convective motions which become locally unstable in the core of the cloud shear turbulence as kelvin helmholtz instabilities at the boundary with the ambient fluid as also observed and quantified by balasubramanian and zhong 2018 and boundary layer instabilities at the bottom boundaries which all concur to the dilution of the cloud 4 entrainment two phenomena responsible for entrainment can be distinguished cf fig 6 the first is induced by the large scale vortex of typical scale of the order of h that engulfs ambient water within the full cloud and the second is due to small scale shear instabilities of typical scale of the order of 1 cm that develop at the contours of the buoyancy cloud with the ambient water and entraining locally the conservation of mass for the buoyancy cloud can be expressed using the model of the thermal theory considering the temporal variation of the lateral surface a 5 d a d t α u γ where α w u is the entrainment coefficient w is the average entrainment velocity across the contour γ corresponding to the buoyancy cloud interface with the ambient water assuming a 2d flow this formulation neglects the variations of density that can be assumed valid for small δ ρ ρ more rigorously the conservation of mass across the control volume representing the density cloud can be expressed as 6 d d t s γ ρ d s s γ p ρ u d s s γ ρ y v d s where p u x u z w is the divergence of the velocity in the x z plane assuming the flow to be primarily two dimensional the last term on the right hand side of eq 6 can be neglected so that the local mass flux can be directly estimated across the interface between the buoyancy cloud and the surrounding ambient the entrainment coefficient α used in the thermal theory can be then written as 7 α 1 ρ 0 u γ ρ u n d l γ d l 1 ρ 0 u c γ ρ u n d l where the circulation integral in the latter equation can be replaced by the surface integral using the green s theorem 8 γ ρ u n d l s γ p ρ u d s fig 7 displays the entrainment coefficient deduced from eqs 7 and 8 the observed sign fluctuations of α in figure 7 are of the order of the spatial average cf dashed line in the figure and correspond to entrainment positive and detrainment negative for comparison the constant entrainment coefficient proposed by beghin et al 1981 is also reported continuous line odier et al 2012 suggested a quantitative measure of local entrainment and detrainment derived from observed conditional correlations of density fluxes to fluctuations of density ρ or of the vertical velocity w fig 8 shows the two dimensional probability density functions pdf of ρ versus ρ w for the initial development phase where the lateral surface of the buoyancy cloud increases a and for the second stage characterized by a decreasing lateral surface of the buoyancy cloud b the right part of the plots corresponds to the stabilizing return to neutral buoyancy while the top left quadrant corresponds to entrainment and the bottom left quadrant to detrainment it is evident comparing the two figures that most of the entrainment takes place in the initial development phase of the density cloud while detrainment is dominant during the second phase characterized by the detachment of the back of the cloud 5 turbulent fluxes the results in section 3 have shown that a variety of turbulent motions characterize the internal structure of the density cloud turbulent motions are usually not solved explicitly in numerical models and thus they need to be parameterized vertical turbulent fluxes are generally assumed to depend linearly on the gradients of large scale quantities the eddy viscosity ν t is used in the momentum equation to parameterize the reynolds stress such as 9 u w ν t u z a frequently used turbulence closure for mixing in ocean or atmospheric circulation models is to assume a linear relation between the vertical buoyancy flux and the density gradients this relation defines a diapycnal turbulent diffusivity k ρ that can be written as 10 ρ w k ρ ρ z maps of the turbulent diffusivities are shown in fig 9 with ν t in a and k ρ in b ν t and k ρ present the same order of magnitude with high values 1 0 4 m 2 s 1 within the large scale vortex and smaller values 1 0 5 m 2 s 1 close to the nose and at the bottom their spatial structure is however different turbulent diffusivities ν t are intensified at the edge of the large scale vortex and the ambient whereas diapycnal turbulent diffusivities k ρ present the largest values in the core of the large scale vortex these estimations show clearly that the usual hypothesis of a constant diffusivity for the entire density cloud does not apply with strong variations of one order of magnitude prandtl 1925 proposed a mixing length scale l u to relate the reynolds stress and the square of the mean velocity vertical shear 11 u w l u 2 u z 2 similarly for the buoyancy flux a buoyancy mixing length l ρ can be defined 12 ρ w l ρ 2 ρ z u z in fig 10 both parametrizations for the reynolds stress eqs 9 and 11 respectively a c and for the buoyancy turbulent fluxes as given in eqs 10 and 12 respectively b d are reported two dimensional histograms show the correlation between fluxes and gradients but no convergence for both models is found thorpe 1977 proposed a characteristic length scale related to a density profile in a mixed patch obtained by adiabatically re ordering the density profile in the unstable regions of the water column and estimating the vertical displacements δ z needed for a fluid particle to be moved from the synthetic stable profile to the observed profile a characteristic length scale for the mixing can then be introduced from the root mean square of the vertical displacements δ z over the vertical profile of the buoyancy cloud such as l t δ z 2 where corresponds to the vertical average operator dillon 1982 showed that this length scale can be related to the ozmidov scale l o as 13 l o 0 8 l t where the ozmidov scale l o is defined as l o ε 1 2 n 3 2 herein ε the dissipation rate and n the brunt väisälä frequency by combining eq 13 with the expression of l o given above the dissipation rate can be written as 14 ε 0 64 l t 2 n 3 osborn 1980 showed that the turbulent diffusivity is limited by the dissipation rate following the equation 15 k ρ w ρ z ρ 0 2 ε n 2 0 13 l t 2 n barry et al 2001 proposed also two equations to estimate the turbulent diffusivity depending of the buoyancy reynolds number r e b ε ν n 2 0 64 l t 2 n ν 16 k ρ 0 9 ν 2 k m o l 1 3 r e b for 10 r e b 300 24 ν 2 k m o l 1 3 r e b 1 3 for r e b 300 where k m o l is the molecular diffusivity of salt in water combining the eqs 14 and 16 leads to 17 k ρ 0 6 p r 1 3 l t 2 n for 10 r e b 300 21 l t 2 n ν 2 p r 1 3 for r e b 300 where p r ν k m o l is the prandtl number of the fluid fig 11a displays the turbulent diffusivity deduced using the thorpe scale l t the light gray dots are estimated following the osborn equation 15 and the red dashed line is the vertical running mean of these points with a window size of 0 05 z h the black dots are estimated following the barry et al 2001 eqs 17 and the red line is the vertical running mean of these points with a window size of 0 05 z h the vertical green line is the vertical average of the diapycnal turbulent diffusivity following barry et al 2001 in fig 11b the turbulent diffusivity is estimated using eq 10 black stars where the continuous vertical green line represents the vertical average both methods fig 11 a b give a similar distribution with the same order of magnitude these results suggest that neither the mixing model based on the prandtl scale l nor the model based on the thorpe scale l t deliver a reliable relation to parameterize turbulent fluxes 6 summary and conclusions an experimental investigation of finite volume gravity currents down a slope released from a lock has been performed using combined piv and plif measurement techniques to obtain two dimensional velocity and density fields experiments were focused on the deceleration region of the buoyancy cloud at a distance x 10 h 0 from the initial volume reservoir based on the high resolved simultaneous velocity density data it is verified that the existing theoretical models of beghin et al 1981 maxworthy 2010 and dai 2013a are suitable for predicting the global characteristics of the cloud propagation front propagation lateral surface and buoyancy with exception of the buoyancy variations that have to be corrected from maxworthy 2010 using the coefficients given in the theoretical model of dai 2013a the measurements showed the complex turbulent structure of the cloud with the back of the buoyancy cloud being hydrostatically unstable with the associated thorpe scale larger than at the front of the cloud large patches of ambient fluid are engulfed into the cloud especially at the back of the head due to a large scale recirculation vortex that causes convectively unstable small scale structures within the head and subsequent intense dilution smaller scale instabilities at the limiting edge between the head and the ambient fluid also contributes to local mixing and dilution such as kelvin helmholtz instabilities using the combined velocity and density data and by averaging the buoyancy cloud along its descent turbulent fluxes has been estimated revealing that the usual parametrization laws based on the assumption of a constant turbulent diffusivity or a constant turbulent mixing length do not work properly these results apply for lock release density clouds propagating down steep slopes and in particular for the head of the gravity current which present high spatial and temporal heterogeneity the tail behind the passage of the head in case of continuous supply or even some lock released gravity currents propagating on horizontal boundaries has shown to be rather stationary and homogeneous present self similarity and can be treated with a good approximation as a stratified shear layer as given by the measurements of odier et al 2012 2014 the turbulent closure models based on mixing length scales e g prandtl 1925 revealed to work reasonably well in such cases spatial heterogeneity has been also reported for spatially developing gravity currents negretti et al 2017 martin et al 2019 in this latter case however turbulent diffusivities can be defined distinctively in the defined spatial regions that can be identified using for example the internal froude number or the bulk richardson number a study is currently in progress on this aspect the high spatio temporal anisotropy of downslope density clouds over steep slopes makes it challenging to find a correct parametrization using closure models based on the turbulent viscosity ν t that depend on the spatial variables our results show clearly that none of the parametrizations proposed in the literature can properly represent turbulent diffusivities for downslope propagating density clouds the fact that in fig 10 the histograms show no correlation between the turbulent fluxes and a mixing length the strong vertical variations shown in fig 11 using the formulation of osborn 1980 and barry et al 2001 comes from the fact that for downslope propagating buoyancy clouds over steep slopes there are several characteristic scales which are set by the multiplicity of turbulent processes that take place along with their intermittency these are convective unstable processes inside the cloud kelvin helmholtz shear instabilities at the edge with the ambient fluid and lobes and clefts instabilities not observed in this study under these conditions mixing scales go from the small convectively unstable scales the kelvin helmholtz scales up to the large scale recirculation vortex which is of the same order of the size of the cloud itself as also highlighted in fig 9 the parametrization of the turbulent diffusivities should be based rather on scalar quantities that avoid the problem of spatial heterogeneity and takes into account the different sources of turbulence production this could be done for example using energetic considerations that compare the terms having a definite exchange of energy and acts as a source or a sink the shear production deriving its energy from the mean flow p k the buoyancy production representing the rate at which turbulent kinetic energy is consumed in mixing but also aliments the production of kinetic energy for downslope propagating currents p b and the viscous dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy ε governed by the balance p k p b ε each of these three terms can be represented by a characteristic length scale of shear l s of buoyancy as for example the monin obukhov or the ozmidov scales l o and a dissipation scale l ε as proposed earlier in bradshaw 1969 the use of the energy budget approach has also the advantage to permit extending the results to similarly spatially heterogeneous non conservative currents such as turbidity currents or katabatic flows where the additional source sink of buoyancy can be added following the suspension deposition of fluid particles in turbidity currents or the presence of a local thermal flux in katabatic flows additional investigations are needed to test the appropriate turbulent closure

environment require closely matching the refraction indices of the dense and light fluids this is generally achieved by the use of salt water for the heavy fluid and ethanol water mixture for the light fluid however as shown by daviero et al 2001 the refractive index variations in stratified flows can be neglected if the salt and dye concentrations remain below thresholds values δ ρ 20 kg m 3 c 0 70 μ g l which is the case in our study with δ ρ 5 kg m 3 c 0 5 μ g l for an excitation illumination i 0 r β with r β being the position along a radius and an angle of the laser sheet and with no absorption along the laser path there is a linear relationship between the intensity of fluorescence emission and the dye concentration consistent with our measurements at dye concentrations ranging from 0 to 53 8 μ g l for low laser intensities crimaldi 2008 the pixel gray scale values at each location in the fluorescence image g 0 r β t are linearly related to the dye concentration at that location c r β t and to i 0 r β via a 1 g 0 r β c γ i 0 r β c r β t g b r β where g b r β is the background noise or camera dark response the constant γ accounts for the system specific optical collection efficiency and the effective quantum yield of the fluorescent dye here the subscript 0 denotes the case without absorption the values of γ i 0 r β and g b r β are determined from a calibration procedure detailed below when laser light passes through the test section the dye solution attenuates the laser intensity and this attenuation must be corrected to obtain accurate dye concentrations from plif images e g ferrier et al 1993 atsavapranee and gharib 1997 odier et al 2014 krug et al 2013 in the present set up the propagation of the laser sheet in the field of view is along the r axis according to the bouguer lambert beer law the laser intensity in such an absorbing medium is a 2 i r β t i 0 r β α r β c with a 3 α exp a w r ε 0 r c r β t d r ε s 0 r c s r β t d r

of the dyed solution per unit concentration ε s is the attenuation coefficient of the salt solution per unit of salinity and c s r β t is the salt concentration of the water the recorded grayscale
